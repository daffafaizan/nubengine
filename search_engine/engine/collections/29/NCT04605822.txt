      independent application in early melanoma detection. The Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered
      3D Total Body Photography (TBP) Vectra® WB360 system's utility and clinical performance in
      detecting melanoma in the real-world setting will be compared to the gold standard with
      clinical assessments by experienced dermatologists, to currently widespread used 2D imaging
      tools (FotoFinder ATBM® Master) and to the Smartphone-based algorithm application (e.g.
      SkinVision®). Here included are specific questions regarding the patients' subjective
      experience, acceptance and evaluation of modern technological examination.

      Additionally, the overall psychological burden and worry of melanoma risk or disease,
      anxiety, depression will be compared in different groups of patients and psychological
      support need and real uptake of support and its predictors will be investigated in all
      participants.
