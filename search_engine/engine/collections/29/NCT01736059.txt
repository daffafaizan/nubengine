      conditions (macular degeneration or retinitis pigmentosa) or retinal vascular disease
      (diabetic retinopathy or retinal vein occlusion) will be treated with intravitreal injection
      of autologous CD34+ stem cells isolated from bone marrow aspirate under Good Manufacturing
      Practice conditions. This study will determine whether there are any major safety and
      feasibility concerns using this therapy. Patients will be followed for 6 months after
      treatment by serial comprehensive eye examination supplemented with various retinal imaging
      and diagnostic tests.
