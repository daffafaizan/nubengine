    
      Phase One: Four Different types of stem cells will be tested ( Freshly aspirated Bone marrow
      cells, cryopreserved cells, umbilical cord cells, Stem cells mobilised from bone marrow by
      g-csf, mesenchymal cells), and the efficacy of labelling documented and effect on viability
      noted. 3 samples of each type will be tested and the results will be documented. Different
      cells are being tried to test the efficiency of the labelling technique in different types of
      cells. This will provide the protocols for all future labelling studies. This will be
      conducted in collaboration between the stem cell department, nuclear medicine department and
      nuclear cardiology department.

      Phase Two (Clinical Study):

      This will be the pilot clinical study done alongside with the phase one study, and will enrol
      10 patients with Recent Myocardial infarction ( within 3 months) . A small fraction of
      patient's own bone marrow stem cells will be labelled with Technetium 99m HMPAO. The labelled
      cells will be administered via the intracoronary injection along with the unlabeled stem
      cells. The localization of the radio-labelled stem cells in the myocardium will then be
      detected using the conventional Gamma camera.
