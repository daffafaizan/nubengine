      I. To assess the ability of the YKL-40 serum marker to detect response or lack of response to
      primary chemotherapy in International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage
      III or IV invasive epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer.

      II. To compare the predictive accuracy of YKL-40 with cancer antigen 125 (CA125).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To test the ability of the YKL-40 serum marker to detect recurrence of ovarian, primary
      peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer in patients who are in first remission following primary
      chemotherapy.

      II. To test the ability of the YKL-40 serum marker to predict poor risk patients with FIGO
      stage III or IV invasive epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore alternative cut-off values for YKL-40 elevation in this large patient
      population.

      II. To describe the variability of YKL-40 and CA125 measurements in patients receiving
      primary chemotherapy and in primary remission in a large patient population.

      III. To describe the accuracy of YKL-40 coupled with CA125 measurements in predicting
      chemotherapy response, progression-free survival and overall survival.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo collection of serum samples for analysis of YKL-40 via enzyme-linked
      immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and CA125 via chemiluminometric sandwich immunoassay at the
      following time-points: at baseline; prior to beginning each course of chemotherapy (courses
      1-6); at completion of chemotherapy; every 3 months during years 1-2 post-chemotherapy; every
      6 months during years 3-5 post-chemotherapy; every year during years 6-10 post-chemotherapy;
      and at time of disease recurrence or progression.
