    
      -  This is the observational study as the single institutional, prospective cohort study.
           The investigators prospectively collect the clinicopathological information of the
           patients with prostate cancer (PCa) undergoing radical prostatectomy (RP).

        -  Particularly, the investigators check the variables, including age at surgery, body mass
           index, comorbidities, preoperative PSA levels, prostate volume measured by TRUS,
           preoperative HbA1c levels, biopsy Gleason score, positive biopsy cores, percent positive
           cores, clinical TMN staging, final pathological results (TMN stage, Gleason score,
           extraprostatic extension, seminal vesicle invasion, surgical margin positivity,
           postoperative biochemical recurrence (BCR), local recurrence, and distant metastasis
           during follow-up periods.

        -  The study protocol is same with routine follow-up schedule of the patients with PCa
           treated with RP. Typically, the investigators check the patients at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18,
           24, 30 and 36 months. However, according to the patients status and preference,
           follow-up schedule can be changed within 3 months at specific time points. Because the
           present study is the observational cohort study, not intervention study, subtle changes
           of follow-up schedule would not affect on the primary outcomes.

        -  Importantly, preoperative HbA1c should be checked within 1 month before operation, same
           as the routine preoperative laboratory tests.
