      are grown in the northern region, and about half of them are edible. Phenolic compounds are
      one of the most diverse group of secondary metabolites present in edible plants, and berries
      are especially rich in them. Flavonoids, phenolic acids, lignans and complex phenolic
      polymers (polymeric tannins) are typical for berries. Phenolic compounds are reported to have
      a variety of beneficial biological properties. They are potent antioxidants, and exhibit
      various other physiological activities including anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial,
      antiallergic, anticarcinogenic and antihypertensive activities. Epidemiological studies
      indicate that diet rich in phenolic compound correlates with lower risk of cancer and
      cardiovascular disease.

      The aim of the present study is to examine the effect of diet rich in berries on glucose and
      lipid metabolism and inflammatory markers and gene expression profile in peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in subjects with features of metabolic syndrome.

      Randomized, controlled clinical intervention including 4 wk run-in period, 8 wk dietary
      intervention and 4 wk recovery period was conducted.
