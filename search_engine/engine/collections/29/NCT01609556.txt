    
      The study consists of a dose-escalation phase that will evaluate 2 dosing schedules (Schedule
      A and Schedule B) of mirvetuximab soravtansine and up to 5 dose-expansion groups at the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD). The first 4 escalation cohorts will be single participant
      cohorts. Subsequent escalation cohorts will use a standard 3+3 design, with each cohort
      consisting of 3 or 4 to 6 participants. Data were collected and analysed for the escalation
      and expansion groups by dose schedule and not by individual dose.
