      posterior midline approach and a left anterior retroperitoneal approach is used. The
      retroperitoneal anterior approach to the lumbar spine offers some benefits compared with the
      posterior approach. Dural injury and epidural scarring can be avoided, and an interbody
      fusion graft can be placed with minimal risk to the nerve roots. However, the extensive
      posterior midline approach with extensive muscle dissection is necessary to place the
      pedicular screws.

      of pedicular screws and rods in lumbar fusion.
