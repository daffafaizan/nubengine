      thrombocytopenic disorders with a platelet count less than 60*10^9/L from 4 medical centers
      in China. In brief, 15 μl aliquots of anti-coagulated whole blood were incubated for 70 min
      with 5 μl of phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-CD42b monoclonal antibody (BD Pharmingen, Tokyo,
      Japan) and 1 ml of thiazole orange (Retic-COUNT; Becton-Dickinson, San Jose, CA, USA) diluted
      10 times by phosphate-buffered saline. RP% was analyzed on a flow cytometer (FACScan,
      Becton-Dickinson) by measuring 10,000 events in the CD42b-positive fraction.

      Clinical information of all participants including gender, age, platelet count and definitive
      diagnosis were recorded by an exclusive investigator. RP% results were revealed at the end of
      recruitment and after all FCM measurements were completed. The agreement between clinical
      diagnosis and RP% results were analyzed to identify primary ITP.
