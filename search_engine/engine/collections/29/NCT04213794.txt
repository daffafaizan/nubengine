    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the feasibility of heated intra-peritoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) with doxorubicin
      (DOXO) and cisplatin (CDDP) after surgical resection of pediatric pelvic and abdominal
      rhabdomyosarcoma tumors.

      II. To assess morbidity, hospital length of stay and peri-operative mortality outcomes for
      pediatric patients with intraperitoneal rhabdomyosarcoma undergoing hyperthermic
      intraperitoneal chemotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Evaluate disease recurrence patterns: locoregional versus distant.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo cytoreduction. Patients also undergo HIPEC over 60 minutes consisting of
      doxorubicin and cisplatin. Patients then receive sodium thiosulfate intravenously (IV) over
      12 hours.

      After completion of the study treatment, patients are followed every 6 months for 5 years.
