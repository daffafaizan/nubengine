      complex and trichothiodystrophy (TTD) have defective DNA excision repair although only XP has
      increased cancer susceptibility. We plan to perform careful clinical examination of selected
      patients with XP, XP/CS, CS, TTD, XP/TTD and other overlap syndromes to follow their clinical
      course. We will obtain tissue (skin, blood, hair, buccal cells) for laboratory examination of
      DNA repair and for genetic analysis. We hope to be able to correlate these laboratory
      abnormalities with the clinical features to better understand the mechanism of cancer
      prevention by DNA repair. Patients will be offered counseling and education for cancer
      control.
