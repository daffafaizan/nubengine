      supportive intervention called "Living with Hope Program" (LWHP) in increasing hope and
      quality of life for older adult community-living terminally ill cancer patients. Using a
      mixed method concurrent nested experimental design, 60 terminally ill cancer patients over
      the age of 60 years were randomly assigned to a treatment and control group. Baseline hope
      [Herth Hope Index (HHI)] and quality of life scores [McGill Quality of Life Questionnaire,
      (MQOL)] were collected at the first visit in the patients' homes by trained research
      assistants. Those in the treatment group received the LWHP, which consisted of viewing an
      international award winning video on hope and a choice of one of three hope activities to
      work on over a one-week period. The control group received standard care. Hope and quality of
      life data were collected one week later from both groups. Qualitative data using open-ended
      hope questions were collected from the treatment group.

      Subjects receiving the Living with Hope Program had statistically significant higher hope
      (U=255, p=.005) and quality of life scores at visit two (U=294.5, p=.027) than those in the
      control group. Qualitative data confirmed this finding with the majority (61.5%) of subjects
      in the treatment group reporting the LWHP increased their hope. This preliminary evaluation
      of the effectiveness of the LWHP suggests that it may increase hope and quality of life for
      older terminally ill cancer patients at home.
