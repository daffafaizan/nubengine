      stimulate the pelvic floor muscles compared with the Neurotech Vital Device. Stimulation of
      the pelvic floor muscles will be assessed by using sonographic/real time ultrasound
      imaging/recording with displacement measurement using onscreen callipers on the sonogram unit
      to assess contractions.
