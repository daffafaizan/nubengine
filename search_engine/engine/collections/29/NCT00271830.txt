      will be eligible to participate in this prospective serial observation study. As roughly half
      of renal transplant patients are assigned to rapamycin immunnosuppression clinically and half
      are not, we plan to assess routine clinical perameters, sex hormone levels, subjective sexual
      function as measured by standardized questionnaire and semen analysis in 55 patients on
      sirolimus treatment and 55 patients not on this treatment. Assessment will be made at
      baseline (1 mo post transplant) and 6 and 12 months later. All adult male renal transplant
      recipients ages 21-65 off dialysis 1 mo post transplant will be eleigible. Exclusion criteria
      will be female gender, patients requiring testosterone therapy, patients on dialysis, and
      those unwilling to give informed consent.
