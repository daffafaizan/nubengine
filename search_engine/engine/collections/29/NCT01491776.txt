    
      Group A Streptococcus is a principal cause of respiratory infections such as tonsillitis,
      pharyngitis, and scarlet fever. Since pharyngitis can lead to rheumatic fever or acute
      glomerulonephritis, it is important to differentiate streptococcal pharyngitis from viral
      disease during early stages of infection. The Strep A Rapid Test is a simple and rapid test
      which can detect Group A Streptococcal antigen directly from throat swabs allowing physicians
      to make a rapid diagnosis and to administer therapy immediately. The IND Diagnostic Inc.
      Strep A Rapid Test is a lateral flow immunoassay utilizing colloidal gold reagents labeled
      with Strep A antibody. The test detects either viable or nonviable organisms directly from
      throat swabs within 10 minutes.
