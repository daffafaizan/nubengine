        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of vinorelbine and celecoxib in women with relapsed
           or metastatic breast cancer.

        -  Determine the safety profile of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive oral celecoxib twice daily on days 1-21 and oral vinorelbine on days 7, 14,
      and 21. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of celecoxib and vinorelbine until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at
      which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-18 patients will be accrued for this study.
