      function before and after discontinuation of the oral phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor in
      patients on left ventricular device support. At baseline and after discontinuation of the
      medication patients will receive a clinical examination and New York Heart Association
      Classification, echocardiographic assessment of right ventricular function, cardiopulmonary
      exercise testing, 6 minute walking test and assessment of quality of life. The primary
      outcome is the change of the quantitative echocardiographic parameters of right ventricular
      function at follow-up. Secondarily, we aim to assess the change in cardiopulmonary exercise
      capacity, the 6-minute walking distance and quality of life.
