      most common cause of cancer death.1 Locally advanced prostate cancer (clinical T3/T4) is
      uncommon in North America because of earlier diagnosis following widespread PSA testing and
      patient information campaigns. However, in the past decade the term high-risk prostate cancer
      has been developed to include the previous locally advanced disease and patient with T1/T2
      disease with poor prognostic features (either a high Prostate Specific Antigen or high
      Gleason score). The risk of involvement of pelvic lymph nodes by prostate cancer for certain
      subgroups of intermediate risk and most high risk prostate cancer may be substantial. The
      long term results of conventional dose (66-70 Gy) external beam radiation therapy for
      intermediate and locally advanced prostate cancer have been disappointing. The combination of
      hormonal therapy and radiation therapy or radiation therapy dose escalation are the two
      strategies which have been evaluated and are now used to improve these results.
