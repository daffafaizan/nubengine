    
      The goals of this study are to: (1) refine and field-test a mobile application intervention
      (PACT) using an iterative design approach, "Think Aloud" exercises, and usability protocols;
      (2) evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, usability, satisfaction, and user engagement of
      the intervention among advanced cancer patients and their caregivers; (3) test the
      preliminary efficacy of the intervention on patients' and caregivers' level of engagement in
      ACP, documented ACP conversations, and patients' completion of ADs (primary outcomes); and
      patients' and caregivers' perceived social support and family functioning as well as
      patients' receipt of goal-concordant care (secondary outcomes); and (4) evaluate process
      measures in a post-intervention interview.
