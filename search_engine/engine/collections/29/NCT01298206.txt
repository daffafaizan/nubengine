      infection. This study will also be able to estimate risk factors for severe illness requiring
      hospitalization or leading to death. These factors are: travel history, exposure to other
      confirmed or suspected cases, obesity, pregnancy, influenza vaccination history, residency in
      nursing homes, attendance of daycares, tobacco use, and other comorbidities (pulmonary
      diseases, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, renal insufficiency). Unlike other descriptive
      studies, this analytical case-control study will enable to accurately measure the strength of
      association between potential risk factors and outcome. By isolating viruses from specimens
      collected from cases, this study will be able to characterize these viruses and document any
      genetic mutations or antiviral resistance.

      The main objectives of this study are:

        1. To investigate the risk factors of infection with the pandemic A/H1N1 viruses.

        2. To characterize influenza viruses causing infection.

        3. If enough severe cases were enrolled to make it statistically feasible, this study will
           investigate the risk factors of severe illness or death associated with infection with
           the pandemic A/H1N1 viruses.
