      is essential for independent standing or ambulation after stroke. Quadriceps muscle consists
      of four different muscles: rectus femoris, vastus intermedius, vastus lateralis and medialis.
      The present study search for reliability for rectus femoris and vastus intermedius muscle
      thickness and cross-sectional area using rehabilitative ultrasound imagining. Longitudinal
      and transverse ultrasound imagining of the muscle thickness will be performed on both rectus
      femoris and vastus intermedius muscles for both extremities. The procedures will be repeated
      by two experts at two separate times (7-10 days). For sarcopenia measurement grip strength
      and DEXA measurements of the patients will be calculated. Totally 68 patients will be
      included in the study.
