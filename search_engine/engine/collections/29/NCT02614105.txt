    
      This two-centre study will consist of a randomised controlled trial (RCT) with a parallel
      group design and include two intervention groups and one control group. Recruitment and data
      collection will occur simultaneously at the Ã˜HT and St. Olav's Hospital in Trondheim.

      All participants will complete an initial four week general group exercise class (1 hour once
      a week) prior to randomisation. This intervention will focus on strength exercises (lower
      limb and upper limb), endurance training, balance training and thorax mobilising exercises.
      All participants will be examined and complete questionnaires at two occasions; after the
      initial four weeks general exercise/before intervention, and at 16 weeks post-randomisation.

      Participants will be randomised to either Intervention group A (pelvic floor muscle training
      group), Intervention group B (cough-suppression group) or a control group who will receive
      brief written information about pelvic floor muscle training and cough-suppression, but no
      other form of regular follow-up or intervention throughout the intervention period.
