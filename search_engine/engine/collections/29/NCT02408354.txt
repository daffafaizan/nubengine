      by the association of permanent and paroxysmal (palsy, dystonia, ocular, epileptic,
      dysautonomic events) neurological events, with onset in childhood. Most of AHC patients carry
      mutations in the ATP1A3 gene. This gene encodes the Na+/K+ ATPase witch is a transmembrane
      ion pump generating chemical and electrical gradient of sodium and potassium across the
      plasma membrane. Those paroxystic events in AHC patients with mutations in the ATP1A3 gene
      could be associated with a glucidic/energetic metabolism or intracerebral excitability
      disorder.

      Triheptanoin is a triglyceride, whose derivatives pass the blood - brain barrier and enhance
      the Krebs cycle functions. Triheptanoin could therefore allow energy supply to the brain,
      which is essential for the functioning of the Na+/ K+ ATPase that consumes a significant
      amount of energy in the brain.

      The investigators goal is to do a pilot study to test the effectiveness on paroxystic
      manifestations and the safety of triheptanoin in a small group of patients with Alternating
      Hemiplegia of Childhood secondary to ATP1A3 mutations.
