      (orally) and injection (intramuscularly and intravenously) formulations. Blood samples were
      collected at regular intervals after single and multiple drug administration. The
      concentration of levosulpiride in plasma was determined using a validated high performance
      liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method. Non-compartmental analysis was
      performed to estimate pharmacokinetic parameters. The analysis of variance was used to test
      for linearity and assess the effect of gender on the pharmacokinetic properties of the study
      drug. Adverse effects were monitored using investigators' questionnaires and subjects'
      spontaneous reports, vital sign measurements, hematology, clinical chemistry, and
      electrocardiogram.
