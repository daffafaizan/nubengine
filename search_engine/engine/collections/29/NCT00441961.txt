    
      Eosinophilic fasciitis (EF)is a fibrosing skin disorder extensively involving the deep
      fascia. The aim of this pilot study is to evaluate the effect of high dose MTX on skin
      induration in patients with EF. In addition, we study the effect of this treatment on joint
      mobility, peripheral blood eosinophilia, functional ability, and pulmonary function. By
      administering high dose MTX intravenously every four weeks with a Leukovorin rescue, we hope
      to induce a more pronounced and sustained effect on the involved skin with less
      (long-lasting) side effects.
