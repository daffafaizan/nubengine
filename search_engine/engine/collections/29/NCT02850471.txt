      We recruited 100 patients who are planned for gynecologic laparoscopic surgery. Patients were
      enrolled from March 1, 2015. We randomly allocated patients into two groups: controlled group
      ( patients treated without transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation) and TEAS group
      (patients treated with TEAS on Feishu, Hegu, Chize half an hour before the surgery). Blood
      pH, Pco2, Po2 and oxygen saturation were measured by an automatic blood gas analyzer
      immediately after obtaining the samples from the aorta. Sample all the patients blood before
      and after the surgery. And then measure the level of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6.
