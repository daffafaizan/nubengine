    
      DYANAVELÂ® XR is an extended-release oral suspension that contains 2.5 mg/mL amphetamine base
      (amphetamine extended-release oral suspension; AMPH EROS). Drug-resin complexation is formed
      with the amphetamine and sodium polystyrene sulfonate, an ion exchange resin. The extended
      release feature of the product is achieved by coating a portion of the drug/resin complexes
      with an extended release coating. AMPH EROS contains approximately a 3.2:1 ratio of
      d-amphetamine compared to l-amphetamine.

      The objective of this study was to evaluate the plasma amphetamine concentration/time profile
      of AMPH EROS in children aged 4 to 5 years with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder,
      following a single 2.5 mg dose of AMPH EROS.

      These data will guide appropriate dosing in planned safety and efficacy studies with AMPH
      EROS in a preschool population with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.
