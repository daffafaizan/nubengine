      ranibizumab, and aflibercept, have become the gold standard treatment for neovascular
      age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Various treatment modalities using these agents have
      been proposed, including monthly, pro re nata, and treat-and-extend philosophies. Despite
      frequent and consistent treatment with anti-VEGF therapy, there is a subset of patients who
      are incomplete or non-responders and have persistent evidence of exudation on spectral-domain
      optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), including subretinal fluid (SRF) and/or intraretinal
      edema.

      While clearance of intravitreal anti-VEGF drugs is not completely understood, some studies
      have suggested that outflow through the anterior chamber may contribute. We hypothesized that
      by decreasing aqueous production, outflow may also be reduced which could delay the clearance
      of intravitreal drugs. As a result, we chose topical dorzolamide-timolol since it is a potent
      aqueous suppressant and is readily available due to its common use in the treatment of
      glaucoma. The current study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of topical dorzolamide-timolol on
      anatomic and visual outcomes in anti-VEGF non-responders with neovascular AMD.

      Significance: The results of this study will help delineate whether topical aqueous
      suppression may be useful as adjuvant therapy in patients receiving chronic intravitreal
      anti-VEGF injections.
