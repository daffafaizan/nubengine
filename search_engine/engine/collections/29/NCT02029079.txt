      nutrients causing measurable adverse effect on body tissue, function and clinical outcome.

      Oral nutritional supplementation has in multiple individual trials and meta-analyzes shown an
      increased total energy intake and protein intake in patients in hospital settings as well as
      in the community.

      The largest producer of dairy products in Norway, TINE AS released a new milk based energy-
      and nutrient dense product, called E+. The initiative behind this was Haukeland University
      Hospital and the municipality of Bergen. The product were developed to prevent malnutrition
      in the elderly and patients with a low food intake and high energy requirements.

      The overall contribution to this study will be to provide new insight on how to offer
      malnourished patients the best available treatment.
