      peri-neural femoral nerve catheter on pain and motor block frequency, after total knee
      arthroplasty. One group of patients will receive automated intermittent bolus, while the
      others will get a continuous infusion. In both cases, patients will be able to administer
      supplementary auto-bolus if required.
