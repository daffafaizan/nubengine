      expenditures. In patients with persistent AF, there are fundamentally two ways to manage the
      arrhythmia: to restore and maintain sinus rhythm (rhythm control) or to allow AF to continue
      and ensure that the ventricular rate is controlled (rate control). As it has been stated, it
      goes without saying that if we could prevent atrial fibrillation (AF) or restore and maintain
      sinus rhythm in patients suffering from persistent AF, without any penalties due to the
      unwanted effects of drugs or incomplete suppression of AF and its thromboembolic
      complications, every physician would do so. Current strategies however, are limited to
      achieve such desirable goal. In the last years a growing amount of evidence and attention
      regarding the cardio-protective role of Omega 3 fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) became progressively
      clear and appealing.

      Epidemiological studies and randomized controlled trials confirms the role of n-3 PUFA in
      reducing all cause mortality and cardiovascular events mostly in patients at high
      cardiovascular risk. These effects seems to be mediated mostly by an anti-arrhythmogenic
      effect.

      Basic science confirms and extended clinical observations regarding the antiarrhythmogenic
      effect of these compounds. Recently both basic research and clinical science suggested a role
      of n-3 PUFA for the prevention and treatment of supraventricular arrhythmias, particularly
      AF.

      The purpose of the study is to show that the addition of n-3 PUFA on the top of the best
      recommended therapies can improve the maintenance of normal sinus rhythm in patients with
      persistent atrial fibrillation.
