      Exposed group: fetuses aged 24 + 0AW to 32 + 0AW and benefiting from MgSO4 for
      neuroprotective purposes, with decision of extraction or spontaneous labour or induced
      labour:

      1 FHR + STV before MgSO4 bolus

        1. FHR + STV 10 minutes after the start of the MgSO4 bolus

           Control group: fetuses aged 32 + 1SA to 35 + 0SA without MgSO4, with extraction decision
           or spontaneous labour or induced labour:

        2. FHR + STV at 10 minutes interval : 1 STV at the entrance if suspicion premature labour
           (in the delivery room) then another 10 minutes after; 2 STV at 10 minutes interval if
           extraction decision.

      Statistical Analysis Plan:

      Measurement of the STV value difference before / after MgSO4 in the exposed group and the STV
      value difference between the 2 measurements in the control group and comparison of these
      differences.
