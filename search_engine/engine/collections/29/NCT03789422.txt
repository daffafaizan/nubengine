    
      Multicentric controlled randomized crossover study, double-blind To evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of levocetirizine 10mg / day + tranexamic acid (AT) 2g / day versus levocetirizine
      20mg / day alone in the chronic treatment of chronic urticaria evaluated at 4 weeks.

      A hierarchical analysis will be implemented in the following order:

        1. Non-inferiority of the combination levocetirizine 10 mg / day + tranexamic acid (TA) 2 g
           / day versus levocetirizine alone 20 mg / day in terms of effectiveness

        2. Superiority of the combination levocetirizine 10 mg / day + tranexamic acid (AT) 2 g /
           day versus levocetirizine alone 20 mg / day in terms of tolerance

        3. Superiority of levocetirizine 10mg / day + tranexamic acid (AT) 2g / day versus
           levocetirizine alone 20mg / day in terms of effectiveness Each objective will be tested
           sequentially if and only if the previous objective is validated.
