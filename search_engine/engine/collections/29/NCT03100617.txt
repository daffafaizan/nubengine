      a modified version of the REACH-VA caregiver intervention in Vietnam. The REACH-VA caregiver
      intervention is an evidence-based intervention that has been shown to be effective in
      multicultural populations in the US. The model has been modified for use in Vietnam. This
      study will test the modified model in Vietnam. Participants in this study will be adult
      family caregivers of non-institutionalized persons with dementia who are living in Hanoi,
      Vietnam. They will receive 4-6 sessions delivered over the course of 2-3 months that will
      included the following components: 1) education about the nature of the disease, 2) risk
      assessment, 3) enhancing caregiver skills and problem-solving, and 4) caregiver stress
      reduction. The intervention will be delivered by a social worker or nurse using a Vietnamese
      language versions of the REACH-VA protocol and caregiver intervention notebook.
