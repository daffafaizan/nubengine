      injections of either CssBA alone, dmLT alone or CssBA + dmLT. The vaccine will be
      administered via IM injection to alternating deltoid regions on days 1, 22, and 43. Each
      participant will receive the same dose at each vaccination dependent upon group assignment.
      Group A is considered a pilot group in which all 3 doses will be administered and
      participants monitored for safety 7 days after the third vaccination, prior to the enrollment
      of participants in Group B.
