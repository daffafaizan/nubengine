      breathing (DB) can improve quality of life, constipation symptoms, and decrease healthcare
      utilization for children with functional constipation (FC) with pelvic floor dysfunction
      (PFD). FC is a common pediatric condition with a high prevalence and $4.25 billion yearly in
      healthcare expenditures. FC is often complicated with PFD as seen through stool withholding
      behaviors. Children with FC with PFD are referred to occupational therapy for biofeedback and
      DB training as standard of care. Occupational therapy uses to teach children with FC with PFD
      to relax their abdominal muscles, and subsequently their pelvic floor muscles, facilitating a
      more complete bowel evacuation. VR is a technology currently employed in rehabilitation
      services, anesthesiology and surgery. VR can provide a fun, immersive environment with a
      feedback component for children with FC to learn DB effectively and build a positive
      association with toileting.

      The purpose of this study is to examine if a virtual reality module that teaches children
      diaphragmatic breathing through an immersive game can improve the quality of life and
      decrease health care utilization for children with functional constipation and pelvic floor
      dysfunction.
