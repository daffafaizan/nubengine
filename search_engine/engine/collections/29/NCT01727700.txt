    
      Tourette's Disorder is a neuropsychiatric condition that is characterized by the appearance
      of tics that can be simple or complex in nature. A tic is a sudden, rapid, recurrent,
      non-rhythmic, stereotyped motor movement or vocalization. There are a very limited number of
      medications approved for the treatment of Tourette's Disorder. The goal of the current trial
      is to obtain efficacy, safety, and tolerability data in a controlled condition of a
      Once-daily aripiprazole formulation in children and adolescents with Tourette's Disorder. The
      trial has an 8-week long double-blind treatment period after a pretreatment
      (screening/washout phase), and the subjects will be followed up for 1 month after the last
      treatment. The Once-daily tablet formulation that will be evaluated in this trial represents
      a daily dosage regimen that is intended to be administered to children and adolescents.
