      I. 6-month progression-free survival (PFS6). (Group A) II. Efficiency of neurosphere
      generation after pretreatment with RO4929097 (gamma-secretase/Notch signalling pathway
      inhibitor RO4929097). (Group B)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Radiographic response rate. (Group A) II. Toxicities associated with this regimen. (Group
      A) III. Overall survival. (Group A) IV. Expression levels of Notch pathway components and
      downstream targets. (Group B) V. Tumor propagation. An extension of lifespan by 50% in tumor
      bearing mice (mice bearing fresh tumor tissue). (Group B) VI. Patient event-free survival in
      correlation with expression levels of Notch pathway components and downstream targets.

      VII. 6-month progression-free survival (PFS6). VIII. Toxicities associated with this regimen.
      IX. Overall survival.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups.

      GROUP A: Patients receive gamma-secretase/Notch signalling pathway inhibitor RO4929097 orally
      (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-3, 8-10, 15-17, and 22-24. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      GROUP B (surgical resection indicated): Patients receive gamma-secretase/Notch signalling
      pathway inhibitor RO4929097 PO QD on days -6 to -1. Patients undergo surgical resection on
      day 0. Within 30 days after surgical resection, patients receive gamma-secretase/Notch
      signalling pathway inhibitor RO4929097 as in Group A.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2 months.
