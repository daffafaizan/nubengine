      a pill without the active medication. This will be determined by chance like a flip of a
      coin.

      Study procedures will include taking study medication and coming to regular in-clinic visits.
      Depending on the study visit, study tests may include the following: medical evaluations,
      physical exams, body measurements, vital signs, blood and urine tests, pregnancy tests,
      genetic testing, heart function monitoring, clinical and psychiatric measures,
      neuropsychological testing (for example, investigators will test how well you remember words
      or how fast you perform a certain task), a function test (for example, investigators will
      test how well you perform certain daily tasks), and a test to measure your startle response.
      A startle response is an unexpected response by a sudden activity.
