    
      This phase IIa randomized, controlled, parallel-group study will be conducted in 36 subjects
      with advanced PD who are treated with oral LD/CD at a stable dose and have predictable
      morning "OFF" periods and at least 2.5 hrs of daily "OFF" periods. The study will investigate
      the efficacy, PK, safety and tolerability of continuous SC infusion of 2 dosing regimens of
      ND0612H. Regimen 1 will employ continuous infusion for 24 hrs using a low infusion rate at
      night and a higher rate at daytime with supplemental administration of oral immediate release
      (IR) LD/CD in the mornings. During the inpatient period of about 3 days, the site staff will
      manage the administration and replacement of the infusions. On Day 4 subjects will be
      discharged home after they and their study partners have received training on the
      administration of the infusion. A safety visit will be performed 4 weeks after the last SC
      administration of the study drug.
