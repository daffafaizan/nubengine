      months later an inpatient challenge phase (134 participants). Participants are randomized
      93:62 to receive either MVA-NP+M1 or Placebo. Up to 20 participants will be challenged over
      several 3-week blocks, and the remainder at the final 3-week block for a total of 80
      MVA-NP+M1 and 54 Placebo recipients challenged.
