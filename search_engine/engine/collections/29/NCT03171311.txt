      implantation techniques with an elevated risk of suboptimal treatment results. Intra vascular
      optical coherence tomography (OCT) enables improved procedural control of correctable factors
      and may lead to optimized implantation results.

      It is unknown if routine, systematic use of OCT scans during complex bifurcation stenting
      improves clinical outcome but present available evidence indicates advantages of OCT guidance
      that could translate into improved clinical outcome.

      Hypothesis: Systematic OCT guided revascularization of patients with bifurcation lesions
      requiring complex stent implantation provides superior two-year clinical outcome compared to
      standard revascularization by PCI.

      Methods: Investigator initiated and investigator sponsored, randomized (1:1), controlled,
      prospective, multicenter, superiority trial. Randomization is stratified for 1) Left main or
      non-Left main artery disease, and 2) up-front planned one-stent technique with kissing
      balloon inflation, or a two-stent technique.

      Systematic OCT guidance is detailed for five complex stent implantation techniques. Standard
      treatment is angiographic based with optional use of intravascular ultrasound (IVUS).
