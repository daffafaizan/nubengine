    
      This is a randomized, open-label, single-center, Phase IV, comparative interventional study
      looking at the effect of the Prevenaâ„¢ Incision Management System (PIMS) on Cesarean section
      Subjects compared to a control arm treated with a standard-of-care surgical incision
      dressing. The prospective, post-marketing clinical study described in this protocol will
      assess the effectiveness and functional performance of PIMS on closed incisions. Clinical
      outcomes of interest for this study are defined as Surgical Site Occurrences (SSOs) that
      include unanticipated local inflammatory response, prolonged drainage, fluid collection,
      dehiscence, and surgical site infection (SSI). This investigation will compare these outcomes
      to a control group consisting of Subjects screened for the same inclusion and exclusion
      criteria but treated with a standard-of-care surgical incision dressing.
