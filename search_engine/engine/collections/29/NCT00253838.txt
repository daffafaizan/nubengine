      primary total hip arthroplasties being performed annually. Failure of these arthroplasties
      has led to an increasing number of patients requiring revision arthroplasty. Various methods
      have been used to reconstruct the hip during a revision procedure. These have generally
      consisted of a cemented or uncemented femoral stem. It is now generally accepted that
      uncemented femoral stems have improved results over cemented stems, especially in those cases
      with compromised bone stock. There are two main alloys used for the femoral revision
      component, that is cobalt chrome and titanium. There may be certain advantages to the use of
      titanium, in particular, a reduction in future bone loss caused by stress shielding. Stress
      shielding is commonly seen with cobalt chrome implants. In order to assess this and the
      overall survival of these two different implants a randomized clinical trial is proposed.
