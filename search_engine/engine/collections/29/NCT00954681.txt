      useful for cannabis dependence. By antagonizing dopamine, quetiapine may interfere with the
      reinforcing effects of cannabis, while serotonin type 2A, histamine type 1, and adrenergic
      receptor antagonism may reduce cannabis withdrawal symptoms, primarily by sedating and
      anxiolytic effects. The proposed research project is an open-label pilot study to evaluate
      the tolerability and ideal target dosing range for quetiapine treatment of cannabis
      dependence over an eight-week period. The purpose of this pilot study is to obtain
      preliminary data regarding the potential efficacy, tolerability and safety of quetiapine
      treatment of cannabis dependence before conducting a larger double-blind trial.
