      participants and invite them to participate in the study. An eligibility screening is held by
      the study assistant at baseline, introducing the study, providing informed electronic
      consent, as well as conducting the self-report measures and app-based assessments. A blinded
      psychologist who works independently of the (co-) psychologist conducts the remaining
      rater-questionnaires. Due to the psychotherapeutic nature of the study, information about the
      treatment allocation had to be shared with the co-psychologist and the participants. Saliva
      samples are also taken to examine stress-related biomarkers. Randomization was conducted by
      the Random Group Generator (pubmed, 2018). The data management plan includes standard
      procedures for data-handling such as using anonymized identification codes for patient data.
      The participants have the right to access their data, and the right to claim an annihilation.
      The data is being saved in an online database, only allowing researchers involved in the
      study to access the data.
