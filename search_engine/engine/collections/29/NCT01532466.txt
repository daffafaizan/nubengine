      analgesic effect, and is associated with lessened cardiovascular depression and low histamine
      release. Although the cough reflex is usually transient and self-limiting, it should be
      avoided in situations such as elevated intracranial, intraocular, or intra-abdominal
      pressure, and unstable hemodynamics.

      The cause of FIC is unclear. One hypothesis is that vocal cord spasms might induce coughing
      because of fentanyl-induced muscle rigidity and histamine release. Muscle relaxants are
      commonly used to treat this condition. This study hypothesizes that priming muscle relaxants
      could prevent or suppress FIC. This study investigates whether the muscle relaxant rocuronium
      attenuates FIC effectively.
