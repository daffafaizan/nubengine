      selected by the World Health Organization to participate in HIV-vaccine development. The
      predominant HIV-1 strains isolated from Ugandans are members of clade A and clade D. The only
      vaccines available for human testing are based on envelope proteins from clade B and clade E
      viruses. ALVAC-HIV vCP205 is a second generation vaccine that can induce a humoral and
      cellular response against several antigens. The current study will attempt to extend these
      findings to determine if the vCP205 vaccine, when administered to Ugandans, can induce
      cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses that are reactive against the HIV strains prevalent in
      Uganda.

      Volunteers are randomized into 1 of 3 groups and receive either the candidate HIV-1 vaccine
      ALVAC-HIV vCP205, the experimental canarypox rabies vaccine ALVAC-RG, or placebo-ALVAC.
      Neither the volunteer nor his/her health care professional knows which preparation is being
      given. Volunteers receive 4 injections over a period of 6 months and are followed for up to
      24 months. Clinical observations and monitoring of hematological, chemical, and immunologic
      parameters are done. Safety is evaluated by monitoring for local and systemic adverse
      reactions during the course of the trial. Comparative immunogenicity analyses are based on
      CTL responses to HIV and measures of binding and HIV-specific antibody responses. At each
      visit, volunteers are counseled on how to avoid HIV exposure and pregnancy.
