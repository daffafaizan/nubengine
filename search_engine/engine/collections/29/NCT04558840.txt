    
      This is a non-blinded, non-inferiority, randomized control trial with the primary outcome of
      interest being overall pain, with secondary outcomes including adverse effects from pain
      medications, patient satisfaction with their pain regiment and with their surgery, and the
      impact of pain on their daily activities. This study is designed to follow one-hundred (100)
      qualified and consenting patients seeing the PI/surgeon (JMK) at his office at UT
      Southwestern for their initial operative consultation for macromastia. If patients meet
      eligibility criteria, they will be offered enrollment in the trial.
