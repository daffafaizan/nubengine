      ultrasonography guided. The area is not sterile, with high concentration of gram-negative and
      anaerobic pathogens, infection can be induced during the procedure to the urinary tract, and
      even cause bacteremia.

      Prior studies concluded that prophylaxis antibiotic against gram-negative bacteria decreased
      significantly the amount of infections and hence it is accepted to give prophylaxis
      antibiotics which will cover especially gram-negative bacteria. Other studies show decrease
      in infections percent in patients that received prophylaxis opposed to those who did not,
      from 5-30% to less than 1%. Yet, there was no significant difference between those who
      received one dose and those who were treated for 3-5 days. Quinolones are considered
      preferred treatment since they can be given orally, but there is already an increase in
      resistance rates. TMP-SMX can not be used empirically due to a high percent of resistant
      uropathogens. One of the options is aminoglycosides, especially gentamicin. Advantages: very
      low resistance rate in the community, high concentration is urinary tract, slow clearance, no
      resistance developed under treatment, chip and with very few side effects.
