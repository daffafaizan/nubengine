    
      An open, single group of ten patients selected will receive a 30 minute music
      therapy/occupational therapy co-treatment intervention. Music interventions will be performed
      by a licensed, Board-Certified Music Therapist while a licensed Occupational Therapist will
      provide support, assistance, and measurements of behavioral attention/inattention. At the
      outset of the first session patients will be briefly, informally interviewed to ascertain
      their musical preferences, which will then be integrated into the music therapist's
      interventions whenever possible to maximize engagement and therapeutic rapport. Live music
      will be provided on the patient's neglected side and patients will be encouraged to play
      music interactively with a focus towards that side whenever possible. An outcome measurement
      tool (Star Cancellation Test) will be focused on measuring hemispheric neglect and
      administered at the beginning and end of each session to measure within session changes.
