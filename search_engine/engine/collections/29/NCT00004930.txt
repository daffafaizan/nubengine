        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose and phase II dose of inhaled doxorubicin
           administered every 3 weeks in patients with primary lung cancer or cancer metastatic to
           the lung.

        -  Determine the toxic effects and pharmacokinetic profile of this regimen in this patient
           population.

        -  Examine the relationship between pharmacodynamic parameters and toxic effects of this
           regimen in these patients.

        -  Obtain preliminary evidence of therapeutic activity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive inhaled doxorubicin every 3 weeks. Treatment continues for a maximum of 3
      courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients may reenter
      at a higher dose level after a 3-month waiting period.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of doxorubicin until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 6 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-36 patients will be accrued for this study.
