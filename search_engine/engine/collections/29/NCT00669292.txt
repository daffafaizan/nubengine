    
      phase I: Patients will be vaccinated on day 1,8,15 and 22 of each 28-day treatment cycles. On
      each vaccination day, the URLC10-117 peptide(1mg) and TTK-567 peptide(1mg) mixed with CpG
      7909 (escalating doses: 0, 0.02, 0.1mg/kg) emulsified with Montanide ISA 51 will be
      administered by subcutaneous injection. Repeated cycles of vaccine will be administered until
      patients develop progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity, or for maximum 2 cycles,
      whichever occurs first. In this phase I study, we evaluate the safety and tolerability of
      URLC10-177, TTK-567 and different doses of CpG7909 to determine the recommended phase II dose
      of CpG7909.

      phase II: Patients will be vaccinated on day 1,8,15 and 22 of each 28-day treatment cycles.
      On each vaccination day, the URLC10-117 peptide(1mg) and TTK-567 peptide(1mg) mixed with CpG
      7909 (recommended dose determined in phase I study) emulsified with Montanide ISA 51 will be
      administered by subcutaneous injection. Repeated cycles of vaccine will be administered for 2
      cycles. In this phase II study, we evaluate the efficacy of this vaccine therapy.
