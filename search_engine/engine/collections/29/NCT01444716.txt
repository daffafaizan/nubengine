    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES I. To evaluate the overall response rate of ofatumumab in the upfront
      setting in elderly, unfit patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the overall survival with ofatumumab in upfront setting in elderly, unfit CLL
      patients.

      II. To evaluate the complete response rate and time to progression to therapy of ofatumumab
      in elderly, unfit patients with CLL.

      III. To determine the plasma levels of ofatumumab in elderly, unfit patients. IV. To evaluate
      predictive capability of micro ribonucleic acid (RNA) (miRNAs) detection in plasma samples.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants receive ofatumumab intravenously (IV) over 4 hours once a week for 4 weeks, then
      monthly thereafter. Treatment continues for up to 12 months in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.
