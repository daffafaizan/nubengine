    
      This study will be multicenter, open-label and observational data collection of patients on
      telbivudine who meet baseline characteristics defined as the majority of patients seen in the
      clinic setting. Data collection will take place after enrollment, at Week 12, 24, 52, 76 and
      104 for efficacy assessments. In patients who discontinue observational drug earlier,
      clinical information would be kept following for assessment as well.

      Study purpose:

      This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy of telbivudine in real-life clinical settings
      with the use of the Roadmap Concept in chronic hepatitis B treatment.

      Objectives:

      Primary:

      To observe telbivudine's 2-year efficacy in real-world clinical setting of achieving HBV-DNA
      < 60 IU/ml and HBeAg seroconversion rate in patients with defined baseline characteristics
      and 24-week treatment PCR negativity as previously reported in GLOBE study's sub-analysis.

      Secondary:

        1. To observe the treatment outcomes.

        2. To validate the result of super-responder trial.

        3. To validate the Roadmap Concept.

      Population:

      The study population will consist of a representative group of 500 chronic hepatitis B
      patients with detectable HBsAg for more than 6 months who need telbivudine therapy based on
      investigators' judgment in 16 medical centers located in Taiwan.
