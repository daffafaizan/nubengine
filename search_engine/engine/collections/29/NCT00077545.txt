      I. Determine the objective response rate in patients with recurrent or metastatic
      adenocarcinoma of the esophagus or gastroesophageal junction treated with 3-AP (Triapine) and
      cisplatin.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. II. Determine the duration of
      response and overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

      III. Determine the palliative benefits with regard to dysphagia in patients treated with this
      regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive 3-AP (Triapine) IV over 2 hours on days 1-4. Patients also receive cisplatin
      IV over 60 minutes on days 2 and 3 before 3-AP infusion. Treatment repeats every 21 days for
      up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed for up to 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 19-39 patients will be accrued for this study within 20 months.
