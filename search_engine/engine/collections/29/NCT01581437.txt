      electrical activity of the upper chambers of the heart. This cardiac arrhythmia may lead to
      stroke, heart failure, low blood pressure, chest pain, and increased mortality rate.
      Treatment may include medication to stop the rhythm abnormality, blood thinners, and/or
      ablation. Ablation involves application of heat or freezing to the area sustaining the rhythm
      abnormality. This requires tubes (catheters)to be placed in the heart. Human atrial
      fibrillation may be sustained by localized drivers (rapid and/or organized sites of atrial
      electrical activation). By mapping/recording the patient's specific atrial anatomy and atrial
      electrical activity with the 64-pole basket catheter, we may add to the knowledge base of
      these driver locations. We may also add to the knowledge about where best to ablate to
      terminate the arrhythmia. Typical anatomic
