      yoga self-practice for sleep disturbance. Prior to all study procedures, online informed
      consent (with phone support) will be obtained from potential participants. Around 30 eligible
      participants will be randomly assigned to either the yoga group (intervention group) or the
      waitlist control group in a ratio of 1:1. The randomization will be performed by an
      independent assessor using a computer-generated list of numbers. No deception is necessary.

      Participants in the intervention group will receive links to two 60-min videos per week for 8
      consecutive weeks. Each video will include a yoga practice guided by a certified yoga
      instructor. The intervention group is required to perform the yoga practice at least two
      times per week. If preferred, they can do additional sessions with the videos and record
      their total hours of self-practice. The waitlist control group will receive the video links
      subsequent to the 8-week study. The intervention group will complete a set of online
      questionnaires before the intervention commences, weekly during the intervention period,
      immediately after the intervention, and 4 weeks after the intervention. The waitlist control
      group will complete the same set of online questionnaires before the intervention commences
      and immediately after 8-week intervention period has ended.
