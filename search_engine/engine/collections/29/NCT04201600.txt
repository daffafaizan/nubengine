      highly prevalent worldwide, is among the leading causes of death, and is an independent risk
      factor for dementia and less severe forms of cognitive dysfunction. The investigators are
      utilizing novel technology to understand the role of variability in glucose on neurocognition
      and functional status among middle-aged and older adults at risk for diabetes. The central
      hypothesis is that even before diabetes onset, variability in glucose will be associated with
      worse cognitive function and lower functional status. Participants will be asked to wear a
      glucose monitoring device over a 10-day period in their home environment. Assessment of
      functional status and neurocognitive function, in addition to sociodemographic factors,
      health habits and mood will also occur over two study visits.
