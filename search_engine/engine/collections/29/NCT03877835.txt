      sagittal infraclavicular block of the posterior and lateral cords would provide good
      postoperative analgesia for patients undergoing shoulder arthroplasty.

      The primary aims of this study were to document numeric rating scale (NRS, 0-10) and use of
      morphine equivalents during the first 24 hours after surgery. Secondary aims were to
      determine the incidence of diaphragm paresis 30 minutes after the block and to quantify
      postoperative hand grip force at 1 hr.
