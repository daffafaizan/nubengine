      encephalopathy. Because the examination of the pupillary reaction is easy it is part of the
      clinical routine but due to the different medication and the dynamic process of reperfusion
      injury to the brain a clinical evaluation might be not precise enough. The NPi has been shown
      to be superior to clinical evaluation in different settings but without regard towards
      cardiac arrest survivors. The Pupillometer is a hand-held, cordless, and simple to use device
      which removes subjectivity in the measurement of pupil size and the pupillary light reflex.
