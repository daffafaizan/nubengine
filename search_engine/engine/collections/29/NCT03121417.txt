      I. To study the sustained proliferation of programmed cell death protein (PD)-1+Ki-67+cluster
      of differentiation(CD)8 T cells as a predictive biomarker of response to nivolumab by
      comparing the response rates to nivolumab treatment between two groups of patients (positive
      vs negative) stratified by the status of PD-1+Ki-67+CD8 T cells.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Characterize phenotype of proliferating T cells in peripheral blood in the setting of
      nivolumab therapy.

      II. Perform gene expression profiling of activated T cells from peripheral blood.

      III. Perform T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing of activated T cells from peripheral blood and
      tumor infiltrating T cells (TILs).

      IV. Assess pre-treatment biopsies and biopsies at the time of disease progression for tumor
      infiltrating lymphocytes.

      V. Determine progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every
      2 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unexpected toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 and 90 days and then
      every 3 months for up to 3 years.
