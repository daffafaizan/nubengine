      Participants will be recruited from all collaborating hospitals (currently Radboudumc,
      Rijnstate, CWZ) after providing written informed consent.

      In this observational, prospective study, a total of 192 patients who are going to be treated
      for their AAA will be included. Baseline patient characteristics will be registered,
      including traditional risk factors and CV-history. In addition to regular care of measuring
      AAA diameter progression (in mm/year), we will perform the CAR-test (10-min) and non-invasive
      arterial stiffness measures (PWA and PWV) with the SphygmoCor device (10-min).

      Furthermore, the investigators will ask patients to complete a questionnaire about the
      quality of their life. A second questionnaire tries to clarify the disease experience of the
      patients. Both questionnaires will be asked to be completed at the start, 6-8 weeks after
      repair, after one year and after two years of repair. Subsequently, the investigators will
      record major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) according to the International
      Classification of Disease-10. Registration of MACE will be performed using hospital-records
      and following international guidelines. Across a 2-year follow-up, by means of regular
      follow-up appointments, the investigators will examine the ability of the CAR parameter and
      arterial stiffness parameters to predict CV-events.
