      administered with and without deep inhalation. This study will also investigate the role of
      airway inflammation on these responses, using sputum differential cell counts and fractional
      exhaled nitric oxide.

      This is a single center, open label, randomized study. Individuals with stable asthma will be
      eligible for enrollment. The study will consist of two parts, screening and testing.

      Part 1: Screening

      Participants will undergo consent procedures and assessments of fractional exhaled nitric
      oxide levels, airway responsiveness to methacholine and sputum induction. If participants
      show airway responsiveness to methacholine (i.e. methacholine PC20 16mg/mL), they will be
      scheduled to undergo the testing part of the study.

      Part 2: Testing

      Participants will be randomized to undergo two methacholine or two mannitol challenges.
      Further randomization will occur with respect to whether the standard challenge method or the
      modified challenge method is performed first.
