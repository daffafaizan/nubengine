      will be enrolled. Of these, 25 will be scheduled for Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass surgery (RYGB),
      while the remainder (50) will be scheduled for Sleeve Gastrectomy (SG). The study team will
      play no role in assignment of the surgical procedure. Following surgery, at month 3, subjects
      undergoing SG will be randomized to either Saxenda or placebo, subcutaneously once daily.
      Subjects randomized to Saxenda or placebo will take for the duration of the study (33
      months). Follow up study visits for all subjects will be timed to coincide with the standard
      clinical follow up visits at months 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 30 and 36.
