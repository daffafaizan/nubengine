      digitally or by direct visualization with a speculum. The uterine component of the balloon
      will be inflated to maximum 60mL. The catheter will be taped to the inner thigh with gentle
      traction. In both groups participants will be started on hospital-based oxytocin protocol.
      This protocol beings with 2 milliunits/min of oxytocin, increasing by 2 milliunits every 15
      minutes until regular uterine contractions occur. The maximum dose of oxytocin is considered
      to be 30 milliunits. The cook catheter will then be removed at 6 vs. 12 hours based on
      randomization. At that point health care providers will manage active labor. Health care
      providers many perform amniotomy at any point during the induction process with
      recommendation for amniotomy with cervix more than 4cm dilated. Labor interventions are at
      the discretion of the healthcare provider. The participants will have continuous fetal
      monitoring throughout their induction, labor and delivery. Need for operative delivery or
      cesarean section will be at the discretion of the health provider.
