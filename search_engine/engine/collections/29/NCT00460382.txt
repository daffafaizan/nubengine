    
      Methods: A phase II pilot, prospective, open label, single arm multicentric clinical trial
      assessing a darunavir/ritonavir, etravirine and MK-0518-containing regimen, if possible
      associated to an optimized background regimen that may include NRTIs and enfuvirtide, in
      HIV-1 infected patients failing combination antiretroviral therapy with multi-resistant
      viruses.

      Treatment strategy: Patients will receive raltegravir (MK-0518), darunavir/ritonavir
      (TMC114/r) and etravirine (TMC125) and if possible an optimized background therapy.

        -  raltegravir (MK-0518) (400 mg x 2/d = one 400 mg pill twice daily)

        -  darunavir (600 mg x 2/d= two 300 mg pills twice daily with meal)

        -  ritonavir (100 mg x 2/d = one 100 mg pill twice daily with meal)

        -  etravirine (200 mg x 2/d = two 100 mg pills twice daily with meal)

        -  if possible an optimized background therapy: may include NRTI(s) and enfuvirtide but not
           nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) and protease inhibitors (PIs).
           NRTIs choice is left to the clinician's discretion. Enfuvirtide is highly recommended in
           enfuvirtide-naive patients but is left to the clinician.

      Main outcome: proportion of patients with HIV RNA levels of less than 50 copies/ml in an
      intent to treat analysis at W24.

      Secondary outcomes: proportions of patients with HIV RNA levels of less than 50 copies/ml at
      week 48, with HIV RNA levels of less than 400 copies/ml at week 24 and 48; HIV RNA level
      evolution between baseline and week 48; HIV proviral DNA and 2LTR circle HIV DNA between
      baseline and week 48; number and type of resistance mutations in case of virologic failure
      occurrence; CD4 lymphocyte count and proportion evolution between baseline and week 48; HIV
      infection progression; frequency of the study regimen modifications and interruption; study
      regimen tolerance; study regimen adherence; association between study drugs' minimum
      concentrations at week 4 and virologic success at week 24; evolution of pharmacokinetic
      parameters of study drugs between week 1 and week 4 in the Pharmacokinetic substudy.

      Sample size: 103 patients

      Enrollment period: 24 weeks

      Patient's participation duration: 52 weeks

      An extended follow-up (from week 52 to week 96) has been added in April 2008.
