    
      This study is a randomized, open-label, mutiple dosing, 2-way crossover design to evaluate
      the pharmacokinetic effect of tadalafil(5mg) on tamsulosin(0.2mg) in healthy male subjects
      Subjects will receive repeated dose of tamsulosin (0.2mg*1t/day) or tamsulosin (0.2mg*1t/day)
      / tadalafil (5mg*1t/day) for 5days Each treatment period was separated by a washout period of
      at least 10 days. Each period of study will enroll 14 healthy male subjects. Blood samples
      for pharmacokinetic analysis will be taken at regular intervals after dosing. Safety will be
      assessed by measurement of blood pressure, heart rate, safety laboratory data, and review of
      adverse events.
