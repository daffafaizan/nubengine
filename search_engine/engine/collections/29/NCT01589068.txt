      nicotine and on patterns of brain activation in areas of the brain with high levels of
      nicotine receptors. This will be correlated with serum nicotine levels, nicotine-induced
      changes in subjective states, and endocrine measures of the HPA and HPG axes. The temporal
      covariance of progesterone's effects on serum nicotine levels and nicotine-induced changes in
      subjective states and cardiovascular measures will be analyzed.

      The covariance between the effects of progesterone on nicotine-induced changes in BOLD fMRI,
      endocrine, subjective and cardiovascular effects and the temporal concordance with increases
      in serum nicotine and cotinine levels will be determined.
