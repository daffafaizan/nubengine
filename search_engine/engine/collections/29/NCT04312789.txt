      I. To determine the safety and efficacy of avatrombopag for the treatment of thrombocytopenia
      after allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To identify predictors of response to avatrombopag.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive avatrombopag orally (PO) once daily (QD) for up to 1 year in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Avatrombopag will be titrated weekly until
      platelet count of greater than or equal to 60,000/uL is achieved and persists for 7
      consecutive days, and the patient remains free from platelet transfusion.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up weekly for 4 weeks and then
      monthly up to 1 year.
