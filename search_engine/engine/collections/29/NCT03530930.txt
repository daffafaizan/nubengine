      osteoarthritis not responding to diclofenac. In animal models comarum palustre showed
      anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, analgesic, antioxidant, antihistamine, and
      membrane-stabilizing effects. Thus, pleiotropic properties of Comarum Palustre may provide a
      rationale for this use in patients having both osteoarthritis and diabetes mellitus. In this
      group of patients Comarum Palustre may not only relieve OA-related pain but reduce systemic
      inflammation, decrease progression of atherosclerosis and diabetes complications.
