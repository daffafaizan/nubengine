      participant knows the treatment that the participants receives), placebo-controlled,
      multi-center (when more than 1 hospital or medical school team work on a medical research
      study) study with a parallel-group design (a medical research study comparing the response in
      2 or more groups of participants receiving different treatments) study of prucalopride. This
      study consist of 3 phases: a 2 weeks drug-free screening or run in phase, a 12-week treatment
      phase and follow-up (post-treatment) phase performed 7 days following the last dose of study
      drug. The total duration of study will be approximately 15 to 20 weeks, including the run-in
      and post-treatment phases. During the run-in phase, participants will receive laxative
      (bisacodyl) as a rescue medication throughout the study, if they will not have bowel movement
      (BM) for 3 or more consecutive days. If participants will not be able to tolerate bisacodyl,
      an enema may be used in place of the bisacodyl. During the double-blind treatment phase,
      participants will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of 2 treatment groups to receive
      either 2 milligram (mg) prucalopride or matching placebo prucalopride for 12 weeks, orally
      once daily. Participants will be primarily assessed for spontaneous complete bowel movements
      (SCBMs) per week. Participant's safety and quality of life will be monitored throughout the
      study.
