      and is an independent prognostic factor. One of the implicated factors is the increase of
      resting energy expenditure (REE) which can be found in about 50 % of ALS patients. The origin
      of this hypermetabolism is currently unknown but could be located in the mitochondria. In
      fact, some studies have found mitochondrial abnormalities and the existence of an oxidative
      stress. Thus, the aim of this study is to characterize the mitochondrial abnormalities and
      the oxidant/antioxidant status of ALS patients and to determine their relationship with the
      metabolic status, hypermetabolism or normometabolism. Three groups of patients will be
      studied : 20 hypermetabolic ALS patients, 20 normometabolic ALS patients and 20 healthy
      volunteers paired for age and sex.
