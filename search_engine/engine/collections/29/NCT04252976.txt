      the traditional Patanjali yoga system, which can act as a coping factor on the one hand, and
      higher motivation and deepening of practice (physical yoga exercises / mantra Meditation).
      MBLM aims to establish an exercise routine in the daily lives of the participants, which
      leads to salutogenesis. The promotion of mental health through meditation and yoga has been
      well documented (BÃ¼ssing et al., 2012, Sedlmeier, Ebert, & Schwarz, 2012), also in clinical
      populations (Ospina et al., 2007). The preventive potential of the MBLM program will be
      examined for healthy volunteers, analogous to the already well-researched and widely used
      Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction program.
