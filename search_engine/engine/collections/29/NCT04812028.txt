      pancreatectomy with islet cell autotransplantation) includes a number of different
      challenges, one of which includes pain. Pain is treated with both medications and approaches
      without medications (such as music and other distraction techniques). Opioids are one such
      effective pain medication which is universally used, however like all medications has risks
      of certain side effects (such as nausea, constipation, itching, and others). Modern research
      has searched for other medications and methods to treat pain in both children and adults. In
      this study, the investigators aim to apply one of these methods that has been shown to be
      effective in certain operative populations through a medicine called Magnesium-Sulfate, which
      may be a safe way to decrease the use of other pain medications (specifically opioids).
      Magnesium is already a physiologic electrolyte the body uses, which we get from certain
      foods. Used as an IV medication to reach higher levels of magnesium can work to decrease pain
      via its action on specific nerve receptors. Magnesium-Sulfate will be given at the beginning
      of transplant surgery for consented liver and TPIAT transplant patients, and continue an
      infusion for 48 hours into their ICU course. The investigators will monitor side effects and
      treat pain the same way otherwise the care team would without magnesium to determine whether
      there is any beneficial effect that can be applied to children in the future.
