      reintroduction of belimumab 10 mg/kg plus standard of care medications on immunogenicity,
      markers of biological activity, efficacy, and safety in subjects with stable low systemic
      lupus erythematosus (SLE) disease activity. Additionally, this study will assess rebound
      phenomenon in subjects with any disease level of SLE who have permanently withdrawn from
      further belimumab treatment
