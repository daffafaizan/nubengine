      Information on abdominal symptoms (GRSR: Gastrointestinal symptom rating scale, rate of
      symptoms, quality of life (SF-36, EQ-5D-5L), consumption of ulcer drugs including over the
      counter drugs, hospital admissions, dyspepsia-related sick leave days, consultations and
      comorbidity). A reminder is sent out 2 weeks after the first contact.

      Register data:

      OPED (Odense Pharmaca-epidemiological Database): Information on reimbursable ulcer drugs,
      ASA, NSAID and HP-eradication therapy. The Regional Hospital discharge Register: Information
      based on International Classification of Diseases (ICD). Information on ulcer-related
      admissions, out-patient ulcer diagnosis and comorbidity, use of upper gastrointestinal
      endoscopy.

      HP-test unscreened group:

      Invitation of the primary unscreened group to HP test (13C-urea breath-test) in order to
      analyze the effect of HP-screening according to HP-status. Instruments: automated breath
      13Co2 analyser- Isotope ratio mass spectrometer.

      Almost all persons are infected with HP during childhood. Infection with the bacteria in
      adulthood is rare. Only few persons spontaneously turn HP-negative. From OPED we will know
      which individuals who have been prescribed HP-eradication treatment. Thus the participants in
      the control group, who are HP-positive at 12-yr follow-up, have had the infection the whole
      period. Provided they have not received HP-eradication treatment, those who are tested
      HP-negative have been so the whole period.
