      of alcohol, and co-occurring psychiatric conditions, relatively little is known about the
      efficacy of naltrexone for the treatment of alcohol dependence in women. This study
      investigated the safety and efficacy of naltrexone in combination with Cognitive Behavioral
      Coping Skills Therapy (CBCST) in a sample of alcohol-dependent women, some with comorbid
      eating pathology.

      Methods: One hundred three women meeting DSM-IV criteria for alcohol dependence (29 with
      comorbid eating disturbances) were randomized to receive either naltrexone or placebo for 12
      weeks in addition to weekly group CBCST.
