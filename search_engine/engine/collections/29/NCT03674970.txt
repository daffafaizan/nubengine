      study in which 45 current cigarette smokers who are interested in quitting will be randomly
      allocated to one of three possible nicotine film treatment regimens:

        1. Random nicotine delivery (a combination of four 0 mg and 4 mg films daily not to exceed
           three non-consecutive 4 mg films in one day and to maintain an average of 8 mg of
           nicotine per day through 7 days for 6 weeks total).

        2. Steady state nicotine delivery (2, 2, 2, 2 mg films daily for 6 weeks total)

        3. Placebo delivery (0, 0, 0, 0 mg films daily for 6 weeks total)

      Prior to assignment in one of the above treatment groups, all participants will take part in
      a 1-week baseline period to assess normal smoking behavior and nicotine dependence. Following
      randomization to their assigned treatment group at Visit 2, participants will be instructed
      to smoke cigarettes as they feel necessary over the next two weeks while using the nicotine
      films as directed (i.e., one film every 3-4 hours for a total of four films per day). After
      two weeks of pre-cessation treatment, participants will be asked completely cease cigarette
      smoking and to only use their assigned nicotine films as directed. Participants will be
      supported in their quitting efforts with regular contacts both in person at the Penn State
      Milton S. Hershey Medical Center and over the phone.
