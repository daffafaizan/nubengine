      displaying increased tone, clonus, spasms, spastic dystonia and co- contractions. The impact
      of spasticity on the patient varies from a subtle neurological sign to severe spasticity
      causing pain and contractures. Upper limb spasticity (ULS) is the rapid contraction or
      shortening of the muscles in the arm causing abnormal muscle movements in the elbow, wrist
      and fingers. It has been reported that over 1 million Americans with traumatic injury to the
      brain or spinal cord, stroke, multiple sclerosis and cerebral palsy experience ULS. Tightly
      clenched fists, twisted wrist and elbow joints, and fixed arms in flexed positions result in
      extreme discomfort, pain and spasm. A nonsurgical, minimally invasive, effective approach to
      pain associated with ULS is desirable.

      Myoscience, Inc. (Redwood City, CA) has developed a pain management device - the Cryo-Touch
      III - for a novel, minimally invasive procedure using focused cold therapy to target sensory
      nerve tissue and offer long-lasting pain relief through cryoanalgesia. The device operates on
      the well-established cryobiology principle that localized exposure to controlled, moderately
      low temperature conditions can alter tissue function. The therapy treats nerves via a probe
      in the form of an assembly of small diameter needles, creating a highly localized, low
      temperature treatment zone around the probe. This focused cold therapy creates a conduction
      block that prevents nerve signaling. Prior studies of the Cryo-Touch, Cryo-Touch II,
      Cryo-Touch III (a.k.a. PCP 1.0) devices have provided preliminary evidence of effectiveness
      on motor nerves and have been shown to be safe with no serious device-related adverse events.
