      post-operative sore throat are two common undesirable side effects of general anesthesia and
      might lead to patients' morbidity or dissatisfaction. We investigated the possibility to
      attenuate both side effects with one single method, i.e. ultrasound-driven lidocaine
      inhalation immediately before induction.
