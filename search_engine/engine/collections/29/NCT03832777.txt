      and economic costs, and is characterized with impulsiveness, both interpersonal relationships
      and emotional disturbance. Symptoms are related to hypofunction of frontal areas like
      Dorsomedial Prefrontal Cortex (DMPFC). Psychotherapy is the base treatment in this disease,
      but economic costs and long-time therapy have made difficult the attachment. Repetitive
      Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation(rTMS), authorized by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on
      Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) treatment has proven good results in previous works in BPD
      clinical characteristics on both dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and enhancement in
      depressive symptoms stimulating DMPFC in high frequency. However, there are no current
      research that have addressed the use of low-frequency on this anatomical area.
