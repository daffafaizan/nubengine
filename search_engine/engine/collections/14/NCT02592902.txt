      and adults as well. It is characterised by grow of squamous cell tumours on mucosa of
      aerodigestive tract, with predilection for the larynx. The disease is caused by the human
      papillomavirus (HPV). However, in contrast to the low incidence of RRP, HPV prevalence is
      common. It is indicated that other factors may contribute to the pathogenesis of RRP. One
      such factor might be extraesophageal reflux (EER). We investigated whether patients with RRP
      suffer more often from EER.
