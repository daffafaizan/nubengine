      This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter phase III trial with a parallel-group design of
      two groups.

      Randomization and Interventions:

      Randomization between Obinutuzumab single agent treatment versus Obinutuzumab plus
      Bendamustine followed by Obinutuzumab

      Treatment plans:

      Arm A: Obinutuzumab single agent Obinutuzumab flat dose of 1000 mg on Day 1 of each of four
      28 -day cycles and on Days 8 and 15 of Cycle 1

      If at least 'stable disease':

      Obinutuzumab flat dose of 1000 mg at weeks 21, 29, 37 and 45 Arm B: Obinutuzumab plus
      Bendamustine Obinutuzumab flat dose of 1000 mg on Day 1 of each of four 28 -day cycles and on
      Days 8 and 15 of Cycle 1 plus Bendamustine 70 mg/m2 iv d1+2 of each of four 28 -day cycles

      If at least 'stable disease':

      Obinutuzumab flat dose of 1000 mg at weeks 21, 29, 37 and 45

      The project attempts to establish an evidence based treatment strategy for medically non-fit
      advanced stage FL-patients who are not eligible for standard therapeutic immunochemotherapy
      approaches to improve their long term perspectives.

      It will furthermore provide a prospectively generated data set which will link performance in
      the assessment scores IADL, G8 and CIRS-G to medical fitness as judged by the treating
      physician. The generated data will allow using geriatric and functional tests to define
      medical fitness and to provide a more solid basis for future studies.
