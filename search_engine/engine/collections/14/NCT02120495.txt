      planning, real time surgical navigation system, endoscope techniques, to do the intraoral
      condylectomy via coronoid process resection. After the condyle lesion resection, the coronoid
      process will be reimplanted and fixed by stainless steel wire. By using these techniques we
      can safely and precisely cut proper size and position of the condyle lesion as we
      pre-surgically designed, and at the same time greatly maintain the temporomandibular joint
      anatomy structure. Since we don't need to do the mandible vertical ramus osteotomy, and no
      conventional extraoral incision will be needed, the surgical injury will be minimized and the
      TMJ function will recover soon postoperatively. Additionally, the intraoral approach can
      avoid the risk of facial nerve injury, salivary fistula and skin scar, so it has better
      aesthetic results than the preauricular approach and the submandibular approach.
