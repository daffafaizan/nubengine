      the diet in adequate amounts. Probiotic supplementation is safe for use in infants to the
      elderly and has demonstrated beneficial effects for a wide variety of health conditions such
      as acute diarrhea, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, allergies, and inflammatory bowel disease.
      The immune-enhancing benefits of probiotics are attractive, particularly for infants, a group
      that is particularly prone to a variety of infections, e.g. respiratory tract infection,
      strep throat, and diarrhea. Probiotic supplementation has been utilized in previous studies
      of childhood infections with promising results.

      In this study, the safety and effectiveness of 12-week probiotic supplementation on the
      incidence and duration of infectious episodes in infants aged 6 to 12 months will be
      determined. The subjects will receive follow-on formula containing 1 million CFU/g
      Lactobacillus rhamnosus HN001 (trademarked DR20), 1 million CFU/g Bifidobacterium animalis
      subsp. lactis HN019 (trademarked DR10), or placebo formula for at least three feeds per day
      for 12 weeks.
