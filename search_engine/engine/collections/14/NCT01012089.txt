      chronic kidney disease. The incidence is highest in children with an access for dialysis,
      especially in those with catheters. Staphylococcal species account for more than 50% of
      access infections (ranging from 58-77%). Failure to clear the infection results in loss of
      dialysis access.

      Daptomycin is a new antibiotic that provides coverage against most gram positive bacteria
      including methicillin-resistant staphylococci, vancomycin-intermediate Staphylococcus aureus,
      and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. The pharmacokinetics of daptomycin in children on
      dialysis, a group of patients who may need the medication the most, remains unknown.

      Children on HD or PD with suspected or confirmed infections due to gram-positive bacteria and
      who are concurrently treated with standard of care antibiotics will be considered for this
      study. Each patient will be given a onetime dose of Cubicin (daptomycin). After receiving
      daptomycin, serial blood samples along with dialysis effluent and urine (obtained from
      non-anuric patients) will be collected to evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of the drug.
