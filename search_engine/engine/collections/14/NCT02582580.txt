    
      METHODS:

      Participants: Primigravidae women over 18 years old will be selected, from the 32th
      gestational week and wishing to have a vaginal delivery.

      Interventions: Pregnant women will be randomly allocated into three groups: perineal massage,
      vaginal dilator and pelvic floor muscles training. The technique should be practiced from the
      34th week of pregnancy until the beginning of labor. Randomization will be done by a
      researcher who was not involved with the recruitment, assessment and treatment of the
      participants. All participants will undergo a clinical and functional assessment of the
      pelvic floor before the beginning of the technique practice, as well as a reassessment of
      these items and an assessment of perineal integrity between 45 and 60 days after delivery for
      a blind physiotherapist regarding the interventional procedures.

      Objective: To compare the effects of perineal massage, vaginal dilator and pelvic floor
      muscles training on the perineal integrity of primiparae women.

      Outcome: The perineal integrity will be verified by the presence or absence of perineal
      laceration as well as their characteristics observed immediately after delivery.

      Randomization: Participants randomization will be done from a sequence generated by a
      computer program.

      Blinding: The evaluative procedures will be done by a 'blinded' physiotherapist in relation
      to the intervention procedures and the randomization procedure by a researcher who was not
      involved with the recruitment, evaluation and participant's treatment.

      Discussion: The knowledge of the effects of antenatal pelvic floor preparation techniques on
      the perineal integrity and pelvic floor muscles function after delivery, will allow a better
      choice about which approach is the best to pregnant women to prevent perineal trauma.
