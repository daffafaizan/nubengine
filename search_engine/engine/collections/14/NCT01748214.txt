    
      Infants born < 32 weeks, in an incubator, and > 7 days postnatal that were maintained on
      either on NCPAP or HFNC to maintain SaO2 in a range of 88 - 92 %. Study infants had decibel
      measurements obtained every 15 seconds for 30 minutes using a noise dosimeter (NoisePro
      DLX-1). The microphone for the dosimeter was suspended from the inside of the incubator such
      that it hung 1 foot above the infants nose and mouth. The exhalation port for NCPAP was
      placed outside of the incubator. Repeated measurement periods on the same mode of support
      were made within a 72 hour period. Each infant the acted as their own control and was
      switched within 7 days to the alternative respiratory support method that maintained similar
      SaO2 goals and repeat measurements were obtained. Comparisons of mean decibel levels during
      recording were compared using paired t-tests.
