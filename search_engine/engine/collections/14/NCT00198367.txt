    
      These results justify the choice of the study design currently suggested, testing the
      preoperative feasibility

        1. chemotherapy: cisplatin-Gemzar (arm A) or

        2. chemoradiotherapy: cisplatin-navelbine-radiotherapy (arm B) or
           Carboplatin-Taxol-radiotherapy (arm C).

      The results obtained, in terms of feasibility and toxicity, will make it possible to select
      the optimal diagrams for a phase III study.
