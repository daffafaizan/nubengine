      quality of life (HRQOL) survey for patients with Chronic Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis (CHP).
      The survey items have been developed and revised from prior qualitative research with CHP
      patients. Potential participants will be recruited from WCMC, the Pulmonary Fibrosis
      Foundation (PFF) Registry and outside physician referral for the study. Participants will be
      asked to sign informed consent. At the initial visit participants will be asked to complete
      the survey and two additional PROs needed for concurrent validity testing. Participants will
      then be asked to complete the HRQOL survey under study a second time 2 weeks after the
      initial visit for test-re-test reliability testing. Pulmonary function testing and six minute
      walk test results will be collected. Pertinent demographic and clinical information will be
      collected from the patients and their medical records or registry data (if a PFF Registry
      participant). All information will be entered into a REDCap database for secure data
      management and storage. Psychometric testing will be performed on the overall survey
      instrument and the individual items in order to test validity and reliability. The goal is
      that the survey developed will be a reliable and valid measurement tool for use in both
      clinical practice and research settings.
