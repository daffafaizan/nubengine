      cholesteric liver diseaseï¼Œwhich will contribute to cirrhosis. Symptoms and course of primary
      biliary cholangitis can be diverse, wherefore the targets of the current treatment are
      focused on the prevention of end-stage liver disease. Researches reported patients with PBC
      may involve abnormalities on skeleton, thyroid and exocrine glands. However, whether this
      autoimmune disease would cause cardiac impairment is scarcely investigated. From our clinical
      practice, the cardiac structural abnormal can be found in certain patients with PBC detected
      by cardiovascular magnet resonance (CMR). CMR is the primary and emerging imaging modality
      for myocardial tissue characterisation, and it is recommended as a gold standard for
      functional imaging and assessment. This single-center, prospective observational study plans
      to identify the type and the severity of cardiac changes in PBC.
