      care setting in terms of the following outcome measures:

        1. The short- and long-term incidence of adverse events related to the anticonvulsant
           medication

        2. The frequency of clinically-evident and sub-clinical seizures, as demonstrated by
           continuous EEG monitoring for the first three days and by clinical assessment for up to
           6 months after initial admission.

        3. Intermediate and long-term outcomes as measured by standard outcome measures including
           Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale, Disability Rating Scale, and Resource Utilization
           Questionnaire
