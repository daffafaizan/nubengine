    
      The study will be conducted in two parts (Part 1 and Part 2). Part 1 consists of three
      treatment periods in six sequences and part 2 consists of four treatment periods in four
      sequences. In Part 1 two pediatric candidate powder formulations will be compared with
      maribavir 200mg tablet under fasted conditions in regards to their bioavailability and
      palatability. In Part 2 dose proportionality and impact of food (a high-fat meal) on the rate
      and extent of absorption of the selected pediatric formulation will be assessed. The
      pediatric formulation which will be evaluated in Part 2 will be chosen based on the results
      of planned analysis of Part 1 PK and palatability data from two candidate pediatric
      formulations and the doses to be evaluated in Part 2 may be adjusted based on relative
      bioavailability of the selected pediatric formulation (powder for oral suspension) to the
      Phase 3 tablet formulation observed in Part 1.
