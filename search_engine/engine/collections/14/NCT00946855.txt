      pathological changes in elite athletes during the regular training process. This is
      particularly true in soccer players who compete more often than many other athletes.
      Therefore, soccer players of the first two German soccer leagues (all professional athletes)
      are recruited for repeated blood sampling during the season (4 sampling times, one of them
      immediately before training commences in the summer, the other ones in October/November,
      February/March, and April/May). Among other standardizing requirements, it is mandatory that
      precisely one training session (not zero, not two, no competition) takes place the day before
      sampling. Several confounders for the interpretation of laboratory results are verified by
      means of a questionnaire. Phases of high competitive stress are compared with those of low
      stress. The course of the parameters as well as confidence intervals for given times during
      the season are of main interest.
