      a new site is enrolled, the first approximately 6 months of the project will be a "ramp-up"
      period during which the protocol will be re-reviewed during a site visit to the participating
      EDs and random block assignments will be generated and delivered. The last 6 months will be
      reserved for data analysis, study closeout, and manuscript preparation. An intervening 2-year
      period will be divided into 4 six-month calendar time periods for carrying out the protocol
      and data collection. For each 6-month period, each ED will have a randomized treatment
      assignment for pediatric emergency and critical care consultations ("M" for telemedicine and
      "P" for telephone.) Participating EDs (the unit of randomization) will be stratified into two
      strata by size of ED and geographical location. EDs will then be randomized within-strata to
      one of the four unbalanced (3:1) crossover treatment assignment sequences, each consisting of
      a 6-month period: PMMM, MPMM, MMPM, or MMMP. During these assigned periods, the type of
      consultation being assigned will be strongly encouraged, but deviating from protocol (i.e.,
      using telephone consultation when randomized to telemedicine, or the vice-versa) will be
      allowed as needed by the physicians. Data will be collected and abstracted through
      retrospective chart review.
