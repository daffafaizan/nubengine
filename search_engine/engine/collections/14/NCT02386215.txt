      (ANC) and post-partum care (PPC) at 3 sites in Kisumu, Kenya. The study's purpose is to
      investigate whether offering multiple HIV self-tests to women can increase the likelihood
      that either partner or couples HIV testing takes place.

      Women who are randomized to the intervention group will be provided with multiple oral
      self-tests as well as information about how to use the tests and where to seek care if
      necessary. These women will be encouraged to give the self-tests to their sexual partners and
      encourage those partners to take a self-test. Women who are randomized to the control group
      will be offered the standard counseling to refer their partners for clinic-based HIV
      counseling and testing. Our hypothesis is that the intervention group will have higher uptake
      of HIV testing by women's partners within 3 months of enrollment in the study than the
      control group. Participants in the study will complete a baseline interview and a follow-up
      interview at 3 months post-enrollment. Qualitative in-depth interviews will be conducted with
      a subset of participants in the intervention group.
