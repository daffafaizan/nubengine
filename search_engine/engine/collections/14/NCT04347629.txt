      (ViDec), which is recorded by the patient. The video decision aid explores ACP options for
      medical care for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and reviews hemodialysis, peritoneal
      dialysis, as well as medical management without dialysis; it also reviews cardiopulmonary
      resuscitation (CPR). Patients will also audio- or video-record their preferences using a
      tablet. The video will be shared with their nephrologist. The patient will have a copy of the
      video to take with them and share with their loved ones.

      Patients will answer survey questions about their preferences, knowledge, decisional
      conflict, and ACP engagement. They will be surveyed every two months for one year or death
      (if they die before one year).

      Potential participants will be recruited from 10 nephrology clinics: Massachusetts General
      Hospital (n=75), Brigham and Women's Hospital (n=75), University of Pittsburgh (n=75),
      University of Pennsylvania, Stanford University, Palo Alto Veterans Institute for Research,
      University of Washington, Renal & Transplant Associates of New England, University of New
      Mexico and Boston Medical Center.
