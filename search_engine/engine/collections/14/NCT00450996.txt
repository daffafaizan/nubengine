      endothelial graft rejection following normal-risk penetrating keratoplasty (PK). DESIGN:
      Prospective, institutional, longitudinal, randomized interventional trial including 406 eyes
      (age: 52 >= 19 years; follow-up: 42 >= 18 months). METHODS: Postoperative treatment started
      with prednisolone acetate 1% eye drops five times daily and was tapered over the first 6
      months. Patients were then randomised into either short-term (stop topical steroid treatment)
      or long-term treatment (continue steroids once daily until 12 months). <=
