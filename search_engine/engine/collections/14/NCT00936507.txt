    
      The purpose of this investigation is to examine the impact of portion size on intake of a low
      energy dense food (fruit). Preschool-aged children will be provided with a small and large
      portion of applesauce (low-energy-dense food) and chocolate pudding (higher-energy-dense
      food) and allowed to eat the foods ad libitum during an afternoon snack in their usual
      preschool classroom. Measures of the amount of each food (grams and kilocalories) consumed
      will be taken.

      The following hypotheses are proposed:

        1. A significant main effect of portion size will occur, such that children will consume
           more food, both in grams and kilocalories, in the large portion as compared to the small
           portion conditions.

        2. A main effect of food type on caloric intake will occur, such that children will consume
           less calories in the applesauce condition as compared to the pudding condition, due to
           the differences in energy density of these foods. It is not anticipated that a
           difference in grams consumed from each food will occur.
