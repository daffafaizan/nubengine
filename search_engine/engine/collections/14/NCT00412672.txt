      myocardial protection during an ischemic event. Increased collateral flow for any given area
      at risk will decrease the myocardial damage caused by the occlusion of the infarct related
      epicardial artery.

      It is further hypothesized that myocardial salvage provided by collateral flow will decrease
      infarct size and this in turn will decrease LV dilatation post-myocardial infarction.

      The two primary endpoints are infarct size as assessed by increase of biochemical cardiac
      markers and coronary collateral perfusion index (CPI) as obtained by transthoracic MCE.

      Extent of LV remodelling, i.e., LV dilatation as assessed by serial assessment of LV
      dimension by LV angiogram and/or echocardiography, respectively.
