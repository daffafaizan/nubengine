      severe ischemic heart disease and clinical indications for coronary revascularization will be
      screened and, if agreeable, entered into the study. Qualified patients unwilling to
      participate in the randomized trial will be approached for participation in a Registry that
      will collect computerized health data. The study consists of a 4-year accrual period. The
      median follow-up will be 3.7 years with a maximum of six years and a minimum of two years.
      Six sites will begin recruitment in the first year followed by nine additional sites for the
      remaining three years. The study is powered to detect a 40% relative difference between the
      groups in time to death or MI with a two-sided, type I error of 5% and a power of 90%.
