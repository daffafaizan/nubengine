      in-person cancer genetic counselling. It aims to recruit 250 prospective patients attending
      genetic counselling for Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer (HBOC) and Lynch Syndrome in
      Clinical Genetic Services (CGS) at National Cancer Centre Singapore (NCCS).

      Patients will be randomised 1:1 to telegenetics or in-person genetic counselling where 125
      patients will be seen using video conference while another 125 will be seen face-to-face. The
      randomisation will be stratified by suspected hereditary condition (HBOC/ Lynch) and age.

      Upon completion of the genetic consultation appointments, patients will be completing a
      series of questions evaluating cognitive and psychosocial outcomes through an internet-facing
      questionnaire.
