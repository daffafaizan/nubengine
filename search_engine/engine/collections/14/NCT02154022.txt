    
      Background:

        -  Pharmacology is the study of pharmaceutical compounds , and encompasses several
           parameters, including how the body handles the substance (pharmacokinetics, PK), what
           the substance does to the body at the molecular level (pharmacodynamics), overall
           efficacy (response), and any adverse events or toxicity encountered.

        -  The Clinical Pharmacology Program (CPP) within the Center for Cancer Research (CCR) of
           the National Cancer Institute (NCI) has sensitive, state of the art bioanalytical
           instrumentation that can accurately and precisely quantitate drug concentrations in
           plasma.

        -  Currently, the CPP can only analyze samples from clinical trials that have explicit
           instructions (within the Pharmacokinetics section) to do so in the IRB approved
           protocol.

        -  However, clinical trial protocols without a Pharmacokinetics section may still need
           occasional pharmacokinetic plasma samples drawn and drug concentration measurements
           performed to help explain unexpected AEs or toxicity or anticipated altered
           pharmacokinetics.

      Objectives:

      - To obtain PK plasma samples from patients being treated with an investigational agent or
      FDA approved therapy at the NIH who are exhibiting or are anticipated to exhibit unusual
      response or toxicity that is believed to be due to high drug concentration in order to assess
      the cause of the toxicity and adverse events..

      Eligibility:

      - Any cancer patients who are currently enrolled in IRB approved NIH Intramural Research
      Program (IRP) clinical trials are eligible.

      Design:

        -  The CPP will measure the drug plasma concentration (or send the sample out to a third
           party if the assay is commercially available).

        -  The accrual ceiling for this study is 100 patients. The anticipated accrual rate for
           this protocol is less than 10 patients per year, and based on the accrual ceiling, the
           duration of accrual and the total study duration is 10 years.
