      families, and has been attributed to numerous genetic factors. One principal explanation came
      with the discovery that renal cyst lining cells from ADPKD patients undergo secondary somatic
      mutations, selective loss of the second copy of a respective normal polycystic kidney disease
      (PKD) gene. These somatic mutations can occur in either polycystic kidney disease 1 (PKD1) or
      polycystic kidney disease 2 (PKD2). Furthermore, various cysts in the same patient have been
      reported to harbor different somatic mutations. These findings implicated a cellular
      recessive mechanism for cyst formation in ADPKD, suggesting the possibility that the observed
      intra-familial variation in disease phenotype may, at least in part, be explained by
      variation in mutation type, the timing and number of somatic "second-hit" mutations in
      individual family members affected with the disease. However, there is currently very little
      known about the cellular genetic mechanism leading to cysts development and very few studies,
      addressing this issue.
