      of Type 1 Diabetes (T1DM) and may correlate with increased expression of interferon alpha.

      Both genetic and environmental factors contribute to risk of development of T1DM. There are a
      number of conflicting reports associating viral infections and T1DM in genetically
      susceptible individuals and causality has not been proven. Viruses may not have a large role
      in the initiation of islet cell autoimmunity but more of a role in acceleration of the
      disease leading to overt symptoms. There are no studies describing viral responsive gene
      expression in these individuals.
