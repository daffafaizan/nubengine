    
      The current study is a randomized controlled trial with a parallel-group design. A total of
      231 patients will be enrolled in the trial. Participants will be randomized to one of three
      arms: 1) Basic carbohydrate counting (BCC), 2) Advanced carbohydrate counting with an
      automated bolus calculator (ABC-ACC), or 3) Standard dietary care.

      The primary objective is to evaluate the six months effects of education in the BCC concept
      and the ABC-ACC concept compared to standard dietary care on glycaemic control as assessed by
      HbA1c or MAGE (mean amplitude of glycaemic excursions).
