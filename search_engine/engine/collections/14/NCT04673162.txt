    
      Patients recently hospitalized for the treatment of documented COVID-19 pneumonia who do not
      require invasive ventilation will be randomized (1:1) to receive current standard treatment,
      which may include desamethasone and oxygen, with methylprenisolone 1gr daily iv for 3
      consecutive days or standard treatment alone.

      Efficacy measures will be time to recovery (discharge from hospital), invasive ventilation
      prevention and survival.

      Patients safety will be evaluated throughout the all study period.
