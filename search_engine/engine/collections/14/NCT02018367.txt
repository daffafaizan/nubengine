    
      Primary outcomes:

        -  the diagnostic yield (defined as the proportion of mucosal biopsy samples with
           neoplasia) of HRME with directed biopsy

           - compared to standard white-light endoscopy with 4-quadrant random biopsy (WL) for the
           diagnosis of BE-associated neoplasia in flat mucosa as well as mucosal lesions

        -  the clinical impact of HRME on the diagnosis and endoscopic surveillance of BE-
           associated neoplasia

             -  does HRME alter the decision to obtain a mucosal biopsy or perform endoscopic
                mucosal resection (EMR)

             -  the total number of total mucosal biopsies taken per procedure; does HRME alter the
                number of biopsies necessary?

      Secondary outcomes:

        -  sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of
           HRME for the in-vivo diagnosis of neoplasia in a routine surveillance population of
           patients with BE (using histopathologic diagnosis of mucosal biopsies as the reference
           standard)

        -  the total procedure time for imaging and mucosal biopsy acquisition of HRME - compared
           with WL, stratified by length of BE (< 3 cm and > 3cm)
