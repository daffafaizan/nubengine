      of psychotic illness.

      Design: Randomised clinical trial. Setting: Copenhagen Hospital Corporation and Psychiatric
      Hospital Aarhus, Denmark Participants: 547 patients with first episode of schizophrenia
      spectrum disorder.

      Interventions: Integrated treatment and standard treatment. The integrated treatment lasted
      for two years and consisted of assertive community treatment with programmes for family
      involvement and social skills training. Standard treatment offered contact with a community
      mental health centre.

      Main outcome measures: Psychotic and negative symptoms (each scored from 0 to a maximum of 5)
      at one and two years' follow-up.

      Results: At one year's follow-up, psychotic symptoms changed favourably to a mean of 1.09
      (standard deviation 1.27) with an estimated mean difference between groups of -0.31 (95%
      confidence interval -0.55 to -0.07, P=0.02) in favour of integrated treatment. Negative
      symptoms changed favourably with a estimated difference between groups of -0.36 (-0.54 to
      -0.17, P<0.001) in favour of integrated treatment. At two years' follow-up the estimated mean
      difference between groups in psychotic symptoms was -0.32 (-0.58 to -0.06, P=0.02) and in
      negative symptoms was -0.45 (-0.67 to -0.22, P<0.001), both in favour of integrated
      treatment. Patients who received integrated treatment had significantly less comorbid
      substance misuse, better adherence to treatment, and more satisfaction with treatment.

      Conclusion: Integrated treatment improved clinical outcome and adherence to treatment. The
      improvement in clinical outcome was consistent at one year and two year follow-ups.
