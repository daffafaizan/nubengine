      patient is interested in participating the study, STOP-Bang and Epworth questionnaires will
      be implemented to determine the risk for OSA.If the patients are classified as high risk of
      having OSA, they are scheduled for an overnight sleep study at home. The patients with
      Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI)>15 from the sleep study will be randomized into two study groups:
      Perioperative CPAP group or control group (routine care). In the perioperative CPAP group,
      patients will be treated with auto-CPAP for 2-3 nights preoperatively and 5 nights
      postoperatively. All patients will undergo sleep study on the third postoperative night and
      be monitored by a pulse oximeter for 2-3 nights preoperatively and 5 nights postoperatively.
