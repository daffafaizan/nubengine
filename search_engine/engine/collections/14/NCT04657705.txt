      factors. One of them is the effective reduction of the myocardium with RF energy during the
      operation. The standardization of the parameters of RF will help to increase the success of
      the procedure.

      Hypothesis: Radiofrequency ablation of ventricular tachycardias with high power parameters
      has comparable safety and leads to greater efficacy (absence of ventricular tachycardias and
      all types of cardioverter-defibrillator therapies) in the long-term compared with ablation
      with standard parameters in patients with structural heart disease.

      Purpose: to evaluate the safety and the efficiency of ablation of ventricular tachycardia in
      patients with structural heart disease using high power RF energy.

      Tasks:

        1. To analyze the number of intraoperative complications in both groups

        2. To evaluate the number of recurrent ventricular tachycardias and the number of episodes
           of CDI therapy in the long-term follow-up period

        3. To estimate the time of onset of the first episode of VT and the overall burden of VT in
           the long-term follow-up period

        4. To compare the total time of surgery, fluoroscopy, the number and total time of RF
           exposure, as well as the ablation index in relation to the "acute" and separated
           efficiency of ablation in the study groups

        5. To estimate all-cause mortality in both groups

        6. The number of repeated ablation for recurrent VT

        7. The number of justified and unfounded CDI therapies

        8. To analyze the long-term burden of antiarrhythmic therapy
