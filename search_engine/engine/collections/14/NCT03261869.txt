      postoperative symptoms may occur such as edema, pain, limitations in mouth opening and
      dysfunction as a consequence of the wisdom tooth extraction surgery.

      Local cold application reduces the magnitude of postoperative symptoms. The physiological
      effects of cold application are as follows: vasoconstriction of blood vessels, blood flow to
      the region decreases, edema and inflammation decreases, slowdown in cell metabolism and a
      decrease in local oxygen demand due to the vasoconstriction effect of the cold. Cold therapy
      also induces muscle constriction which reduces muscle stress, pain and inflammation.
