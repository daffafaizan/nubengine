      of food on CHR-2797 PK following a single 120 mg dose. Approximately 18 normal, healthy male
      subjects will be enrolled with at least 12 subjects completing the study. Two 60 mg capsules
      will be administered for a 120 mg dose of CHR-2797 on Days 1 and 8 with a high-fat meal or in
      the fasted state according to the randomization schedule. Subjects will be confined at the
      clinical research unit (CRU) from the time of Period 1 Check-in until Clinic Discharge on Day
      3, and will return to the CRU on Day 7 for Period 2 Check-in and remain in the CRU until
      Study Completion (on Day 10 of Period 2). Blood samples for PK analysis will be collected
      through 48 hours post dose.
