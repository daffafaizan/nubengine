      scan prior to axillary node assessment. All patients will have a sentinel node biopsy if any
      sentinel nodes can be located. Patients with a positive sentinel node will have an axillary
      node dissection. The results of the PET will be compared to the reference standard of
      histologic examination of all excised (sentinel and non-sentinel) axillary lymph nodes which
      will be referred to as axillary node assessment. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and
      negative predictive values for PET-FDG will be determined.
