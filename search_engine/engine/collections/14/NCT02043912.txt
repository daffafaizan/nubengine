      The following aspects will be investigated:

        -  The medication profiles will be checked for drug interactions with risk of
           QT-prolongation.

        -  Clinical risk factors for developing QT-prolongation (gender, age, (history of)
           cardiovascular disease, comorbidity,...) and lab results will be collected.

        -  Safety measurements (e.g. ECG) will be documented.
