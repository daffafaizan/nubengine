      analyze circulating cell free fetal (ccff) nucleic acid from blood samples from pregnant
      women who have an increased risk indicator/s for fetal chromosomal aneuploidy and are
      undergoing invasive prenatal diagnosis by chorionic villus sampling (CVS) and/or genetic
      amniocentesis. The results of the ccff aneuploidy test will be compared to the chromosomal
      analysis obtained via CVS or genetic amniocentesis.
