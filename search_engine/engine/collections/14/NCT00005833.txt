      colorectal cancer who have been previously treated for advanced disease. II. Assess the time
      to treatment failure and survival of these patients with this treatment regimen. III.
      Determine the frequency and severity of toxicities of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral R115777 twice daily on days 1-21.
      Treatment continues every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients are followed every 6 months for 2 years and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study over 5-7 months.
