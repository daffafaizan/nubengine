      improve symptoms and quality of life in adolescents with functional nausea.

      The study has the following specific aims:

        1. To define adolescent functional nausea into subtypes based on clinical characterization
           and physiologic testing.

        2. Evaluating the efficacy of auricular neurostimulation via PENFS for functional nausea.
           Subjects will be randomized into two groups: 1) neurostimulation versus 2) sham. They
           will receive either an active or non-active (sham group) device for 5 days each week x 4
           weeks total. Those who do not improve will receive an additional 4 weeks of therapy with
           active stimulation.

        3. Investigate possible brain functional connectivity changes induced by auricular
           neurostimulation compared to patients with irritable bowel syndrome and healthy controls
