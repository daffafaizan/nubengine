      is a need for a sensitive and specific marker to detect ovarian insufficiency early in its
      course. FSH stimulates inhibin B production by the granulosa cells of the cohort of ovarian
      follicles; serum inhibin B in turn participates in the negative feedback loop regulating FSH
      secretion. This protocol is characterizing the normal FSH-stimulated serum inhibin B response
      to a single subcutaneous injection of 300 IU human recombinant FSH given on day 2 to 4 of the
      menstrual cycle. In preliminary analysis under this protocol we have demonstrated that
      FSH-stimulated serum inhibin B levels measured at 24 hours after injection is a more robust
      marker of functional ovarian age than ovarian follicle count by transvaginal ultrasound,
      basal serum Mullerian Inhibiting Substance (MIS) levels, or basal serum FSH levels. Multiple
      regression analysis has revealed that FSH-stimulated inhibin B, FSH-stimulated estradiol, and
      basal FSH contribute significantly to an ability to predict functional ovarian age (as
      approximated by chronological age). The resulting regression equation relating these three
      parameters with age has a correlation coefficient of 0.742 and a coefficient of determination
      of 0.551. The protocol is now evaluating the reproducibility of this test and the feasibility
      of generating normative data in young women between the ages of 18 and 25. The results of
      this study may define parameters that could lead to earlier diagnosis and treatment of
      premature ovarian insufficiency.
