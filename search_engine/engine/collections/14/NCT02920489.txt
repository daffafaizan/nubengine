      maternal anxiety and improve maternal satisfaction. A recent "Practice guidelines for
      obstetric anesthesia" suggests that neuraxial analgesia should be provided in the early stage
      of labor (cervical dilation < 5 cm) or, for some special patients, be provided on a
      individualized basis. Studies showed that, when compared with late administration, early
      administration of labor analgesia resulted in equivocal findings for spontaneous,
      instrumented, and cesarean delivery. The investigators hypothesize that neuraxial labor
      analgesia provided on an individualized basis will further improve analgesia quality and
      maternal satisfaction. The purpose of this randomized controlled trial is to investigate
      whether neuraxial labor analgesia administered on an individualized basis can improve
      analgesia quality and maternal satisfaction.
