        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of pyroxamide in patients with advanced
           malignancies.

        -  Define, qualitatively and quantitatively, the dose-limiting and non-dose-limiting toxic
           effects of this drug in these patients.

        -  Describe the pharmacologic behavior of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive pyroxamide IV continuously over 5-7 days. Courses repeat every 21 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of pyroxamide until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2
      of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed monthly for resolution of adverse events.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 32 patients will be accrued for this study.
