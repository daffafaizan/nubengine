      conception till one's second birthday is a critical period of cognitive and physical
      development. It is the most sensitive period where brain development is most receptive to
      positive nutrition. Any form of malnutrition, especially during this golden time frame, can
      lead to irreversible effects to growth, health, education and future career attainment to our
      potential leaders, which in turn can be a barrier to human development.

      The CoVID outbreak is a unique period in recent human history where drastic public health
      measures such as MCO for an extended period of time has to be implemented nation-wide. These
      measures have untold severe consequences on the food security of the vulnerable urban group,
      in particular the young children whose brains require diverse micronutrients to support the
      rapid growth. These micronutrients can only be obtained from a daily diet that is equally
      diverse, especially from fresh vegetables and fruits which will be short in supplies. These
      perishable food items are not usually included in food aids, thus the child may have to
      subsist on staple-rich diet which are energy-dense but nutrient-poor. These dietary practices
      are associated with negative health outcomes. Thus by monitoring dietary diversity of the
      children, we hope to better inform food aid organisations to consider the inclusion of
      healthier food options to prevent micronutrient deficiencies.
