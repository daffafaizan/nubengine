    
      This is a double-blind, active-controlled, double-dummy, multi-center, randomized trial in
      subjects with symptomatic AF of 3 to 48 hours duration.

      Subjects will be randomized to receive vernakalant injection or amiodarone injection in a 1:1
      ratio.

      Safety will be assessed through the monitoring of adverse events, vital signs, continuous
      telemetry monitoring, 12-lead Holter monitoring, 12-lead ECGs, and laboratory tests.

      At 2 hours after the start of infusion, electrical cardioversion may be performed or rate
      control medication may be administered. Class I and Class III antiarrhythmics are not to be
      administered for 24 hours after the start of infusion.

      Subjects are to remain in the clinic for at least 6 hours after the start of infusion.
      Subjects will attend a follow-up visit at 7 (±2) days after treatment and will receive a
      follow-up telephone call at 30 (±3) days for assessment of serious adverse events,
      concomitant medications related to serious adverse events, and recurrence of AF.

      All roles were blinded with the exception of each site's designated unblinded personnel who
      were responsible for randomization and preparation, dispensation and accountability of the
      study medication.

      Expanded Access was not available through this protocol.
