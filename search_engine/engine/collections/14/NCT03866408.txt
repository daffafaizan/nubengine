           lipolysis (as measured by IC50) is related to the above mentioned lipolysis proteins in
           groups of volunteers known to vary widely with regards to abdominal adipocyte size and
           regulation of adipose tissue lipolysis.

        2. The investigators will determine whether the improved insulin regulation of lipolysis
           resulting from treatment with the PPARγ agonist pioglitazone, with or without weight
           loss, can be linked to specific changes in sets of PPARγ-responsive adipocyte lipolysis
           proteins in UBO adults.
