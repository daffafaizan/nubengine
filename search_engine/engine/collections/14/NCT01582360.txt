    
      The main purpose of the study is to examine if changes in pharmacokinetics of important
      antiinfectives in Critically Ill patients in need of continuous renal replacement therapy
      (CRRT), causes inadequate concentrations in plasma.

      The effect of different modus of CRRT: CVVH and CVVHD will be compared, as well as type of
      filter, filter lifetime etc.

      Hypothesis: The risk of incorrect dosage of antiinfectives - to low/ to high- is increased in
      critically ill patients receiving CRRT. Inadequate plasma concentrations of antiinfectives
      may contribute to increased mortality in this group.

      The antiinfectives to be examined are meropenem, fluconazol, cefotaxim, ciprofloxacin,
      tazobactam-piperacillin, vancomycin,penicillin,cloxacillin.

      Endpoints:

        1. Measured plasma concentrations of antiinfectives are sufficient for maximal microbial
           killing.

        2. To identify the most important variability factors for plasma concentrations of
           antiinfectives in patients receiving CRRT

        3. Establish and validate a routine for measurement of vital antiinfectives.
