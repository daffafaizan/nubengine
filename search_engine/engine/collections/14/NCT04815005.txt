    
      The HICC registry is an observational, multicenter, international registry collecting
      de-identified clinical and genetic information from patients with homozygous Familial
      Hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) worldwide.

      Patients are eligible to be enrolled in the registry based on the diagnosis of HoFH by the
      treating clinician, irrespective of how the diagnosis was made. To generate up-to-date data
      reflecting current rather than historic practice, patients who died or were lost to follow-up
      prior to 2010 are excluded.

      Anonymized data on demographics, type of HoFH diagnosis (clinical and/or based on the results
      of a genetic test), genetic results, (cardiovascular) medical history, relevant family
      history, physical examination, laboratory measurements, lipid lowering treatment and
      cardiovascular imaging are collected for 3 different time points: at diagnosis, at enrolment
      and at time of best lipid profile (if this is different from time at enrolment). Data are
      collected using pre-definite electronic case report forms to ensure uniformity of data
      collected. Primary analysis will be cross-sectional (e.g. based on country of residence, age,
      etc)
