      Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Burkholderia cepacia, and Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM)
      that are a potential source of lung infection in CF patients. As omadacycline demonstrates
      antimicrobial activity against a number of pathogens in CF, the investigators hope to learn
      the optimal dose of omadacycline necessary to treat lung infections in patients with CF in
      the future. The study hypothesis is that omadacycline will exhibit good oral bioavailability
      in patients with CF.
