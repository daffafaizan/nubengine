      cancer (mCRC) resistant to standard drugs (fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, irinotecan,
      bevacizumab, and panitumumab or cetuximab in case of RAS wild-type tumors). This treatment
      has a marketing authorization.

      Neutropenia is a classic complication of cytotoxic treatments. Febrile neutropenia are
      associated with a mortality rate of 9.5% and a hospitalization of 6 days in median. Recent
      meta-analyses have reported that the use of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (GCSF)
      allows to maintain the dose-intensity of cytotoxic treatment and was associated with a better
      overall survival (OS).

      There is currently no clear recommendation for the use of G-CSF with trifluridine/tipiracil.

      Unpublished analyses that various clinical parameters may be associated with the risk of
      neutropenia: age ≥ 65 years, female sex, level of leukocytes at baseline, and time of initial
      diagnostic to randomization ≥ 36 months.These data are too preliminary to allow proposing a
      G-CSF primary prophylaxis in a defined subgroup of patients. However, a secondary prophylaxis
      based on the administration of G-CSF seems efficient, with a prescription from day 14 to day
      18.

      The aim of this phase II study is to assess the efficacy of the secondary prophylaxis with
      G-CSF in case of first episode of grade 3-4 neutropenia in the aim to maintain the optimal
      dose intensity.
