    
      Transthoracic echocardiographic images are recorded in the available ultrasound units (Vivid
      7 and Vivid 9, GE Ultrasound, Horten, Norways and MyLab - Esaote, Genoa, Italy). The
      diameters and the wall thicknesses are measured according to the insurance of the American
      Society of Echocardiography. The images obtained with apical view and in format 4 bedrooms
      with frame rates (70-80 frames / s) - stored for three cardiac cycles in cine-loop format -
      will be used for evaluate off-line to evaluate left ventricle deformation in the longitudinal
      and radial direction, basalelateral, and top segments (post processing) through software
      already in use and available (Suitestenza, Esaote, Florence, Italy and GE Ultrasound, Horten,
      Norway).
