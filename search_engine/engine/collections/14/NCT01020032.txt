      recommendations of the scientific literature. The objective of the study is to evaluate this
      method on chronic painful patients presenting a lumbago, a fibromyalgia, an inflammatory or
      neurological pathology. During the hospitalization, the intervention group benefited from at
      least 2 daily sessions of music therapy between day 0 and day 10, and continued the
      musicotherapy at home until day 60. The evaluated criteria are pain, depression and anxiety
      and their evolution after 60 days of treatment (since the inclusion). The evaluation at day
      90 allows to test the persistence of the effect of the music therapy 90 days later.
