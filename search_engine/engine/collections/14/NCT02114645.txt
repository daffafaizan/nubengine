      in the luteal phase on the outcome of ART cycles stimulated with the long GnRH agonist and
      GnRH antagonist protocol. Decision between each of these two protocols was subjective and
      depended on the clinical context.In addition to routine luteal phase support with
      progesterone and estradiol valerate,women received two dose of GnRH agonist on the fifth and
      tenth day after ET.Live birth rate was the primary outcome measure.
