      I. To evaluate the feasibility of patient recruitment, including time required to consent,
      enroll and retain the necessary number of participants.

      II. To determine the distribution of candidate primary patient-reported outcome measures,
      including time to resumption of sexual activity, global satisfaction with sex life, sexual
      function and anxiety in this particular population.

      III. To establish the prevalence of patient recall of the intervention to determine the most
      effective time at which to deliver the intervention.
