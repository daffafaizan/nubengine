      the ability to work and quality of life: pain, urination disorders, copulatory dysfunction.
      Professional societies recommend diagnosing and treating patients with chronic prostatitis on
      the basis of determination of belonging to classification categories proposed by the National
      Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases and the National Institutes of Health
      in the USA .

      According to the recommendations of European Association of Urologists, in chronic bacterial
      inflammation of the prostate and in nonbacterial (inflammatory syndrome of chronic pelvis
      pain), the performance of antibacterial therapy during four - six weeks is efficient. The
      first-line drugs are fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin) as along with good
      tolerance they easily penetrate into the zones of the prostate inflammation and are highly
      efficient in respect of prostatitis pathogens . Although the treatment with levofloxacin
      promotes more evident decrease in clinical symptoms and demonstrates better parameters of
      eradication of pathogen in comparison with ciprofloxacin administration, it is used less
      common, possibly due to insufficient awareness of physicians of its high efficacy in chronic
      prostatitis .
