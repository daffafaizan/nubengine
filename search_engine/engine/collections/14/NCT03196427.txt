      treat pediatric participants who have moderately to severely active UC or CD.

      This study will look at the long-term safety profile in participants who take vedolizumab IV.
      Participants will be randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) which will remain
      undisclosed to the participant and investigator during this double blind study (up to Week
      40) maintaining the dose at study entry and escalating the dose at disease worsening.

      The dosing regimen selected for the long-term study is intended to maintain clinical response
      at the lowest possible exposure.

      At the discretion of the investigator, participants receiving the low dose (150 or 100 mg) of
      vedolizumab IV may be escalated to the high dose (300 or 200 mg) if the participants
      demonstrate disease worsening at 2 consecutive visits (scheduled or unscheduled).

      Participants who experience continued disease worsening during the study despite being
      administered vedolizumab 300 or 200 mg every 8 weeks (Q8W) will be discontinued from the
      study.

      Study duration is expected to be up to 5 years, depending on the enrollment rate in the
      previous randomized double blind study (MLN0002-2003).
