      CXA-201 and metronidazole or comparator (meropenem). Subject participation will require a
      minimum commitment of 38 days and a maximum of 45 days. An End of Treatment (EOT) visit will
      occur within 24 hours following the last dose of study drug administration/drug
      discontinuation. A Test of Cure (TOC)/Safety visit will be conducted 26 to 30 days following
      the first dose of study drug administration. A Last Follow-up (LFU) visit will be conducted
      38 to 45 days after the first dose of study drug.
