      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of erlotinib in patients with solid tumors and
      hepatic or renal dysfunction.

      II. Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      hepatic or renal dysfunction (albumin less than 2.5 g/dL, direct bilirubin less than 1.0
      mg/dL, any AST, and creatinine normal vs direct bilirubin 1.0-7.0 mg/dL, any AST, and
      creatinine normal vs creatinine 2.5-5.0 mg/dL, albumin 2.5 g/dL or greater, AST less than 3
      times upper limit of normal, and direct bilirubin less than 1.0 mg/dL).

      Patients receive oral erlotinib once daily. Treatment continues in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of erlotinib until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2
      of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, at
      least 6 evaluable patients are treated at that dose.
