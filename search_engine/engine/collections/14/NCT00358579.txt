      Historically intravenous adrenaline has been the recommended drug of choice since 1906. There
      have been few formal evaluations to determine the value of adrenaline for cardiac arrest, and
      clinical trials have not been able to show any benefit with intravenous adrenaline (compared
      to placebo or no treatment) in the field.

      More recently, vasopressin has been used in patients with cardiac arrest. In human studies on
      vasopressin, clinical trials have produced conflicting results.

      The current study compared vasopressin and adrenaline in the treatment of cardiac arrest in
      patients presenting to the Emergency Department (ED). Specific outcomes included return of
      spontaneous circulation (ROSC) (as measured by the presence of a palpable pulse at any time
      during resuscitation), survival to hospital admission, survival to discharge from hospital,
      and functional status at discharge and at one year (as measured by the Glasgow-Pittsburgh
      outcome categories).
