      investigate the efficacy and safety in the treatment of anemia caused by antibody-mediated
      pure red cell aplasia in participants with chronic kidney disease.

      The study enrolled 22 patients. All the participants enrolled into the study received:

      â€¢ Peginesatide 0.5 mg/kg subcutaneous (SC) injection

      The participants received a starting dose of 0.05 mg/kg (every 4 weeks) followed by 0.1 mg/kg
      dose, based on the assessment of the dose response in the initial group of 5 participants.
      The frequency of each injection and the dose adjusted based on the participant's hemoglobin
      response and the ability to maintain a hemoglobin level in the range of 10.0-12.0 g/dL.

      This multi-center trial was conducted in Europe. The overall time to participate in this
      study was 10 years and 7 months approximately. Participants made multiple visits to the
      clinic until the projected end of treatment period, which was 31-Oct-2016.
