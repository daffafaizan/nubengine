      trial participants to help facilitate early detection of a second wave of SARS-CoV-2
      infections. Specifically, this study aims to determine ; to assess the duration of immunity
      by assessing the number and speed at which trial participants were infected and cleared the
      virus with or without symptoms; and to determine the length of symptom onset in those with an
      active infection; levels of IgG antibodies by demographics (sex, age, ethnicity, and
      intensity of symptoms). Longitudinal assessment of antibody levels will additionally allow
      for assessment of the efficacy of any vaccines adminstered. This study also seeks to explore
      how many people are asymptomatic carriers. In addition, this study aims to help facilitate
      the development a quantitative laboratory reference test for antibodies (IgG).

      By using multiple different tests, it can be determined if a person is currently infected
      with SARS-CoV-2 or whether they previously have been infected. This allows for the scanning
      of people with asymptomatic carriage of the virus, which is important to help reduce the
      spread of SARS-CoV-2 through contact with people unaware of infection.

      Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) testing is routinely used to check for active SARS-CoV-2
      infections. It measures whether viral RNA is present in an individual's system. All in-house
      PCR tests are verified by an independent laboratory to check for false positives.

      Using a membrane-based immunoassay to detect IgG and IgM antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in whole
      blood, serum or plasma specimens helps to assess whether an individual has previously had the
      virus and is potentially immune. IgG and IgM detection components are separate allowing for
      differential detection of each antibody.

      To this date, 20904 PCR tests and 6848 antibody tests have been carried out in 2328
      individuals, providing some interim data. Of the 20904 PCR tests, 17635 (84%) were negative
      and 132 (1%) were negative. Of the 6848 antibody tests, 706 (10%) were positive for IgG only,
      64 (1%) were positive for IgM only, and 351 (5%) were positive for both IgG and IgM. 5710
      (83%) tests were negative.

      Of those individuals with a positive PCR test, 53% reported fever during the previous two
      months and 75% reported a loss of taste during the previous two months.
