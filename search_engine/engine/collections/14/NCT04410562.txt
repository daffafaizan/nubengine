    
      This is a randomized, double blinded, placebo-controlled multicenter clinical trial including
      714 pregnant women (200 SARS-CoV-2 infected -100 symptomatic with mild disease and 100
      asymptomatic- pregnant women and 514 SARS-CoV-2 uninfected pregnant women who are contacts
      with a SARS-CoV-2 case) with the main objectives of assessing the safety and efficacy of oral
      hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in reducing maternal viral shedding by PCR, and preventing incident
      SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease severity. Pregnant women undergoing antenatal follow up at
      five maternity hospitals, presenting at least one sign and/or one mild suggestive symptoms
      and a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test, or who are contacts of a suspected or confirmed case,
      will be recruited and randomized 1:1 to receive HCQ orally (400 mg/day for 3 days, followed
      by 200 mg/day for 11 days) or placebo. Women will be followed up for the duration of the
      intervention. One week after intervention completion, a SARS-CoV-2 PCR test will be repeated.
      At delivery, the pregnancy outcome will be registered, and a cord blood sample will be
      collected to measure for IgG and IgM of SARS-CoV-2. A neonatal nasopharyngeal aspirate will
      be collected to perform PCR SARS-CoV-2 testing.
