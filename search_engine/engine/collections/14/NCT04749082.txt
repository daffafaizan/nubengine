      and adjacent vertebrae. The estimated incidence of spondylodiscitis, ranging from 0.2 to 10
      per 100,000 inhabitants per year, has increased in recent years, which is likely associated
      with an aging population, higher prevalence of chronic disease, and more effective diagnostic
      techniques. Spondylodiscitis is a life-threatening disease with a mortality rate of 2-20%
      that is often associated with potential complications, such as paraspinal abscess, epidural
      abscess, meningitis, spinal instability, and neurologic deficiency. The relapse rates were
      reported to be as high as 32% in the literature. The aims of this study are to evaluate
      improvements, complications, recurrence and reoperation rates in Assiut university hospitals.
