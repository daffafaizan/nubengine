    
      All patients with a distal radius fracture treated by surgery (palmar angle stable plate)
      will be included in this study and randomised into two groups according the CONSORT
      Guidelines of Prospective Randomised Trails. One group ("early mobilisation") receive a
      removable plastic cast for one week and are allowed to move the wrist directly postoperative.

      The other group ("control group") received a non removable cast for 5 weeks. Both groups
      underwent physiotherapy two times a week. The control group was only allowed to move the
      closed-by joints.

      In the 6., 9., 12. postoperative week, a half and one year after the operation the patients
      underwent range of motion (ROM), grip strength measurement and pain according to the visual
      analogue scale (VAS). Hand function will be analysed according the PRWE (Patient-Rated Wrist
      Evaluation) Score, DASH (Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand) Score and Mayo Wrist
      Score.
