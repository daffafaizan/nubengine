      ventilation results in patients with acute lung injury (ALI) in a higher mortality. A
      positive endexpiratory pressure (PEEP) is applied with the intention to avoid these cyclic
      opening and closing of alveoli. The distribution of ventilation in patients with ALI is
      extremely inhomogeneous, consequently there are different regional opening pressures needed
      to open up the alveoli and avoid closing. Finding the best level of PEEP in patients with
      injured lungs to avoid atelectasis and alveolar strain induced by inadequately high or low
      PEEP levels is a challenge.

      The purpose of this study is to develop a protocol for measuring regional opening and closing
      pressures using the method of electrical impedance tomography in lung healthy and ALI
      patients. A ventilator setting guided by regional opening and closing pressures might help
      reducing the impairment of the lung by artificial ventilation.
