      in patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic or biliary adenocarcinoma treated
      with gemcitabine, leucovorin calcium, and fluorouracil. II. Determine the tolerance of this
      regimen in this patient population. III. Determine the survival without disease progression
      in patients treated with this regimen. IV. Determine the overall survival in patients treated
      with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours
      followed by fluorouracil IV over 24 hours on day 1 followed by gemcitabine IV over 80-150
      minutes on day 2. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for a minimum of 6 courses in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving complete response may
      continue chemotherapy for up to 1 year. Patients with locally advanced disease after 3 months
      of chemotherapy may receive concurrent radiotherapy with chemotherapy for 5 weeks, or may
      undergo surgical resection. Fluorouracil-based chemotherapy (with or without radiotherapy)
      may then resume after surgery. Patients are followed for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-39 patients will be accrued for this study.
