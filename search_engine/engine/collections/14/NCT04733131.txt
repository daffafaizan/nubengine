      Administration (FDA) in 2011 for the prophylaxis of graft rejection in adult kidney
      transplant recipients. This treatment is indicated as an alternative to Calcineurin
      Inhibitors (CNIs) for prophylaxis of graft rejection in de novo renal transplant recipients.
      Major studies evaluating belatacept showed that de novo kidney transplant patients treated
      with belatacept presented an improved renal function with a higher average estimated
      glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) compared to ciclosporin (CsA) regimen in patients.
      Conversion to belatacept after transplant seems to be safe even in highly sensitized
      patients. However, long term efficacy and safety outcomes of a kidney transplant population
      converted to a belatacept regimen after transplant and compared to a matched control group
      under a CNIs regimen have not been yet reported.

      A multicenter cohort of kidney transplant patients, will be use to match patients converted
      to a belatacept immunosuppressive regimen to a control group under CNIs immunosuppressive
      regimen.
