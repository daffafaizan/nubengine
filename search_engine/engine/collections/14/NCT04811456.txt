      collection was initiated under the National Consultant of Pediatrics auspices. Anonymized
      patient data from pediatric hospitals from all over the country are extracted from electronic
      and paper records and collected through online form developed for that purpose. Before the
      surveillance was launched, reporting clinicians underwent an online training, which included
      the current state of knowledge about multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C).
      Patient management is at the discretion of the relevant treating clinicians.

      KD and aKD were defined following the American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines.

      TSS was established based on modified criteria by the Centers for Disease Control and
      Prevention.

      MAS was diagnosed based on the Paediatric Rheumatology International Trials Organization
      (PRINTO) criteria for MAS classification.

      The definition of the inflammatory syndrome was based on the WHO MIS-C definition with the
      exclusion of SARS-CoV-2 confirmation.

      For patients who met the inclusion criteria, demographic data, past medical history, data on
      COVID-19 exposure, clinical symptoms, physical examination findings, laboratory, imaging, and
      cardiologic tests results, treatment, and outcome data are collected.

      All study definitions are defined in accordance to relevant guidelines and evaluated
      automatically with the use of a dedicated software.
