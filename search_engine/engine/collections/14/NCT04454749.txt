      day of final oocyte maturation in stimulated cycles with fresh embryo transfer or on the day
      of progesterone administration in FET cycles.

      Progesterone is essential for the secretory transformation and compaction of the endometrium,
      prior to implantation. A recently published paper (Haas et al., 2019) however, evaluated the
      degree of endometrial compaction under the influence of progesterone in FET cycles and
      described, that a lack of certain endometrial compaction has a negative impact on the ongoing
      pregnancy rate. As in this study embryos of unknown ploidy status were transferred, the role
      of embryo ploidy on the outcome may bias the study results.

      In the herein presented study protocol we aim to investigate the influence of endometrial
      compaction in FET cycles in which euploid embryos are transferred.

      HYPOTHESIS: Lack of endometrial compaction after the start of progesterone leads to an
      impaired reproductive outcome.
