      injuries and recovery of the hand. Some of the most used Questionnaires, unfortunately, are
      not available in Italian. This poses a problem when evaluating Italian speaking patients. Our
      aim is to develop a culturally adapted Italian version of the Michigan Hand Questionnaire.
      There is no risk involved for the patients, as the task of the recruited patients is to
      answer a survey (online and in clinics).
