      on acceptable mood stabilization. They may or may not be on antidepressants at the time of
      screening but subjects on antidepressants would be taken off them before completing the
      screening phase. Those patients who have a depression of at least moderate severity without
      significant symptoms of activation or mania will be started on a course of open label TMS
      treatment of up to 35 sessions. Safety and efficacy assessments will be done weekly. Patients
      will complete a course of treatment when they meet remission criteria (MADRS score < 10) or
      at the end of 30 treatments, whichever comes first. Patient who are still judged to be
      improving between treatment 25 and treatment 30 will be eligible to complete up to five
      addition treatments as the discretion of each site's principal investigator. Patients who
      meet response criteria (MADRS score decreases by at least 50%) will complete the full course
      of 30 to 35 TMS sessions. Patients will be withdrawn for safety concerns, particularly the
      onset of activation suggestive of mania or a mixed state.

      Patients who meet response or remission criteria will be followed monthly for up to six
      months to evaluate the durability of response. They will be on standard mood stabilizing
      medications and psychotherapy per their clinician's discretion.
