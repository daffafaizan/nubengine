      Kids ostomy device works, and how safe it is. This device has already been studied and
      approved to be used in the United States. It has a European CE-mark, which means it has met
      European health and safety requirements. SenSura速 Mio Kids is a flat ostomy device that is
      made to be used for kids from 6 months up to 4 years of age.

      The reason for this study is to find out how well the new SenSura速 Mio Kids device works
      compared to the standard of care device. We can learn about this by asking people who have
      used it about how well it worked and how comfortable it was.

      The Investigator/study nurse will decide whether the subject would benefit from switching to
      SenSura速 Mio Kids and if so, the subject will be invited to take part in the study. The study
      design is observational. That means that the ostomy device, and the skin around the stoma,
      will be observed while receiving the stoma care they normally would. This study design will
      help the researchers see how well the device works when it is used in the usual way, and
      makes it easier for the people who are participating in the study.
