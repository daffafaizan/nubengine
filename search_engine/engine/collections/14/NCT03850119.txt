    
      In this monocentric, randomized, controlled, double-blinded prospective interventional study,
      twenty patients will be included. Each patient will be his/her own control.

      Patients undergoing DIEPflap breast reconstruction will be included in this study. During the
      surgery, the abdominal incision will be divided in two equal sides with the umbilicus as
      midline reference. The sides will be randomized in a treatment side and control side. The
      treatment side will receive intradermal nanofat injections after the subcutaneous and right
      before the intradermal sutures.

      The patient and investigators will be blinded for the treatment protocol. The effects on
      wound healing, adverse events, scar formation and pigmentation will be evaluated up to one
      year after the surgery.
