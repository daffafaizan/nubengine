    
      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Quantify T cells specific for tumor peptides (carcinoembryonic antigen and MUC1) from
           the peripheral blood of patients with colon cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

      Patients undergo blood collection at time of follow-up, surgery, thoracentesis, paracentesis,
      or leukapheresis (â‰¤ 5 times per year). Blood is analyzed for tumor peptides (carcinoembryonic
      antigen and MUC1), circulating cytokines, and lymphocyte response by ELISA, ELISPOT, or
      intracellular flow.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 140 patients will be accrued for this study.
