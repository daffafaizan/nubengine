      pl-vegf165 (Neovasculgen) in treating scleroderma-associated Raynaud's syndrome. Each patient
      of clinical group will undergo several intramuscular injections with a treatment dose of
      pl-vegf165 (Neovasculgen) in hand where digital ulcers locate. In the control group patients
      will receive only standard of care without gene therapy drug.

      Study participants at the first study visit will complete study questionnaires, their hands
      will be assessed clinically for digital ulceration, and their hands will undergo non-invasive
      capillaroscopy. After this initial assessment, the patients of clinical group will undergo
      intramuscular injections of pl-vegf165 (Neovasculgen) in a hand altered with digital ulcers.

      Patient will report the severity of their Raynaud's symptoms weekly over the six month study
      period. At three month post-injection, the patient will complete study questionnaires, their
      hands will be assessed clinically for digital ulceration, and their hands will undergo
      non-invasive capillaroscopy. At six months post-injection, the patient will again complete
      study questionnaires, their hands will be assessed clinically for digital ulceration, and
      their hands will undergo non-invasive capillaroscopy.
