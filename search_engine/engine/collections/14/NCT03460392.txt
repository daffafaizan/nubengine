      associated to the human organism. In particular, the present study aims to evaluate how the
      microbiota (intestinal, cutaneous, vaginal, nasal, bronchial, breast milk, salivary, oral,
      etc.) is subject to quantitative and qualitative changes consequently to different events
      involving the human host. The project trys to highlight which microorganisms may be involved
      in the onset or progression of certain pathological condition, as well as to identify which
      bacterial genera can be more subject to variations due to specific non-pathological events.

      Secondary objectives of this study are:

        -  To define a "healthy microbiome", that is to understand which are the main bacteria that
           commonly compose the human microbiome in physiological conditions, differentiating it
           from that present in certain pathological conditions.

        -  To characterize the physiological effects that bacterial changes of the human microbiota
           have on the host.

        -  To evaluate whether the use of probiotics, prebiotics, dietary and nutritional factors,
           cosmetics, and oral, nasal, vaginal, or pharmacological therapies of any kind can
           influence the microbial network of the human microbiota associated to different body
           districts.
