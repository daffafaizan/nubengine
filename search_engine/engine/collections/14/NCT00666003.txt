      function. In patients with renal failure, the ability to gauge adequacy of circulating blood
      volume based on urine output is obviously lacking. The FDA approved devices called
      Flotrac/Vigileo and Crit-Line are used in this setting to determine adequacy of fluid
      resuscitation. This study proposes to use the data collected in a retrospective manner to
      determine if correlation of the various measured parameters can serve as a predictor of
      hemodynamic status.
