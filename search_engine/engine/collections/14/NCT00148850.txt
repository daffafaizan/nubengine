      This complication can be stigmatizing in some affected patients and lead to reduced adherence
      to treatment, increased risk of cardiovascular complications and induce insulinoresistance.
      The pathophysiology of lipodystrophy remains poorly understood. Some antiretroviral drugs
      could be involved. Therefore, using PPAR G as a therapeutic target with the objective to
      reverse drug induced lipoatrophy appeared as a promising objective Thiazolidinediones are a
      new class of insulin sensitizing drugs for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. These PPARG
      agonist which mainly promote the differentiation of adipocytes, decrease circulating plasma
      free fatty acids. In non-HIV infected patients this class of drugs decreases intraabdominal
      fat accumulation and increases subcutaneous fat depot.

      Different previous studies were performed with that aim, most of them using rosiglitazone.

      We designed a prospective randomized, double blind placebo controlled multicentre study
      aiming to test the hypothesis that pioglitazone would improve lipoatrophy without deleterious
      effect on lipid profile in adult subjects receiving antiretroviral therapy.
