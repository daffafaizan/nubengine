    
      A randomized controlled trial that will be realized in six psychiatric institutions of
      Portugal. Pilot study will be carried out initially. The sample will be constituted by
      individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia (experimental group (n=30) and control group (n=30).
      The evaluation instruments will be utilized are PSYRATS, BCIS, PSP and WHODAS 2.0 applied to
      both groups in three different moments. In experimental group the eight MCT modules will be
      applied over four weeks.

      The objective is to compare the outcomes associated with "treatment-as-usual" and the
      benefits of implementing the Metacognitive Training for Schizophrenia.

      The hypothesis to be validated in this trial are:

        -  the schizophrenic patients who integrate the experimental group and participate in the
           MCT program will reduce the severity of psychotic symptoms and will present a better
           insight to disease and a better functioning on the final of the program than the control
           group;

        -  in participants that participating in the MCT program, the psychotic symptoms decrease
           at the end of the program and in the follow up (three months later) and the awareness
           for the disease and functioning improves.
