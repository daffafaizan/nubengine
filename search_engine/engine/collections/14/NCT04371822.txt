      Introduction:

      Pandemic Covid-19 pneumonia, of SARS-CoV-2 aetiology, presents an existential threat to
      health care systems globally. Multiple therapeutic and prophylactic agents are currently
      undergoing clinical trial, including 23 clinical trials of (hydroxy) chloroquine in China.
      While progress towards a curative agent or vaccine is promising, the principal limiting
      factor in public health emergency is time, and therefore Virus resistance to antiviral
      therapies is an increasing concern that makes the development of broad-spectrum antiviral
      drugs urgent. Targeting of the viral envelope, a component shared by a large number of
      viruses, emerges as a promising strategy to overcome this problem. Natural and synthetic
      porphyrins are good candidates for antiviral development due to their relative hydrophobicity
      and pro-oxidant character a pre-existing licensed therapeutic would offer reprieve to health
      care systems operating at the edge of capacity. In this brief communication, the Principal
      investigator argues that Covid-19 has high probability of being more than a disease of
      pneumonia, and that critical Covid-19 patients may be experiencing a form of acquired acute
      porphyria. Readily available interventions exist to treat acute porphyria and the position is
      advanced that urinalysis of critical Covid-19 patients would diagnose this pathology.

      COVID-19 binds to porphyrin and cause acquired porphyria.

      Erythrocytes are strongly implicated in the pathophysiology of Covid-19. Wuhan University
      researchers argue that the role of erythrocytes in the pathophysiology of Covid-19 is
      under-estimated; the co-efficient of variation of red blood cell distribution width (RDW) is
      predictive of severity of disease state (Gong 2020). Elevated RDW is correlated with reduced
      erythrocyte turnover; red blood cells become smaller as they age and the delay in clearance
      expands the low-volume tail of the volume distribution (Patel 2015). Suppressed erythrocyte
      turnover may indicate erythropoietic distress and function as a compensatory mechanism to
      maintain circulating red blood cell levels (Patel 2015).

      Excess porphyrins in red blood cells can precipitate cell lysis and development of hemolytic
      anaemia (Sassa 2006). Macaques infected with SARS-CoV- 2 also have decreased red blood cell
      numbers (Munster 2020) and susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 appears to be determined by blood
      group; blood group A is most affected whereas blood group O seems to be protected (Yang
      2020). This finding is concordant with previous studies showing that susceptibility to the
      2003 strain of SARS-CoV was determined by blood group (Guillon 2008). Preliminary evidence
      suggests that CD147, the determinant of the Ok blood group system, binds the spike protein of
      SARS-CoV-2 (Wang 2020). Incidentally, CD147 functions as an essential receptor for
      erythrocyte invasion by Plasmodium falciparum (Crosnier 2011). Blockade of CD147 abrogates
      the normal recirculation of erythrocytes, from the spleen into the general circulation,
      leading to selective trapping of red blood cells in the spleen as development of a form of
      anaemia (Coste 2001). Autopsy of deceased Covid-19 patients reveals that the spleen is
      significantly reduced in size. Reduction in spleen size would be expected in the event that
      the spleen has emptied its reserve of erythrocytes into the circulation as part of a normal
      physiological response to anaemia (Dale 2016).

      Primate models of Covid-19 (Munster 2020) and human Covid-19 patients have subnormal
      haemoglobin levels (Chen 2020). Clinical evaluation of almost 100 Wuhan patients reveals
      haemoglobin levels below the normal range in most patients as well as increased total
      bilirubin and elevated serum ferritin (Chen 2020). Hyperbilirubinemia is observed in acute
      porphyria (Sassa 2006) and would be consistent with ineffective erythropoiesis (Sulovska
      2016) and rapid haemoglobin turnover.

      COVID-19 and Porphyrin of haem:-

      Elevated serum ferritin levels are typical of acute porphyria (Trier 2013) and would be
      expected upon dissociation of iron from haem. A mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 might attack
      the 1beta chain of haemoglobin has been proposed; the product of open reading frame 8 (ORF8)
      binds to the porphyrin of haem and displaces iron, according to bioinformatics prediction
      analyses (Liu 2020).

      The oxygen-carrying capacity of erythrocytes would therefore be compromised by SARS-CoV-2,
      thereby exacerbating the difficulties already experienced by the patient, in terms of
      maintaining partial pressure of oxygen in the alveoli (PaO2). While the impact of SARS-CoV-2
      targeting of haemoglobin on oxygen content of the blood would therefore be considerable, the
      author proposes that perhaps of greater concern, are potential ramifications upon homeostatic
      regulation of haem anabolism. Haem biosynthesis is exquisitely controlled by seven
      enzyme-controlled reactions proceeding from the first intermediate, aminolevulinic acid
      (ALA), to haem as thefinal product. Haem negatively regulates the first step in the pathway
      by repressing expression of aminolevulinic acid synthase (ALAS).

      SARSCoV- 2 is predicted to directly interfere with haem production (Liu 2020), and this
      prediction is supported by empirical evidence of reduced haemoglobin levels in Covid-19
      patients (Chen 2020) and in animal models of the disease (Munster 2020). Decreased haem
      production dampens repression of ALAS, and thereby increases the production of haem
      precursors, leading to accumulation of porphyrin intermediate metabolites. All of the haem
      pathway intermediates are potentially toxic (Sassa 2006). During an attack of acute
      porphyria, ALAS is induced 2006) and this perturbation continues until sufficient haem
      synthesis is restored. Phenotype of SARS-CoV-2 porphyrin excess is hypothesised to mimic
      extreme lead poisoning; both as examples of acquired acute porphyria.

      Overproduction of haem precursors - aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and porphobilinogen (PBG), in
      particular - manifests life-threatening attacks (Pischik 2015) with neurovisceral symptoms
      (Sassa 2006), including: abdominal pain (85-95% cases), vomiting (43-88%), constipation
      (48-84%), muscle weakness (42-60%), mental symptoms (40-58%), pain of the limbs, head, neck
      and chest (50-52%), hypertension (36-54%), tachycardia (28-80%), convulsion (10-20%), sensory
      loss (9-38%), fever (9-37%), respiratory paralysis (5-12%) and diarrhoea (5-12%).
      Neurotoxicity of aminolevulinic acid accounts for the plethora of neurovisceral symptoms and,
      interestingly, there is considerable overlap between neurovisceral complaints of ALA excess
      and extra-pulmonary symptoms of critical Covid-19 patients. Extra-pulmonary symptoms of
      Covid-19 are significant but under-estimated, including gastrointestinal symptoms (Poggiali
      2020), which news reports suggest may affect in the region of 50% Covid-19 patients.
      Neurological problems also appear to be overlooked by the hyper-focus on respiratory symptoms
      (Zhao 2020). Of 214 Covid-19 patients, 36.4% experienced neurological manifestations
      including: headache, dizziness, acute cerebrovascular incidents and impaired consciousness
      (Mao 2020). Loss of autonomic control of breathing has also been reported and autonomic
      neuropathy is a clinical feature of acute porphyria (Laiwah 1985). Neuropsychiatric symptoms
      of Covid-19 may be downstream of irregularities in haem metabolism.

      The most important question is now asked by Principal investigator Can Sunlight stimulated
      porphyrins act against COVID-19 as like as Sn- protoporphyrin IX mechanism in impeding the
      entry and division of the virus(Zika, Chikungunya and other arbo viruses) by targeting the
      viral envelope and protect hemoglobin and blood components that are affected by the viral
      infection?

      The principal investigator expect the possibility of inhibiting Covid -19 by Sulfonated
      porphyrins X-ray induced visible luminescence of porphyrin and light-stimulated Sn-
      protoporphyrin IX because According to previous studies which showed that Covid -19 binds to
      the porphyrin of haem and displaces iron in addition to Sulfonated porphyrins and
      light-stimulated Sn- protoporphyrin IX have broad antiviral activity against more distinct
      types of viruses, Co-protoporphyrin IX and Sn-protoporphyrin IX inactivate Zika, Chikungunya
      and other arboviruses by targeting the viral envelope Porphyrins are amphipathic molecules
      able to interact with membranes and absorb light, being widely used in photodynamic therapy.
      Previously, we showed that heme, Co-protoporphyrin IX (CoPPIX) and Sn-protoporphyrin IX
      (SnPPIX) directly inactivate DENV and YFV infectious particles. Here we demonstrate that the
      antiviral activity of these porphyrins can be broadened to CHIKV, ZIKV, Mayaro virus, Sindb
      is virus and Vesicular Stomatitis virus. Porphyrin treatment causes viral envelope protein
      loss, affecting viral morphology, adsorption and entry into target cells (Neris 2018)

      The sulfonated tetranaphthyl porphyrin (TNapPS), sulfonated tetra-anthracenyl porphyrin
      (TAnthPS), and sulfonated 2,6-difluoro-meso-tetraphenylporphine [TPP(2,6-F2)S] and its copper
      chelate [TPP(2,6-F2)S,Cu], which reduced HIV infection by 99, 96, 94, and 96%, respectively
      (Andrei 2002)

      Treatment of HepG2 cells with heme, CoPPIX and SnPPIX after DENV infection reduced infectious
      particles without affecting viral RNA contents in infected cells. The reduction of viral load
      occurs only with the direct contact of DENV with porphyrins, suggesting a direct effect on
      viral particles. Previously incubation of DENV and YFV with heme, CoPPIX and SnPPIX resulted
      in viral particles inactivation in a dose-dependent manner. Biliverdin, a noncyclical
      porphyrin, was unable to inactivate the viruses tested. Infection of HepG2 cells with
      porphyrin-pretreated DENV2 results in a reduced or abolished viral protein synthesis, RNA
      replication and cell death. Treatment of HepG2 or THP-1 cell lineage with heme or CoPPIX
      after DENV infection with a very low MOI resulted in a decreased DENV replication and
      protection from death. (Assunção 2016)

      In summary, SARS-CoV-2 would not be the first known virus to alter porphyrin metabolism;
      hepatitis C virus (Hep C) and human immunodeficiency virus(HIV) infection lead to a non-acute
      form of porphyria (Blauvelt 1996). So the principal investigator expects and suggests that
      porphyrin based therapy is suitable and effective treatment against COVID-19 and could
      Protects hemoglobin and RBCs from dangerous influence of COVID-19 .The possibility of
      therapeutic application of porphyrins or their use as models to design new antiviral drugs
      against DENV ,COVID -19 and YFV.
