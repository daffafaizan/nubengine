      N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor located in the central nervous system. It has two stereoisomers
      : R +ketamine and S - ketamine, the latter being about two to four times more potent.
      S-ketamine also has the advantages of producing less psychotropic effects, less tiredness and
      a lower temporary cognitive impairment than the racemic mixture at equianalgesic doses. Being
      first used as an anesthetic, in the last twenty years, ketamine's indications expanded to
      other domains, such as treatment of depression or off label use for chronic pain relief.
      Chronic pain is a multidimensional syndrome that touches 17-44% of the population of western
      countries. Fibromyalgia is a cause of chronic pain, classified by the Internal Classification
      of Diseases (ICD) as a primary chronic pain with specific diagnostic criteria established by
      the American College of Rheumatology (ACR). No treatment to its complete cure is available at
      this time, all treatments having as purpose pain relief and an improvement of quality of life
      by combining pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments (as given by the European League
      Against Rheumatism (EULAR) guidelines). One of the mechanisms proposed in fibromyalgia is the
      central sensitisation phenomenon, by which the central nervous system becomes
      "hypersensitive" to nociceptive or non-nociceptive stimuli. The receptor involved in this
      phenomenon is the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor to which ketamine binds. Ketamine has
      therefore been proposed as a co-treatment in chronic pain with central sensitization
      phenomena, such as fibromyalgia.
