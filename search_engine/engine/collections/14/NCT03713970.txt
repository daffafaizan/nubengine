      optical properties that enhance patient satisfaction to dental restorations. several ceramic
      materials are currently available, including the lithium-reinforced glass ceramic like e.max
      press, which stands out for its excellent esthetic appearance and mechanical properties.also
      ZLS (zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate) are a function of its unique micro structure
      (500-700 nm in size, correspond exactly to the wavelength range of natural daylight). The
      presence of 10% zirconia in the glass phase in atomically dissolved form provides high
      strength and ensures safe and long-lasting restorations .The result is a large number of very
      fine-grained lithium silicate crystals, whose high glass content give the material its
      excellent light-optical and mechanical properties.

      Translucency, opalescence, fluorescence and the chameleon effect all benefit, with high edge
      stability and excellent polishability being an added plus.3 Despite the recent introduction
      of improved ceramic materials, patient satisfaction with restoration contour,symmetry,margins
      and shade matching natural teeth with ceramic restorations is still one of the major
      challenges in clinical practice. The determination and interpretation of natural tooth color
      involve the selection and reproduction of ceramic shade and choice of restorative material.
      These factors have had a major influence on the final color of restorative treatments.
      Color-measuring instruments assist in shade analysis, thus minimizing the subjective
      variables of this process. Color readings allow improved determination of the restoration
      shade and better communication with the dental laboratory.4The influences of underlying
      substrate,8-9 luting agent,ceramic thickness and translucency, and restoration type14 on the
      color variation of ceramic restorations have been investigated in in vitro studies. Thus, the
      purpose of this study was to evaluate clinical performance of celtra duo press ceramic and
      IPS e.max press ceramic laminate veneers including patient satisfaction, fracture, shad
      matching, marginal adaptation and sensitivity.
