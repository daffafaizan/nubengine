      responses before and after treatment. We use two methods to evaluate the efficacy of our
      treatments: questionnaires and interviews with a member of the Anxiety Disorders Clinic. As
      part of standard clinic procedure, each person in the program completes an in-person
      interview with a staff member who will determine your suitability for treatment. If you have
      received this questionnaire packet, it is likely that your concerns will be appropriately
      addressed in the Anxiety Disorders Clinic. The purpose of the questionnaire packet is to
      assess the severity of your panic disorder; its impact on your functioning, and factors that
      may contribute to the onset or maintenance of your panic (e.g., depression, anxiety
      sensitivity). We will ask you to complete this questionnaire again when you have completed
      your treatment along with a brief telephone interview with a staff member of the Anxiety
      Disorders Clinic.
