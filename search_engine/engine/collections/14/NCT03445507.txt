      helping patients quit smoking and so are included in usual care given by general
      practitioners and nurses. However, in the primary care setting, this sort of interventions
      are less common than they should be, due to many circunstances, and solutions must be found
      due to the huge dimensions of tobacco use challenge.

      On the other hand,new kinds of information tecnology give a chance to intervene with less
      costs and more specific tools. Actually, there are a lot of mobile apps and other devices
      designed to help people to improve their health in many ways, but without scientific evidence
      of their effects.

      This is a pragmatic, randomised, controled and multicentric clinical trial that tries to
      evaluate in general population the effectiveness of a chat bot that incorporates evidence
      based interventions and interacts by a text application instaled in patients mobile phone
      (intervention group).

      Investigators have decided to compare with usual care delivered by the usual general
      practisioners and nurses of Spanish Public Health Centres, because this interventions have
      shown their effectiveness (control group).

      Efficiency and impact on quality of life will also be compared on both groups.
