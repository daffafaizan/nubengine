      malignancy, and are also the leading cause of cancer related deaths worldwide. Early
      detection of premalignant lesions such as adenomatous polyps has decreased the risk of CRCs;
      however, cases which are initially undetected and progress to advanced CRC with distant
      metastasis are still unfortunately incurable. The development of CRC is a complex and
      heterogeneous process arising from an interaction between multiple etiological factors,
      including genetic factors and environmental factors such as diet and lifestyle. The
      challenges are to understand the molecular basis of individual susceptibility to colorectal
      cancer and to determine factors that initiate the development of the tumor, drive its
      progression, and determine its responsiveness or resistance to antitumor agents. Next
      generation sequencing(NGS)-driven genomic studies are already reporting novel features of
      cancer genomes beyond the traditional mutational categories. Recent advance in sequencing
      technology has enabled comprehensive profiling of genetic alterations in CRC.These methods
      are facilitating an increase in the efficiency and resolution of detection of each of the
      principal types of somatic cancer genome alterations, including nucleotide substitutions,
      small insertions and deletions, copy number alterations, chromosomal rearrangements,DNA
      methylation sequencing such as bisulfite-sequencing and microbial infections. Besides the
      microsatellite instability (MSI), some researchers reported novel mitochondrial mutations in
      the cancer genomes.NGS technology will help the investigators for understanding of entire CRC
      genomes and the obtained knowledge will lead to a better diagnosis and personalized targeted
      therapeutics for CRC management.Experimental design: The study design to attempt to identify
      the unique mutational spectrum and novel targets of genomic, epigenetic alterations in
      Egyptian colorectal cancer patients in Delta Regionusing Whole Exome and Epigenetic deep
      sequencing.Expected results:NGS-based genome analysis facilitates the identification of
      unrecognized gene mutation of Egyptian CRC cancer especially in Delta Region which may be
      biologically different from Western CRC as the environmental factors are
      different.Significance of the expected results:The results of this project will benefit in(1)
      Identification of novel features or mutation types in CRC genomes In Delta Region. (2)
      Understanding the advancement of pathway-level in colorectal carcinogenesis and (3) Identify
      Clinically relevant genetic and epigenetic biomarkers for noninvasive diagnosis and
      clinically actionable targets for personalized targeted medicine.
