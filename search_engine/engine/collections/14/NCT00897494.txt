        -  Identify specific proteins of interest to evaluate for their potential role as markers
           for pancreatic cancer.

        -  Analyze serum proteins directly by mass spectrometry to identify new biomarkers of
           pancreatic cancer that can be used for early diagnosis.

      OUTLINE: Blood from patients is collected prior to treatment. Plasma proteins are analyzed by
      matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/MS)
      and/or electrospray mass spectrometry (ESI/MS).

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 120 patients will be accrued for this study.
