      Progression free survival in patients with advanced or metastatic breast cancer receiving
      everolimus plus hormonal therapy beyond first progression.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        1. Clinical benefit rate (sum of stable disease, partial response, complete response).

        2. Response rate (partial response and complete response).

        3. Overall survival.

        4. Safety, side effects and tolerability profile of everolimus.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive everolimus orally (PO) daily and a hormone therapy regimen chosen at the
      discretion of the investigator (anastrozole PO daily; letrozole PO daily; tamoxifen citrate
      PO daily; fulvestrant intramuscularly [IM] or PO on days 1, 15, and 29, and then monthly;
      megestrol acetate PO 4 times daily [QID]; or other regimen). Treatment continues in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
