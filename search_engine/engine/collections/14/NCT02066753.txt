        -  Study 1 estimates the extend of myocardial damage resulting from the primary arrest and
           from the reperfusion injuries: Area under the curve of cTnT and CK-MB as 12 repeated
           measurements and NT-proBNP as 4 measurements post arrest

           -Hypothesis: There is a statistically significantly greater release of the cardiac
           biomarkers cTnT and NT-proBNP quantified by the area under the curve in the 24 versus
           the 48 hours group in the intervention period from 24 to 72 hours.

        -  Study 2 investigates MTH´s influence on systolic and diastolic function by standard and
           Tissue Doppler (TDI) echocardiography after 24, 48 and 72 hours. The primary endpoint is
           mitral annular systolic velocity ("S´ max")

           -Primary hypothesis: There is statistically significant improvement in S' max from the
           time T24 to T72 in the 48 versus the 24 hours group.

           -Secondary hypothesis: There is statistically significantly better systolic function at
           T48 measured in terms of individual S' max-change in the 48 hours group (still
           hypothermic) versus the 24 hours group (reached normothermia).

        -  Study 3 investigates MTH´s influence on the need for vasopressor or inotrope and the
           duration of arrhythmias during the first 72 hours post arrest.

             -  Primary hypothesis: There is a statistically significantly increased tendency of
                arrhythmias in the 48 versus the 24 hours group measured in the period from T0 to
                T72.

             -  Secondary hypothesis: There is a statistically significantly reduced need for
                inotropes in the 48 versus the 24 hours group measured by cumulative vasopressor
                index in the period from T0 to T72.
