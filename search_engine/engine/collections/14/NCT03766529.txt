      patients with ischaemic heart diseases. Considerable effort has been made to optimize
      cardioprotective strategy for improving cardiac performances after global myocardial
      ischemia. Of various strategies, terminal warm blood cardioplegia (TWBC) delivery has been
      proven to be effective in reducing risk of ischemic attack at the time of myocardial
      reperfusion. Based on TWBC strategy and Frank-Starling law of heart, the investigators
      proposed loop isolation-based uploading preconditioning to protect heart from
      ischemic-reperfusion damage (LiuPhD) as a novel myocardial protective strategy, which
      procedurally renders coronary loop via brief warm blood delivery independent of
      extracorporeal loop following TWBC delivery just before declamping. The investigators
      hypothesize that LiuPhD strategy allows myocardial cells complete depolarization and drives
      heart into zero-loading heat cycles, contributing to enhancing myocardial physiologic reserve
      and improving cardiac initiative capacity responding to upcoming loading increases after
      onset of clamp release. The aim of the present study was to determine whether LiuPhD strategy
      during on-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) can attenuate reperfusion injury after
      global myocardial ischemia.
