      for central neurological and neurodegenerative diseases. However, the metaboloic bases of CSF
      in diabetes patient have not been studied. In this plan, the investigators will use
      analytical platforms, including nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), liquid chromatography-mass
      spectrometry (LC-MS), to perform quantitative metabolomics on human CSF and blood samples and
      further establish the human CSF Metabolome Database of DM. This work will can supply
      important CSF metabolic profit information and help to facilitate a wide range of metabolomic
      studies on central nervous system diseases and their associations disease.
