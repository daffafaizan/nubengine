      sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) concentration versus 5.25% NaOCl concentration on post-operative
      pain and medication intake in adult patients with pulp necrosis in mandibular molars. Medical
      and dental history was obtained from all participants in this trial and clinical and
      radiographic evaluation for teeth was recorded. Participants with pulp necrosis with or
      without apical periodontitis were included. After access cavity preparation, participants
      were randomly assigned to one of the following groups: experimental group (irrigation using
      1.3% NaOCl) or control group (irrigation using 5.25% NaOCl ). Two-visit root canal treatment
      was performed with a week interval in between visits. Each patient received a 7-day diary to
      record postoperative pain and rescue medication intake. Post-operative pain was measured at
      the following time points: immediately , 3, 24, 48 hours and 7 days after the first visit and
      postobturation.
