      style approaches to determine the effects of MDMA on prefrontal and amygdala activation, and
      to explore the relationship between these MDMA-induced neural changes and the acute
      behavioral effects of the drug in patients with PTSD. In addition, the investigators will
      collect preliminary data on the MDMA effects on large-scale intrinsic functional connectivity
      using novel graph-based network analyses.

      Specifically, the investigators will measure medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and amygdala
      activation in response to negative stimuli in patients with PTSD. The investigators
      hypothesize that MDMA will increase mPFC, but decrease amygdala, activation in response to
      negative stimuli.

      The investigators will also explore the relationship between the MDMA-induced mPFC and
      amygdala activation, and performance on Ekman's Emotional Facial Expression task. This task
      is modulated by the mPFC and amygdala and as well as trauma severity in participants with
      PTSD. And finally, to explore the effects of MDMA on resting-state functional connectivity
      (rs-fcMRI) the investigators will use Coupled Intrinsic Connectivity Distribution
      (Coupled-ICD); an innovative, graph-based, fully data-driven approach that is particularly
      sensitive to paired rs-fcMRI data (e.g. pre/post-treatment).

      Adult participants with PTSD will be recruited for a double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      within-subjects, crossover-dose neuroimaging study in which they will initially receive
      either a single dose of MDMA 1.5mg/kg or a placebo (niacin 250mg), with a crossover dose to
      follow. Doses will be separated by 2 weeks.
