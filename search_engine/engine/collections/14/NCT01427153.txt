    
      The purpose of this study is to compare a commonly offered clinical approach of a series of
      intra-articular steroid injections to an orthopaedic manual physical therapy (OMPT) approach
      consisting of manually applied passive movement and reinforcing exercise for the treatment of
      osteoarthritis of the knee (knee OA). A second purpose is to validate a clinical prediction
      rule (CPR) for patients unlikely to respond to the orthopaedic manual physical therapy
      approach in a pre-planned secondary analysis of data from the randomized clinical trial.

      Aim 1: To see if there is a significant difference in pain and function lasting out to 1 year
      for patients that receive a clinical approach consisting of a series of intra-articular
      steroid injections compared to those that receive a clinical approach consisting of
      orthopaedic manual physical therapy.

      Aim 2: To validate a clinical prediction rule of characteristics identified in a previous
      preliminary study that predicted which patients with knee OA would be unlikely to respond to
      OMPT.
