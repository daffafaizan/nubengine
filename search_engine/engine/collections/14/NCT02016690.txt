      enroll participants in the study. Palivizumab was administered monthly throughout the
      Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) infection seasons via intramuscular injection at a dose of
      15 mg/kg of body weight. Survey forms were collected after the observation period. The number
      of adverse events and the frequency of hospitalizations due to RSV infections in surveyed
      participants were assessed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of palivizumab.
