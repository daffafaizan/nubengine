      increases survival as compared to gemcitabine but at a cost of increased toxicity. Irinotecan
      is responsible for much of the toxicity of FOLFIROX but may not contribute significantly to
      the regimen's activity. Abraxane is a new agent in pancreatic cancer. This albumin-bound
      nanoparticle form of paclitaxel increases tumor accumulation of paclitaxel though binding of
      albumin to SPARC in pancreatic cancer stroma. The investigators therefore propose a pilot
      study of FOLFOX (fluorouracil, leucovorin and oxaliplatin) combined with abraxane to
      establish the safety and preliminary activity of FOLFOX-A. Patients with inoperable
      (metastatic and locally advanced) pancreatic cancer will be eligible since the primary
      outcome is to establish the safety of FOLFOX-A.
