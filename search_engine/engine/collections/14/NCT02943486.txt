      patients with diabetic foot ulcer. The remaining 50% of patients have non-responding
      recoveries that leads to amputation of the compromised limbs. Currently, the administration
      of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in animal models or in small groups of patients with
      diabetic foot ulcer has shown to be safe and effective. Particularly, the use of these cells
      induce regeneration, both in the dermis and the epidermis. Nevertheless, MSC transplantation
      has some limitations, for instance, time restrictions in the availability of cells due to
      their isolation and expansion as well as the complex and costly large-scale production. In
      the same manner, the cryopreservation might cause deleterious effects that affect the
      biological activity of the cells and a medical professional should conduct the cell
      administration. In addition, different studies report variability in the results due to the
      inconsistency in the methods that they used (extraction protocols, cultivation, expansion and
      administration). The investigators' recent studies in mice with skin lesions, particularly
      type 1 diabetes, have shown that the presence of the cells is not necessary to promote skin
      regeneration and the administration of dac-MSCs is sufficient to stimulate would healing.
