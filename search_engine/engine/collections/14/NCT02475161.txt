    
      This is an open-label, single-center, fixed-sequence study designed to assess the effects of
      multiple oral administration of rabeprazole (a PPI) on the pharmacokinetics of a single oral
      dose of JNJ-42847922 in healthy participants. The study consists of 3 phases: a Screening
      Phase of approximately 4 weeks (Days -29 to -2); an Open Label Treatment Phase (Days -1 to
      7); and an End-of-Study Phase occurring from 7 to 14 days after the last dose of study drug.
      All participants will receive JNJ-42847922, orally on Day 1 (alone) and Day 6 (along with
      rabeprazole).Rabeprazole will be administered orally on Day 2 to Day 6. Pharmacokinetics will
      primarily be for JNJ-42847922, M12 metabolite and M16 metabolite. Participant's safety will
      be monitored throughout the study.
