      surgery in the study eye will be included. When a screened participant meets the inclusion
      and exclusion criteria to be enrolled in the study, the investigator will request a cornea
      from the central eye bank. The eye bank will then prepare and crosslink the corneal tissue
      with riboflavin (Vitamin B2) and ultraviolet A (UVA) light. This prepared corneal tissue will
      be used for the corneal transplant of the patients. Subjects will be followed up
      post-operatively by the site investigators with a follow-up period of 24 months and standard
      of care follow-up every six months for up to 3 years or until study closure. The
      investigators will monitor for systemic and ocular adverse events at all follow-up visits.
