        -  Compare the antitumor activity of antineoplaston A10 with methotrexate vs methotrexate
           alone, in terms of objective tumor response, in women with advanced breast cancer.

        -  Compare the adverse effects of and tolerance to these regimens in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive gradually escalating doses of oral antineoplaston A10 capsules 7
           times daily until the maximum tolerated dose is reached, followed by oral methotrexate
           capsules 2 to 3 times per day in five days on and five days off courses. Treatment
           continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral methotrexate alone on the same schedule as in arm I.

      Tumors are measured every 4 months for 2 years, every 6 months for years 3 and 4, and then
      annually for years 5 and 6.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30-70 patients will be accrued for this study within at least
      12 months.
