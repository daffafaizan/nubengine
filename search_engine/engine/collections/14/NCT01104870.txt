    
      Prospective, randomized, parallel group study with two periods: a 10 week, dose titration
      period, followed by a 2 week, dose maintenance period in patients with exercise-induced PH.

      The study population will be randomized into Dose Group 1, Dose Group 2, or an Individual
      Maximum Tolerated Dose (iMTD) of UT-15C SR by Week 10 and maintained through Week 12.
      Patients may be either currently receiving an approved oral background therapy for their PH
      (phosphodiesterase-5 [PDE-5] inhibitor, OR endothelin receptor antagonist [ERA]) (no dual
      background therapy), or not currently receiving therapy for PH.
