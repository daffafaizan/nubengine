      nucleus (STN-DBS) on motor function, quality of life and cognitive function in Parkinson's
      disease (PD) patients treated at Rikshospitalet University Hospital. The aim is to identify
      which factors that predict good treatment outcome, in order to improve patient selection of
      this generally highly effective, but specialized and expensive treatment.

      The study has several aims:

        1. Randomized double-blind evaluation of the impact of using single vs. multiple
           electrode-recordings to guide electrode placement.

        2. To identify factors predicting good effect on motor function and improvements of quality
           of life after deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus.

        3. To identify cognitive and psychiatric changes related to deep brain stimulation of the
           subthalamic nucleus

        4. To study social functioning of patients after STN-DBS and quality of life of patient
           caregivers
