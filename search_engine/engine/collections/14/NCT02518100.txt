    
      To assess the feasibility and usability of the total Vital Signs Patch (VSP) System in an
      actual hospital environment on in-patients by monitoring specified vital signs. The VSP
      System will be assessed for incorporation into the study site's Information Technology
      infrastructure. The VSP measurements will be compared with the predetermined expected results
      of the established vital signs equipment normally used by the facility based upon clinician
      protocols.

      The VSP System can take and monitor patient vital signs in a more reliable and consistent
      manner by removing the human variability that occurs when clinicians manually take a
      patient's vital signs. The VSP has been designed to automatically take and monitor the
      following vital signs:

        -  Arterial blood oxygen Saturation (SpO2)

        -  ECG (up to 3 - Lead)

        -  Heart Rate (Part of ECG)

        -  Surface Temperature

        -  Respiration
