      in the study. The sedation group (Group S, n=30), received 1 mg/kg ketamine and 1 mg/kg
      propofol as a bolus for induction. The patients then received an infusion of 100-150
      mcg/kg/min propofol and 0.25mg/kg/h of ketamine for maintenance. In the general anesthesia
      group (Group G, n=30), anesthesia was induced using 8% sevoflurane by inhalation with 50%
      nitrous oxide in oxygen; endotracheal intubation was facilitated without use of a
      neuromuscular blocker agent. Anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane (2%) and 50% nitrous
      oxide in oxygen. Our primary objective was to evaluate the need for post-operative mechanical
      ventilation.
