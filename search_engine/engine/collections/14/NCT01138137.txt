      PRIMARY:

      To determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and assess the toxicity of IV NAC in
      conjunction with IP cisplatin and IV/IP paclitaxel in subjects with stage 3 or 4 epithelial
      ovarian cancer that has been surgically debulked

      SECONDARY:

        -  To describe tumor response in subjects receiving treatment for previously debulked stage
           3 or 4 epithelial ovarian cancer with IP cisplatin, IV/IP paclitaxel , and IV NAC.

        -  To describe the incidence and severity of nephrotoxicity (Creatinine Clearance (CrCl))
           in subjects undergoing treatment for stage 3 or 4 epithelial ovarian cancer with IP
           cisplatin, IV paclitaxel and IV NAC and who have had their disease surgically debulked.

        -  To describe the incidence and severity of hearing loss in subjects undergoing treatment
           for stage 3 or 4 epithelial ovarian cancer with IP cisplatin, IV/IP paclitaxel and IV
           NAC and who have had their disease surgically debulked.

        -  To describe the incidence and severity of peripheral and autonomic neuropathy in
           subjects undergoing treatment for stage 3 or 4 epithelial ovarian cancer with IP
           cisplatin, IV/IP Taxol and IV NAC and who have had their disease surgically debulked.

      OUTLINE:

      Subjects will undergo chemotherapy for epithelial ovarian cancer with paclitaxel IV, 135
      mg/m2 (Day 1) and IP cisplatin 100 mg/m2 (Day2), followed by Taxol IP, 60 mg/m2 (Day 8) every
      3 weeks for 6 courses. Sixty minutes prior to each course of IP cisplatin, IV NAC (starting
      at 150 mg/kg) will be infused over 30 minutes. A dose escalation schema for NAC will be
      followed. Toxicity to the therapy will be graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria
      for Adverse Events.
