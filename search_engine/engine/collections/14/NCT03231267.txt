      or K. pneumoniae ESBL or carbapenemase (EPC) (Ec-ESBL / EPC or Kp-ESBL / EPC) and subsequent
      acquisition Of carrying Ec-BLSE / EPC or Kp-BLSE / EPC during their stay in intensive care.

      Collection of stools of the patients included at the admission then in a successive way. On
      the first stool, search for multiresistant bacteria. If positive research: search for
      bacteriophage directed against the strain of the patient bearing. Continued screening of
      stools from non-carriers at baseline.

      In patients defined as non-carriers at the end of the inclusions and collection, selection of
      8 stools for the detection of bacteriophages directed against all BMR strains which were
      isolated during the study period.
