    
      This study will be conducted in 2 phases.

      The first phase of the study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and the reactogenicity of
      escalating doses (10 µg, 25 µg, 50 µg, and 100 µg) of the ChulaCov19 messenger ribonucleic
      acid (mRNA) vaccine, administered IM according to a repeat vaccination schedule (given 21
      days apart) in healthy adults aged 18-55 years and in elderly adults aged 65-75 years, up to
      Day 50. For each dose, there will be 12 participants. There will be a total of 8 arms (4 arms
      for healthy adults aged 18-55 years and 4 arms for the elderlies). There will be a total of
      96 participants.

      The second phase of the study (if DSMB approves for the study to proceed to the next phase)
      will evaluate the immunogenicity measured as neutralising antibody titer (measured by
      MicroVNT [Micro-viral neutralising test]) following repeat vaccination of escalating doses of
      the ChulaCov19 mRNA vaccine, administered IM according to a repeat vaccination schedule
      (given 21 days apart) in healthy adults aged 18-55 years and in elderly adults aged 65-75
      years, at Day 29 (7 days after the second vaccination). Each treatment group will consist of
      participants randomly assigned to active treatment versus placebo in a ratio of 4:1 per dose
      cohort. The participants, the care providers, the PI(s), and the outcome assessors will be
      blinded to the treatment assignment of the participants. Two different doses will be
      evaluated in the healthy adults (total 4 arms, including placebo). Two different doses will
      be investigated in the elderlies (total 4 arms, including placebo). There will be a total of
      600 participants (120 participants per dose; 30 participants for placebo).
