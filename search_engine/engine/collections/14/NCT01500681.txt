    
      Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is an inflammatory disease of the central nervous system that is
      associated with autoantibodies to aquaporin-4. Treatment options for prevention of clinical
      relapses of NMO include immunosuppressive medications. Plasma exchange (PLEX) is commonly
      used as a rescue therapy for NMO relapses but ongoing, regular PLEX procedures (maintenance
      PLEX) is sometimes used to prevent relapses. This observational registry will record
      feasibility, tolerability, safety, and preliminary efficacy data regarding maintenance PLEX
      for participants with NMO, NMO spectrum disorders, and recurrent idiopathic longitudinally
      extensive transverse myelitis.
