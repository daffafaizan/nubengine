      receive 2 NRTIs plus either 141W94 or placebo. Enrollment of patients is sequential: patients
      13 to 18 years of age are enrolled first, followed by children < 13 when the appropriate
      pediatric dose has been determined. Patients who are unable to swallow capsules will be
      accrued when a liquid formulation becomes available.
