      as survival, functional capacity and symptom relief. Most patients with advanced cancer
      (>80%) expect their sensitive discussions with physicians about prognosis and treatment
      choices, in order to be involved in the decision making process. Nevertheless, this kind of
      discussion is frequently lacking. Consequently, patients often have a biased view of their
      own prognosis such as an underestimation of disease severity, or unrealistic expectations for
      cure.

      Patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) may be treated with systemic therapies
      which may prolong survival, but are not curative. Patients with advanced HCC often report
      expectations for survival and treatment-related side-effects that differ from their treating
      physician. Accordingly, communication on prognostic and treatment choices is essential to
      obtain an accurate understanding of the disease that allows patients to make informed
      decisions. To the best of our knowledge, a thorough evaluation of the physician-patient
      communication quality has never been performed in advanced HCC patients.

      The aim of our study, is to assess the perception of the expected prognosis, the treatment
      side-effects; by the patient and by his investigator during the first consultation before the
      initiation
