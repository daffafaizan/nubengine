      low back pain will enter the study. Each group will receive two different interventions, one
      consisting of visual feedback when performing 10 repetitions of low back flexion, extension
      and right and left side-flexion and another intervention consisting of the same low back
      movements without visual feedback. Participants will be assessed for pain intensity, pain
      location, disability, kinesiophobia, catastrophizing, perception of the low back, flexion
      range of motion and time to perform the sit to stand test both at baseline and after the
      intervention.
