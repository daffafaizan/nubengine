      from thoracic diseases, to achieve the best outcome in terms of physical, psychological,
      social and spiritual well beings. The care provided not only focuses on in-hospital
      treatments that patient received, but also encompasses the whole patient journey including
      lifestyle modification, health concept promotion, self-empowerment and secondary prevention.
      Preoperative prophylactic physiotherapy has been shown to be an important and effective
      approach in preventing or reducing postoperative complications, in addition to optimizing
      treatment by familiarizing the patient with the physiotherapeutic procedures. Quasi
      experimental research design was utilized to conduct this study.Sixty adult patients
      undergoing thoracoscopic surgery included and had the following criteria, the age ranged from
      18-65 years old, both male and female. The patients divided into two equal groups (study and
      control groups), 30 patients for each. The study group received educational nursing protocol
