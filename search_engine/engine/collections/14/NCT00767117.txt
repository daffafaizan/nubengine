    
      This is a Phase I, open-label, randomized (patients are assigned different treatments based
      on chance), 2-period, 2-way cross-over interaction trial to investigate the pharmacokinetic
      interaction (study of the bodily absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of
      drugs) between lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/rtv) and TMC125, both at steady-state.The trial
      population will consist of 16 healthy volunteers. In 2 consecutive sessions, healthy
      volunteers will receive Treatment A and Treatment B, in a randomized sequence. In Treatment
      A, 200 mg TMC125 b.i.d.will be administered for 7 days (from Day 1 to Day 7) with an
      additional morning dose on Day 8. In Treatment B, 400/100 mgLPV/rtv twice a day will be
      administered for 15 days (from Day 1 to Day15) with an additional morning dose on Day 16,
      while 200 mgTMC125 b.i.d. will be co-administered from Day 9 to Day 15 with an additional
      morning dose on Day 16. Subsequent sessions will be separated by a washout period of at least
      2 weeks. Full pharmacokinetic profiles of TMC125 will be determined over the 12-hour dosing
      interval after the morning intake on Day 8 of Treatment A and on Day 16 of Treatment B. Full
      pharmacokinetic profiles of LPV and ritonavir will be determined over the 12-hour dosing
      interval after the morning intake on Days 8 and 16 of Treatment B. All treatments will be
      administered under fed conditions and will be taken within 10 minutes after a meal. Safety
      and tolerability evaluations will be recorded continuously. Treatment A = 200 mg TMC125
      b.i.d. will be administered for 7 days (from Day 1 to Day 7) with an additional morning dose
      on Day 8. Treatment B = 400/100 mg LPV/rtv b.i.d. will be administered for 15 days (from Day
      1 to Day 15) with an additional morning dose on Day 16, while 200 mg TMC125 b.i.d. will be
      co-administered from Day 9 to Day 15 with an additional morning dose on Day 16.
