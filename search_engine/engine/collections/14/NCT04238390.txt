      beta-lactamases (ESBLs) or AmpC beta-lactamases. ESBL or AmpC producers are typically
      resistant to third generation cephalosporins such as ceftriaxone, but susceptible to
      carbapenems. In no study has the outcome of treatment for serious infections for ESBL
      producers been significantly surpassed by carbapenems. Despite the potential advantages of
      carbapenems for treatment of ceftriaxone non-susceptible organisms, widespread use of
      carbapenems may cause selection pressure leading to carbapenem-resistant organisms. This is a
      significant issue since carbapenem-resistant organisms are treated with last-line antibiotics
      such as colistin.

      Ceftolozane-tazobactam is a combination of a new beta-lactam antibiotic with an existing
      beta-lactamase inhibitor, tazobactam, and is active against ESBL and most AmpC producing
      organisms. In a large sample of ESBL- and AmpC-producing Enterobacterales isolates from
      urinary tract and intra-abdominal specimens, ceftolozane-tazobactam was susceptible in over
      80%. It has been FDA approved for complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI) and complicated
      intra-abdominal infections (cIAI), and more recently for hospital-acquired and
      ventilator-associated pneumonia (HAP/VAP). In addition, a pooled analysis of phase 3 clinical
      trials has shown favourable clinical cure rates with ceftolozane-tazobactam for cUTI and cIAI
      caused by ESBL-producing Enterobacterales. Given the issues of carbapenem resistant
      organisms, there is a need for establishing the efficacy of an alternative to carbapenems for
      serious infections.
