      (TCM), Epimedium, have potent estrogenic properties. The principal bioactive compounds in
      Epimedium are the prenylflavonoids, icaritin, and their glycosylated derivatives which can
      enhance osteoblastic differentiation and mineralization, inhibits bone resorption, and
      induces apoptosis of osteoclasts. Animal experiments indicate that icariin can prevent bone
      loss induced by ovariectomized (OVX) in rats, through its stimulatory effects on osteoblast
      growth and function, and inhibitory action on osteoclast cells.

      Epimedium has also demonstrated significant cardiovascular benefits with positive actions on
      vascular reactivity, endothelial function and thrombosis in human subjects. Notably, icariin,
      demonstrated a significant nitric oxide (NO)-dependent vasorelaxation of precontracted
      coronary arterial rings with intact endothelium in a concentration-dependent manner, via the
      activation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase protein and NO-cyclic guanidine monophosphate
      (cGMP) pathway. Epimedium prenylflavonoids (EP) can prevent steroid-associated osteonecrosis
      in rabbit model and notably, reduce thrombosis incidence and shrink fat-cell-size
      significantly. This striking combination of properties highlights the immense potential in EP
      for osteoporosis and cardiovascular health.
