      clinical study (work WP 1) will ensure the inclusion of up to 30 patients with verified sleep
      apnea that will be in need of either structural nasal surgery, pharyngeal surgery or
      orthognathic surgery. Studies of nasal airflow and pressure as well as a detailed ConeBeam CT
      scans of the upper airways will be performed before and after surgery.

      WP 2, 3 and 4 deals with the mathematical modeling, structural mechanic modeling and the
      patient-specific airflow modeling.
