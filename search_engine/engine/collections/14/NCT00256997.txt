    
      This is a Phase 4, an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention),
      multi-country and multi-centric (conducted in more than one center) study of risperidone
      long-acting formulation versus oral (having to do with the mouth) atypical antipsychotics in
      participants with a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition
      Text revision ( DSM-IV TR) diagnosis of schizophrenia currently being treated with oral
      antipsychotic medication. The duration of this study will be 2 years. All the eligible
      participants will be randomly assigned to an oral atypical antipsychotic (risperidone,
      olanzapine, quetiapine, and where commercially available, aripiprazole and amisulpride) or to
      risperidone long-acting formulation. For risperidone long-acting formulation participants,
      study medication will be administered by intramuscular (into the muscle) injection every 2
      weeks at doses of 25, 37.5 or 50 milligram (mg). Oral supplementation with the current oral
      atypical antipsychotic is required for the first 3 weeks following the initial injection and
      dose increase. Dose increase can be made as per product labeling. The primary measure of
      effectiveness is the reduction in the percentage of participants experiencing a clinical
      exacerbation after being in the study for 3 months. Participants' safety will be monitored
      throughout the study.
