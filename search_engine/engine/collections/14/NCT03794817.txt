    
      Recipients of deceased or living donor transplants with calculated percent reactive antibody
      (cPRA) of 50% or greater at University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) will be enrolled
      in the trial. Samples for Kidney Solid Organ Response Test (kSORT) will be obtained
      pre-transplant (and immunosuppression) and post-transplant (see Table 1). Urine will be
      obtained at the same true intervals including pre-transplant in patients who still produce
      urine to correlate with graft rejection, inflammation and kSORT. A piece (minimum 1/3 core)
      of the protocol or for cause biopsy tissue will be saved in Ribonucleic acids (RNA) later for
      gene expression analysis as a correlate of graft inflammation with the biopsy, kSORT and
      urine. In addition, samples will be when patients are undergoing cause kidney biopsy, prior
      to treatment intensification and procedure. Patient's who are treated for rejection, will
      have additional samples obtained 2-4 weeks after treatment of rejection and at the time of
      any followup biopsy for monitoring resolution of biopsy confirmed acute rejection.
