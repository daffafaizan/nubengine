      interventions') can have a significant impact on the health and quality of life of patients
      suffering from chronic conditions in general and chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients in
      specific. In the last decade, the use of electronic health (eHealth) technology in
      self-management interventions has become more and more popular. EHealth-based self-management
      interventions have been shown to improve health-related outcomes, such as blood pressure (BP)
      control and medication adherence, and found to be feasible and acceptable for CKD patients
      and care professionals. Hence, the use of eHealth self-management interventions for CKD
      patients has become increasingly popular. Knowledge of the implementation and effectivity of
      such interventions in China and other developing countries is, however, still lacking.
      Researchers from the Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC) developed 'Medical Dashboard',
      an eHealth intervention to help support and involve CKD patients in their disease
      self-management. We aim to tailor the evidence-based Dutch intervention 'Medical Dashboard'
      to the Chinese context and evaluate its implementation process and effectiveness.
