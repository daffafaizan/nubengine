      evaluate the efficacy and safety of a nasal, non-inhaled administration of carbon dioxide
      (CO2) in the treatment of mild headaches. An estimated 250 patients who meet the eligibility
      criteria will be enrolled into this study at approximately 15 sites to ensure that about 220
      patients are randomized and complete the study.
