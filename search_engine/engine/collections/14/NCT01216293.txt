      and resorption biomarkers. This study will evaluate the effect of dexlansoprazole on bone
      homeostasis by assessing changes in biochemical markers of bone formation and bone
      resorption. This study will also assess changes in bone mineral density by dual-energy x-ray
      absorptiometry scan and other markers of bone homeostasis.

      The study will consist of a 12-week screening period, a 26-week treatment period with a total
      of 5 visits during the treatment period and a follow-up visit at Week 52 for bone mineral
      density assessment.
