      mass. Resistance exercise guidelines generally suggest that those looking to increase muscle
      mass should train each muscle group once to twice per week. However, it has been proposed
      that it may be of greater benefit to train a muscle group with a higher frequency (i.e., four
      to six times per week) than currently suggested. If true, completing the same total volume of
      resistance exercise in more frequent, smaller bouts could prove to be a more beneficial
      strategy to optimally build or maintain muscle mass.

      Therefore, this study will investigate whether manipulating resistance exercise frequency
      impacts cumulative muscle protein synthesis rates in young individuals. Participants will
      undergo a 7 day period of habitual activity before completing the same total volume of
      resistance exercise as either; i) one isolated bout (low frequency) or ii) five smaller bouts
      (high frequency) over a period of 7 days.
