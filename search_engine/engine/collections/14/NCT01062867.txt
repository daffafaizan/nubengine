      intravenous anesthetic Trial Center Phase 1 Clinical Trials Unit Limited, 119 Looseleigh
      Lane, Derriford, Plymouth PL6 5HH Publication Studied Period The first subject was screened
      on 04/01/2000 and the final subject completed the follow up on 24/03/2000.

      Phase of Development Phase I (First into Man) Objectives To assess the safety, tolerability
      and efficacy of Org 25435 as an intravenous anesthetic and to obtain preliminary
      pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic details of Org 25435.

      Methodology Sequential rising dose study of an intravenous anesthetic in young healthy males,
      at up to eight dose levels.

      Number of Subjects 19 healthy male volunteers were included into the dose escalation part of
      the study and an additional 7 volunteers participated in the Target Controlled Infusion (TCI)
      part of the study.

      Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion Inclusion criteria:

      Good physical and mental health: absence of a clinically relevant medical history; Clinically
      acceptable hematology and clinical chemistry results; Hemoglobin > 13.5 g/dl; Normal ECG;
      Diastolic blood pressure 60 to 90 mmHg inclusive; Normal cardiac morphology demonstrated by
      echocardiography; Satisfactory cardiovascular response to exercise, measured by the Bruce
      Protocol, subjects must have completed Bruce stage 5; Aged 18 to 35 years inclusive; Body
      mass index (BMI) 19 to 27 inclusive, weight 65 to 100 kg inclusive; Negative hepatitis
      screen; Non-smoker for at least 6 months; Previous experience of general anesthesia with no
      problems reported; Willingness to give written informed consent; Ability to communicate well
      with the Investigators.

      Investigational Product Dose Mode of Administration Batch Number 1 vial 200mg Org 25435 /
      10ml solvent for reconstitution Intended doses: 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0 and 6.0
      mg/kg Intravenous 9J521 Duration of Treatment

      Dose Escalation phase:

      Each study treatment consisted of an intravenous infusion of Org 25435, given by Infusion
      pump over exactly 1 minute.

      Target Controlled Infusion phase:

      Each study treatment consisted of an intravenous infusion of Org25435 given by a
      computer-controlled infusion over 30 minutes.

      Criteria for Evaluation Tolerability, adverse events, EEG effects, cardiovascular effects,
      electrocardiogram (ECG), excitatory phenomena, respiratory effects, laboratory safety blood
      analyses, pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic measurements. Efficacy Induction phenomena;
      time of cessation of speech, eye closure, loss of eyelash reflex, eyes open on command, limb
      movement on command and syringe drop. Other Induction phenomena; pain on injection, sign of
      histamine release, excitatory phenomena, respiratory depression, apnea. Recovery phenomena;
      nausea / vomiting, delirium, shivering, disturbed psychomotor function, eye opening on
      command, spontaneous respiration, adequate respiration, move limbs on command, increased
      saliva production.

      Statistical Methods Formal statistical methods are not appropriate in this small pilot
      investigative study where group sizes comprise 5 or less subjects. All data collected is
      presented and summarized according to investigation type (Dose Escalation or TCI).
