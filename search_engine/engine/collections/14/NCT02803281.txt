      worldwide. In Canada the incidence for Esophageal Adenocarcinoma has doubled in the last two
      decades, while lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death. Surgery is a treatment
      option for these patients; however, esophagectomy in particular, is associated with
      significant morbidity, mortality and adverse effect on quality of life. Despite satisfactory
      standard preoperative testing to evaluate risk for surgery, some patients experience
      morbidity and never recover fully from surgery. Frailty assessment may offer a more sensitive
      measure of a patient's physiologic reserve, which may allow identification of patients who
      are poor candidates for surgery. There is a lack of consensus of how best to assess frailty
      prior to surgery. This study aims to analyze frailty assessment as a tool for patient
      selection for surgery.
