      living with dementia (PLWD). Informal caregiving for PLWD by lesbian, gay, bisexual, and
      transgender (LGBT) individuals continues to receive limited attention, and current research
      rarely examines how caregiving for PLWD affects the LGBT community.

      The primary goal of this pilot clinical trial is to establish the readiness of an
      intervention addressing the unique challenges facing LGBT informal caregivers of PLWD, and
      geared toward achieving caregiver mastery in this high-risk population for a larger efficacy
      trial.
