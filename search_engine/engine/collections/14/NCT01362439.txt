    
      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), multi-centric
      (conducted in more than one center) and non-comparative study of paliperidone ER in
      participants with schizophrenia who have a previous history of bad adherence to the
      antipsychotic treatment because of insufficient efficacy and side-effects. All the eligible
      participants will receive a dose of paliperidone ER in range of 3 to 12 milligram (mg) orally
      (taken by mouth; to be swallowed) once daily for 13 weeks. Efficacy and safety will primarily
      be evaluated by Positive and Negative Syndromes Scale (PANSS) and Extrapyramidal Symptom
      Rating Scale (ESRS), respectively. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the
      study.
