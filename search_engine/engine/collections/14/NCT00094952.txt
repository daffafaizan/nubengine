      (CSF) biomarkers to identify cognitively normal participants who show the earliest clinically
      detectable brain changes of Alzheimer's disease (AD).

      The major hypothesis for this study is that CSF P-tau231 measurement improves the accuracy of
      MRI and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) measurements in predicting mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
      Validation of this hypothesis can lead to improved diagnostic tools for detecting AD as early
      as possible.

      This 5-year longitudinal study will involve a baseline exam and two 18-month followup exams.
      Participants will undergo MRI scans, CSF collection and blood samples, neuropsychological
      performance testing, and medical, neurological and psychiatric assessment. The screening and
      diagnostic evaluations will be carried out by the New York University Alzheimer Disease Core
      Center (ADCC) and the NYU Center for Brain Health.

      This study will enroll a minimum of 80 cognitively normal participants, 60 to 80 years of
      age, with English as their first language, with about 12 years of formal education, and who
      are living in the metropolitan New York City area. All participants will receive baseline and
      follow-up evaluations to rule out confounding medical, neurological, and psychiatric
      conditions that could affect cognition. The study coordinator will maintain 6-month telephone
      contact with all participants and their caregivers who are part of the project.
