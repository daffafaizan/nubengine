      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose of temsirolimus when administered with sorafenib
      in patients with metastatic, recurrent, or unresectable melanoma.

      II. To determine the safety and toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To Determine the population pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients.

      II. To correlate tumor and blood biomarkers with clinical outcome in patients treated with
      this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, phase I, dose-escalation study followed by a phase II,
      open-label study (2005-0215).

      Patients receive temsirolimus IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 and oral sorafenib
      once or twice daily on days 1-28. Treatment course repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3-6 months.
