        -  Three patients will be treated per cohort for one cycle (28 days per cycle).

        -  If no DLTs are recorded, treatment will continue and three patients will be treated in
           the subsequent cohort.

        -  However, if a patient develops a DLT, another three patients will be treated in this
           cohort for one cycle.

        -  If there are no more DLTs, dose escalation continues.

        -  If more than one of three patients develop a DLT in any cohort, another three patients
           will be treated in the next lower dosage cohort.

        -  If no DLTs are recorded in any of the cohorts, cohort 3 will be expanded to six
           patients.

        -  Up to 12 patients will be enrolled at the MTD.

        -  The phase II dose for this combined treatment will be therefore defined as the highest
           dosage cohort in which six patients had been treated and there are less than three DLTs.
