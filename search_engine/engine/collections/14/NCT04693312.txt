      the rhomboid muscles, and results in a winged scapula. A winged scapula is where the scapula
      protrudes from the patient's back and can affect the ability to lift objects or pull and
      push. The winging of the scapula seen with dorsal scapular nerve syndrome is not as severe as
      seen as injury or paralysis of the serratus anterior muscle.

      Dorsal scapular nerve entrapment is a very under-recognized cause of neck and shoulder pain.
      The scapular winging may be subtle, and the symptoms are easily mistaken for other problems.
      A careful history and physical exam, along with a high index of suspicion, are necessary for
      accurate diagnosis and therefore appropriate treatment. Injection of the dorsal scapular
      nerve under ultrasound guidance can be diagnostic as well as therapeutic.
