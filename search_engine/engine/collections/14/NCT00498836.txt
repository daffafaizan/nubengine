      study designed to investigate objective tumor response, the time to progression (TTP) and the
      duration of tumor response in patients with metastatic malignant melanoma when treated with
      CP-4055 in combination with sorafenib (NexavarÂ®). The safety and tolerability of the
      treatment will also be assessed.
