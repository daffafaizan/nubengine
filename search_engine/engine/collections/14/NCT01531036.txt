      3D acquisition is compared to breast MRI in order to evaluate volume measurements calculated
      in ultrasound. Lesion elasticity is calculated in 3 planes with immediate reconstruction. The
      purpose of this prospective study is to evaluate the feasibility of this technique and
      compare the results to those of Breast MRI. For women receiving preoperative chemotherapy,
      this technique will be evaluated with regard to tumour shrinkage and lesion elasticity
      modifications under treatment.
