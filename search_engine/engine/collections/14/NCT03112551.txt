      effective and attractive, especially in settings with limited resources and where there is no
      availability of tools to monitor the serum level of magnesium sulphate. This is because the
      most common reported maternal adverse effects of magnesium sulphate are minor and may be
      confused with other symptom of eclampsia of even labor.The administration of Magnesium
      sulphate for 24 hours in the absence of monitoring of the serum magnesium sulphate might be
      life threatening in a resource- challenged situation , thus the current study is planned to
      be conducted to investigate the efficacy and safety of shorter duration (12 hours) of
      magnesium sulphate therapy in preventing development of convulsions in cases of eclampsia.
