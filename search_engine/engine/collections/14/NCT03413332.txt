    
      This two-phase study develops and tests the usability and efficacy of a culturally relevant,
      web-based patient education program, hereafter known as E-Talkcare, in improving Chinese
      immigrant breast cancer survivors' competence, perceived control, and self-efficacy in cancer
      care communication (intermediate outcomes), and patient-reported symptoms, adherence to
      breast cancer survivorship care guidelines, and quality of life (distal outcomes) versus the
      usual care control arm. In Phase I, community-based participatory research (CBPR) principles
      will be used to develop the intervention to educate participants about culture and
      communication by demonstrating how to ask for and verify information with doctors and use
      personalized symptom reports, and by providing question prompt lists for doctor visits. In
      Phase II, the intervention will be tested in a pilot randomized control trial (RCT). Using
      cases from Los Angeles Cancer Surveillance Program, California Cancer Registry, Maryland
      Cancer Registry, and clinics from California, 118 Chinese immigrant women (diagnosed with
      stage 0-III breast cancer and 1-3 years post-diagnosis) will be enrolled and randomized to
      either the E-Talkcare intervention or a usual care control arm. Participants will be
      interviewed via telephone at baseline (i.e., pre-randomization), 3-, and 6-months
      post-randomization.
