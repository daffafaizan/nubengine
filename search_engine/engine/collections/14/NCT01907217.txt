    
      The study is a two-group parallel design randomised controlled non-inferiority trial and has
      been registered (ISRCTN23577151). Consented patients with major depressive disorder (DSM-IV)
      will be randomly allocated to a course of bitemporal (BT) ECT (1.5 x ST) or high-dose right
      unilateral (RUL) ECT (6.0 x ST). To facilitate generalizability of results, the trial takes
      place under "real world" conditions and so both groups continue usual care and medications
      during the treatment phase and thereafter. Patients are followed-up for 12 months after
      completing their allocated course of ECT. Completion of the primary outcome depression-rating
      measure (i.e. HDRS) and the secondary outcome of most interest (autobiographical memory,
      using the AMI-SF) will be prioritised in the data collection.

      Patients, their treating clinicians and raters are blind to treatment; clinicians
      administering ECT are not involved in post randomisation assessments or formal data analysis.
      Success of blinding for patients and raters will be assessed after the second and final
      treatments. The trial statistician is also blinded to allocation status.

      Sample size: In a large series (n = 253) of depressed patients, Petrides et al. (2001) found
      a mean (SD) reduction in 24-item HDRS of 25.6 (9.4) after treatment with bitemporalT ECT (1.5
      x ST). We therefore estimate that 69 patients will be required per treatment group to have
      80% power to demonstrate, using a one-sided equivalence t-test at 5% level, that mean
      reduction in 24-item HDRS achieved using high-dose RUL ECT is no more than 4 points (i.e.
      equivalent to 3 points on 17-item HDRS) less than that achieved using standard BT ECT,
      assuming a common within-group SD of change scores of 9.4 and equal expected group mean
      change scores.
