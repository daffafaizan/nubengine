      administered as an adjunct to local anesthetics via an epidural catheter. Patients undergoing
      elective cesarean sections will be randomized into three groups using a random allocation
      table. Group assignment will be performed by opening a previously prepared numbered opaque
      envelope containing the assignment. Each group will receive the same combined spinal epidural
      (CSE) containing 10-12mg hyperbaric bupivacaine, 150mcg preservative-free morphine, and 15mcg
      fentanyl. At surgical closure, Group 1 will receive 10cc bupivacaine 0.0625%, Group 2 will
      receive 10cc bupivacaine 0.0625% +4mg dexamethasone, and Group 3 will receive 10cc
      bupivacaine 0.0625% + 8mg dexamethasone (4mg). In order to maintain this as a double-blinded
      study, the patient will not be told which medication was administered and the drug will be
      given by one anesthesiologist and the patient follow-up will be performed by a different
      anesthesiologist. VAS, sedation, nausea, and satisfaction scoring will be measured on patient
      follow-up to compare how these outcomes compare between the different treatment groups.
