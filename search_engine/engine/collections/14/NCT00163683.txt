      increasing the risk of heart disease in people with Type 2 diabetes. Good markers present in
      the blood are now available to detect this inflammatory state. Recent evidence suggests that
      a Mediterranean-type diet, high in plant foods and with monounsaturated fat from olive oil
      has beneficial effects on blood vessels as well as on blood glucose and blood lipid control.

      In this study we will compare the effects of a Mediterranean diet, high in fruit and
      vegetables with the more conventional diet recommended for diabetes therapy (a high
      carbohydrate, low fat diet). Twenty-four people with Type 2 diabetes will be randomised to
      one of these diets and followed for six months. At the end of this time, the effect of the
      diets on markers for inflammation will be compared.
