      may demonstrate efficacy. Doses of sorafenib (400 mg b.i.d.) as a single agent is with
      minimal toxicity, presents an opportunity to explore a more intensive drug administration.
      This study will allow individual patient titration (e,g,, intrapatient dose escalation) as
      per protocol.

      This provides the basis for the dose escalation development of sorafenib. The study is
      designed to evaluate the ability for patients to dose escalate. Secondary endpoints include;
      response, time to progression, and overall survival in patients with MRCC. Tissue correlation
      to evaluate the impact of expression of receptor on clinical outcome will be retrospectively
      performed. Laboratory correlation of plasma VEGF levels will be correlated and evaluated to
      clinical outcome.
