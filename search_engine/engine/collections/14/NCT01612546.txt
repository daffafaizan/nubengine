      I. To evaluate pre- and post-treatment biopsies to assess CRLX101 (cyclodextrin-based
      polymer-camptothecin CRLX101) nanoparticle and 20(S)-Camptothecin (CPT) uptake in tumor and
      normal tissue.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and toxicity of CRLX101 in this patient population.

      II. To examine the antitumor efficacy of CRLX101 in advanced gastric/gastroesophageal
      junction (GEJ)/esophageal squamous or adenocarcinoma including clinical benefit rate
      (complete response [CR] + partial response [PR] + stable disease [SD]) at 4 months and
      overall survival.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive cyclodextrin-based polymer-camptothecin CRLX101 intravenously (IV) over 60
      minutes on days 1 and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients achieving stable disease or better, may receive treatment for an additional 6
      months.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up monthly.
