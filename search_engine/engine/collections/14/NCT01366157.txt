        -  To investigate the variability of expression of human geminal-center-associated lymphoma
           (HGAL) protein in pediatric low-risk Hodgkin lymphoma.

        -  To assess the variability of HGAL staining between risk groups by comparing samples from
           subjects enrolled in the low-risk study AHOD0431 with subject samples enrolled in
           AHOD0031 for intermediate-risk classical Hodgkin Lymphoma (cHL).

        -  To assess the variability of HGAL staining by evaluating a tissue array created from
           subjects with intermediate-risk cHL.

        -  To correlate rapid or slow early-response in the intermediate-risk group with HGAL
           protein expression.

      OUTLINE: Paraffin-embedded tissue samples and tissue microarrays are analyzed for protein
      expression by IHC.
