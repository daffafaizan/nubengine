    
      This two-arm randomized study will evaluate an "unaware intervention package" among
      HIV-infected persons attending Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI) clinics in Lilongwe,
      Malawi. The package includes detection of Acute HIV Infection (AHI), contract partner
      notification, and social contact referral to find persons unaware of their HIV infection. The
      package will be compared to the current standard of care, passive partner notification, as
      the base case. Participants will be randomized to receive the intervention package -
      classified as the "active arm" of the study. The study will characterize the HIV stage
      (acute, recent, chronic) of the index participants and their sexual partners and social
      contacts, and use the HIV staging combined with sexual behavior data, phylogenetic analyses,
      and egocentric sexual/social network assessments to assess the potential impact of the
      intervention on ongoing transmission. We will obtain the distributions of numerous
      transmission-related attributes among the recruited contacts/partners of STI clinic patients,
      including contacts' and partners' HIV infection status and stage, HIV
      diagnosis/care/treatment status, STI status, and sexual behaviors. This information will
      allow us to model testing, linkage, and treatment interventions targeted to the traced
      partners and/or social contacts of acute, recent, and/or chronic index cases identified in
      STI clinics. We can then assess and compare the predicted effects on population-level HIV
      incidence of interventions attached to each recruitment method (tracing partners, social
      contacts, or both) and index case and contact disease stage (acute, recent, and/or chronic).
