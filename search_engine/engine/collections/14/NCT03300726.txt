    
      SPECIFIC AIMS:

      Aim 1: Investigate correlations between CSF biomarkers of synaptic injury (Ng and SNAP-25)
      and functional connectivity (FC) within the default mode network (DMN) using resting-state
      fMRI (adjusting for age, gender, apolipoprotein-E4 [APOE4] genotype, task performance, and
      regional brain atrophy) in MCI/AD and controls.

      Aim 2: Examine correlations between CSF biomarkers of synaptic injury and functional
      connectivity (FC) within the semantic memory network on task-activated fMRI using the Famous
      Name Discrimination Task (FNDT) (adjusting for age, gender, APOE4 genotype, task performance,
      and regional brain atrophy) in MCI/AD and controls.
