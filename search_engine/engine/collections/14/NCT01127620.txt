      study followed by an open label extension. Duration of the double-blind period was 28 days
      and the duration of the open label period was 12 additional months.

      The primary efficacy variable of the double-blind period was the area under curve (AUC) of
      total symptoms scale (TSS) from baseline (defined as the mean of 6 last points of the
      patients' diary before randomization) to D28 visit according to the patient's assessment on
      reflective symptoms. 650 patients were included in the study and 614 completed the
      double-blind phase. Out of the 614 patients who completed the double blind period, a total of
      513 patients started the open label period with Bilastine 20 mg (83.6%)
