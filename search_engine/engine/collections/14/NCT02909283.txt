      evidenced in SCA children who have no microarteriopathy and may correlate with
      hemorheological abnormalities and impaired vasomotion. A multimodal approach designed to
      study a. cerebral perfusion and oxygenation, b. flow motion properties and c. blood
      rheological parameters might help to describe the different processes involved in cerebral
      ischemia.
