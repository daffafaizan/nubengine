      parent who supports the participant during the physical activity (PA) intervention and in the
      adolescent and parent arm does the physical activity with the participant. Approximately 29
      participants/yr. over 4 yrs. will be randomized in a 1:1 allocation to a remote group-based
      program of MVPA delivered to the adolescent (AO) or a multi-level intervention delivered to
      both the adolescent and a parent (A+P). Both interventions will be 12 mos. (6 mos. active
      intervention, 6 mos. maintenance intervention) with a 6 mos. no-contact follow-up targeted to
      increase MVPA to the recommended 60 min/d. Both intervention will include real-time MVPA
      sessions delivered to groups of 5-7 adolescents in their homes using video conferencing
      software (ZoomTM) with homework assignments designed to increase MVPA on the non-group
      session days. Parents of adolescents in the A+P group will be asked to participate in the
      group video MVPA sessions and homework activity, and to attend sessions (0-6 mos. 2
      session/mo.; 7-12 mos. 1 session/mo.) with their adolescent and the health coach designed to
      educate/support parents regarding the role of MVPA in health and function and strategies for
      increasing MVPA and decreasing sedentary time in both their adolescent and themselves. All
      participants will monitor their daily PA using a Fitbit wireless activity tracker.
