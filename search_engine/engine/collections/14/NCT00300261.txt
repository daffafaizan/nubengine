      few studies have evaluated its efficacy. Reported studies were conducted prior to the
      introduction of Medicare's prospective payment system for home care and evaluated the use of
      telehomecare in addition to traditional home visits. None examined patients' involvement in
      decision-making regarding the use of such technology in meeting their health care needs.
      Available data suggest that telehomecare may improve self-care and enhance outcomes for
      elders with heart failure but major gaps in knowledge exist regarding the clinical and cost
      effectiveness of this technology when decisions regarding its use are negotiated with
      patients and when it substitutes for traditional nurse visits under the recently introduced
      changes in the financing of home health care.

      Patient and cost outcomes will include: self-care, health care resource utilization, health
      status, quality of life, satisfaction, access to care and cost effectiveness. Data analysis
      will consist of a variety of statistical tests, and estimates of treatment costs. Findings
      will help guide optimal use of telehomecare in promoting self-care in the growing population
      of chronically ill elders whose conditions are characterized by high morbidity, complex
      therapies and poor quality and cost outcomes.

      Subjects will be enrolled from the acute care setting and will be randomized to receive home
      care with or without telehealth monitoring. Baseline and follow-up interviews will be
      conducted at admission, 60, 120 and 180 days.
