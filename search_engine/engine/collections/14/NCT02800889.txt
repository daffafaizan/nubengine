      pixantrone monotherapy, with two additional cycles in patients who continue to benefit from
      treatment. Each patient will receive pixantrone administered intravenously on days 1, 8, and
      15 of each 28-day cycle. There will be three age cohorts, defined as age cohort 1 (12 to less
      than 18 years, plus young adults (ages 18-21 years)), age cohort 2 (5 to less than 12 years),
      and age cohort 3 (6 months to less than 5 years). During dose escalation, three patients will
      first be accrued to the starting dose level. If no DLTs are identified, that dose level will
      be declared to not exceed the MTD and three patients will be accrued to the next higher dose
      level. Each subsequent dose-escalation level will be accrued per the DLT/MTD determination
      schema above. Planned sequential dose-escalation phase will receive 40 mg/m2, 50 mg/m2, 60
      mg/m2 or 70 mg/m2 of pixantrone base (on days 1, 8 and 15), as tolerated, based on DLT
      evaluation.Dose escalations will follow a standard 3+3 patient cohort escalation plan. No
      patients from Age Cohort 3 will be enrolled until 6 patients from age cohorts 1 and 2
      (combined) are evaluable for toxicity. After the MTD has been determined, an expansion phase
      will be accrued in order to gain better estimates of the safety, tolerability, and anti-tumor
      activity of pixantrone monotherapy in pediatric patients when treated at the MTD. Patients
      will be offered 3 years of post-study extension phase follow-up with periodic assessments of
      cardiac function parameters.
