      mortality is high. An outreach registry of primary care patients obtaining care at
      participating practices who meet study eligibility criteria will be created from the
      electronic medical record. 500 primary care patients will be randomly selected for the
      Outreach Contact with Decision Counseling (OCDC) Group from this outreach registry. Patients
      targeted for inclusion in the study will have a scheduled primary care appointment 18-23 days
      after initial outreach contact.
