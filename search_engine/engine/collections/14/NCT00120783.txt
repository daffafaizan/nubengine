      usually results in significant drug toxicity and in continued accumulation of resistance
      mutations that can preclude future therapeutic options. In contrast, treatment interruption
      provokes the reemergence of wild-type virus with full replicative and pathogenic capacity.
      The researchers investigated whether a calibrated reduction in drug pressure could stabilize
      the evolution and the pathogenic potential of resistant virus.

      A prospective pilot study was conducted in patients receiving protease inhibitor-based HAART
      with a resistance genotype predicting less than two active drugs according to the 2002 ANRS
      algorithm, CD4 counts over or equal to 100/mm3 and plasma HIV RNA below or equal to 5 log/ml.
      The treatment was low-dose IDV/RTV (200/100 BID) and 3TC 150mg BID. IDV doses were adjusted
      at week 4 to ensure a Cmin of 250+/-100ng/ml, which, based on a panel of multi-PI resistant
      viruses, was calculated to yield an inhibitory quotient (Cmin/IC50) of 0.50. Primary
      end-points were over 25% decrease in CD4 counts (immunological failure-IF), or over 0.7 log
      increase in plasma HIV RNA (virological failure-VF) at two consecutive monthly visits during
      the 24-week study. Inclusions were to stop when the total number of failures (VF+IF) reached
      7
