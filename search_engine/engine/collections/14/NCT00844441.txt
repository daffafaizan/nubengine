      Primary

        -  To compare the death rate in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes or acute myeloid
           leukemia who are discharged after completion of induction chemotherapy vs those who
           remain in the hospital until blood counts recover.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the proportion of patients who meet the early discharge criteria after
           completion of induction chemotherapy.

        -  To compare the costs incurred by patients who are discharged early vs those who are
           discharged only after blood counts recover.

        -  To compare resource utilization (e.g., transfusions) among these patients.

        -  To compare the quality of life of these patients.

      OUTLINE: Within 72 hours after completion of induction chemotherapy, patients are either
      discharged from the hospital or remain in the hospital until their blood counts recover.

      Patients receive standard supportive care after completion of induction chemotherapy either
      in the hospital or as an outpatient. Outpatients are seen by a registered nurse or physician
      assistant â‰¥ 3 times weekly and by a physician at least once weekly.

      A medical chart review is conducted to obtain information about medical complications (e.g.,
      neutropenic fever, documented infections, bleeding, reasons for hospitalization) and use of
      medical resources. Patients complete the MDA Symptom Inventory and the EORTC QLQ-C30
      questionnaire periodically to assess quality of life. Costs associated with inpatient and
      outpatient care are evaluated using electronic billing information from the University of
      Washington Medical Center and Seattle Cancer Care Alliance.

      After completion of the study, patients are followed up for 1 month.
