      the United States. The best treatment for NSCLC is surgical resection. For patients with
      inoperable or unresectable NSCLC chemotherapy and radiation is used as first line therapy.
      This is a consolidation therapy trial evaluating GI-4000 in subjects with NSCLC treated with
      curative intent who are disease free at their first post-treatment restaging assessment.
      These subjects must also have a ras mutation.
