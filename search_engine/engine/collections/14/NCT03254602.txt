    
      Intense Therapeutic Ultrasound (ITU) is an established ultrasound based therapy in which
      sound waves are concentrated and focused into selected musculoskeletal tissue, to produce
      selective thermal coagulative changes over a small controlled area while leaving the
      surrounding tissue unaffected. These coagulative changes are known to begin the body's tissue
      response cascade and promote collagen generation in the targeted anatomy resulting in pain
      reduction.
