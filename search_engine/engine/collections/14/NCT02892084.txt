      excitability of neural circuits involved in post-stroke locomotion, identify effective
      strategies for training a specific locomotor adaptation, and improve adaptations via
      adjunctive non-invasive brain stimulation. Tools to improve neural excitability may increase
      potential for locomotor skill learning, thereby improving rehabilitation outcomes.
      Non-invasive brain stimulation with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has
      recently emerged as a simple to administer, low-cost, and low-risk option for stimulating
      brain tissue. Cortical excitability is increased after application and preliminary results
      imply a relationship to increases in motor activity in those post-stroke. However, inhibition
      of the contralesional hemisphere is also shown to improve paretic motor output through
      inhibition of excessive maladaptive strategies, and combining the two electrode
      configurations may provide additional benefit for locomotor tasks requiring interlimb
      coordination. Furthermore, the effects of tDCS on walking function in conjunction with
      physical intervention strategies aimed at improving locomotor ability post-stroke are yet
      unstudied.
