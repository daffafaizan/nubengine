      inflammatory lymphocytes, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of MS.

      It was shown in animal models of EAE that during the disease effect or phase GM CSF sustained
      neuroinflammation via myeloid cells that infiltrate the CNS proving an essential role of GM
      CSF in encephalitogenicity.
