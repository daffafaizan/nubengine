    
      Data captured in the EHRs will be collected from all available departments, including
      inpatient hospital, outpatient hospital, emergency room, etc. for virtually all types of
      provided services in each participating site. The study period will be from January 1, 2020
      to the most recent data available.

        -  Primary objective To determine factors that predict disease prognosis and outcomes in
           COVID-19 patients, specifically: Hospitalization/Off-site monitoring, transfer to ICU
           and/or need for medical mechanical ventilation (both invasive and non- invasive), length
           of ICU stay, and outcome (cure/ hospital discharge, in-hospital death)

        -  Secondary objectives

             -  To describe the demographic and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients

             -  To describe the patient management (treatment and procedures) in the target
                population

             -  To describe the outcomes of COVID-19 (discharge, hospitalization, transfer to ICU/
                mechanical medical ventilation, in-hospital death) in relation to patients'
                clinical and demographic characteristics, and treatment received

             -  To determine whether the factors that predict COVID-19 prognosis and outcome also
                apply to other types of pneumonia.

        -  Exploratory objectives One of the goals of this study is to configure the Big Data
           system to unravel any hidden variable/s (and their associations) that may offer novel
           clinical insights into COVID-19 management.
