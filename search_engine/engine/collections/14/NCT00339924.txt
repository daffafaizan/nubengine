      complex relationships between self-identified race, ancestral origin and the genetic
      components of diseases, it is important to study physicians and other health professionals
      knowledge of human genetic variation and how they interpret and apply race, ethnicity and
      human genetic variation in their clinical decision making. Primary care physicians will be
      responsible for the translation of new genomic knowledge, including the use of
      pharmacogenomic and multiplex genetic testing in clinical practice. Understanding health
      professionals knowledge, beliefs and practices will provide important data for furthering
      health services and research. The Physicians Understanding of Human Genetic Variation study
      (PUHGV) is a three-phase, mixed-method study using both qualitative (focus groups and
      semi-structured interviews) and quantitative methods (web-based survey). The first phase of
      the study used qualitative methods to investigate racial and ethnic differences in how
      physicians understand and use genetics, race and ethnicity in their practice and to assist in
      developing the Health Professionals Genetic Education Needs Exploration survey instrument (HP
      GENE). Bonham and Sellers developed and piloted the Human Genetic Variation-Health
      Professionals Knowledge, Beliefs, and Use Scales (HGV-HP) to measure physicians knowledge of
      human genetic variation (HGV-HP Knowledge), beliefs about biologic and genetic differences
      based upon their patients race and ethnicity (HGV-HP Beliefs), and use of these constructs in
      their clinical decision making approaches (HGV-HP Use). The HGV-HP Scales are a component of
      the larger HP GENE survey instrument. The second phase of the study piloted these instruments
      with a random sample of United States general internists from diverse racial and ethnic
      backgrounds and geographic areas of the United States to assess the psychometric properties
      of the scales and investigate the role of incentives in recruiting physicians to participate
      in web surveys. Informed by the pilot testing of the instrument, the third phase of this
      study is to conduct a national survey using the instrument and scales with health
      professionals from different health disciplines.
