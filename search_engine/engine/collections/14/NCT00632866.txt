      disease systemic is characterized by disabling dryness, fatigue and pain, and systemic
      complications in 30% of patients. No treatment has proven effective in this disease. In open
      studies, some efficacy was observed with hydroxychloroquine but no RCT versus placebo has
      ever been done.

      Thus, the primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      hydroxychloroquine (400mg/ day) on dryness, pain, and fatigue, assessed by the patient using
      visual analogical scales (VAS).

      Response is defined by the improvement of 30% or more of at least 2 out of 3 of the following
      VAS : most disabling dryness, fatigue, and pain.
