      to evaluate a single local administration of low dose or high dose of SKY0402 compared with
      75 mg of bupivacaine HCl (i.e., MarcaineÂ® 0.5%) in women undergoing bilateral, cosmetic,
      sub-muscular, augmentation mammoplasty under general anesthesia. Each subject was to serve as
      her own control.

      A total of 40 subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive one of the following
      regimens:

        -  Low-dose SKY0402 in one side and Marcaine 75 mg in the contralateral side.

        -  Mid-dose SKY0402 in one side and Marcaine 75 mg in the contralateral side.

      Study drug was administered locally into the breast implant pocket at the end of surgery.
      After surgery, subjects were to receive standard treatment with acetaminophen 1000 mg three
      times daily and rescue analgesia with immediate-release oxycodone, as needed, for
      breakthrough pain.

      Assessments of postoperative pain were conducted through 96 hours. Safety assessments were
      conducted including monitoring of local and systemic adverse events (AEs).
