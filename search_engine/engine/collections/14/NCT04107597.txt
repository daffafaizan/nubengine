    
      This is a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effect of myofascial trigger point
      release therapy compared to core stabilization exercises, both with and without additional
      paced breathing training, on patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP). The main focus is on
      changes in pain severity, anxiety and depression, heart rate variability, and use of
      analgesic medication. Outcomes are measured at baseline (pre-intervention), after ten
      treatments (post-intervention), at three- and at six-month follow-up.
