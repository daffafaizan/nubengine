    
      This study has four parts. Part 1 is a dose escalation of BDC-1001 as a single agent to
      determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), or maximum
      protocol dose (MPD) recommended for Part 3. In Part 3, the selected dose will be administered
      as monotherapy to patients with selected advanced malignancies. Part 2 is a dose escalation
      of BDC-1001 in combination with pembrolizumab to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD),
      recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), or maximum protocol dose (MPD) recommended for Part 4. In
      Part 4, the selected dose will be administered in combination with pembrolizumab to patients
      with selected advanced malignancies.
