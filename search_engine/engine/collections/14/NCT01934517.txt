    
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the validity, reliability and
      reproducibility of the dental measurements obtained on the digital models with iTero® in
      comparison with those obtained on the plaster models (gold standard) and on the digital
      models with Lava Digital®.

      The secondary objective is to compare two different impression materials (i.e. alginate and
      polyvinylsiloxane (PVS)) and determine whether the impression material used affects the
      accuracy of the measurements.

      Statistical analysis:

        -  Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) will be used to evaluate the intra- and
           inter-operator reliability of the measurements for each method, i.e. the plaster models
           and the digital models.

        -  A paired t-test will be used to determine the validity of the digital measurements with
           iTero®, and to compare the impression materials (alginate and PVS).

        -  A Bland-Altman plot will also be used to compare the two digital methods (Lava Digital®
           et iTero®) with the plaster models.

        -  Dahlberg coefficient will be used to evaluate the technical error associated with the
           measurements that will be made.
