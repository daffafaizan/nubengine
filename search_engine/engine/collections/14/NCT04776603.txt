      new Holladay with total surgical-induced astigmatism, the Kane and and the NÃ¦ser-Savini toric
      intraocular lens (IOL) power formulas using a large database of toric IOL refractive
      outcomes.Retrospective consecutive case series.One hundred seventy-two eyes of 172 patients
      who had a toric IOL inserted during surgery.One eligible eye from patients having
      uncomplicated cataract surgery with insertion of an Alcon SN6AT(2-9) IOL (Alcon Laboratories,
      Inc, Fort Worth, TX) from 1 surgeon were included in the study. pre-operative were measured
      using either the IOLMaster 500 or 700 (Carl Zeiss Meditec AG, Jena, Germany). Using vector
      calculation, the predicted postoperative refractive astigmatism was calculated for each
      formula. This was compared with the actual postoperative refractive astigmatism to give the
      prediction error.
