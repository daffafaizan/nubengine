      to determine absolute BV as well as changes in BV and correlates reasonably well with CLM-III
      measurements. Individual refilling ability can be determined as well. This may prove useful
      in prescribing and monitoring ultrafiltration rates, establishment of optimal BV in HD
      patients and reducing morbidity and mortality associated with chronic HD.

      In the current study the investigators hypothesize that BVA can be used in the longer term to
      evaluate the adequacy of the current clinically estimated dry weight in dialysis patients and
      can be used to titrate EDW in order to improve overall volume status and decrease the
      incidence of blood volume misinterpretation. The investigators enrolled 12 eligible patients.
      Participants underwent post-hemodialysis blood volume analysis (BVA) as a baseline
      measurement. Based on their Blood Volume (BV) status, their prescribed estimated dry weight
      (EDW) was adjusted. After 3 to 6 months, participants underwent a repeat BV measurement. The
      investigators compared the second value to the first in order to judge whether an improvement
      in BV status occurred if the dry weight prescription was changed, or to judge stability if it
      was not.
