      survey assesses surgery and anaesthesia at Ethiopian public hospital facilities.

      The surveys assesses infrastructure, workforce, and availability of resources across all
      National facilities providing surgery.

      An online national cross-sectional survey, designed through a consultative process involving
      senior clinicians - anesthesia providers, surgeons, and obstetricians.

      Elements incorporated from existing tools, including the Safe Surgery Hospital Assessment
      Tool, World Federation of Societies of Anaesthesiologists (WFSA) Anaesthesia Facility
      Assessment Tool and the Lancet Commission on Global Surgery Surgical Assessment Tool.

      Survey questions grouped into themes: infrastructure, human resources, service delivery, and
      the availability of medications, equipment, and guidelines.

      The final quantitative survey includes 77 questions, for distribution to clinicians at a
      convenience sample of government hospitals providing major surgical services. Private
      facilities are excluded.

      The online survey link sent via the N4PCc collaborator network to clinicians at each site.
      All collaborators and clinicians are perioperative practitioners (anesthesia providers,
      surgeons, obstetricians, nurses) at their respective institutions. Additional facilities with
      no N4PCc collaborator contacted via the department of anesthesia at each institution.
      Telephone follow-up with non-responding hospitals to overcome barriers to completion,
      including assistance with data input where required.
