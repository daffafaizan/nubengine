    
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a live attenuated
      monovalent dengue virus vaccine (rDEN3Δ30) in healthy flavivirus-naive adults.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive the rDEN3Δ30 vaccine or placebo at Day 0.
      Study visits will occur on Days 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 21, 28, 56, 90, and 180. Visits
      will include physical examinations and blood collection. All participants will record their
      temperature 3 times a day from Day 0 through Day 16. Some participants may be admitted to the
      clinic for an inpatient (overnight) stay during the first 16 days of the study.
