      Gastroentero-pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (GEP-NETs) are generally classified as rare
      diseases. Little is known about their cell biology and their mechanistic regulation. During
      the last years, the incidence of GEP-NETs is continuously increasing worldwide. In parallel,
      novel treatment options are currently evaluated which may substantially improve prognosis of
      patients with NETs. Data on such tumours in Switzerland, however, is scarce and treatment
      strategies vary throughout the country.

      Objective

      To systematically and prospectively collect clinical information of patients with GEP-NETs in
      Switzerland based on a histologically confirmed diagnosis.

      Methods

      All NETs of both, gastrointestinal and pulmonary origin are included provided that patients
      have given informed consent. Data will be entered prospectively and anonymised in a
      specifically designed database. Contributing centres and general practitioners are visited by
      a study nurse, patient files are analysed and data is transferred to the database. In case of
      conflicting evidence, questions are resolved in collaboration with a review board of
      SwissNET. Evaluation of treatment modalities and patient outcomes (e.g. mortality,
      hospitalisation rate) will take place within regular time frames.
