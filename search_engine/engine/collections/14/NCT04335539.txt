    
      This is a multicenter, single-arm, open-label, single- and multiple-dose study to assess the
      safety, tolerability, and PK of cefiderocol in hospitalized paediatric patients.

      The single-dose phase will include 4 separate cohorts of patients, grouped according to age
      range:

        -  Cohort 1: 12 to < 18 years

        -  Cohort 2: 6 to < 12 years

        -  Cohort 3: 2 to < 6 years

        -  Cohort 4: 3 months to < 2 years Cohorts 1, 2, and 3 in the single-dose phase will be
           initiated in parallel. Cohort 4 will begin after safety and PK data from at least 6
           participants from the single-dose Cohorts 1, 2, and 3 (with a minimum of 3 participants
           from Cohort 3) have been assessed.

      The multiple-dose phase will include 3 cohorts according to age range (Cohorts 2, 3, and 4)
      and will begin after safety and PK data from 6 participants in the corresponding single-dose
      cohort have been assessed.
