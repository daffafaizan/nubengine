           cancer after preoperative chemoradiation - randomized prospective trial

        2. Principal investigator: Jae Hwan Oh Co-investigator: Seung Yong Jeong, Sung Bum Kang,
           Hyo Seong Choi, Seok-Byung Lim

        3. Purpose of the study: To compare efficacy of laparoscopic and open resection for locally
           advanced rectal cancer after preoperative chemoradiation

        4. Specific aims

             1. comparison of oncologic outcomes

             2. comparison of quality of life

             3. comparison of anorectal function

        5. Materials Rectal cancer <9cm from anal verge, measured by rigid sigmoidoscopy
           histologically proven adenocarcinoma locally advanced (T3), determined by CT,
           transrectal ultrasonography, MRI without any contraindication for general
           anesthesia,operation and chemoradiation Completion of preoperative chemoradiation

        6. Statistics

             1. Sample size calculation for non-inferiority trial: 340

             2. Disease free survival: Log-rank test,Cox regression analysis

             3. QOL and anorectal function: Repeated measured ANCOVA

        7. Methods

             1. operation time of operation : 6-8 weeks after end of preoperative chemoradiation
                surgical technique standard total mesorectal excision and high ligation of inferior
                mesenteric vessels

             2. preoperative chemoradiation chemotherapy: 2 cycles of 5-FU (400 mg/m2/day) + LV (20
                mg/m2/day) IV bolus, for 3 days in 1st & 5th wks of RT or Capecitabine 825 mg/m2
                p.o. bid during RT RT:45 Gy/ 25 fractions to the pelvis, 5.4 Gy/ 3 fractions boost
                to the primary tumor over 5.5 wks

             3. postoperative chemotherapy 4 cycles of 5-FU (400 mg/m2/day) + LV (20 mg/m2/day) IV
                bolus, for 5 days, 4 wks interval

             4. oncologic outcomes

                  1. Short-term outcomes Surgical length of incision op time blood loss
                     intraoperative complications conversion rate Pathological resection margins
                     (proximal, distal, circumferential) number of harvested lymph nodes length of
                     resected bowel tumor regression grade (Dworak's grading) TNM staging
                     Perioperative recovery duration of use of parenteral narcotics initiation of
                     peristalsis initiation of oral intake duration of hospital stay 30-day
                     postoperative mortality morbidity

                  2. Long-term outcomes Primary end point Disease free survival (3 years after
                     surgery) Secondary end points Overall survival Local recurrence Distant
                     metastasis Port-site and wound site recurrence
