    
      The study includes 45 consecutive patients diagnosed as differentiated thyroid cancer by
      clinical examination and/or fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC).

      Exclusion criteria are: previous neck surgery, pregnancy and known hypersensitivity to the
      dye used.

      An informed consent was obtained from all the patients. Peroperative workup includes history
      taking, clinical examination, relevant laboratory investigations including thyroid hormone
      assay, ultrasonography of the neck with special emphasis on the thyroid focal lesion and
      cervical lymph nodes. FNAC was attempted in all patients.

      All patients were then subjected to operation:

      A systematized surgical approach was adopted for the purpose of the study: this started by
      collar incision, development of sub-platysmal skin flaps and separation of strap muscles in
      the midline. This was followed by exposure of the thyroid gland; identification of the
      thyroid tumour; injection of the dye into the tumour; waiting for the dye to reach the lymph
      nodes; identifying the stained node; labeling it as the sentinel node (SLN); performing total
      thyroidectomy and bilateral central neck dissection.

      The resected specimen was fixed by formaldehyde, stained with hematoxylin and eosin and
      examined with light microscopy.

      If the SLN was found to be free of malignant deposits, it was further examined by
      immunohistochemical staining.

      Statistical analysis: Descriptive statistics were used to analyze demographic data.
      Sensitivity, specificity and predictive value of the SLN were calculated.

      The histopathological report of the excised specimen was considered the criterion standard.
