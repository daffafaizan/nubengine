    
      This is a single-center, randomized trial designed to examine the hypothesis that a
      lifestyle-based mobile health cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention program administered to
      graduates of a cardiac rehabilitation (CR) program will improve physical activity, body
      composition, fitness, and quality of life (QOL).

      The investigators may enroll up to 52 men and women volunteers from a pool of graduates of
      the Duke Cardiac Rehabilitation Program who are initially eligible to participate in this
      study. Of the 52 men and women volunteers who may be initially consented, it is anticipated
      that a portion (potentially 30%) may drop out during the study timeline, and approximately 40
      are expected to complete this study. Following informed consent and baseline testing, the
      participants will be randomized in a 3:1 fashion to receive VIDA's 12-week mHealth program
      focused on lifestyle modification through remote health coaching in order to improve physical
      activity, body composition, and fitness. The multi-domain mHealth intervention will mirror
      traditional CR programs by focusing primarily on a structured physical activity intervention
      within the context of a comprehensive lifestyle program. Physical activity will be monitored
      by Fitbits and will be integrated into VIDA's mHealth platform which will also include
      modules on physical activity, weight management, heart healthy diet, medication adherence,
      coping with a chronic disease, psychosocial management, and stress management/sleep. Health
      coaches will be used to guide patients through the 12-week program. All participants will
      undergo measures of physical activity, body composition, fitness, and QOL at baseline and at
      12-weeks.
