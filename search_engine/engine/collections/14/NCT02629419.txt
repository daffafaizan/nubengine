    
      Patients aged 18 to 75 years with mucocutaneous candidiasis (esophageal, oropharyngeal, or
      vulvovaginal) who are refractory or intolerant to standard non-intravenous therapies will be
      enrolled. Patients will initially be treated in a short-term dose titration period, where the
      dose may be increased in patients that do not respond clinically. Patients who do not respond
      clinically to the highest dose of drug will discontinue the protocol. Patients that respond
      to treatment and tolerate the study medication will be eligible to enter a long-term
      extension (up to 36-months).
