      treatment of Ct genital infection in young women to prevent complications) that may be
      implemented in the future if proved efficient 7 centers are involved in the enrollment
      (university health services), and 4 centers will participate in the study within the frame of
      the follow-up and final visit (hospital gynaecology departments).

      Participants included will have to perform 4 self-taken vaginal samples linked to four online
      corresponding questionnaires, at different timeframes 6-month apart to each other (M0, M6,
      M12, M18). The first sampling (M0) will be performed at the university health service, this
      self-taken sampling could also be performed at home later in case of menstruation; the others
      (M6, M12, M18) will be performed at home (or at the university if problem of sampling kits
      receiving at home).

      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the two following arms:

        -  in the non-intervention arm, participants will follow current guidelines of Ct screening
           (i.e. opportunistic screening only in STI clinics for women aged less than 25 years
           old), and their samples will be tested for Ct at M18 by the NRC;

        -  in the intervention arm, analyses for Ct will be carried out immediately by the NRC.

      A final visit with a hospital gynecologist is planned for all participants between M18 and
      M24 and aims at providing an extensive clinical examination to seek for potential signs of
      pelvic inflammatory disease and to treat participants if needed.

      Based on all data collected on the electronic platform through questionnaires from the
      different visits, independent experts blinded on chlamydia status will assess PID status of
      all participants (no PID, probable PID, confirmed PID).

      The duration of enrollment is planned for 36 months.

      The duration of follow-up for each patient is 18 months to 24 months.
