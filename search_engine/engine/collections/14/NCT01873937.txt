      clinical situations. With the advent of new LED-based (light emitting diode)light sources,
      the need of further clinical experiments aiming to compare the effectiveness between them is
      paramount. Method: This study proposes an evaluation of analgesic effect in TMD
      (temporomandibular disorders) using two different LEDs systems, one emitting at the spectral
      band of red (630 +/-5 nm) and the other at infrared band (850 +/-5 nm), and compare the
      results with a laser treated control group (780nm diode laser using 105.7 J/cm2). Mandibular
      range of motion and report of pain were evaluated via appropriate equipment developed to do
      this end. Power output was 150mW, tip area was 0.5 cm² for both sources. Fluency or dose
      chosen was 18 J/cm² for each point of application, around the TMJ, on both sides. Five points
      were irradiated on TMJ, temporal and masseter muscles. Eight irradiation sessions were done
      and follow up was performed 7 and 30 days, after last session. Thirty patients were enrolled
      and they were selected randomly for each treatment, resulting in 10 patients per group
      (infrared LED, red LED and Control Group using infrared Laser).
