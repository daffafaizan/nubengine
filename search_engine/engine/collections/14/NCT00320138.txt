      increased health care utilization. Yet, service members with the disorder may be resistant to
      traditional treatments or find them undesirable because of side-effects, stigma, and
      long-term commitment. Acupuncture, which has few known side effects, holds promise as an
      effective treatment option for PTSD. Acupuncture has been shown to improve well-being and has
      been successfully used to treat stress, anxiety and pain conditions. In order to test the
      efficacy of acupuncture for treating the symptoms of PTSD-measured by the PTSD Checklist
      (PCL)-a 12-week, randomized, waitlist-controlled trial will be conducted using a sample of 75
      active duty military personnel. Participants will receive an eight-session acupuncture
      treatment, and will be evaluated throughout the study by way of clinical assessments and an
      independent assessing acupuncturist.
