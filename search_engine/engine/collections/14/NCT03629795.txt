      scan; the samples are to be collected immediately after the subject's routine blood sample at
      the clinic visit. No extra venepuncture will be required.

      Blood samples collected will be shipped to the sponsor's laboratory to establish analytical
      performance characteristics of the ADVIA Centaur® Pregnancy Associated Plasma Protein A
      (PAPP-A) and ADVIA Centaur® Free Beta Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (Free βhCG) assays.
