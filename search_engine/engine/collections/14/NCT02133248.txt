      disproportionate and increasing cluster on the wait list (33%), and have to wait longer to
      receive a transplant than non-sensitized patients. By 36 months on the wait list, 10% died
      before receiving a transplant. Those who do receive transplants require desensitization. The
      current desensitization protocols include anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody to remove B cells, a
      proteasome inhibitor to eliminate plasma cells and plasma exchange and/or intravenous
      immunoglobulin (IVIG) to remove pre-formed donor specific antibodies (DSA). The success of
      these protocols can be measured using single antigen bead (SAB) luminex technology. These
      desensitization protocols have been shown to significantly decrease mean fluorescence
      intensity (MFI). Desensitization protocols typically are more effective in removing
      antibodies that recognize HLA Class I molecules than those that recognize HLA Class II
      molecules. Unfortunately, even after pre-conditioning, sensitized patients are more likely to
      develop antibody mediated rejection (ABMR) than patients that do not have donor specific
      antibodies prior to transplant. Currently, serum levels of DSA are measured after
      desensitization, but not donor specific B cells (DSB). It is possible that B cells and/or
      plasma cells remain after treatment. Donor specific B cells, upon transplant and the
      accompanying exposure to antigen, can be re-stimulated to both produce antibody and also to
      develop into plasma cells which produce antibody. Therefore, potentially a better means of
      determining whether desensitization has been successful would be to look at both the DSA
      level using SAB technology as described above and to look at DSB to determine if these cells
      have been adequately cleared by the desensitization protocol.

      Specific Aim 1 Hypothesis: Patients who have adequate clearance of serum DSA, but who still
      have significant populations of DSB are more likely to develop ABMR.

      In Specific Aim 1, the investigators will utilize cutting edge technology to observe levels
      of anti-HLA antibodies, particularly donor specific antibodies, present in sensitized
      patients by staining DSB with HLA class I tetramers. This method allows enumeration and
      characterization of the source of DSA, the DSB. The investigators will determine the number
      of DSB and donor specific plasma cells (DSPC) prior to and after desensitization as well as
      later post transplant. In addition, the investigators will look at the phenotype and
      activation state of the DSB prior to transplant and after transplant. HLA class I tetramers
      are MHC class I molecules of a particular allele which are refolded with a peptide in the
      peptide binding groove, biotinylated on the C terminal tail and tetramerized using
      streptavidin conjugated to a fluorophore such as phycoerythrin (PE). Similarly, HLA class II
      tetramers are made of MHC class II alleles. B cells retain membrane bound antibody which has
      the exact specificity of the soluble antibodies that it also produces. The tetramers will
      bind only to B cells that have antibodies against that specific HLA class I allele on the
      surface, since the binding is determined only by the specificity of the antibody. At the same
      time, the cells will be stained with other markers to determine the activation state and
      phenotype of the DSB. This assay is done using flow cytometry. Additionally, the
      investigators will measure BAFF and APRIL cytokine levels by Elisa at all time points. These
      cytokines are closely related to B cell development. There is data to suggest that BAFF is
      elevated after some forms of desensitization, which could enhance new B cell development.

      The investigators will obtain a blood draw from subjects once consent is obtained and utilize
      this sample to establish a baseline of B cells that produce antibodies that recognize HLA
      class I tetramers of the same type as those previously identified by SAS anti-HLA antibody
      analysis. Immediately prior to and after the patient receives a transplant, the SAB anti-HLA
      antibody analysis, tetramer analysis, and BAFF/APRIL Elisas will be repeated. Analyses will
      also be performed between 6 weeks and 2 months after transplant.

      Specific Aim 2 Hypothesis: During chronic rejection, patients who respond well to
      desensitization and who are able to maintain tolerance after desensitization will have fewer
      residual DSB.

      In Specific Aim 2, the investigators will utilize the same technology to quantify and
      characterize DSA and DSB when a patient experiences chronic rejection due to ABMR. In this
      case, the patient may not have had DSA when transplanted, but developed de novo DSA (dnDSA)
      after transplant, causing rejection. Or the patient may have had DSA, been desensitized
      successfully, maintained tolerance for a period of time, then either lost tolerance or
      developed dnDSA. The timelines will be similar to specific aim 1 - the investigators will
      take samples at the following timepoints: upon diagnosis of ABMR, 1 week after
      desensitization, then 2 to 3 months after desensitization to look for rebound.

      In addition to enrollment of new subjects, the investigators will also enroll healthy normal
      individuals to serve as controls.
