      hypothermia during surgery. Conventional core temperature is monitored at esophagus, rectum,
      nasopharynx. But some of them are invasive and impossible in sometimes. Recently developed 3M
      Spoton skin temeprature which is applied on temporal artery is correlated with core
      temperature measured by esophageal prove in several studies. Its mechanism is making zero
      heat flux on skin applied. But it also cannot apply in head or facial surgery. Other studies
      showed conventional skin temperature over carotid artery is also correlated with core
      temperature. The investigators hypothesized using Spoton on carotid artery could be
      alternative method measuring core temperature. The purpose of this study is comparing 3
      methods of temperature monitoring. First, conventional core temperature measure by esophageal
      stethoscope. Second, 3M Spoton applying on temporal artery. Third, 3M Spoton applying on
      carotid artery
