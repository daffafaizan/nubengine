      I. To determine the overall response rate in patients with advanced esophago-gastric cancer
      (EGC) to combination pralatrexate and oxaliplatin.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To examine the toxicity and tolerability of this regimen. II. To determine the
      time-to-progression and overall survival using this regimen.

      III. To examine whether functionally relevant polymorphisms of genes of the folate metabolism
      pathway correlate with efficacy and toxicity of pralatrexate.

      IV. To examine whether response to pralatrexate can be predicted by micro-ribonucleic acid
      (microRNA) expression profiling of the epithelial component of the tumor.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pralatrexate intravenously (IV) over 3-5 minutes and oxaliplatin IV over 2
      hours on day 1. Courses repeat every 2 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Oxaliplatin will be discontinued after 12 courses.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days and then
      periodically thereafter for up to 5 years.
