    
      This is an observational study, which will utilize a wrist-based blood pressure monitor to
      explore blood pressure variation in up to 75 participants in various real-world settings.
      There is no intervention in this study. The study will take place over a 4-week period.
      During this time, participants will be asked to sample their blood pressures 1) at random
      times, several times per day; 2) during specific periods of either emotional stress or
      relaxation; 3) during guided orthostatic testing. Study participants will utilize an
      application on their smartphones to log the device-measured blood pressures and flag selected
      blood pressure measurements as either being part of the orthostatic testing or during periods
      of emotional stress/relaxation. At the close of the study a post-study questionnaire will be
      sent electronically to each participant.
