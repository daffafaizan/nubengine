      placebo-controlled, double-blind (neither physician nor participant knows the identity of the
      assigned treatment), 2-way cross-over study of JNJ-42847922 participants with insomnia
      disorder without psychiatric comorbidity. The study consists of following phases: screening
      (28 days prior to Day 1), a double-blind treatment phase (consists of 5-day treatments,
      either JNJ-42847922 or placebo in subsequent 2-treatment periods, each separated with washout
      period of 5 to 9 days), and a follow-up examination (7 to 14 days after last dose
      administration). Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
