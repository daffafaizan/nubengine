      diabetic and obese, ARDS is characterized by inflammation and pulmonary fibrosis mediated by
      cytokines and biomarkers released from activated alveolar macrophages, also cytokine storm
      may occurs leading to multiple organ failure. These sequelae of COVID-19 disease in obese and
      diabetic patients are attributed to elevated plasma lipopolysaccharide which is the main
      activator of M1 and M2 macrophages. chronic activation of macrophages leads to production of
      profibrotic markers as transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), platelet-derived growth factor
      (PDGF), matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP7) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9) which promote
      fibrogenesis. In this research, we measure circulatory alveolar macrophage activation markers
      in COVID-19 obese patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.
