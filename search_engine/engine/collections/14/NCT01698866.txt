      an indispensible drug for the treatment of B-cell lymphoproliferative syndrome which induced
      immunosuppression. So, the infectious complications increase. Reactivation of hepatitis B
      virus is one such complication that can lead in asymptomatic hepatitis to death. Prevention
      of hepatitis B reactivation is recommended like using nucleoside analog for patients with
      chronic hepatitis B or occult hepatitis and vaccination against virus for seronegative
      patients. The published data about efficacy of hepatitis b vaccination in onco-haematology
      are rare. therefore, we carried out a prospective study to assess efficacy of hepatitis B
      vaccination in patients with lymphoproliferative disorder.
