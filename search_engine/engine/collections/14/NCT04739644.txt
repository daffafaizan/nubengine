      enrolled in an open randomized controlled trial over a 24 months period. Each participant is
      randomly allocated to experimental or control group and receives a 3-week rehabilitation
      program including both assessment and rehabilitative sessions. While patients in the control
      group undergo a traditional rehabilitative protocol, the experimental group is treated
      replacing traditional exercises with robot-aided ones performed with WRISTBOT, a 3 Degrees of
      Freedom (DoFs) robotic exoskeleton. WRISTBOT allows for passive, active and assisted
      range-of-motion (ROM) exercises, isotonic and elastic tasks, proprioceptive and perturbation
      training. All subjects perform the same sessions of assessment, which include two evaluations
      through the robotic system and clinical measures at the beginning (Tb) and at the end (Te) of
      the rehabilitative training, and a follow-up through phone call, three months after the end
      of the treatment (Tf). The assessment sessions include a robot-based evaluation (measurement
      of ROM, exerted forces, dexterity, and wrist position sense acuity) and clinical measures
      (Patient Rated Wrist Evaluation, Jebsen-Taylor and Jamar Test). Subjects' level of
      satisfaction about treatment is asked at the end of the rehabilitative treatment (Te). The
      primary objective is to evaluate the results of a robot-based rehabilitative approach on
      wrist functionality after work-related trauma, comparing the effects of robotic therapy with
      those achieved through a conventional therapy.
