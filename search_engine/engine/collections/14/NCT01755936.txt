      stenosis. Currently, the indications for valvular replacement are based on the valvular
      severity evaluated by echocardiography and the presence of symptoms. There is some evidence
      to suggest the presence of myocardial fibrosis is associated with a poor outcome in patients
      with aortic stenosis. The aim of this prospective study is to investigate the prognostic
      implications of myocardial fibrosis in patients with aortic stenosis. The presence of
      myocardial fibrosis will be identified by delayed enhancement with the cardiac magnetic
      resonance imaging at 3T. We will also be evaluating the application of T1 mapping techniques
      to detect diffuse myocardial fibrosis.
