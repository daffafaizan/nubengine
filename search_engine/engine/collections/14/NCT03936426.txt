    
      This is a single centre, open label, non-randomised, single cohort, multiple dose study of
      Cu-67 SARTATE administered to male and female participants diagnosed with grade I, II, or III
      meningioma. The maximum allowable dose will be calculated using dosimetry data acquired from
      PET/CT scans completed during a pre-treatment diagnostic & dosimetry phase using Cu-64
      SARTATE, a structurally identical molecule radiolabelled with copper-64 (Cu-64), instead of
      copper-67 (Cu-67). Approximately 6 participants will be enrolled in the study. Participants
      will have up to 4 therapy cycles (6-12 weeks apart). Safety visits will occur between each
      cycle at bi-weekly intervals to ensure the participant meets the safety criteria prior to
      their next therapy. An efficacy assessment will be conducted following cycle 2 to determine
      if a subsequent 2 cycles of therapy will be administered. Participants who complete all four
      cycles of Cu-67 SARTATE therapy, will complete their final study visit at 12 weeks post
      administration of cycle 4.
