      ventricular tachycardia will be recruited from those who have failed or were unable to
      tolerate conventional therapy. These patients will be recruited from the cardiology clinic
      where they will already be under the care of a heart rhythm/heart function specialist.
      Clinical imaging data, medical history and previous ablation data will be collected and use
      towards planning their treatment with SBRT. Patients will undergo further imaging (unless
      recently done clinically), including: 4D cardiac CT (cCT), cardiac MRI (cMRI) and a planning
      CT (pCT). MRIs will only be performed on patients with ICDs for whom it is considered safe to
      do so. Using the imaging and electroanatomic substrate mapping data collected from a previous
      ablation attempt, a volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) treatment plan will be
      established. This treatment plan will be generated in consultation between the cardiac
      electrophysiologist, radiation oncologist and medical physicist; and will define the target
      volume (TV) of myocardial tissue to be treated.

      Once a TV has been established and verified, patients will be set up on a TrueBeam 1 linear
      accelerator where the treatment will be administered. The actual time for treatment
      administration is approximately 30 minutes.

      After the procedure, at 6 & 12 weeks, 7.5 months then every 6 months, a follow-up will occur
      as a part of standard care where outcome data regarding the chronic success of the ablation
      procedure will be collected and ICD interrogation will be performed. No imaging or mapping is
      planned at the follow-up. Patients will be followed for a minimum of 7.5 months to a maximum
      of 2 years depending on when they are enrolled.
