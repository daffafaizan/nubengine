      affects walking efficiency or stability in trans-tibial unilateral amputees when compared to
      their current prostheses. The primary objectives are to determine if the experimental foot
      changes Cost of Transport (ml O2/kg/meter) or Stride Time Variability compared to an
      amputee's current prosthesis. Cost of Transport is an indicator of metabolic efficiency and
      Stride Time Variability indicates how likely a person is to fall. Oxygen consumption and
      stride time will be collected on a treadmill at the Gait and Motion Lab at the University of
      Colorado in Boulder.
