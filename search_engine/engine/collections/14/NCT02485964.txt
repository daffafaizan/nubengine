      peptides in order to develop a novel therapeutic vaccine. This vaccine will consist of
      prostate specific antigen (PSA) peptide and Candida skin test reagent. Candida has recently
      been shown to be a promising new vaccine adjuvant for promoting T-cell responses. It can
      induce interleukin-12 (promotes T-cell response) secretion by Langerhans cells, the main
      antigen presenting cells in skin. In a Phase I clinical trial treating women with
      biopsy-proven high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSILs), precursors of cervical
      cancer, a combination of human papillomavirus peptides with Candida was demonstrated to be
      safe, to induce immune responses to human papillomavirus, and to promote T-helper type 1
      (Th-1) response (promotes cellmediated immunity) in vaccine recipients.

      For treating prostate cancer, PSA is an ideal antigen as it is expressed in prostate cancer
      but not in any other organs. The characteristics of peptides that can effectively be used in
      therapeutic vaccines are their solubility in a single solution, immunogenicity in terms of
      containing large number of T-cell epitopes (so the vaccine can be used for all patients and
      not just a few that express certain Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) tissue types), and ability
      to mature Langerhans cells which in turn promotes T-cell activity.

      In this protocol the investigators focus on the immunogenicity of candidate peptides.
