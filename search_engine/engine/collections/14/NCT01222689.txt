      l. To assess overall survival (as measured by median survival and proportion of patients
      alive at 24 weeks) in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer who have received one prior
      line of systemic therapy when treated with the combination of AZD6244 (selumetinib) and
      erlotinib (erlotinib hydrochloride).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Progression-free survival (median progression-free survival [PFS] and proportion of
      patients with PFS at 12 and 24 weeks).

      II. Cancer antigen (CA)19-9 biomarker response (defined as a 50% decline in serum CA19-9
      level from baseline in patients with > 2 x upper limit of normal [ULN] CA19-9 measurement).

      III. Objective radiographic response by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)
      criteria.

      IV. Safety and toxicity profile of the combination of AZ6244 and erlotinib.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive selumetinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) and erlotinib hydrochloride PO QD on
      days 1-21. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2-3 months.
