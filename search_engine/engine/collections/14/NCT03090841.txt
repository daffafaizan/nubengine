      diagnosis of CMV fetal infection relies on the detection of viral DNA in amniotic fluid by
      polymerase chain reaction after amniocentesis. Non-invasive diagnosis of fetal infection
      directly in maternal blood is not available. Symptoms develop in about 10% of HCMV-infected
      fetuses. Despite important advance in medical imaging, establishing the prognosis of an
      infected fetus remains challenging. Thrombocytopenia, blood HCMV DNA, anti-HCMV
      immunoglobulin M and β2-microglobulin are recognized biomarkers of symptomatic fetal
      infections. However, the predictive value of these individual markers is not. Omics
      technologies could help to establish multimarker signatures of symptomatic infections.

      The objective of the study is to:

        -  validate fetal blood HCMV DNA, anti-HCMV immunoglobulin M , β2-microglobulin and
           platelet count as biomarkers of fetal disease;

        -  identify new biomarkers of severe fetal disease using transcriptomic, methylomic and
           lipidomic analyses of fetal blood and of amniotic fluid.

        -  validate a non-invasive CMV fetal infection diagnosis tool based on deep-sequencing of
           targeted CMV genes in maternal blood
