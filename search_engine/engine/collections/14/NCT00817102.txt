      coronary artery stenoses. Recently, coronary artery computed tomography angiography (CorCTA)
      has been introduced as a non-invasive method for the evaluation of coronary artery stenoses
      and has been shown to be highly accurate in stenosis detection when compared to invasive
      X-ray angiography. While invasive X-ray angiography and CorCTA evaluate morphological
      features of coronary arterial plaques, fractional flow reserve is an invasive measure of the
      hemodynamic significance of a stenosis obtained in the catheterization laboratory by
      measuring changes in intracoronary arterial pressure before and after maximal vasodilation
      induced by intracoronary adenosine. An FFR value less than 0.75 has been shown to predict
      ischemia in vascular beds distal to the stenosis by radionuclide perfusion modalities and has
      been shown to be associated with worse outcomes. Therefore, FFR is considered to be an
      invasive hemodynamic "reference standard" for the evaluation of the hemodynamic significance
      of coronary arterial stenoses. While intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) can provide additional
      morphological information in intermediate stenoses, it can not provide further functional
      information and cannot be used in more significant stenoses as the IVUS probe cannot be
      advanced through stenotic lesions.

      We are currently conducting investigation in the validation of CorCTA against FFR in
      intermediate coronary artery stenoses (40-70%) (see below under "Preliminary Data"). However,
      CorCTA has not been validated against invasive hemodynamic measurements of fractional flow
      reserve in patients with stenoses >70% by invasive X-ray angiography. We hypothesize that
      CorCTA-derived measurements are accurate in the diagnosis of hemodynamically significant
      coronary artery stenoses, using FFR as the reference standard in patients with coronary
      artery stenoses>70%.
