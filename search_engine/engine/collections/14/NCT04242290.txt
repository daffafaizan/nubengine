      was performed in this prospective, cross-sectional, single-blind study evaluating two
      different disease groups compatible in age and gender and the two groups were compared.

      For inclusion in the Cervicogenic Headache group, inclusion criteria determined by the
      Cervicogenic Headache International Study Group (CHISG) were used.

      Symptoms of all patients were questioned in detail and physical examinations were performed.
      After obtaining demographic information such as age, height and weight, severity and duration
      of pain were asked to the patients and Neck Disability Index (NDI) and Visual Analogue Scale
      (VAS) were used for pain assessment Cervical radiographic analysis was evaluated measuring
      general cervical lordosis and upper cervical lordosis on lateral standing X-rays using
      SurgimapÂ®. General cervical lordosis and Upper cervical lordosis measurements were performed
      on the lateral cervical graph.
