      of, management and spectrum of approaches to weaning from ventilation, in patients that
      require invasive mechanical ventilation for any reason, for a time period of at least 24
      hours. It will answer the following questions:

        -  What are the current approaches taken to wean patients from invasive mechanical
           ventilation?

        -  What is the frequency of delayed weaning from invasive mechanical ventilation?

        -  What are the factors that are used to determine when patients are in the weaning phase?

        -  What are the barriers to effective weaning from invasive MV?

        -  What factors (patient, institutional, medical practice) contribute to failed attempts to
           wean from invasive mechanical ventilation?

        -  What is the impact of premorbid conditions on weaning from invasive MV?

        -  What is the utility of existing classifications for weaning from invasive MV?

        -  What is the impact of early versus delayed and/or failed weaning from invasive MV?

      Patients will be screened for the study when undergoing mechanical ventilation and admitted
      in the ICU.

      Day 1 will be defined as the first day when IMV commences Day 2 commences at 6-10am (fixed
      time point each day per ICU practice) after IMV commences. Patients undergoing invasive
      mechanical ventilation on the morning of day 1 will be screened for the study Patients still
      undergoing IMV on Day 2, will be enrolled in the study Patients not undergoing invasive
      mechanical ventilation or liberated from invasive mechanical ventilation on day 1 will be
      re-evaluated daily for the presence of inclusion criteria.
