    
      For patients and parents who are considering scoliosis surgery, a video recording of the
      encounter will be obtained during their routine clinical visit to discuss surgery/options.
      This video will then be sent to the shared decision making group at Mayo Clinic, Rochester,
      MN to run analysis of the data (Shared Decision Making National Resource Center, Knowledge
      and Evaluation Research Unit, Mayo Clinic). Investigators will follow the patient's
      electronic medical records for 2 years after their decision of treatment option. No outcome
      forms will be specifically collected as part of the study, as outcomes forms are currently
      being collected clinically on all scoliosis patients.

      Based off of the initial video recordings, the first visual prototype of the shared decision
      making tool for scoliosis has been developed. This prototype of the shared decision making
      tool will be now be used to help test it's efficiency.
