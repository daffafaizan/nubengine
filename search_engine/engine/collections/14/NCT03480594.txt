      production of [13C]bicarbonate from [1-13C]pyruvate via flux through the pyruvate
      dehydrogenase (PDH) reaction in healthy subjects compared to those with fatty liver. The
      long-term purpose of this work is to develop hyperpolarized 13C imaging as a method to
      directly assess metabolic pathways in the human liver. Many high-impact diseases such as
      insulin resistant states, fatty liver and inborn errors of metabolism are known to alter
      biochemical fluxes and for this reason it is important to detect altered activity in specific
      pathways.
