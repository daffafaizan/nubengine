      to be insufficient/deficient in vitamin D. Vitamin D is a neurohormone which is important for
      development of the child, especially of the child's brain. The primary source of vitamin D is
      from the sun through one's skin. People have been avoiding the sun because of skin cancer,
      because of increasing Television watching, computer viewing and wearing clothes that cover
      most of the body. This approach will study whether making the pregnant mother, whose child is
      at risk for autism because of a previous child with autism, replete with vitamin D will
      prevent that recurrence of autism in the newborn sibling.
