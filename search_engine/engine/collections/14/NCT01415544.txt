      determination of their blood glucose levels. Although current technology glucose meters use a
      smaller amount of blood than older generation meters, the pain and inconvenience associated
      with this invasive measurement is the number one reason cited for inadequate or infrequent
      blood glucose monitoring. In fact up to 67% of patients with diabetes fail to routinely
      monitor their blood glucose levels. A survey of 1895 patients showed that finger soreness was
      the most common reason given for self-reported noncompliance with testing recommendations,
      followed by pain, inconvenience, fear of needles, and "other" (including cost), (Diabetes
      Care August 2001 vol. 24 no. 8 1502-1503). The ability to make a painless blood glucose
      measurement using only light would address the pain and inconvenience issues associated with
      current technology glucose meters.

      The initial application of the technology is associated with the monitoring of Gestational
      Diabetes. The International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG)
      recently released recommendations for diagnosing gestational diabetes, as well as clarifying
      the benefits of treatment (Diabetes Care, 2010;33:676-682). The IADPSG cited research that
      found significant graded relationships between increasing maternal glucose levels and the
      frequency of four primary and five secondary outcomes. For example, with a 1-standard
      deviation increase in maternal fasting, 1-hour, and 2-hour plasma glucose levels, there was a
      corresponding 38%, 46%, and 38% increased risk, respectively, in the primary outcome of birth
      weight >90th percentile, and a 5%, 18%, and 16% increased risk, respectively, of the
      secondary outcome of premature delivery before 37 weeks gestation (N Engl J Med
      2008;358:1991-2002).
