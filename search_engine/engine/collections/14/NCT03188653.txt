    
      Up to 50 subjects (up to 25 with healthy skin or 25 with atopic dermatitis) meeting the
      inclusion criteria will be enrolled in this study. A physical exam will be performed to
      ensure the subjects have healthy skin versus atopic dermatitis. For atopic dermatitis
      subjects, AD severity will be graded by the EASI score. Site randomization will be performed
      to determine which cleansers will be used for each of the 8 test sites (one site will be
      randomized to act as a control and not receive any cleanser). Baseline skin barrier function
      (TEWL, pH and hydration) will be measured. Then 1ml of each cleansers will be applied to the
      corresponding test sites, 2ml of tap water will be added, and lathered in a circular motion
      for 15 seconds. The sites will then be rinsed off with tap water for 15 seconds. Arms will be
      padded dry. Barrier functions will be measured again immediately after padding dry, and at
      30, 60 and 90 minutes after.
