      paraprotein in serum or urine, which is often associated with the presence of clonal plasma
      cells (PCs) mainly in the bone marrow (BM) . MM is the second most common hematologic
      malignancy and is expected to cause âˆ¼13 000 new cases and 30 000 deaths in 2018. Myeloma is a
      genetically complex disorder characterized by multiple genetic changes, affecting different
      pathways, that have the ability to deregulate plasma cell biology leading to a broadly
      similar phenotypic manifestation of disease. From a genetic perspective, myeloma can be
      divided into those with and without a hyperdiploid karyotype .The zinc-finger protein 217
      (ZNF217) is an oncogenic protein that plays deleterious functions in various human cancers.
      The ZNF217 gene is located at the 20q13 chromosomal region, which is frequently amplified in
      human tumors . This region also contains several oncogenes thought to confer selective
      advantages to cancer cells. Increased copy numbers of ZNF217 have been reported in various
      tumors and linked to poor outcome in some studies . ZNF217 can attenuate apoptotic signals
      resulting from telomere dysfunction and may promote neoplastic transformation and later
      stages of malignancy. ZNF217 was shown to be a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target
      during breast cancer progression. In our best knowledge, No studies were done to detect
      ZNF217 in multiple myeloma.
