      understanding of patient experience. Patients who have used this service will be invited to
      take part in an interview. Patients will be split in to two groups: those reassured and
      discharged after first attendance, and those who went on to have further diagnostic testing.
      The aim is to interview three patients from each group to compare experiences and perceptions
      of a service which previously would have been undertaken by physicians, but is now completely
      nurse-led.
