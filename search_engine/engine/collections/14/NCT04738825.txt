      randomized clinical trial designed to evaluate the effectiveness of Contingency Management
      with stepped care to PrEP Adherence and Support Services (CoMPASS) vs. treatment as usual
      (TAU) on HIV risk reduction among individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD) who inject
      drugs. The study will be conducted in community-based settings serving individuals with
      opioid use disorder to assess the effectiveness of CoMPASS on promoting: sustained PrEP
      adherence (primary outcome) and HIV risk behaviors, engagement in opioid use disorder-related
      care, opioid use (secondary outcomes); and sexually transmitted infections and HIV
      (exploratory). Participants randomized to CoMPASS will first receive contingency management
      and have the potential to earn prizes for making progress towards initiation of and
      consistent adherence to HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and engagement in OUD-related
      care. Individuals who do not demonstrate PrEP adherence (based on self-report, confirmed by
      urine testing for tenofovir metabolites at week 12), will be "stepped up" to PrEP Adherence
      and Support Services (PASS). The intervention is 24 weeks in duration. Participants
      randomized to TAU will receive a health handout on HIV risk reduction approaches, including
      PrEP and OUD-related care, and where to access such services.

      To inform future implementation efforts, factors relevant for scale-up in parallel (e.g.,
      completion of study visits, attitudes regarding the intervention among front-line staff) will
      be assessed.
