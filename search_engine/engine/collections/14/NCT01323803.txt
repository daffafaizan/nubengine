    
      Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a newly recognized chronic disease that is increasingly
      being diagnosed in children and adults. Many patients with EoE also have food allergies. EoE
      is characterized by inflammation and accumulation of a specific type of immune cell, called
      an eosinophil, in the esophagus. While there have been several large studies of EoE, very few
      have focused on the roles the immune system, genetics/heredity, and the environment in EoE.

      The samples and information collected from participants will help to identify and understand
      the genetic mechanisms underlying eosinophilic esophagitis.

      The Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center will serve as the Central Laboratory for
      genetic characterization studies.
