      Sanofi Pasteur Pregnancy Registry by providing the registry's toll-free number, 1-800-VACCINE
      (1-800-822-2463), in the USPI. The toll-free number will also be available through the Sanofi
      Pasteur-sponsored Website for the Pregnancy Registry. Both the United States product insert
      (USPI) and Website will advise health care providers to register women who are pregnant or
      became aware they were pregnant at the time of Fluzone QIV-ID immunization.

      Descriptive statistical methods will be the primary approach for summarizing data from the
      Fluzone QIV-ID Pregnancy Registry. No vaccine products will be provided or administered as
      part of this registry protocol.
