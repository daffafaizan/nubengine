      unrelated umbilical cord blood transplantation. Emphasis will be placed on adverse events
      that are not typically associated with umbilical cord blood transplantation. Also, to
      determine whether engraftment of a third party thymus allograft is feasible in patients who
      have undergone unrelated umbilical cord blood transplantation. Thymic engraftment will be
      determined by biopsy of the thymus allograft and immunohistochemical evidence of
      thymopoiesis. In addition, we would like to assess thymic function by measuring the number of
      naive T cells and the number of T cell receptor rearrangement excision circles (TRECS), and
      by assessing the diversity of the T cell receptor beta chain. These data will be compared to
      age, stem-cell donor source and disease matched historical controls whose stem cell
      transplants were not followed by a thymus transplant. This will be done in descriptive
      fashion. Other immune parameters will be followed including T, B, and NK cell numbers, T cell
      responses to mitogens, antigens, and immunoglobulin production.
