    
      Prospective, multicenter, international, no-randomized, single-arm, investigator-initiated
      study, enrolling up to 200 patients with intermediate to severe coronary stenosis (30-90%
      diameter stenosis) in patients presenting with NST-ACS requiring coronary angiography
      assessment.

      Patients will receive ad-hoc OCT evaluation of the target vessels and offline 3D-angio-based
      FFR evaluation.

      The primary study parameter is the association between 3D-angio-based FFR values and OCT
      detected minimum luminal area pre- and post-PCI
