      I. To determine whether tasquinimod augments immune response to sipuleucel-T.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety and tolerability of the combination of sipuleucel-T and tasquinimod
      in patients with castration-resistant metastatic prostate cancer.

      II. To obtain preliminary evidence of the clinical benefit of the combination of sipuleucel-T
      and tasquinimod; to include changes in prostate specific antigen (PSA) over time, and
      duration of progression-free survival/overall survival.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive sipuleucel-T intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on day 4. Treatment
      repeats every 2 weeks for 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive tasquinimod orally (PO) once daily (QD) beginning on day -14 and
      sipuleucel-T IV over 60 minutes on day 4. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for 3 courses in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients continue on tasquinimod
      treatment after day 42 until disease progression.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 3
      years.
