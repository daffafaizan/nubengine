      abdominal pain is associated with defecation and altered bowel habits. Although the
      pathophysiology is incompletely understood, it is generally regarded as a multifactorial
      disorder involving host factors such as low-grade immune activation, altered intestinal
      barrier function and defense. Environmental factors, including diet, are also suggested to
      play a role. Dairy products such as cow's milk are widely produced and an important component
      of the human diet. Cow's milk is composed of various macronutrients, micronutrients and
      water. Beta-casein is a major protein component of cow's milk; most cows produce a mixture of
      A1 and A2 beta-casein (conventional milk), whereas some cows produce only A2 beta-casein (A2
      milk). It has been suggested that specific components in cow's milk, such as A1 beta-casein,
      may trigger gastrointestinal symptoms after intake.

      The purpose of this randomized, double-blind, cross-over study performed in Maastricht
      University Medical Center (MUMC+) is to explore the acute and mid-terms effects of A2 milk
      versus conventional milk on gastrointestinal symptoms and immune and defense markers in
      separate groups of patient with constipation-predominant IBS and in patients with
      diarrhea-predominant IBS.
