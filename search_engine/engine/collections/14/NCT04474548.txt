      admitted to Labor and Delivery for delivery and express desire for a post-placental LNG-IUD.
      If the patient consents for study participation and meets eligibility criteria above, she
      will be enrolled in the study after achieving vaginal delivery when she is randomized to
      either IUD insertion with ultrasound or without ultrasound use. See protocol for detailed
      description of IUD placement and ultrasound use.

      After placement of IUD with or without ultrasound guidance, patients will be scheduled for a
      routine postpartum follow-up visit 6-10 weeks after delivery. At the postpartum follow-up
      visit, providers will assess for IUD expulsion with usual clinical practice, including
      history, pelvic exam, and additional imaging if IUD strings are not visualized on exam.
      Several attempts to contact participants who do not attend their postpartum visits will be
      made to attempt to reschedule appointments and conduct a phone questionnaire assessing for
      IUD expulsion.
