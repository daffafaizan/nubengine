      stones which is performed in different positions such as prone, lateral, and supine. However,
      we do not have enough evidence comparing prone and lateral positioning regarding the need for
      analgesia and onset of pain after surgery. This study was designed to evaluate whether
      patient position (lateral vs. prone) has affect on the need for analgesia and onset of pain
      after surgery.
