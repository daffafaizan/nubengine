      neurorehabilitation therapy to regain part of their former motor functional ability to
      perform everyday activities with often limited and unsatisfactory outcome. Robots became a
      promising supplement or even alternative for neurorehabilitation therapy, providing
      cost-effective, high repetition and task-oriented training. However, results of an initial
      body of work comparing the effectiveness of robotic training strategies are highly
      inconclusive. A possible explanation is that most current robotic systems cover only one
      neurorehabilitation strategy (e.g. reducing or augmenting movement errors) and may thus
      insufficiently address the subjects' individual needs and the characteristics of the task to
      be learned. In this study, Investigators will perform several motor learning experiments with
      healthy adult and neurological patients in order to evaluate the relative motor and cognitive
      benefits of newly developed robotic training strategies that modulate errors based on the
      subject's age, skill level and tasks characteristics. The effects of the new strategies will
      be compared to classical robotic assistance, and to non-robotic feedback approaches, such as
      visual feedback. The culmination of this work may help to optimize training benefits of
      already existing rehabilitation robots.
