      patients causing significant increases in morbidity, mortality, and health care costs. As
      they are usually caused by components of the normal skin flora, disinfection of the surgical
      site with an antiseptic skin preparation is standard practice prior to any surgical
      intervention. The most commonly used disinfectants are either chlorhexidine in alcoholic
      solution (CHX) or PVP iodine in alcoholic solution (PI) This prospective cluster-randomized
      multicenter cross-over trial is to prove non-inferiority of PI compared to CHX in
      preoperative skin antisepsis in abdominal and cardiothoracic surgery in regard of SSIs.
