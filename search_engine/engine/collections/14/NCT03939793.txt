      housing insecurity or trauma. Two interventions show promise for promoting behavior change
      and improving health outcomes: digital health interventions coupled with financial incentives
      (DFI) and community health workers (CHWs). Yet, these interventions have limitations; DFI
      interventions have low uptake and high attrition among vulnerable populations, while CHW
      interventions are relatively resource intensive.

      Investigators propose a 24-week randomized trial of a hybrid DFI/CHW intervention among a
      population of 150 low-income patients with diabetes. Participants will be randomized to one
      of three arms: 1) DFI intervention, 2) hybrid DFI/CHW intervention, 3) usual care.
      Participants assigned to DFI will receive a free wireless glucometer and be eligible for a
      lottery incentive if they use their glucometer. Participants assigned to the hybrid DFI/CHW
      intervention will receive the same glucometer and incentives. If they exhibit low adherence
      to self-monitoring or poor glucose control, they will also receive support from a CHW who
      would help patients to address underlying socioeconomic barriers and cope with setbacks.
      Investigators hypothesize that compared to usual care and DFI alone, the hybrid intervention
      will lead to more glucose self-monitoring and greater improvements in glycosylated
      hemoglobin.
