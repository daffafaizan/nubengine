      lean males (BMI between 18 and 25 kg/m2), of whom 12 Dutch South Asians and 12 Dutch
      Caucasians. After a medical screening, included subjects will receive 12 weeks of treatment
      with the GLP-1 analogue exenatide (Bydureon; 2 mg s.c. 1x/wk). Study subjects will visit the
      LUMC weekly. Before and after treatment there will be a study day, in which BAT (by means of
      18F-FDG PET-CT scan and MRI scan), resting energy expenditure (measured by indirect
      calorimetry) and fat mass (by bio-impedance analysis) will be measured. Moreover, blood will
      be drawn to investigate the effects of exenatide on lipid- and glucose metabolism.
