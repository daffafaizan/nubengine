      organ abnormalities including hepatic, endocrine (diabetes) and cardiac failure. In patients
      with ineffective erythropoiesis, iron overload results from the combination of increased
      intestinal absorption and transfusion. Unfortunately, physiological means to remove excess
      iron are limited, and treatments are limited to therapeutic phlebotomy and chelation therapy.
      While phlebotomy is the preferred therapy for patients with hemochromatosis, therapy for
      anemic patients is largely limited to chelation drugs. Since those drugs are frequently
      inadequate, additional iron-reduction therapies are being sought. Based upon recently
      published data in a rodent model, the purpose of this study is to determine if nifedipine
      will increase iron excretion in the urine among humans with increased levels of iron.
      Volunteers will be given a single oral dose (20mg) of nifedipine. Iron level in collections
      of urine will be measured and compared before and after nifedipine to determine if there is
      an associated increase in urinary iron excretion.
