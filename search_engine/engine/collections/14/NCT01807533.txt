    
      A total of 275 VLBW preterm infants (269 participants and 6 pilots) were recruited at three
      medical centers in northern and southern Taiwan and were randomly assigned to the FCIP or UCP
      group. Outcome assessments included primary (neurobehavioral development) and secondary
      measures (neurophysiological performance, parents' stress and transactions within the
      family). The neurophysiological and transactions data were examined for whether they mediate
      intervention effects on child development. In addition, these infants 219 VLBW preterm
      infants and 118 term infants in our prior intervention studies were collected buccal cells
      for assessment of the polymorphisms of dopamine-related genes, which are involved in the
      neurotransmission of cognitive, sensorimotor and behavioral-emotional systems and postulated
      to be associated with several developmental and psychiatric illnesses. The polymorphisms of
      dopamine-related genes were examined for potential moderating influence on the effects of the
      intervention for child development.
