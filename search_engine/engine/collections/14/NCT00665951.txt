    
      Cipla has developed two co-formulated forms of lopinavir/ritonavir for second-line
      antiretroviral therapy for children: Lopimune granules and Lopimune tablets. They contain
      100mg lopinavir and 25mg ritonavir.

      Primary objective of this study:

      To determine the pharmacokinetic profile of lopinavir and ritonavir in two different
      co-formulations (Lopimune granules and Lopimune tablets) after single-dose in HIV-negative,
      healthy adult subjects, and to compare this to the branded product.

      Secondary objective:

      To evaluate the safety of single-dose administration of the two generic co-formulations of
      lopinavir/ritonavir and compare this to the branded product.
