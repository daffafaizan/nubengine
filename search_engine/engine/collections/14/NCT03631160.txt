      follow-up design. In this study, bilateralZhongji ( CV3),Guanyuan ( CV4),Sanyinjiao ( SP6)

      evaluating the postoperative spontaneous voiding, the incidence of Postoperative
      dysuria,postoperative catheterization rate, as well as the effects on postoperative NRS pain
      and sleep quality scores . To clarify the effect of TAES on the postoperative spontaneous
