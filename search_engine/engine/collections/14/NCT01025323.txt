      the upper number- 130-139 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure 85-89mmHg- the lower number-) are
      randomly assigned to one of two groups:

      the Minimal Intervention Group- participants receive advice and printed guidelines only but
      no counseling or personalized instruction, or the Enhanced Intervention Group- participants
      receive advice and the same printed guidelines as the minimal intervention group, together
      with dietary and physical activity counseling provided by a dietician and/or coordinator,
      periodic professional reviews of their progress and personalized instructions.
