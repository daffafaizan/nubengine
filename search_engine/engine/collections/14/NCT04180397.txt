      care unit (ICU). A core element of therapy in the ICU is resuscitation with crystalloid
      solutions. In many cases fluid accumulate, and patients become fluid overloaded. Several
      observational studies indicate a detrimental effect of fluid overload in different clinical
      settings, including patients with acute kidney injury. It is unknown whether this association
      is causal or if the increased tendency to accumulate fluid is a marker of disease severity
      and thereby a higher risk of death. The investigators want to investigate this in critical
      ill patients with fluid overload of 5% or more by randomizing them to furosemide (diuretics)
      or placebo.
