      2mg/ml oral solution of midazolam containing cyclodextrin, has been developed for moderate
      sedation in paediatric patients. Population pharmacokinetics for ADV6209 is reported.

      Plasma concentration data were collected from 37 paedriatic patients and 12 healthy adults
      recruited in a single dose, open-label phase II pharmacokinetic study and in a single dose,
      randomised, open-label two-peiod crossover bioavailability study, respectively. Data were
      analysed using non-linear mixed effect modeling. Plasma concentrations of midazolam were
      discribed by a two-compartement model. An additional one-compartement model was added for a
      Î±-hydroxymidazolam.
