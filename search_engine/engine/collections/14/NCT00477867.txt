        -  Determine the feasibility of collecting data on medical resource utilization and costs
           incurred in the care of patients with stage III ovarian cancer treated with intravenous
           (IV) paclitaxel and cisplatin vs IV paclitaxel, intraperitoneal (IP) paclitaxel, and IP
           cisplatin on a randomized, controlled clinical trial.

        -  Determine the feasibility of collecting data on resource utilization incurred outside
           GOG institutions through the use of patient diaries.

        -  Assess the work load required to collect this data, in terms of mean number of hours
           required to complete medical resource utilization forms.

      OUTLINE: Data on medical resource units consumed (including length of hospital stay, length
      of time using operating room, units of drugs and blood products administered, number of
      diagnostic tests received, and number of physician visits needed) are collected on all
      patients.

      Quality of life is assessed prior to randomization on clinical trial GOG-172, prior to the
      fourth course of chemotherapy, after the sixth course of chemotherapy, and at 3 months and 6
      months after the sixth course of chemotherapy. Patients complete diaries throughout treatment
      with chemotherapy and for 12 months after treatment.

      Data collected are used for analysis of economic impact, quality of life, neurotoxicity, and
      sociologic characteristics associated with these treatment regimens.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
