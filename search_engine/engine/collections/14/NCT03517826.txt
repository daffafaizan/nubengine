      pulmonary diseases such as asthma and COPD, the main symptom is dyspnea and it causes
      activity limitation. Dyspnea is defined as the difficulty that a person experiences during
      breathing. As a result of painful situations or injuries, avoidance of physical activity or
      movement due to the fear of repetition of the problem are defined as kinesophobia. Pulmonary
      patients are compensated by reducing the rate of activity, while avoiding dyspnea.This
      reduces the severity of the symptom that precedes the symptom that may occur. As a result,
      dyspnea causes kinesyphobia. Decrease in the level of activity; social isolation, fear of
      dyspnea, depression and anxiety result in a stubborn cycle, quality of life is reduced. The
      Breathlessness Beliefs Questionnaire (BBQ) was developed based on the Tampa Kinesiophobia
      Scale to assess dyspnea and dyspnoea-related kinesophobia and anxiety in respiratory
      diseases.
