      cell specific surface antigen cluster of differentiation (CD19) resulting in the depletion of
      B cells. Inebilizumab depletes antibody-secreting plasmablasts and some plasma cells, which
      are generally CD19 positive and CD20 negative.

      The main objective of this study is to determine whether inebilizumab compare to placebo
      decreases the risk of an attack in participants with NMO/NMOSD.

      This is a multicenter, multinational, randomized, double-masked, placebo controlled study
      with an open-label extension period to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intravenous (IV)
      inebilizumab in adult participants with NMO/NMOSD. After a screening period, eligible
      participants will enter a randomized-controlled period (RCP) of maximum 197 days where they
      will be randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive either IV inebilizumab or placebo. NMO/NMOSD
      attacks will be evaluated by the investigator and confirmed against the attack criteria by an
      independent Adjudication Committee (AC). Participants for whom the attack was confirmed by
      the AC will be given the option to enroll into an open label period (OLP) with inebilizumab
      treatment. Participants who complete the RCP without experiencing an attack will be given the
      option to enroll into an OLP with inebilizumab treatment. The OLP will continue for a minimum
      of 1 year and a maximum of 3 years after the last participant enter the OLP. All participants
      who discontinue from the RCP or the OLP will continue in a Safety Follow-up for a total of 12
      months from last dose to evaluate the long-term safety of the investigational product.
