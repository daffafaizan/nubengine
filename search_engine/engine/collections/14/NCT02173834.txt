    
      The sympathetic nervous system is the primary activator of Brown Adipose Tissue.

      Obese humans are known to have less metabolically active brown adipose tissue as compared to
      their leaner counterparts.

      The reason for this diminished metabolic brown adipose tissue activity is unknown.

      However, a lower sympathetic nervous system activation to brown adipose tissue in the obese
      might explain a diminished metabolic brown adipose tissue.

      Therefore, in this study, both the sympathetic nervous system activation to brown adipose
      tissue and the metabolic activity will be measured in lean and obese subjects.

      sympathetic nervous system activity will be measured using 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine
      single-photon emission computed tomography scans, metabolic activity will be measured using
      18F- fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography CT scans.
