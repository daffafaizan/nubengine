      I. To estimate the decrease in symptoms of vaginal dryness and dyspareunia with the use of
      fluocinonide 0.05% cream in breast cancer subjects and subjects at increased risk for breast
      cancer on endocrine therapy. Estimates of decrease will be obtained utilizing patient survey
      instruments.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the decrease in symptoms of vaginal itching and the total vaginal index score
      with the use of fluocinonide 0.05% cream in breast cancer subjects and subjects at increased
      risk for breast cancer on endocrine therapy. Estimates of decrease will be obtained utilizing
      patient survey instruments.

      II. To explore toxicities reported by subjects using fluocinonide 0.05% cream via vaginal
      application.

      III. To explore correlation between subject reported compliance, as well as compliance via
      measurement of the amount of fluocinonide 0.05% cream used, and response rates with the use
      of fluocinonide 0.05% cream.

      IV. To explore the correlations between patient characteristics and response rates with the
      use of fluocinonide 0.05% cream.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients apply topical fluocinonide cream twice daily (BID) in weeks 1-2 and once daily (QD)
      in weeks 3-4.
