      sleeplessness, poor concentration, and anxiety. The addition of modafinil, a promising
      pharmacologic agent, may enhance the effectiveness of NRT by further reducing inattention and
      depressed mood. The purpose of this study is to examine the safety of using both modafinil
      and NRT in treating nicotine dependent adolescents. In addition, this study will examine the
      effects of modafinil and NRT, alone and in combination, on alleviating symptoms of
      inattention and depressed mood.

      Participants in this 12-day dose escalation study will be tested under eight different dose
      conditions. Modafinil and NRT will first be tested alone; participants will be exposed to low
      doses prior to higher doses of medication. Various modafinil-NRT dose combinations will then
      be tested. Modafinil will be administered at 5 p.m. each day, and NRT will be
      self-administered at the start of each day in which a participant must complete lab tests.
      The following measures will be obtained at study visits occurring before and after the
      various modafinil-NRT dose combinations: nicotine withdrawal symptoms, medication side
      effects, activity level, cardiovascular response, and profile of mood states (POMS).
