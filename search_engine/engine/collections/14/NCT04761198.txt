    
      This is an open-label, phase 1b/2, multicenter study designed to evaluate the efficacy,
      safety, tolerability, PK, and pharmacodynamics of etigilimab in combination with nivolumab in
      subjects with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. Subjects will be assigned to
      receive etigilimab (every 2 weeks) in combination with nivolumab (240 mg every 2 weeks) and
      will continue until either unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Subjects may
      continue to receive treatment beyond documented RECIST 1.1 or disease progression. Subjects
      who are both CPI (checkpoint inhibitor) na√Øve as well as subjects who have received or
      progressed following a CPI will be eligible and include the following tumor types: head and
      neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), cervical carcinoma, gastric or gastroesophageal
      carcinoma, endometrial carcinoma, tumor mutation burden high (TMB-H) and select rare tumors.
