    
      This study is a multicenter, prospective, open-label, randomized controlled, blinded-endpoint
      trial with two parallel groups and a 3-month follow-up. A total of 200 eligible participants
      recruited from 4-6 stroke centers will be randomly allocated to either an experimental group
      (intravenous tirofiban + MT therapy) or a control group (MT alone) in a 1:1 ratio. The
      primary outcome is a composite endpoint, including the rate of recanalisation after the first
      embolectomy and the risk of symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage. The secondary outcomes
      include clinical and neuroimaging outcomes, procedure-related complications, and adverse
      events to evaluate the effects of MT in combination with tirofiban treatment compared to MT
      alone in AIS patients. Intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis will be undertaken in this study,
      and the full analysis set (FAS) population serves as the primary population for the analysis
      of efficacy data.
