      response to successful therapies, such as chemoradiation, and have been demonstrated to be
      early predictors not only of therapeutic response, but also of overall survival for other
      malignancies. Our long-term goal is to use these imaging techniques to develop non-invasive
      functional imaging methodologies that would be better predictors of pathological response
      than the current clinical standard.
