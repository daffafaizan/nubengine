    
      18 newly diagnosed hypothyroid female patients and 18 healthy controls age between 20 and 75
      years will be recruited from the out-patients clinic in Herlev and Gentofte Hospital and the
      general practitioners before start of substitution therapy.

      The study is devided in to three identical experimental days of approx. 6 hours. First
      experimental day placed before T4 treatment is initiated. Second day as soon as Thyroid
      Stimulating Hormone (TSH) is below 4 milli unit pr liter (mU/l). The Third experimental day
      after 6 months of T4 therapy.

      For 5-7 days before each experimental day, the participants' physical activity energy
      expenditure (PAEE) will be monitored by an Actiheart® pedometer attached to the skin of the
      chest.

      The last two days before each experimental day, the participants will follow a standardised
      diet following World Health Organization guidelines on energy requirements and nutrient
      composition according to gender, age and body weight Shortly after diagnosis patients will
      undergo a test panel at the first experimental day, where patients arrives fasting.

      Visual analog score on satiety and thirst will be filled out continuously. REE will be
      measured by a CCM-express calorimeter,

        -  Dual Energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA)-scan

        -  Blood samples will be taken continuously during the experimental day. Gall bladder size
           will be examined at 6 times during the experimental day using ultra sound.

      At the end of the day, patients´ satiety will be examined with an ad libitum meal.

      Blood will be analysed for Gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP), Glucagon-like Peptide 1
      (GLP-1), Glucagon-like Peptide 2 (GLP-2), glucagon, peptide tyrosine tyrosine (PYY), Gastrin,
      Cholesystokinin (CCK), Insulin, C-peptide, Blood sugar, Cholesterol, Free fatty acids and
      paracetamol.
