      critically ill patients. There's a growing global burden of critical illness especially in
      the low-income coun-tries where critical care services are limited. Despite advances in
      critical care, the mortality in Uganda remains very high, with sepsis and trauma as the major
      contributors. There's paucity of literature regarding ICUs characteristics, disease burden
      and patient characteristics which could be contributing to the high mortality.

      Objectives To describe the functional characteristics of the ICUs in Uganda. To determine the
      ICU mortality of critically ill patients in Uganda. To determine the risk factors of
      mortality of patients admitted in the ICU Methods A prospective cohort study will be carried
      out in all ICUs in Uganda. All new patients in the ICUs will be recruited into the study.
      Data will be collected onto two separate questionnaires, one for patient characteristics and
      the second for ICU functional characteristics. The patient's data will be collected within
      the first 24 hours and patients will be followed up for death\discharge within 28 days in the
      ICU. The data will be collected from the patients' charts and entered into Epidata.
