      inner canthus of their eye and middle finger nail bed, representing a baseline of core and
      peripheral temperatures, respectively. They will also have their metabolic rate measured via
      a canopy hood method. At their initial visit, they will be randomized to either a colder
      environment (66-68°F) or a warmer environment (77-79°F) under the artifice of monitoring
      routine office work with abnormal temperature conditions. Their knowledge of the experiment
      will be limited until the end. They will experience this temperature while filling out
      paperwork and performing basic office tasks for a 7 hour work day. At the beginning and end
      of each day they will fill out a questionnaire on their appetite and thermal comfort. After
      the first 3.5 hours, another thermal image will be taken and the participant will be
      presented with lasagna and water and directed to eat at their leisure and subsequently finish
      the office tasks over the next 3.5 hours. A thermal image will be taken and metabolic rate
      will be assessed at the end of the day. Snacks will be available throughout the day. The
      participants will return approximately 1 week later to experience the other thermal
      environment following the same protocols. The participants will then be debriefed on the
      parameters of the experiment and body measurements will be taken at the end so as to prevent
      bias of the subject by limiting their food intake. We will quantify energy intake by weighing
      remaining food and comparing to known caloric content by weight from bomb calorimetry tests.
      The infrared thermal images will determine whether the temperatures experienced were extreme
      enough to initiate a change in thermoregulation.
