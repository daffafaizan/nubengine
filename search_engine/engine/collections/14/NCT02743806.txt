      who have ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease. This study will monitor ongoing safety in the
      people who take vedolizumab.

      Participants who have successfully completed the participation in qualifying vedolizumab
      clinical studies will be enrolled and assigned to receive:

      â€¢ Vedolizumab 300 mg

      All participants will receive an intravenous infusion once every 8 weeks until vedolizumab is
      available through commercial channels, including reimbursement, for the participant's
      clinical scenario, or until participant withdrawal, whichever comes first. (Per MM approval,
      dosing regiman may be modified) This multicenter trial will be conducted worldwide.
      Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic and a final visit at 18 weeks after
      receiving the last dose of study infusion of vedolizumab for a safety follow-up assessment.
