    
      Takayasu vasculitis is a systemic inflammatory disease that causes progressive thickening and
      stenosis of large and medium-sized arteries (the aorta and its branches, as well as the
      pulmonary arteries). The classic histological aspect corresponds to a chronic inflammation
      localized to the arterial wall. Vascular imaging plays an important role in the diagnosis and
      monitoring of these patients. Although Doppler ultrasound, MRI and computed tomography can
      simply assess recognized inflammation criteria, such as thickening or signal intensity of the
      arterial wall, to recognize Takayasu vasculitis in the early stages of inflammation of the
      disease, there is no clear correlation between the presence of these signs and the activity
      or progression of the disease.

      However, assessment of Takayasu vasculitis activity is difficult in daily practice because
      symptoms, physical examination, and biological parameters may not reliably reflect vascular
      inflammation. Finally, unlike other small- and medium-vessel vasculitis, histology is rarely
      available to diagnose and evaluate the activity of patients with Takayasu vasculitis.

      In order to identify local markers of disease activity, contrast ultrasound (with injection
      of SonoVueÂ® microbubbles) has shown its ability to visualize the presence of micro-vessels
      within the carotid wall. Ultrafast Ultrasound Imaging provides a more accurate exploration of
      the small vasorum vessels compared to contrast ultrasound. This technology has already been
      the subject of a study on cerebral microvasculature. In its application on the carotid wall,
      it will allow easier quantification than conventional ultrasound, by a signal analysis in
      ultrafast Doppler and not on the gray level, much more variable.
