      provides an alternative method for quantifying liver stiffness. ARFI US has been shown in a
      small pilot investigation in Europe in children to be reliable and rapid in estimating
      moderate to severe liver stiffness using histology as a reference gold standard. ARFI
      measures the speed of a shear wave in the examined tissue, expressed in m/s. This shear wave
      velocity can be mathematically converted into a liver stiffness value, which can then be used
      to estimate degree of liver fibrosis. The technique is non-invasive, uses no ionizing
      radiation, and is fast (several minutes to complete). It is possible that ARFI US will be
      more accurate than MRE in quantifying liver stiffness. In addition, ARFI US will ultimately
      be a less expensive clinical test, shorter in duration, and will not require
      sedation/anesthesia in younger children as MRE requires.
