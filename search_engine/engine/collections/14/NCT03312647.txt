      This study is prospective study of newly diagnosed LTBI in HCWs at Hanyang University
      Hospital, a tertiary referral hospital in South Korea, between 2017 and 2018. This study
      aimed to identify the prevalence of adverse reactions of treatment regimen for LTBI. The
      diagnosis of LTBI was made on the basis of interferon-gamma releasing assay. Information on
      demographic characteristics, comorbidity and treatment outcomes was collated from
      questionnaires. Treatment regimen for LTBI was chosen by patients' preference among 3 months
      of INH(isoniazid) plus RFP(rifampin), 4 months of RFP and 9 months of INH. All PTB patients
      were observed 2 weeks after the initiation of medication, and monthly thereafter, and were
      asked about any drug side effects at these visits. Serious adverse drug reaction (ADR) was
      defined as any severe side effect that resulted in discontinuation or change (either
      temporally or permanently) of anti-TB medication, and/or directly resulted in
      hospitalization. Drug-induced hepatitis was defined as liver transaminases more than three
      times higher than the upper limit of normal in the presence of symptoms such as anorexia,
      nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain, or transaminases more than five times the upper limit of
      normal without symptoms.
