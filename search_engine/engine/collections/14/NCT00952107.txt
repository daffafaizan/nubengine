    
      To perform a pilot study of the FLAREâ„¢ NIR fluorescence imaging system in conjunction with
      indocyanine green (ICG) during breast reconstructive surgery utilizing deep inferior
      epigastric perforator (DIEP) flaps.

      Due to patient-to-patient anatomic variation, the vascular perfusion to the cutaneous
      elements in flaps is unpredictable and of great concern to the surgeon planning the design of
      the flap. We propose a method of imaging the flap based on the use of invisible near-infrared
      fluorescent light that has significant advantages for both patient and surgeon.

      Specific Aims:

      A pilot optimization study of the imaging system in combination with ICG to determine optimal
      dose, light excitation fluence rate, and camera exposure time.
