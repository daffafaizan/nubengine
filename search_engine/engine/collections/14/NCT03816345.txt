      I. To assess the overall safety, including the incidence of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), and
      other toxicities associated with the use of the anti-programmed death 1 (PD-1) antibody
      nivolumab in patients with varying severity of dermatomyositis (DM)/systemic sclerosis (SSc),
      rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), inflammatory bowel disease
      (IBD) (ulcerative colitis [UC] and Crohn's disease [CD]), multiple sclerosis (MS), Sjogren's
      syndrome [SjS], and other autoimmune diseases.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the efficacy of nivolumab in terms of objective response rates (ORRs),
      progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) in patients with cancer and
      DM/SSc, RA, SLE, IBD (UC and CD), MS, SjS, and other autoimmune diseases.

      II. To observe and record anti-tumor activity. III. To propose dosing recommendations for
      anti-PD-1 antibodies based on the severity of the autoimmune disorder.

      IV. To evaluate the impact of nivolumab on the disease severity indices for: DM/SSc, RA, SLE,
      IBD: UC and CD, not specified (NS), MS.

      V. To perform molecular profiling assays on malignant and normal tissues, including, but not
      limited to, ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing, in order to: identify potential predictive and
      prognostic biomarkers beyond any genomic alteration by which treatment may be assigned, and
      identify resistance mechanisms using genomic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)- and ribonucleic
      acid (RNA)-based assessment platforms.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes every 4 weeks for up to 2 years
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 100 days.
