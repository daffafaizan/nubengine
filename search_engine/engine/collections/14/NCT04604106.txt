      potentially harmful impact of repeated and prolonged (more than three hours) general
      anesthesia on the child's brain. The potential impact of anesthesia highlights the importance
      of remediating the need for repeated and prolonged surgery with accompanying anesthesia
      exposure in a time of cerebral vulnerability and if possible, delay exposure to avoid
      potentially preventable harm. Therefore, it is crucial to better understand the impact of
      (different durations and frequencies of) anesthesia exposure on neurodevelopment.
