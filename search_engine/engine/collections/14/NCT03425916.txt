      of the abdominal and pelvic floor muscles. The distension of the muscular tissue and the
      possible diastasis recti can alter the performance of the abdominal musculature in the
      control of intra-abdominal pressure and the lumbo-pelvic stabilization in postpartum term.
      Abdominal exercise is highly recommended to restore these changes but there is not enough
      evidence about the effects of exercise modalities.
