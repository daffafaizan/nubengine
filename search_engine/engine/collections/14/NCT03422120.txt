    
      Rationale:

      The purpose of this program is to obtain consent for and to outline the process for
      collection of fresh blood sample from healthy humans and colorectal cancer patients before
      and after surgical resection.

      Procurement of fresh human blood is required for the following:

        -  To compare NK cell function, measured by two different assays, in healthy humans and
           newly diagnosed colorectal cancer patients at the Ottawa Hospital.

        -  To compare NK cell function, measure by two different assays in colorectal surgery
           patients preoperatively and at various time points postoperatively.
