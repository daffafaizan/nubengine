      chronic widespread pain and insomnia. Sample will include 20 patients ([18]-65 years) who
      satisfy criteria for chronic widespread pain and insomnia. Participants will be randomly
      assigned to CBT or waitlist control. All participants randomized to the cognitive-behavioral
      interventions will receive 4 treatment sessions (~50 minutes each). Baseline, posttreatment,
      [& 3-mo.] follow-up assessments will include measures of sleep, pain, thermal pain response,
