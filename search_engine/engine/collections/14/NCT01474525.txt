      diabetes mellitus (GDM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2). High levels of blood glucose in
      pregnancy may lead to complications during delivery and pose threat to the fetus. The
      self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) by patients at home is used to provide clinicians
      with information to make adjustments to treatment plans. Patients record the values and
      present them at their next meeting with the physician. As such, SMBG by the patients is an
      important part of disease management and a method for clinicians to follow a patient's
      day-to-day response to a treatment regime.

      The system is designed to send the blood glucose values from the patients' glucometers
      wirelessly to the server where they can be viewed by the patients' health care providers. The
      system generates automated adherence reminders to patients and alert messages to both
      patients and their care providers. The system will provide clinicians with better access to
      the patient data, so that they may better manage their case loads, make timely clinical
      decisions, and ultimately provide better patient care.
