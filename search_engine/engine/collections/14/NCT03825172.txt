      infraumbilical surgery in children. Although it can be carried out safely and easily, many
      complications have been described so far, because of inaccurate needle injections. To perform
      a successful block, a good caudal epidural anatomic assessment is essential. Ultrasonography
      is an important tool to perform pediatric regional blocks, including caudal blocks. We
      believe that caudal epidural ultrasound evaluation can be an important option to decrease
      complications and to achieve a successful attempt; due to that we will try to describe caudal
      epidural ultrasound imaging and changes from one month to 84 months.
