    
      To conduct an 8-week, open label study of N-acetylcysteine for the treatment of depressive
      symptoms in youth at high risk for bipolar disorder, with resting state functional magnetic
      resonance imaging (fMRI) examinations at baseline and endpoint. This proposal is innovative
      because it investigates the efficacy and tolerability of a novel pharmacological treatment in
      youth offspring of bipolar disorder, and examines the neurophysiology of predictors of mood
      disorders in youth at high risk for bipolar disorder. This study will obtain pilot data to
      propose a larger, neuroimaging-based, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of
      N-acetylcysteine in youth at high risk for bipolar disorder. The expected outcome, that
      N-acetylcysteine will be efficacious in ameliorating depressive symptoms in youth at high
      risk for bipolar disorder, and that it will demonstrate improvement in functional
      connectivity within the left frontostriatal circuit associated with treatment response.
