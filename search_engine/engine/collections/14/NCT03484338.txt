    
      ART is an evidence-based therapy for the treatment of depressive symptoms and trauma and
      stress-related disorders that includes the core components of trauma-focused therapy
      including imaging rescripting, voluntary image replacement, guided visualization with use of
      eye movements, desensitization and processing of distressing memories, and in-vitro exposure
      to future feared triggers. Mental health professionals are delivering ART in clinical
      practice to assist with grief; however, there is a need for formal research evaluation of the
      effects of ART on complicated grief and psychological distress.
