      Too little evidence to show whether oxygen administration to the woman during labour is
      beneficial to the baby.

      Some babies show signs of distress, such as unusual heart rates or the passing of a bowel
      motion (meconium) during their mother's labour. This may be caused by a lack of oxygen
      passing from the woman to the baby through the placenta. Sometimes, women may be encouraged
      to breathe extra oxygen through a facemask (oxygen administration) to increase the oxygen
      available to the unborn baby. A review of two trials found too little evidence to show
      whether oxygen administration to the woman during the second stage of labour is beneficial to
      the baby. No trials of oxygen administration when the baby is showing signs of distress were
      found. Further research is needed.
