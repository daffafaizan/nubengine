    
      The specific aim of this study is to evaluate the intermittent non-invasive measurements of
      pulmonary function: pulmonary blood flow (PBF), functional residual capacity (FRC), shunt
      fraction index (Qsi) and airway dead space measured by the VQm PHMâ„¢ compared to known
      clinical standards. PBF will be compared to continuous and intermittent bolus thermodilution
      cardiac output as measured through a Swan-Ganz catheter. FRC will be compared to an FRC
      measurement provided by the ventilator (GE Healthcare, FRC INview software module). Qsi will
      be compared to shunt fraction calculated through mixed venous and arterial blood gas values
      (VBGs/ABGs). Airway dead space will be compared to an airway dead space measurement provided
      by the ventilator (GE Healthcare, Vent Calculations software module).
