    
      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of the probiotic B. subtilis DE111Â®
      for regulation of bowel movements. A single capsule containing 1 x 10^9 CFU B. subtilis is to
      be consumed once a day per participant. 50 adults (18-65 years of age at the time of
      participation) suffering from occasional constipation and/or diarrhea will be enrolled.
      Participants will be double-blindly and randomly assigned to either the probiotic (Bacillus
      subtilis) or the placebo (maltodextrin) group. Efficacy will be assessed with
      participant-reported bowel movement (BM) records. As a secondary outcome, the study will
      provide further insight into the tolerance of the supplement. Tolerance will be assessed
      using a digestive health questionnaire and blood samples to analyze pertinent metabolic
      biomarkers. Participants will be asked to complete a daily dietary intake record as well.
      Prior to capsule consumption, participants will complete a two-week pre-testing phase in
      order to provide a more inclusive diagnostic baseline. This phase will consist of daily BM
      and dietary intake record keeping.
