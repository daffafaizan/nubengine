      efficacy of two psychological stop smoking interventions. Specifically, Allen Carr's Easyway
      smoking cessation programme comprising one 5/6 hour group session (plus one or two 3 hour
      booster sessions over the following 3 months for those who require them) and a 1-1
      counselling service available via the NHS (comprising one 30 minute session and four weekly
      follow ups of 10-15 minutes) will be compared. The efficacy of both treatments will be
      followed up at 4, 12 and 26 weeks after treatment. The evaluation will be compliant with the
      Russell 6 Standard (which requires, amongst other things, a double blind, randomised design,
      chemical verification of quit outcomes, and the inclusion of all participants who received
      treatment in the final analysis). The findings will add to the evidence base around the use
      of the Allen Carr method, in particular by testing it in non-commercial settings.
