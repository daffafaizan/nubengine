      with metastatic or recurrent unresectable non-small cell lung cancer. II. Determine the
      toxicity of this regimen in these patients. III. Determine if the hypothesized lack of social
      support impacts the recruitment of elderly patients into clinical trials. IV. Determine if a
      previously validated tool of functional status in the elderly predicts treatment related
      toxicity superior to that predicted by the ECOG performance status in this patient
      population.
