    
      -  The investigators plan to study the impact of higher-dose oseltamivir (150 mg b.d.)
           treatment on rate of viral load decline and RNA negativity (in nasal and throat swabs,
           assessed by quantitative RT-PCR assay) and time to clinical recovery in adult patients
           hospitalized for severe influenza.

        -  Patients who received intervention (oseltamivir 150 mg b.d. for 5 days) will be compared
           to those in the non-intervention arm (patients may receive oseltamivir treatment at 75
           mg b.d. for 5 days, decided by their managing physicians) in the two respective study
           sites. Viral load changes and viral clearance will be compared. Clinical progress and
           time to symptom recovery will be reported. The protocol will be crossed-over to the
           other site at a defined time frame.

        -  oseltamivir 150 mg b.d. has been shown to be safe and well-tolerated in earlier clinical
           trials

        -  higher-dose treatment has been suggested by health authorities (e.g. WHO) to treat
           severe influenza infection/pneumonia.
