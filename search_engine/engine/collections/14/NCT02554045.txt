      treatment + 8 follow-up)

      At baseline, after 8 and 16 weeks the following evaluations will be assessed: general
      physical examination and anthropometric parameters i.e., body weight (BW), height, BMI, and
      waist circumference (WC). Every eight weeks, body composition was calculated by using a whole
      body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA-HOLOGIC QDR-1000) according to the instructions
      of the manufacturer and standardized procedures, and the individual Total Fat Mass (FM)
      variation has been expressed as delta-variation (%) from baseline. Abdominal fat mass
      (distrectual, described as R1) was calculated by using arbitrary area of the square chosen by
      tracing of an ideal line joining last inferior ribs and anterior superior iliac spines.
      Calibration with the manufacturer's spine phantom and quality control analysis were performed
      daily. Fat Mass was expressed in grams per square centimeter (g/cm2) and result expressed as
      variation in percentage. Secondary outcomes were variations forom baseline of IIEF-5, total
      testosterone, estradiol and testosterone /estradiol ratios.

      STATISTICAL EVALUATION With a two-sided alpha value of 5% and power of 90%, a sample size of
      20 subjects per arm would be able to detect a 2% variation in the percentage of body lean and
      fat mass from the baseline at upper waist section (for fat mass) and overall body composition
      (for lean mass). Also, we tested for the differences between treatment groups by using
      analysis of variance for repeated measures. Statistical analysis was performed by using the
      computer statistical package SPSS 11.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL).
