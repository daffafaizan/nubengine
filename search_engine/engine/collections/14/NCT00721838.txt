      virtually unknown. The main trial of the Teen-LABS consortium is not studying dietary intake
      and eating behavior before and after bariatric surgery. The consortium, however, provides a
      unique opportunity to investigate these issues in a large and diverse sample through the
      context of the proposed ancillary study.
