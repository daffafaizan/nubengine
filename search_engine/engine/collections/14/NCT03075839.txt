      paradigm to examine how switching adult smokers from menthol to non-menthol cigarettes
      impacts smoking behavior and satisfaction. Smoking behavior will be measured by self-reported
      total number of cigarettes and time to first cigarette in the morning, assessed during the
      period of menthol smoking (week 1) and again after switching to non-menthol cigarettes (weeks
      2, 3). Smoking satisfaction will be measured by self-reported ratings of the cigarettes,
      assessed during the period of menthol smoking (week 1) and again after switching to
      non-menthol cigarettes (weeks 2, 3).
