      I.To assess disease control rate (DCR) after treatment.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I.To assess best overall response rate (ORR) after treatment. II.To evaluate the
      progression-free survival (PFS) of patients with extensive stage-small cell lung cancer
      (ES-SCLC) treated with paclitaxel + simvastatin or with paclitaxel alone.

      III.To estimate overall survival (OS) of patients with ES-SCLC. IV. To evaluate the toxicity
      profile of paclitaxel + simvastatin.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I.To evaluate biomarkers correlatives. II.To explore the mechanism of paclitaxel +
      simvastatin in the treatment of chemotherapy-resistant participants with ES-SCLC.

      OUTLINE: Patients are divided into two arms. ARM A: Participants received intravenous
      infusions of Paclitaxel 260 milligrams per square meter (mg/m^2) on Day 1 of every 21-day
      cycle in combination with oral simvastatin (20mg daily) until persistent radiographic PD,
      symptomatic deterioration, intolerable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, death, or study
      termination by the Sponsor.

      ARM B:Participants received intravenous infusions of Paclitaxel 260 mg/m^2 alone on Day 1 of
      every 21-day cycle until persistent radiographic PD, symptomatic deterioration, intolerable
      toxicity, withdrawal of consent, death, or study termination by the Sponsor.
