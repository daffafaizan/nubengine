      maleic acid pyrrole for his piece of HER-2 positive treatment of advanced breast cancer
      treatment, observation and verification maleic acid pyrrole for his piece for a line or a
      single drug resistance by bead in the real diagnosis and treatment in patients with advanced
      breast cancer environment and the efficacy and safety of new treatments. Biomarkers of breast
      cancer prognosis are of great significance in predicting the degree of malignancy, metastasis
      and recurrence of breast cancer, as well as guiding clinical treatment programs.This study
      will explore the prognostic factors and curative effect of breast cancer patients from
      multiple aspects, explore the dominant population of breast cancer patients with pyrrolidone
      maleate, and provide the theoretical basis for individualized treatment for clinical
      treatment practice.
