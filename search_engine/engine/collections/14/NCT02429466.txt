    
      Primary Objective:

      To assess the safety and toxicity of guadecitabine (SGI-110) plus cisplatin including the
      dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and to determine the Maximum tolerated dose (MTD)

      Secondary Objective:

      To assess the efficacy of guadecitabine (SGI-110) to resume sensitivity to cisplatin in
      refractory GCT

      Correlative Objective:

      To evaluate the pharmacodynamic activity of guadecitabine (SGI-110) Evaluate miRNA biomarkers
      in serum on day 1 of cycles 1-6

      Intervention and Mode of Delivery: Guadecitabine (SGI-110) will be given subcutaneously,
      daily, 30 mg/m2 on days (1-5) followed by cisplatin 100mg/m2 on day 8 every 4 weeks.

      Duration of Intervention and Evaluation:

      Treatment will be continued for a maximum of 6 cycles or until disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity whichever occurs first. Subjects who are responding to therapy without
      major toxicty would be allowed to continue on single agent guadecitabine (SGI-110) at the MTD
      after 4-6 cycles of the combination therapy until disease progression. Subjects will be
      followed after the last cycle every 2 months for the 1st year, and every 4 months thereafter
      until death (expected overall survival less than 12 months).
