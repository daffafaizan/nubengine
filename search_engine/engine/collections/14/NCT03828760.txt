      IUD insertion. The experimental group will receive music, self-selected, with a music-playing
      device prior and during the procedure and the control group will receive standard care. Data
      for pain and anxiety will be collected prior to the procedure, and during, and after IUD
      insertion. In addition, a post-procedure questionnaire will be given to patients and
      providers to ask about satisfaction and acceptability of the intervention.
