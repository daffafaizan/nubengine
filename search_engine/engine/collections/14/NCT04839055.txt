      States, PCa has the highest morbidity in man. In China, the incidence rate is lower than in
      Europe and the US, but it is growing faster and faster. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)
      has been the most commonly used treatment for men with advanced prostate cancer for hundreds
      of years, effective in more than 85 percent of cases, but usually after 20 months or so, half
      of patients will inevitably develop castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), which will
      become resistant to ADT, and patients will relapse. There are several treatments that are
      trying to address this problem. Such as the chemotherapy docetaxel, cabataxel, and the
      radioactive drug radium 223 dichloride; PARP inhibitor olaparib, but the efficacy is limited.

      For finding some new pathways and targets to treat CRPC, a model of PCa persister cell was
      first been established at a cellular level in this study. In light of the new target, we
      first find a being used clinically drug, Coenzyme A (CoA), through prescription sieve to
      treat enzalutamide or abiraterone drug-fast CRPC patients. CoA functions as an acyl group
      carrier and assists in transferring fatty acids from the cytoplasm to mitochondria. It is
      also involved in the oxidation and catabolism of fatty acids. There is an efficient drug
      action at a cellular level and in animals, and we look forward to it at clinical utility.
