      significant morbidity and mortality.1 Surgical reduction and fixation are the definitive
      treatment in most patients.2 Effective perioperative analgesia that minimizes the need for
      opioids and related adverse effects (such as delirium) is essential in this patient
      population.

      Regional analgesic techniques, including femoral nerve (FN) block, fascia iliaca block (FIB),
      and 3-in-1 FN block, are popular analgesic strategies, due mainly to their opioid-sparing
      effects and reduction in opioid-related adverse effects. The effect size of analgesia from
      these blocks is only moderate, and literature suggests that the obturator nerve (ON) is not
      covered.

      The anterior hip capsule is innervated by the ON, accessory obturator nerve (AON), and FN as
      reported by previous anatomic studies. The anterior capsule is the most richly innervated
      section of the joint, suggesting these nerves should be the main targets for hip analgesia. A
      recent anatomical study by Short et al15 confirmed the innervation of the anterior hip by
      these 3 main nerves but also found that the AON and FN play a greater role in the anterior
      hip innervation than previously reported. This study also identified the relevant landmarks
      for those articular branches. The high articular branches from FN and AON are consistently
      found between the anterior inferior iliac spines (AIIS) and the iliopubic eminence (IPE),
      whereas the ON , close to the inferomedial acetabulum. Using this information, the
      investigator developed an ultrasound-guided technique for blockade of these articular
      branches to the hip, the PENG (PEricapsular Nerve Group) block. In this study, the
      investigator will examine the efficacy of PENG block in hip surgeries as a post-operative
      pain management technique in comparison with fascia Iliaca block in hip surgeries
