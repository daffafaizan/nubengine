    
      Patients receive epacadostat orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on Days 1 to 21 and pembrolizumab
      intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on Day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days for up to 24 months
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 9 weeks for
      18 months, and then every 12 weeks thereafter.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      Assess 6-month progression free survival (PFS).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        -  To evaluate objective response rate (RR) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
           (RECIST) version (v) 1.1 and immune-related response criteria (irRC).

        -  Evaluate overall survival (OS).

        -  Assess the safety and tolerability of epacadostat in combination with pembrolizumab by
           National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)
           v4.03.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the responder rate defined as the proportion of subjects with an increased
           ratio of CD8+ to Treg cells in on-treatment compared with pre-treatment biopsies.

        -  Identify putative immunologic biomarkers of tumor response.
