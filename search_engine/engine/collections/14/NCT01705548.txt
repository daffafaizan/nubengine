    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      To demonstrate the safety and feasibility of treating brain metastases or resection cavities
      greater than 3 cm with hypofractionated radiosurgery and to determine the maximum-tolerated
      radiation dose for hypofractionated radiosurgery (HR) delivered in 5 fractions, 2-3 fractions
      per week.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients undergo hypofractionated stereotactic radiosurgery 2-3 times weekly (5 fractions
      total) for 2-3 weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 month and then every 3
      months thereafter.
