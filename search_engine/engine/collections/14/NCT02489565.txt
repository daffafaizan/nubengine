      disease from a tertiary hospital with outpatient discharge criteria. The purpose is to
      compare the use of telemedicine in the quality of care transition between tertiary care and
      primary care patients (intervention group), with patients who remain in the outpatient clinic
      of a tertiary hospital (control group).
