    
      This is an observational study of cervical cytology assessment, high risk human papilloma
      virus (hr-HPV) status, and HPV antibody titres amongst adult women living with perinatally
      acquired HIV infection (PaHIV). Eligible consenting participants will have two samples taken;
      firstly, a cervical sample tested for cytology and Hr-HPV with the Cepheid GeneXpert HPV;
      secondly serum will be assessed for hr-HPV serology. All women with PaHIV, vaccinated and
      unvaccinated for HPV, over the age of 18 years will be eligible and will be recruited into
      one of two cohorts: (1) sexually active women: full study, cervical and blood sampling (n=50)
      or (2) non-sexually active women, blood sampling only (n=30). Follow up for abnormal smear
      results or hr-HPV positivity will be arranged through colposcopy.
