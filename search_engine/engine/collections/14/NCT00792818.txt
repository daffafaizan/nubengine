      humans. It may exert its anti-inflammatory activity by inhibition of a number of different
      molecules that play a role in inflammation.

      Our experience in a study of 100 subjects revealed a trend towards a greater effect in OA
      patients receiving Curcuma domestica extracts. However, studies with adequate sample and
      dosage of Ibuprofen are recommended to demonstrate the efficacy of C.domestica extracts in
      alleviating knee pain and improving knee functions.

      The objective of the study was to determine the efficacy and safety of C.domestica extracts
      in pain reduction and functional improvement in patients with knee osteoarthritis.
