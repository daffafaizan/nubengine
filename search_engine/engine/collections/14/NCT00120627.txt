      intervention. In this study, the MRP was delivered in addition to usual care (defined as case
      management and medication) in a 6-week (90 minutes/week) group setting. The MRP was compared
      to usual care only.

      This 4-year study employed a mixed-methods, prospective, randomized controlled trial with
      qualitative phone interviews at 3 months post-intervention to explore ways that the
      intervention was used. Outpatient Veterans (N=146) with military-related PTSD were recruited
      from a single VA site and randomly assigned to the experimental arm (n=71) which consisted of
      usual care and the mantram program versus usual care only control group (n=76).
