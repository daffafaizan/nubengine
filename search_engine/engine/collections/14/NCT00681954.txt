      death. The precise mechanisms of TRALI are uncertain. We hypothesize that TRALI is a full
      spectrum of lung injury. One theory holds that the infusion of cytokines associated with the
      transfusion of stored blood combined with the trauma and stress of surgery produce lung
      injury. We propose to examine lung function following transfusion, and that stored blood (and
      by implication, cytokines) injures the lung. TRALI is a rare condition and we do not expect
      any of the patients that we observe will develop TRALI. We are merely observing their
      pulmonary function closely to see if there are any mild changes.

      Patients will be randomized into three groups based on whether or not they have pre-donated
      blood for the surgery. Once divided into these groups they are randomized to one of three
      groups with patients in the first group randomized to receive their stored (either autologous
      or allogeneic) "unwashed" blood first in the operating room using the standard cell salvage
      system. The second group will receive their stored (either autologous or allogeneic) "washed"
      blood first and the third group will receive blood from the cell salvage system first. Those
      who get the stored blood first will get the cell salvage blood as their second transfusion
      and those that get the cell salvage blood first will get stored "unwashed" blood as the
      second transfusion in the operating room. We will closely monitor pulmonary function and
      oxygenation, and try to observe whether there is early evidence of lung changes. If there is
      evidence of lung changes, then the blood is tested for cytokines and antibodies.
