    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the association between the primary breast tumor protein expression of MYC,
      IGF-1R, and PTEN and disease-free survival (DFS) in patients randomized on clinical trial
      NCCTG-N9831.

      II. To determine the association between the primary breast tumor amplification status of MYC
      and TOP2A and DFS in patients randomized on NCCTG-N9831.

      III. To determine the association between the primary breast tumor mutation status of PIK3
      and DFS in patients randomized on NCCTG-N9831.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the association between the primary breast tumor marker protein
      expression/amplification/mutation status of the aforementioned markers and overall survival
      in patients randomized on NCCTG-N9831.

      II. To investigate the predictive potential of multiple marker analyses on DFS and overall
      survival using multivariate analysis.

      III. To determine the correlation between the protein expression and amplification status of
      MYC in patients randomized on NCCTG-N9831.

      IV. To determine the correlation between marker protein expression/amplification/mutation
      status and known clinicopathological characteristics of the tumors.
