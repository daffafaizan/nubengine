      for nutrition change and one for activity change) will follow and assessments over a time
      period of 12 to 20 weeks will be conducted afterwards. Study participants in the intervention
      groups receive an interactive, computerized expert system (Intervention Group, IG).
      Individuals in the waiting control group (WCG) get nothing. Employees (N = 1000) will be
      recruited at their regular medical appointment. Study participants will be followed up over
      three measurement points: One to nine weeks after T1, T2 will take place. Five to 13 weeks
      after T1 the T3 measurement will be conducted.

      The hypotheses are: In comparison to the WCG the employees in the IG are expected to have a
      higher motivation, to adopt a healthy lifestyle, to perform more health behavior and to be
      less likely to relapse into previous unhealthy routines. Also, IG employees will be healthier
      as well as they will report more quality of life, more work satisfaction and more
      occupational efficiency . In comparison to WCG, the IG is also hypothesized to be more
      effective than the WCG regarding social-cognitive predictors of behavior.

      Moreover, the interventions are supposed to be more effective for individuals with more risk
      factors (obese ect.). After successful evaluation and some adoptions the intervention will be
      implemented as a self-help program in all eligible employees in the Intranet.
