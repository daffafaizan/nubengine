      liver cirrhosis. The diagnostic accuracy and predictive value of non-invasive methods is
      studied.

      Upon diagnosis multiparametric ultrasound imaging of the lesions as well as sarcopenia
      parameters are performed for characterization of the lesions. For primary endpoint the
      results are then analyzed with regard to diagnostic accuracy compared to gold standard (CT,
      MRI or histology). For secondary endpoint, predictive value of the non-invasive diagnostics
      are analyzed with regards to mortality and response to treatment.

      All work up, treatment and follow up are applied in standard of care fashion.
