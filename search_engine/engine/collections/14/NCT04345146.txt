    
      This Phase II randomized study is to determine the efficacy and safety of Bevacizumab
      combined with fractionated stereotactic radiation therapy(FSRT) in patients with 1 to 10
      brain metastases in non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer by assessing the treatment
      response, neurological symptoms and quality of life.

      Patients will receive Bevacizumab(7.5mg/kg, q3w, i.v.) before and after FSRT(40Gy in 10
      fractions or 30Gy in 5 fractions) to the brain metastases with Bevacizumab (7.5mg/kg, q3w,
      IV). The primary end point is the objective response rate. The secondary end points are 1-y
      iPFS, 1-y PFS, 1-y OS, perilesional edema of brain metastases, neurological symptoms, quality
      of life and safety of the treatment.
