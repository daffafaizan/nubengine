    
      The objective of the study is to confirm in a larger and less selected population ("real life
      conditions") the positive risk-benefit balance observed with silodosin in double-blind,
      randomised clinical trials.

      The following aspects will be evaluated:

        -  the effects on lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), by means of the International
           Prostate Symptoms Score (IPSS) questionnaire

        -  the effect on the most frequent and bothersome symptoms, by means of International
           Continence Society (ICS)-male questionnaire

        -  the effects on Quality of Life (QoL) due to urinary symptoms

        -  the safety profile

        -  the adherence to therapy

        -  the patient satisfaction with treatment The effectiveness and safety of the drug will be
           investigated also in different subgroups of subjects according to age, severity of the
           disease, concomitant disease and medications.
