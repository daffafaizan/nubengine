      proteins. Injected into a muscle, incobotulinumtoxinA causes a reversible local weakening of
      the muscle for several months, and may improve an impaired muscle function by lessening the
      muscle tightness within few days. IncobotulinumtoxinA is widely used for various severe
      neurological conditions. There is some evidence that the treatment effect may be influenced
      by the amount of the solvent in which incobotulinumtoxinA is diluted before injection.
