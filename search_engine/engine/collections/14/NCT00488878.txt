      I. To collect, both prospectively and retrospectively, data on disease characterization,
      treatment, and outcomes for approximately 1600 female patients with low-grade ovarian and
      peritoneal tumors.

      II. To organize clinical information in order to support multifaceted queries of patient
      characteristics, treatment, and disease outcome data and to facilitate correlation of these
      characteristics with patient outcome.

      III. To have a single data repository, kept on a secure platform that will integrate clinical
      information and research findings and serve as a secure archive for future research.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To obtain and store human tumor samples in the form of blocks or slides for the purpose of
      establishing a tumor bank.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients' medical records are reviewed for retrospective and prospective data collection.
      Patients may also have residual tissue samples collected and stored.
