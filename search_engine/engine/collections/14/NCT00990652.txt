      of the tumor on day 8 or 9.

      Beginning approximately 14 days after surgery, patients receive oral temozolomide on days 1-7
      and 14-21 and bortezomib IV on days 7 and 21. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 2
      years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Tumor tissue and blood samples are collected periodically for biomarker analysis, gene
      methylation studies, and pharmacokinetic studies.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years.
