      induced to achieve weight loss using financial incentives. The study is a 3-arm randomized
      controlled trial (RCT) stratified by gender. The goal is to examine how overweight
      individuals respond to two different types of financial incentives. The first type of
      incentive, incentive for weight loss (IW), is a cash award of approximately $150 given for
      achieving 5% weight loss over 12 weeks. The second type of incentive, incentive for education
      (IE), is a $150 award for passing quizzes that test the participants' health literacy about
      weight loss and the techniques required for maintaining a healthy lifestyle. The
      investigators compare the effectiveness of IW to IE in promoting weight loss in overweight
      individuals and investigate whether the two incentives work equally well for men and women.
