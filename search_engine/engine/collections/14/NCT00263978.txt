      and marrow transplantation. Treatment with currently available (FDA approved) agents fails in
      most cases. Recently conducted clinical studies indicate that patients benefit from
      defibrotide, a non-FDA approved agent. This protocol has been developed not with a research
      intent, but rather to ensure that defibrotide is used by the blood and marrow transplant
      programs at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta and at Emory University in a safe, effective and
      ethical manner.
