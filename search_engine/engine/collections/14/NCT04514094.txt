      untreated, immediate intervention is indicated to control the condition.

      Barriers to intervention as young age, uncooperative patient behavior and lack of access to
      dental care are however, very common. The use of silver diamine fluoride as an anticaries
      agent is of growing popularity worldwide due to its promising results, safety of use, ease of
      application and relatively low cost. Further research is still required in order to provide
      evidence-based recommendations regarding the use of SDF in arresting early childhood caries.
      Purpose: To evaluate the effectiveness of biannual application of 38% silver diamine fluoride
      in arresting early childhood caries when compared to atraumatic restorative treatment.
