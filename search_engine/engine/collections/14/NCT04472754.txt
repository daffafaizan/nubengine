      incidence of ischemic stroke is the highest. Atherosclerosis is the main cause of ischemic
      stroke. According to the theory of traditional Chinese medicine, the disease is closely
      related to the physical constitution of the individual. The main body constitution of the
      population in Lingnan area is phlegm dampness syndrome;Previous large cross-sectional studies
      have found that 65.3% of patients with ischemic stroke in Lingnan area have phlegm dampness
      syndrome. However, there is currently no biological evidence related to phlegm-dampness
      syndrome and ischemic stroke.In recent years, proteomics research technology has developed
      vigorously. The research samples have developed from blood obtained from minimally invasive
      to urine and saliva obtained non-invasively. Studies have found that urine proteins
      associated with AS include type I, type III collagen, 8-isoprostaglandin F2α, and saliva
      proteins include IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and PGE2.Therefore, this research is dedicated to
      exploring the biological basis of phlegm-dampness syndrome in patients with ischemic stroke
      using proteomics research techniques of urine and saliva.
