      as for irrigation of wounds and burns. Since it has been used successfully in caring for the
      exit site of hemodialysis catheters, it is reasonable to propose its use for the insertion
      and care of central intravascular catheters, as well as for skin preparation before surgery.
      Alternatives for povidone-iodine, which is the agent most commonly used, are costly or
      ineffective. To have more options, this study is needed to know if 10% sodium hypochlorite is
      similar to the most common option for skin antisepsis.
