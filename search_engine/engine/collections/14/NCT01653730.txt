      6-minute walk test on room air oxygen to assess their suitability for the study. Only those
      participants with documented exertional oxygen desaturations of â‰¤ 85% as measured by pulse
      oximetry during this walk will be asked to return for the second session. During session 2
      participants will perform a further four 6-minute walk tests spread over a morning and
      afternoon testing session. All all data for primary and secondary outcomes will be measured
      at session 2.
