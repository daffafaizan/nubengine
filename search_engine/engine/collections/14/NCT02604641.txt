      form of water-soluble Q10vital® on skin conditions. 33 healthy female subjects will be
      randomly assigned to a placebo group, a low-dose (LD) group receiving 50 mg CoQ10/day and a
      high-dose group (HD) receiving 150 mg CoQ10/day (11 subjects per group). A water-soluble form
      of CoQ10 with improved bioavailability (Quvital syrup with Q10vital®, Valens Int. d.o.o.,
      Slovenia) will be used. The placebo or CoQ10 will be administered in the form of a syrup; all
      subjects will consume 5 mL of syrup daily for 12 weeks. The photoprotective potential of
      CoQ10 will be evaluated with a determination of the minimal erythema dose (MED) before (the
      baseline) and after 12 weeks of the supplementation. Other skin parameters will be evaluated
      before supplementation (the baseline), after 6 and after 12 weeks of supplementation.
      Comparison will be done as the mean of the individual ratios. The differences between the
      before-after condition will be analyzed with the statistical test of analysis of variance. In
      case of failure to find homogeneity in the variances the nonparametric ANOVA, the Willcoxon
      test, will be used. The results will be expressed as mean ± standard error for each group
      with a significance level of 0.05 for all the statistical tests.
