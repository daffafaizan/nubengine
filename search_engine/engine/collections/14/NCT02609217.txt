      One to two weeks prior to the scheduled cesarean section and during a scheduled obstetric
      outpatient visit, the first interview and questionnaire will be administered to the couple. A
      second questionnaire will be provided while still hospitalized (5 days post partum), to both
      mother and partner. Six weeks post partum, during a scheduled obstetric outpatient visit, the
      couple will be interviewed for the last time and will be asked to complete the third and last
      questionnaire.
