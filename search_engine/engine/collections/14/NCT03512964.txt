      decreases the morbidity and mortality of HIV and greatly reduces the risk of transmission yet
      gaps in the care cascade persist. At current testing and treatment rates, an estimated
      524,000 new infections and 375,000 deaths will occur between 2015 and 2025 in the US. Rates
      of HIV are unacceptably high among African Americans and men who have sex with men and a
      majority of new transmissions originate from patients previously diagnosed but not in care.
      To curb rates of infection and improve HIV-related outcomes, cities such as Baltimore, where
      the HIV epidemic predominately affects African Americans and men who have sex with men, must
      implement more effective ways to identify and treat all individuals with HIV. Compressing the
      treatment timeline by starting antiretroviral therapy at the time of diagnosis is known as
      rapid HIV treatment initiation. Early studies of Rapid HIV Treatment Initiation in newly
      diagnosed patients in South Africa and San Francisco showed significant improvement in care
      linkage, antiretroviral therapy initiation and time to viral suppression. Investigators
      propose to evaluate Rapid HIV Treatment Initiation in Baltimore in newly and previously
      diagnosed HIV-positive patients not in care through identification of barriers, facilitators
      and acceptability of Rapid HIV Treatment Initiation and pilot testing a protocol for Rapid
      HIV Treatment Initiation among newly and previously diagnosed HIV-positive patients not in
      care identified at the Johns Hopkins East Baltimore campus and at the Baltimore City Health
      Department sexually transmitted disease clinics. This pilot data will be used to design a
      multi-site study evaluating the effectiveness of Rapid HIV Treatment Initiation versus
      facilitated linkage to care. A model for Rapid HIV Treatment Initiation in Baltimore could be
      generalized to cities where the HIV epidemic has a similar demographic and risk profile such
      as Washington DC, Atlanta, and New York City.
