      oocytes recovered after minimal ovarian stimulation with no LH/hCG administration, and
      improve oocyte competence. This may result in development of a greater number of embryos to
      the blastocyst stage.

      FSH is administered starting on cycle day 3 to stimulate follicle growth. When the leading
      follicle reaches 12-14 mm, egg retrieval will be scheduled. No hCG/LH trigger will be
      administered. Specially designed maturation media is used to collect and culture the immature
      eggs once recovered from the follicle. Once the eggs have matured in vitro, fertilization and
      embryo culture, vitrification and comprehensive chromosomal screening will be completed as
      per standard operating procedures.
