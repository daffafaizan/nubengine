      leads to an increase in adrenal androgen production during early puberty and since early
      puberty is associated with an overnight rise in testosterone that follows a similar time
      course to cortisol, we hypothesize that the adrenal gland is a major source of androgens in
      early puberty. On the other hand, the overnight rise in testosterone may reflect an ovarian
      response to overnight increases of gonadotropin secretion in early puberty. However, the
      ability of the ovaries to produce androgens (e.g., to respond to gonadotropin stimulation)
      during early puberty has not been tested concurrently in these girls. The sources of excess
      androgen production and the timing of their relative contributions across puberty are
      important in understanding the mechanism of hyperandrogenemia in these individuals. In
      addition, determination of the sources of hyperandrogenemia across puberty may have clinical
      utility in the development of preclinical screening tests designed to reveal those girls at
      greatest risk for PCOS and identification of potential therapeutic targets to prevent its
      development.
