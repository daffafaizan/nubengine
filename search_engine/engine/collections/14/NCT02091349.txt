      and maintaining gastrointestinal health. It is expected that feeding soluble fibers will
      decrease protein fermentative end=products while increasing carbohydrate fermenative
      end-products, and lead to a more beneficial microbial profile. Determination of the effects
      of nutriose and polydextrose when included as supplemental fiber in a human diet will give
      insights to its potential to maintain or improve gut health and highlight its use in the food
      industry.

      The object of this study are first to determine the tolerance of soluble fibers polydextrose,
      inulin and nutriose when provided as supplemental fiber to an existing diet. The second
      objective is to determine the utilization of polydextrose and nutriose through analyses of
      fecal samples of fermentative end-products and shifts in microbial populations.
