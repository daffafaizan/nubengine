      semantic distance training, which was effective in improving categorical language fluency of
      mild cognitive impairment and mild Alzheimer's dementia. 10 patients with mild cognitive
      impairment and another 10 patients with mild Alzheimer's dementia were recruited to examine
      therapeutic efficacy of the application.
