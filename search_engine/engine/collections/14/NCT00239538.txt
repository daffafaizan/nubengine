    
      Methodology:

      Prospective, randomised, open-label, blinded end-point, forced-titration, parallel group
      comparison using Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring (ABPM).

      Planned/Actual Number of Subjects:

      Enrolled: 1500/2085; Randomised: 750/840; Complete: 680/752

      Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion:

      1) Mild-to-moderate hypertension defined as a baseline mean seated cuff DBP of 95 - 109
      (inclusive) mmHg, and/or SBP of 140-179 (inclusive) mmHg, and a baseline 24-hour ABPM mean
      DBP >= 85 mmHg, and/or SBP >= 130 mmHg. 2) Overweight or obese as defined by a Body Mass
      Index (BMI) >= 27 kg/m2 in non-Asians and >= 24 kg/m2 in Asians 3) Type-2 diabetes mellitus.
      4) At least 30 years of age.

      Duration of Treatment:

      10 weeks total: telmisartan (80 mg) or valsartan (160 mg) for 4 weeks followed by telmisartan
      (80 mg) plus hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg) or valsartan (160 mg) plus hydrochlorothiazide
      (12.5 mg) for an additional 6 weeks.

      Criteria for Efficacy:

      Primary Endpoint:

      Reductions in blood pressure during the last 6 hours of the 24-hour dosing interval as
      measured by ABPM. The primary analysis will consist of comparing telmisartan combined with
      hydrochlorothiazide 80 mg/12.5 mg to valsartan combined with hydrochlorothiazide 160 mg/12.5
      mg at the end of the 10-week study using a closed testing procedure first testing for
      non-inferiority based on SBP; if significant, testing for non-inferiority based on DBP; if
      significant, testing for superiority based on SBP; and if significant, testing for
      superiority based on DBP.

      Secondary Endpoints:

      Statistically greater reductions in ambulatory blood pressure for patients treated with
      telmisartan combined with hydrochlorothiazide 80 mg/12.5 mg compared to patients treated with
      valsartan combined with hydrochlorothiazide 160 mg/12.5 mg at the end of the 10-week study as
      measured by: 1) Changes from baseline in the last 6 hours of the 24-hour dosing interval for
      pulse pressure; 2) Changes from baseline in the 24-hour ABPM mean (relative to dose time) for
      SBP, DBP, and pulse pressure; 3) Changes from baseline in the ABPM mean SBP, DBP, and pulse
      pressure (relative to clock time) during other periods (i.e., morning, daytime, night time)
      of the 24-hour dosing interval; 4) Change from baseline in systolic and diastolic blood
      pressure load during the 24-hour dosing interval; and 5) Percentage of patients responding to
      treatment based on the 24-hour ABPM mean SBP and DBP (relative to dose time).

      Statistically greater reduction in mean seated trough blood pressure patients treated with
      telmisartan combined with hydrochlorothiazide 80 mg/12.5 mg compared to patients treated with
      valsartan combined with hydrochlorothiazide 160 mg/12.5 mg at the end of the 10-week study as
      measured by: 1) Changes from baseline in mean seated trough SBP and DBP as determined by
      electronic or manual device in-clinic; and 2) Percentage of patients responding to treatment
      based on electronic or manual in-clinic trough cuff blood pressures.

      Evaluation of other endpoints comparing telmisartan combined with hydrochlorothiazide 80
      mg/12.5 mg to valsartan combined with hydrochlorothiazide 160 mg/12.5 mg, respectively,
      including: 1) Changes from baseline in metabolic markers: serum TG, LDL-C, HDL-C, total
      cholesterol, potassium, fasting glucose and HbA1C, and for urine: Na, K, Cl, proteinuria (as
      measured by spot urine for protein:creatinine ratio); and 2) inflammatory markers: serum high
      sensitive C-reactive protein, serum homocysteine and plasma fibrinogen.

      Criteria for Safety:

      Evaluation of adverse events, physical examinations, laboratory assessments, pulse rate and
      cuff blood pressure monitoring.

      Statistical Method:

      Analysis of covariance with treatment and centre as main effects and baseline as a covariate;
      Mantel-Haenszel test controlling for centre.

      Study Hypothesis:

      Null Hypothesis:

      The overall mean change from baseline in the automated blood pressure monitor mean blood
      pressure during the last 6 hours of the 24-hour dosing interval for telmisartan (80 mg) plus
      hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg) is less than or equal to that for valsartan (160 mg) plus
      hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg).

      Alternative Hypothesis:

      The overall mean change from baseline in the automated blood pressure monitor mean blood
      pressure during the last 6 hours of the 24-hour dosing interval for telmisartan (80 mg) plus
      hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg) is greater than that for valsartan (160 mg) plus
      hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg).

      Comparison(s):

      Telmisartan (80 mg) plus hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg) vs. valsartan (160 mg) plus
      hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg)
