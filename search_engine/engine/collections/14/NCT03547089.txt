      multimodal treatment. Estrogen suppression also reduces the likelihood of a breast cancer
      recurrence. Therefore, breast cancer survivors with estrogen sensitive tumors are placed on
      hormone suppression therapy with either selective estrogen receptor modulators like tamoxifen
      or aromatase inhibitors like anastrazole. This therapy typically is administered for five
      years after a cancer diagnosis. Regardless of age or pre-existing menopausal status, the
      hormone suppression reduces estrogen levels and can either exacerbate existing menopausal
      symptoms or induce medical menopause in otherwise premenopausal women. This study will
      evaluate the patient's perspective of vaginal therapy using the ViveveÂ® device in breast
      cancer patients.
