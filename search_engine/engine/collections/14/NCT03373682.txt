      pancreatitis who underwent P-ESWL. Patients aged over 65 years were included in the geriatric
      group; patients aged under 65 years who underwent P-ESWL in the same period were assigned to
      the control group. For investigation of long-term follow-up, the geriatric group were matched
      with patients from the control group in a 1:1 ratio. The primary outcomes were P-ESWL
      complications and pain relief. The secondary outcomes included: stone clearance, physical and
      mental health, quality of life score, and body weight.
