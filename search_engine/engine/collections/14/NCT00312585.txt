      gestation. However, it is not always safe or easy to put these women into labor. Acupuncture
      has been used in Asia for hundreds of years to induce contractions and begin the labor
      process. Acupuncture is not typically used in the United States to induce labor, however. The
      purpose of this study is to determine whether a series of up to five acupuncture treatments
      can prevent postdates pregnancy.
