      (PCIs)[1-2]. They have lower success rate after operation, higher re-stricture ratio by
      radiography and frequent complications, which result in adverse clinical outcomes as compared
      to non-bifurcation lesions[3-5]. Secure and efficient treatment strategies for PCI and
      bifurcation lesions are research hotspots for cardiovascular surgeons. Single-side stand
      strategy (main-support implantation stand or side-support implantation stand when necessary)
      is currently preferred for bifurcation lesions[2,6]. However, as main-support implantation
      stand could lead to plaque transposition, bifurcation ridge excursion and side a sandwich,
      the side openings could become narrower or even blocked[7]. In 2011, our centre initiated the
      use of balloon-stent kissing technique (BSKT)[8] to protect the side branch, which has higher
      success rate after operation, lower block ratio of side branch and lower incidence of
      perioperative adverse events, which led to immediate clinical effect. This study compared
      BSKT versus Jailed Wire Technique (JWT) in the interventional treatment of coronary
      bifurcation lesions to further clarify BSKT's efficacy and advantages.
