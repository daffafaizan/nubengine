      clinical trial evaluating the effect of a bone substitute; NanoBone® (Artoss GmbH, Rostock,
      Germany) (group 1, control group) compared to the same bone substitute with simvastatin
      (Corvast 80 mg, Egyphar, Egypt) (group 2, test group) for RST of peri-implantitis. A total of
      30 patients suffering from peri-implantitis who needed regenerative treatment of at least one
      peri-implant bone defect were selected and only one implant per patient (the most severe) was
      evaluated in the treatment groups. The criteria for diagnosing peri-implantitis is based on
      the consensus report of the eighth European Workshop on Periodontology [34] ; the presence of
      a peri-implant marginal bone loss ≥2 mm based on baseline periapical radiographs after
      delivery of the final restoration and bleeding on probing (BOP) and/or suppuration with or
      without concomitant deepening of peri-implant pockets.

      Clinical and radiographic evaluation were conducted at baseline and 6 months postoperatively.
      Grouping was done using a random number table generated by a third party. They were numbered
      according to the order of enrolment and assigned to group I or group II. The grouping results
      were sealed in an opaque envelope and kept by an independent third party. For each patient,
      cards opened immediately before the surgical procedures. Treatment assignment in each patient
      was registered by the clinician who assisted in the operations and kept concealed until the
      completion of the study.
