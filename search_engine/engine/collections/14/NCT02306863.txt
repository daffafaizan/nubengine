    
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease resulting in the loss of
      dopaminergic neurons projecting from the substantia nigra pars compacta to the striatum.

      Whole-body vibration (WBV) is potentially beneficial in treating Parkinson's disease because
      it has been shown to elicit effects specific to both the brain and muscular system. Animal
      models of PD indicate that whole-body vibration can increase striatal dopamine levels, as
      well as the number of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. These findings were
      correlated with increased levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor.

      In addition to the potentially neuroplastic effects, >20 Hz WBV has been shown to improve
      muscular performance. Improved muscular performance is believed to be attributed to WBV
      induced neuromuscular effects rather than muscle hypertrophy, with the specific mechanism
      defined as the tonic vibration reflex.
