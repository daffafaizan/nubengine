    
      This is a multicenter randomized controlled pilot study. 110 patients who require intubation
      in the ICU will be randomly assigned, with a 1:1 ratio, to 3 or 5 minutes of preoxygenation
      duration. EtO2 will be continuously measured but hidden to the clinician. The primary outcome
      measure will be the obtention of an optimal preoxygenation defined by an EtO2 >90%. Secondary
      outcomes include the occurrence of hypoxia and complications during the procedure.

      A pulse oximetry (SpO2) greater than or equal to 96% (SpO2 â‰¥ 96%) at the end of
      preoxygenation will be the target in each group. If at the end of the preoxygenation, SpO2 is
      still lower than 96%, clinician will be allowed to extend the duration of preoxygenation (up
      to 5 minutes in the 3 minutes period of preoxygenation group and up to 8 minutes in the 5
      minutes period of preoxygenation group).

      End-tidal oxygen concentration (EtO2) will be measured during preoxygenation and will be
      hidden to the clinician in order to not influence the duration of preoxygenation.
