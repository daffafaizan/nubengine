      stimulation and live birth rates after bariatric surgery compared to weight-matched patients.
      However, statistical significance was not reached, as the sample size was small.

      The aim of the research project is to study the ovarian response and live birth rates of this
      bariatric surgery population, with a sufficient number of patients, in order to reach higher
      statistical power. This case-control study will involve 3 IVF (in-vitro fertilization)
      centers in France . All patients undergoing IVF with a history of bariatric surgery will be
      included from January 2012. Each case will be matched for BMI and age to the 2 next patients
      without bariatric surgery history and undergoing IVF and to one non-operated severely obese
      woman. Surgery procedures include sleeve gastrectomies and by-passes. The IVF results and
      live birth rates will be compared between the three groups.
