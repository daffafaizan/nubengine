      rates of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs); however, the number of
      evidence-based interventions for Black MSM is limited. This study evaluated the efficacy of
      Many Men, Many Voices (3MV), a small-group HIV/STI prevention intervention developed by Black
      MSM-serving community-based organizations and a university-based HIV/STI prevention and
      training program. The study sample included 338 Black MSM of HIV-negative or unknown HIV
      serostatus residing in New York city. Participants were randomly assigned to the 3MV
      intervention condition (n = 164) or wait-list comparison condition (n = 174). Relative to
      comparison participants, 3MV participants reported significantly greater reductions in any
      unprotected anal intercourse with casual male partners; a trend for consistent condom use
      during receptive anal intercourse with casual male partners; and significantly greater
      reductions in the number of male sex partners and greater increases in HIV testing. This
      study is the first randomized trial to demonstrate the efficacy of an HIV/STI prevention
      intervention for Black MSM.
