      or sub-epithelial lesions. Endoscopic resection can be considered as a less invasive approach
      than surgery. Moreover, endoscopic resection can be available to patients who are ineligible
      for surgery or who have refused more aggressive surgical intervention.

      The study investigators would collect data on a large sample size of subjects undergoing
      various endoscopic resection procedures such as EMR (Endoscopic Mucosal Resection), ESD
      (Endoscopic submucosal dissection), STER (Submucosal tunneling endoscopic resection, and EFTR
      (Endoscopic full-thickness resection). Clinical metrics will be recorded including procedure
      times, length of follow-up, specific tumor characteristics, resection method, pathology
      results, procedural complications, additional therapy required, and disease-free survival
      time.

      Currently, there is limited multi-center data on endoscopic resection outcomes in western
      populations.

      Evaluation of these measurement would help the investigators compare them to conventional
      treatment modalities within current tertiary facilities; and consequently help the
      investigators identify appropriate treatment techniques and improve clinical management of
      patients at WCMC-NYPH.

      The purpose of this retrospective and prospective registry is to assess long term data on
      efficacy, safety and clinical outcome of Endoscopic Resection within the gastrointestinal
      tract (1 year).
