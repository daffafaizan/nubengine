      a primary health care facility. It should be quick acting, have minimal cardiorespiratory
      side effects and have a relatively prolonged effect and be cheap. No combination of drug or
      delivery system fully satisfies these criteria. There are no large published studies
      evaluating intranasal lorazepam in paediatric status epilepticus. Given its favourable
      pharmacokinetics and potential practical advantages, we wished to assess the efficacy and
      safety of intranasal delivery of lorazepam compared to intramuscular paraldehyde, our
      existing first line anticonvulsant agent in the treatment of acute seizures in children.
