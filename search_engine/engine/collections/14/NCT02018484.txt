      primary outcome by an independent expert comity. Each participant will have an MRI which will
      be sent to the society in charge of creating the patient specific cutting guides. The
      intervention will be performed using the patient specific cutting guides and in parallel, a
      station of navigation will be used to provide a safety control of the orientation of the
      cutting guide and to collect per operative data.

      Evaluation visit is performed 6 months after surgery.
