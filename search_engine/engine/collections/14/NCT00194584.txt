      an email message to family.strengths@seattlechildrens.org. They will complete a survey taking
      no more than 60 minutes. Parents will then be randomized to either take the class immediately
      or be in the control group which can take the class in 12 months. At the end of 6 and 12
      months all the participants again take the survey.

      Classes are 7 weeks in length, 2 hours each and are offered at various locations throughout
      the Greater Seattle area.
