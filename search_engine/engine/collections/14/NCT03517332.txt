      the potential of circulating tumor DNA exposure in peripheral blood using a novel process in
      a sample of patients with different types of malignant organ tumors and a control cohort
      without malignant disease. The study applies a new process to detect ctDNA and other
      molecular markers in peripheral blood using: a collection of de-identified blood specimen and
      clinical data from up to 10,000 participants from clinical sites across the United States and
      Europe. Data collected will include the following: Demographics, Tumor Characteristics,
      Information about Treatment, Specimen Assessment, Postoperative Assessment Clinical
      information, and Follow-up at intermittent future time points, for up to 15 years. The study
      test(s) to be used in this protocol is a multiplexed primer and probe design developed, that
      allows detecting a wider set of mutations at a higher sensitivity then conventional
      sequencing-based method. This novel process is currently being investigated at Quantgene Inc.
