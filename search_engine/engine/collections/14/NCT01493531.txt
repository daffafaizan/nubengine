      treated with allopurinol do not achieve the recommended sUA target of < 6.0 mg/dL and need
      additional therapy to achieve the target. Probenecid and benzbromarone are URAT1 inhibitors,
      generally recommended as second-line agents for patients who are either resistant to or
      intolerant of allopurinol. However, benzbromarone is not available in the US and probenecid
      is rarely used. Consequently, there is a clear unmet medical need for a new safe and
      effective therapy for gout, such as lesinurad, a potent URAT1 inhibitor, that can be used in
      combination with allopurinol in patients not responding adequately to allopurinol monotherapy
      so that very high rates of response can be achieved by nearly all gout patients, rather than
      a minority.The subjects selected for this study will have moderate to severe gout with an
      inadequate response to allopurinol
