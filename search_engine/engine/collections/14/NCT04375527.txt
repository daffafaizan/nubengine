    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Objective response rate (ORR), which is defined as the proportion of response-evaluable
      participants either with a confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) per
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1, as determined by the investigator
      assessment, at best overall response.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Progression-free survival (PFS), clinical benefit rate (CR + PR + stable disease [SD]
      among response-evaluable participants, per RECIST 1.1), overall survival (OS) and duration of
      response (DOR).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Evaluation of histologic evidence of response (p-ERK reduction in residual tumor cells and
      CD8 T cell or tumor infiltrating lymphocytes or tumor infiltrating lymphocyte [TIL]
      infiltration induced by combination treatment) using pretreatment and early on-treatment
      tumor biopsies.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive binimetinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28 and nivolumab
      intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 12
      cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 1
      year, then annually thereafter.
