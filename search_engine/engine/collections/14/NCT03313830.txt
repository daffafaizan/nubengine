      will be studied in the post-absorptive state on two different days, during which they will
      randomly assigned to drink a WPH or WHEY mixture.

      Measures of muscle protein synthesis will be taken at baseline, one and three hours following
      nutrient ingestion.

      The expected outcome of the proposed work is the identification of a new nutritional strategy
      for activating skeletal muscle protein synthesis. The findings of the proposed studies will
      have a positive impact, because they will allow us to translate this information into
      evidence-based clinical interventions to improve muscle size, strength and function and
      improve recovery after conditions associated with muscle wasting.
