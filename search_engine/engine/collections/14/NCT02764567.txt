      who participate in a clinical trial agree to frequent lab sampling to monitor for effect and
      safety of the investigational product. The frequency is variable, from several times a day
      for a participant in the hospital to annually for some trials. Participants have reported
      anxiety regarding the number of tubes to be drawn, even resulting in near syncope, and pain
      with the venipuncture process.

      The clinical trial nurses at HealthEast have utilized a variety of therapeutic techniques to
      ease the pain and anxiety experienced by the trial subjects, such as redirection, deep
      breathing, hand massage and guided imagery. These techniques have not been evaluated for
      effectiveness in easing pain and anxiety nor have they been compared with no intervention to
      determine if any intervention was more efficacious in alleviating pain and/or anxiety.

      The primary objective of this study is determine if aromatherapy with an essential oil has a
      higher reported effect in anxiety and pain relief with venipunctures than standard of care
      (no therapy) among participants in HealthEast Clinical Trials Office studies.

      Secondary objectives include comparing the number of venipunctures and blood collection tubes
      in the treatment arms.

      This is a randomized, open label, prospective single site study designed to determine the
      effect of essential oil aromatherapy compared to usual care on pain and anxiety associated
      with venipunctures for clinical trial participants in the HealthEast Heart Care Clinic.
