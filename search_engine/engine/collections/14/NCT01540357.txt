      manualized therapeutic approach, which is based on mindfulness- and body-psychotherapy and
      which has been specifically developed for the treatment of tinnitus patients (Tinnitus
      Atemtherapie; http://www.maria-holl.de/). Essential components of the treatment program
      include mindfulness, meditation, selfmassage, and breathing exercises. These components are
      intended to help patients use their inner resources to accept responsibility for themselves,
      become more self-sufficient and develop symptom acceptance.
