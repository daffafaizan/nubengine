      urban, minority, and disadvantaged children. When implemented correctly, existing
      evidence-based guidelines from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) improve
      pediatric asthma care and outcomes. One key component of these guidelines is the importance
      of longitudinal care as part of a partnership among patient, parents, and a healthcare
      provider. Such a partnership depends on effective communication of healthcare status by
      parents to providers. Improving the communication skills of inner-city parents may improve
      their ability to obtain more effective longitudinal asthma care within their primary care
      homes and thereby to improve their child's asthma health outcomes. IMPACT DC ("Improving
      Pediatric Asthma Care in the District of Columbia") is a locally validated emergency
      department (ED) based intervention that improves multiple measures of asthma care and
      outcomes through an intensive short-term program of asthma education, medical care, and care
      coordination. In spite of these successes, achieving increased subsequent contact and
      partnership with primary care providers (PCPs) for asthma care after the intervention has not
      been successful. Therefore, for the current study, we propose to assess the effectiveness of
      an enhanced version of the existing IMPACT DC intervention consisting of short-term case
      management by trained asthma educators.
