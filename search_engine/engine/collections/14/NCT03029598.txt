      I. To determine the clinical response rate of platinum chemotherapy and pembrolizumab
      (MK-3475) in platinum chemotherapy pretreated ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary
      peritoneal.

      II. To examine whether retreatment with platinum chemotherapy in platinum resistant ovarian,
      fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers improves progression free survival by
      concurrent administration of MK-3475.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety and tolerability of concurrent administration of MK-3475 with
      platinum chemotherapy in patients with platinum resistant recurrent ovarian, fallopian tube,
      and primary peritoneal cancers.

      II. To determine the relationship between PD-L1 expression and response to the combination of
      MK-3475 and platinum.

      III. To assess the overall survival of patients treated with the combination of MK-3475 and
      platinum.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To explore whether treatment with MK-3475 and platinum alters soluble factors in sera,
      peripheral immune responses and immune cell profile.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 and carboplatin IV
      over 30 minutes on days 8 and 15. Cycles repeat every 21 days for up to 24 months in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 3 months for
      1 year, every 6 months for 1 year, and then every 12 weeks thereafter.
