    
      All recipients will receive an induction therapy with rituximab and polyclonal antibodies, as
      well as a maintenance therapy by tacrolimus, mycophenolic acid (switched for mTOR
      (Mechanistic target of rapamycin) inhibitors 1 month after the transplantation to avoid viral
      infections) and steroids.

      The desensitization protocol will be based on the initial titer of isoagglutinin. All
      patients with an isoagglutinin titer between 1/8 and 1/128 will be included in this
      monocentric, open label study, and randomized between the DFPP arm (1 to 4 sessions according
      to the initial titer) and large-plasma SIA (1 to 2 sessions according to the titer). The
      effectiveness will be evaluated on the ability to obtain the targeted titer before
      transplantation (1/4) with less than 5 DFPP, or 2 large-plasma volume SIA.

      All recipients will be followed for 6 months, and examined for surgical complications,
      rejection rate, and kidney function. All complications related to desensitization protocol
      will be reported. Moreover, all cost associated with these two apheresis techniques will be
      evaluated.
