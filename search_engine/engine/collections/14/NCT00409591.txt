      Note: The study was stopped and data unblinded upon DSMB recommendations in September 2010
      because of changes in Thai PMTCT guidelines recommending use of HAART in all HIV infected
      pregnant women regardless of their CD4 count. At the time of unblinding 435 pregnant women
      had been enrolled and follow-up of these women and their children is continuing.
