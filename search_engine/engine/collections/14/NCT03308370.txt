      emotional stresses for sufferers, for which a universally effective treatment is still
      lacking. Platelet rich plasma is commonly used in dermatology and plastic surgery, especially
      for treating chronic wounds, ulcers, and burns. The most important contents of platelets are
      contained in the α-granules. Some of the bioactive substances present in the α-granules
      include platelet-derived growth factor, transforming growth factor -β1 and -β2epidermal
      growth factor, and mitogenic growth factors such as platelet-derived angiogenesis factor and
      fibrinogen.

      transforming growth factor -β1 decreases melanogenesis via delayed extracellular
      signal-regulated kinase activation. The regression of melasma in a 27-years-old woman after
      injecting platelet rich plasma for skin rejuvenation was observed, but controlled clinical
      trials are still lacking to confirm this preliminary observation.
