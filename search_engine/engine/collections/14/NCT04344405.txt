      autoimmunity. Vitamin D was found to modulate cell growth, function of immune cells and
      anti-inflammatory action. The aim of this study was to investigate serum vitamin D level and
      some cytokines and to identify the correlation between vitamin D and these cytokines in RA.

      Methods: Totally 60 RA patients without vitamin D supplement were involved in this study. The
      serum level of vitamin D, interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-10, IL-35, tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α)
      and C-reactive protein (CRP) were measure in all patients by enzyme-linked immunosorbent
      assay (ELISA) then they will divided into 2 groups, group I receive vit. D supplementation
      and group II will receive placebo and follow up for 3 months.
