    
      This is a randomized (the study medication is assigned by a random order), active control
      (study medication will be compared with available standard care of treatment), parallel-group
      (each treatment group will be treated simultaneously at the same time and each participant
      only receives one treatment regimen as assigned), open-label (both the investigator and the
      participant know the intervention received by the participant), multicenter study designed to
      determine if women with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer, who were previously
      treated with prior anthracycline therapy in the neoadjuvant (administration of treatment
      before surgery) or adjuvant setting (administration of treatment after surgery), and who also
      had a disease-free interval of at least 12 months since the end of their last cytotoxic
      therapy, would benefit from the addition of DOXIL to docetaxel therapy. Approximately 751
      participants will be randomly assigned to either receive docetaxel monotherapy or DOXIL in
      combination with docetaxel therapy. Treatment is to continue until disease progression or the
      occurrence of unacceptable treatment related toxicity. Safety evaluations will include
      assessments of adverse events which will be recorded from the first study related procedure
      until 30 days after the last dose of medication; clinical laboratory tests and tests for
      cardiac function (multiple gated acquisition scan/echocardiogram and electrocardiogram) which
      will be monitored throughout the study.
