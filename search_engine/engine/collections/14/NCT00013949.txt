      40 minute measurement of continuous EKG (Holter), blood pressure, and oximetry. In
      Steubenville we have also measured exhaled nitrogen oxide, an index of pulmonary
      inflammation. The exposure monitoring has included outdoor particle mass of PM2.5, outdoor
      gaseous pollutants, and indoor home and personal monitoring to evaluate the indoor
      contribution of pollution to health effects.
