    
      Study Design: Prospective, open label, Four-arm, randomized single-center trial to test the
      effect long-term Vitamin C+E and Statin therapy on vasospasm improvement and regression of
      atheroma in patients with variant angina.

      After provocation test, patients will be classified into three groups.(See below)

        1. Negative group : Patients who have symptoms that are consistent with vasospastic angina
           but only show luminal narrowing less than 50% on coronary angiography during provocation
           test.

        2. Mild Spastic group : Patients who have symptoms that are consistent with vasospastic
           angina and show luminal narrowing over 50% to less than 90% on coronary angiography
           during provocation test.

        3. Severe Spastic group : Patients who have symptoms that are consistent with vasospastic
           angina and show luminal narrowing over 90% on coronary angiography during provocation
           test.

      In each group (except for patient in Negative group), patients will be randomized in a two by
      two factorial manner according to the study drug therapy (Vitamin C+E vs. no Vitamin C+E)
      (Statin vs. no Statin) As a result, patients in each group(except for patient in Negative
      group) will be randomized to 4 treatment subgroups, which are

        1. Control subgroup : Standard medication for Variant angina only

        2. Vitamin subgroup : Standard medication + Vitamin C+E

        3. Statin subgroup : Standard medication + Statin

        4. Dual subgroup : Standard medication + Vitamin C+E + Statin

      Patients in Negative group will be prescribed only for standard medication for variant
      angina.

      Patient Enrollment: Recruiting 300 patients(100 patients for each group, as 25 patients for
      each subgroups) from September 2014 through February 2021 at single center in Korea(Seoul
      National University Hospital)

      Patient Follow-Up: Clinical follow-up will occur at 1, and 6 months, and at 2, 4, and 6
      years. Investigator or designee may conduct follow-up as telephone contacts or office visits.
