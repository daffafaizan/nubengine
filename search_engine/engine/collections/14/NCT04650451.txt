    
      -  Phase 1: Cell dose escalation to identify the maximum dose of BPX-603 administered
           without or with rimiducid (fixed dose at 0.4 mg/kg per infusion). The first subject in
           each dose cohort will receive BPX-603 alone (without rimiducid) in order to assess
           safety of the CAR-T monotherapy.

        -  Phase 2: Indication-specific dose expansion to assess the safety, pharmacodynamics
           (including BPX-603 persistence and response to temsirolimus as applicable), and clinical
           activity at the recommended dose for expansion (RDE) identified in Phase 1 in various
           HER2+ solid tumors.

        -  During Phase 1 or 2, temsirolimus (single IV dose at 25 mg) may be administered
           following BPX-603 infusion in response to treatment-emergent toxicity in order to
           activate the iRC9 safety switch.
