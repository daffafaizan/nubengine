      20 ml; size 4, 30 ml; size 5, 40 ml), as illustrated in several studies , but it may become
      more rigid which may cause displacement of the LMA and decreases the airway sealing of LMA,
      more pressure on pharyngeal mucosa which might cause severe mucosal ischemia leading to post-
      operative sore throat, dysphagia or hoarseness.

      Ultrasonography can reliably confirm correct placement of supraglottic devices like laryngeal
      mask airway (LMA) and rules out causes of inadequate ventilation , also it was found to be a
      sensitive in detecting rotational malposition of LMA in children.

      the replacement of air with saline in LMA cuffs enable detection of cuffs in the airway
      allowing visualization of the surrounding structures and tissues as the ultrasound beam can
      be transmitted through the fluid-filled cuffs without being reflected from air mucosal
      interface.

      the adequacy of LMA position will be confirmed by a fiberoptic laryngoscope (FOL)
