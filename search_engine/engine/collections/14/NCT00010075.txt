        -  Determine the survival without degradation of quality of life in elderly women with
           metastatic breast cancer treated with leucovorin calcium, fluorouracil, and
           mitoxantrone.

        -  Determine the efficacy of this regimen, in terms of response and survival without
           progression, in these patients.

        -  Determine the tolerance of these patients to this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive mitoxantrone IV and leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours on day 1. Patients
      then receive fluorouracil IV over 46 hours on days 1-2. Treatment repeats every 21 days for a
      maximum of 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, after 3 courses, and at treatment completion.

      Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 39 patients will be accrued for this study.
