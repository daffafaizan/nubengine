      children might result in a reduction of the intubation time needed to facilitate tracheal
      intubation. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine TimeEI with a low dose of
      esmeron (rocuronium) (0.3 mg.kg-1) for achievement of successful tracheal intubation
      conditions during intravenous (i.v.) anaesthesia using propofol and alfentanil in children
      and to determine whether administration of i.v. atropine (atropine sulphate) (10 Î¼g.kg-1)
      during anaesthesia induction reduced these times.
