      the prevalence of dry eye disease (DED).

      Studies show that blink frequency reduced considerably during computer work, hence the tear
      film is spread less regularly over the anterior surface of the eye giving rise to an unstable
      tear film. This may lead to tired, dry eyes.

      The aim of this study was to observe if the tear film quality and dry eye symptoms may
      improve with the use of the computer animation program "BlinkBlink" during prolonged computer
      work. Participating subjects test two versions of the program, whereby one version applies
      the animation in a much lower frequency, hence serving as a near placebo version. The testing
      order of the versions is randomized.

      The variables tested in this study are non-invasive tear film break up (NIBUT) and subjective
      dry eye symptoms with the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) questionnaire.
