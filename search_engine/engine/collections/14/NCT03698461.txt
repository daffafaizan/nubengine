           Programmed Death-Ligand 1(PD-L1) and inhibits the interaction between PD-L1 and its
           receptors, Programmed cell Death protein 1(PD-1) and B7.1. Therapeutic blockade of PD-L1
           binding by atezolizumab has been shown to enhance the magnitude and quality of tumor
           specific T cell responses, resulting in improved anti tumor activity.

        -  Bevacizumab is a recombinant, humanized therapeutic antibody directed against vascular
           endothelial growth factor(VEGF). In addition to its well-characterized role in
           angiogenesis, VEGF is also believed to be involved in cancer immune evasion via the
           induction of myeloid- derived suppressor cells(MDSCs). These VEGF-induced MDSCs can
           suppress both T-cell and dendritic-cell function. Bevacizumab can restore and/or
           maintain the antigen presentation capacity of dendritic cells, leading to enhanced
           T-cell infiltration in tumors. When used in combination, VEGF targeting agents such as
           bevacizumab promote the normalization of tumor vasculature and may thereby increase
           access of therapeutic agents.

        -  Atezolizumab with bevacizumab, levoleucovorin, oxaliplatin, and 5-fluorouracil(FOLFOX).
           A translational study for renal cell carcinoma showed bevacizumab resulted in modulation
           of tumor immune microenvironment with Th1-related signatures, which was more potentiated
           by subsequent treatment with atezolizumab. This suggests potentiation of anti-tumor
           immunity with the combination of bevacizumab and atezolizumab.
