    
      Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a common disorder, affecting 12% of adults older than 50
      years of age. Approximately one third of these patients experience intermittent claudication,
      defined as pain in the thigh or calf muscles during walking and that resolves with rest.
      Lower extremity pain is often severe enough to significantly limit ambulation, forcing many
      patients to seek medical care. Current treatments include two FDA-approved medications,
      supervised walking programs, arterial angioplasty and/or stent placement, and open arterial
      bypass surgery. The problem is that noninvasive treatments are oftentimes ineffective, while
      invasive treatments are effective but expensive.

      A non-invasive lower extremity treatment that has shown success in treating lymphedema and
      venous insufficiency will be studied during this protocol to assess its effects on
      claudication symptoms. Half of the participants in this prospective, single-center randomized
      controlled trial will be treated with a pneumatic compression device in a home treatment
      program, while half will receive standard medical therapy. If effective, potential benefits
      are high, providing relief of personal disability and avoidance of costly surgical
      intervention.
