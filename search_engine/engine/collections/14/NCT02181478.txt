      I. To estimate the feasibility of combining intra-osseous umbilical cord blood (UCB)
      hematopoietic stem cells and human mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSC) following reduced
      intensity conditioning (RIC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the time to engraftment of intra-osseous (IO) UCB transplant combined with
      hMSC following RIC.

      II. To estimate the safety profile of IO UBC transplant combined with hMSC.

      OUTLINE:

      REDUCED INTENSITY CONDITIONING: Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) over 2
      hours on day -6 and fludarabine phosphate IV on days -6 to -2 and undergo total body
      irradiation (TBI) on day -1.

      GRAFT-VERSUS-HOST DISEASE (GVHD) PROPHYLAXIS: Patients receive cyclosporine orally (PO) or IV
      over 2 hours every 12 hours on beginning on days -5 to 100 with taper beginning on day 100
      and mycophenolate mofetil IV or PO twice daily (BID) on days -5 to 100.

      TRANSPLANT: Patients undergo intra-osseous UCB and hMSC co-transplant on day 0.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at days 28 and 100, and then at
      6, 9, and 12 months.
