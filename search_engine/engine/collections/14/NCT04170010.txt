    
      This is a protocol for the study of post-prandial gut peptide response and meal-induced
      thermogenesis in a group of 15 conservatively managed (through diet and exercise) morbidly
      obese individuals. During two separate visits in the study site, anthropometric data will be
      collected, resting metabolic rate will be measured, and the patients will undergo a panel of
      cardiovascular examinations (heart rate variability, baroreflex sensitivity, heart
      ultrasound). On a separate occasion, they will consume a standardized test mixed meal and
      complete visual analog scales for the subjective assessment of hunger and fullness every 30
      minutes for 3 hours. At the same time points, blood samples will be collected for the
      consequent measurement of glucose, insulin, lipids, and gastrointestinal hormones.
      Additionally, immediately before and at 60', 120', 180' after the start of the consumption of
      the test meal, the resting metabolic rate of each participant will be assessed through
      indirect calorimetry, to quantify meal-induced thermogenesis. The observed induction of
      satiety and suppression of hunger, post prandial gut-peptide mobilization and change in
      metabolic rate will be compared to those of participants of trial no NCT03851874 (Morbidly
      obese patients that have undergone either Roux en Y gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy and
      participated in trial NCT03851874).
