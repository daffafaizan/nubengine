    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To demonstrate an improvement in 3-year disease-free survival for high-risk stage II colon
      cancer patients randomly assigned to 5-FU (fluorouracil), leucovorin (leucovorin calcium),
      oxaliplatin versus 5-FU, leucovorin, oxaliplatin and bevacizumab.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare overall survival between the regimens. II. To further define the toxicity
      profiles of the regimens. III. To prospectively determine the impact of tumor biological
      characteristics on the survival of patients with stage II colon cancer.

      IV. To assess the association between oxaliplatin exposure, allelic variants in candidate
      genes, and neurotoxicity. (Pharmacogenetic ancillary objective)

      OUTLINE: Patients with high-risk disease are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms (Arms A and
      B). Patients with low-risk disease are assigned to Arm C.

      ARM A: Patients receive oxaliplatin intravenously (IV) over 2 hours and leucovorin calcium IV
      over 2 hours on day 1. Patients also receive fluorouracil IV continuously over 46 hours
      beginning on day 1. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for 12 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM B: Patients receive oxaliplatin, leucovorin calcium, and fluorouracil as in Arm A and
      bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for 12 courses in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then receive
      bevacizumab alone for 12 additional courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM C: Patients undergo observation.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years,
      every 6 months for 3 years, and then every 12 months for 10 years.
