      the efficacy of cannabis, compared to placebo, in medically ill participants seeking relief
      symptoms such as pain, nausea, and vomiting. Participants who meet criteria for severe
      conditions will be referred from their clinicians . Cannabis that has a high concentration of
      cannabidiol, which is a cannabinoid that does not change perception or produce intoxication,
      and low in Δ-9-THC will be used. In this way, the hope is to maximize the benefit of
      cannabis, while lowering the possible side effects of cannabis in medically ill participants.

      The overall goal of this study is to compare active high cannabidiol (CBD)/ low (-)-trans-Δ9-
      tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) cannabis vs placebo cannabis in patients with serious medical
      disorders. Participants will be referred from clinicians and will come to the laboratory
      daily (3-5 times weekly) for cannabis (15.76% CBD; 3.11% Δ-9-THC) vs placebo (0.0% CBD/ 0.01%
      Δ-9-THC). The cannabis will be vaporized or smoked as a cannabis cigarette. The participants
      can choose which option they prefer. The cross-over design will be used where participants
      receive 2 weeks of active cannabis vs two weeks of placebo in counterbalanced order, with
      participants blinded to the condition. The outcome measures primarily include measures of
      pain, with secondary measures of mood, nausea/appetite, quality of life, and the both the
      potentially positive and negative subjective effects of cannabis (e.g., high, mellow,
      anxious, paranoid).
