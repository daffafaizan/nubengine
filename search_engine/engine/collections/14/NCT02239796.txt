      It is associated with significant burden including reduced quality of life, increased
      morbidity and disability. Urgency UI, together with overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms
      (frequency, urgency, nocturia), is most commonly experienced. Current continence care is
      limited to lifestyle advice and behavioural interventions such as voiding programmes. There
      is a reliance on containment approaches and a lack of available options for active treatment.
      Intermittent electrical stimulation of the posterior tibial nerve (TPTNS) is effective for
      treating non-stroke neurogenic UI and OAB, but has not been tested in the stroke population.
      This pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT) aims to test the potential effectiveness of
      TPTNS for stroke-related bladder dysfunction. Adults with stroke-related UI will be
      randomised to TPTNS or sham. They and/or their carer will be taught to self-deliver a
      programme of TPTNS over a six week period. Bladder function, associated healthcare costs and
      quality of life outcomes will be measured at 6, 12 and 26 weeks. A nested process evaluation
      will be conducted. Pilot RCT and process evaluation results will inform the design of a phase
      III RCT of TPTNS to treat urinary incontinence in the stroke population.
