      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of sunitinib malate and gemcitabine
      hydrochloride in patients with adenocarcinoma of the pancreas or other solid tumors.

      II. Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8 OR on days 1,
      8, and 15. Patients also receive oral sunitinib malate once daily on days 1-21 OR days 1-28.
      Treatment repeats every 21 days OR every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of gemcitabine hydrochloride and sunitinib
      malate until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose
      preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Up to 10
      patients may be treated at the recommended phase II dose (RPTD), which is generally the dose
      level below the maximally administered dose.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 30 days and then periodically
      thereafter.
