      for AF when employing a lesion set targeting the posterior left atrial wall and pulmonary
      vein (PV) antra using contemporary large-tip or irrigated-tip catheter ablation systems when
      endocardial target sites are in close proximity to the esophagus.

      It is very likely that a movement by the Esophageal Stylet of only 2 to 3 centimeters from
      the midline can safely protect the esophagus from thermal injury and will mimic the natural
      migration of the esophagus itself.

      The Stylet proposes to safely facilitate lateral esophageal movement in a manner consistent
      with the esophagus's own natural migration in order to displace and maintain the esophagus's
      position away from potential damage resulting from a cardiac ablation procedure in the left
      atrium or coronary sinus.

      The Esophageal Stylet is a thin rigid tube, which will be inserted inside a commonly used
      nasogastric tube placed inside the esophagus during the ablation. We will use this stylet to
      move the esophagus away from the site of the ablation about 1-2 centimeters. Other common
      procedures, such as (Trans-esophageal Echocardiogram), move the esophagus twice this distance
      with a low risk.
