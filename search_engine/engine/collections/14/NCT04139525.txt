      heparin anticoagulation during hemodialysis (HD) with PES-PVP membrane. The research will be
      performed as a prospective clinical trial and will include 35 patients. Every patient will
      have 2 HD procedures with PES-PVP membrane in a randomized order: 1 with unfractionated
      heparin (UFH) and 1 with 8% trisodium citrate. We will compare the efficiency of both types
      of anticoagulation by measuring overall and instantaneous clearances of small, middle and
      protein-bound molecules (urea, creatinine, phosphate, Î²2-microglobulin, p-cresol).
      Biocompatibility will be evaluated by measuring activation of: complement (serum
      concentration of C3a and C5a), leukocytes (serum concentration of myeloperoxidase) and
      thrombocytes (serum concentration of PF4). We will also monitor complete blood count for
      occurrence of leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. After the HD electron microscopy of the
      membrane will be done in the proportion of included patients to evaluate adsorption of cells
      and formation of blood clots on the membrane.
