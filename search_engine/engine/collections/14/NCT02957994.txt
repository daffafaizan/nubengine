      reabsorption of phosphate among CHB patients treated with more than 18 months of TDF to be
      48%. Renal tubular dysfunction associated with TDF may be reversible when TDF is discontinued
      4. Recently, TAF 25 mg daily was shown to have comparable efficacy to TDF 300 mg with respect
      to viral suppression in both HBeAg positive and HBeAg negative CHB patients (studies 110 and
      108) at 48 weeks of therapy. As speculated, the systemic exposure to tenofovir was
      significantly less in patients exposed to TAF compared to those on TDF with strikingly less
      effects noted in a variety of renal and bone parameters for individuals receiving TAF.
      Notably, however, the question remains to what if any improvements may be seen in CHB
      patients switched from TDF to TAF.

      The investigators propose a prospective open label study to evaluate various markers of renal
      function and bone density in 80 CHB patients who are currently treated with TDF who are
      switched to TAF.
