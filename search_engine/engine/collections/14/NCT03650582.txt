      individuals. Participants are their own control in a single-blind, placebo-controlled,
      crossover design. Participants are admitted after an overnight fast and allowed to rest for 1
      hour before either intranasal glucagon (0.7mg) or intranasal placebo (sterile diluent) is
      administered. Study visits occur 1-3 weeks apart with intranasal glucagon or placebo applied
      in random order. Resting energy expenditure is measured via indirect calorimetry at baseline
      and over 90 minutes post-spray in 10-20 minute segments. Blood samples are taken at baseline
      and at regular intervals post-spray to measure glucagon, glucose and other
      hormones/metabolites. Appetite is assessed by visual analogue scale at 90 minutes post-spray
      followed by provision of a buffet-style meal for ad libitum food intake measurement.
