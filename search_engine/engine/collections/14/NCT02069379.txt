      mediating the relationship between metabolic dysfunction and depressive symptoms in
      reproductive aged women.

      PET image data was unable to be analyzed due to PET equipment replacement midway through
      study, leaving PET images collected at beginning of study incompatible with PET images
      collected later in study.

      Due to insufficient enrollment in treatment arms, the 20 or 40 week data was unusable for
      analytic goals, so the study was re-framed for what could usefully be learned about baseline
      characteristics among the study populations and the originally planned outcome measures were
      amended to only to those that related to understanding the baseline population.
