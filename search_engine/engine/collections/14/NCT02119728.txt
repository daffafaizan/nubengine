    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To test the non-inferiority of photodynamic therapy (PDT) to standard of care surgery.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine improvement in quality of life (QoL) using the University of Washington
      Quality of life questionnaire version 4.

      II. To assess the toxicity using the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) National Cancer
      Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE version 4.0).

      III. To explore progression-free survival in this patient population treated with HPPH
      mediated PDT.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Immune markers (T cells). II. To investigate the correlation of the tri-modal optical
      spectroscopy with tumor response to PDT.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatments arms.

      ARM I: Patients undergo standard of care surgery on day 1.

      ARM II: Patients receive HPPH intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on day 0. Approximately 24 hours
      later, patients undergo photodynamic therapy on day 1.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up 3-4 months for 1 year, 3-6
      months for 1 year, 4-8 months for 1 year, and once a year for 2 years.
