      measures related to mood and alertness caused. These effects might be prevented by taking
      short breaks with physical activity. Usually, desk workers have short breaks during office
      times for either a visit to the restroom or to enjoy for a moment a (hot) drink. Consumption
      of tea has been associated with benefits related to attention, alertness, mood and
      creativity. This study focuses on the impact of physically leaving the desk to prepare and
      consume a cup of tea at regular intervals during a sedentary working day.
