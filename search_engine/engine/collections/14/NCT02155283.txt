    
      The Kyrobak is an electrically operated, continuous passive motion device including a
      platform that performs angular oscillations. The Kyrobak is used at home as an aid to relieve
      mild-to-moderate low back pain.

      The study is designed to evaluate the efficacy of daily home use of the Kyrobak for 3 weeks
      and to assess the sustained efficacy 1 week later.

      The evaluation will include the level of pain using the numerical rating scale (NRS), Digital
      Posturography, Heart Rate Variability (HRV), Static Surface Electromyography (SEMG), a
      condition-specific low back pain disability status by the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and
      subject satisfaction.
