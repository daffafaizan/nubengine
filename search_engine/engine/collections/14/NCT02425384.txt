      rewards will increase physical activity levels in middle school aged students who use it over
      6 weeks. To test this, students who participate in the study will be assigned to 1 of 3
      groups: the meter with web-based rewards group, the Dance Dance Revolution group, or the
      control group. The physical activity of participants in all 3 groups will be tracked using
      the an activity meter that participants will be asked to carry daily for the 6 weeks of the
      study. Participants given the activity meter with web-based rewards or Dance Dance Revolution
      will be instructed to use them at their own will, as much or as little as they like. Before
      beginning the study, all participating students will be asked background questions about
      themselves (such as their gender, age, and ethnic group) and about the kinds of computer and
      video game consoles they have access to at home. All participants will also complete short
      questionnaires at enrollment, week 1, week 3 and week 6. These questions will ask
      participants about their experiences using the assigned devices, their physical activity
      levels, and their thoughts about their ability to be physically active. At the end of 6
      weeks, all participants will finish the study and return their assigned devices to the study
      coordinator. Height and weight will be measured at baseline and at the end of the study.
