      overload will be randomized to ultrafiltration (UF group) or conventional medical treatment
      (Control group). Patients follow-up at least monthly visit for one year. Ultrafiltration will
      be repeated during follow-up in case of body weight gain due to fluid accumulation.
      Ultrafiltration will be performed during short term hospitalization.
