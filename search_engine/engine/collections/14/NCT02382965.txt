      and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) have proven efficacious for inducing
      transient plastic changes in the human cortex. However, these technologies have poor spatial
      resolution, suffer from a depth focality tradeoff and experience significant attenuation at
      depth. Thus, they cannot effectively target neural tissue below the surface of the cortex.
      Transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) is a new and very promising non-surgical low-energy
      technique for inducing transient plasticity with high spatial resolution, adjustable focus
      and low tissue attenuation. tFUS has been used safely and effectively for neural stimulation
      in mouse, rabbit and monkey and my research has shown tFUS to also be a safe and effective
      method of transient cortical stimulation in humans. Having demonstrated its efficacy in
      humans for cortical stimulation, the next step is to take advantage of tFUS' high spatial
      resolution and deep focal lengths to stimulate sub-cortical neural structures. Currently, the
      only way to stimulate sub-cortical structures involves expensive and risky surgery. It is the
      purpose of this proposal to test tFUS for sub-cortical stimulation. The ability to
      individually stimulate small neural structures deep to the cortex without invasive surgery
      would have broad application in basic neuroscience for the investigation of brain structure
      and function as well as for the potential diagnosis and therapy of many neurological and
      psychiatric diseases.
