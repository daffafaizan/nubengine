      Assess whether employing a paradigm of genomic/precision medicine in primary care clinics can
      lead to an improvement in the medical or economic outcomes of the clinic as a unit.

      Specific and secondary aims

        1. Study differences in morbidity, mortality, quality of life or the cost of medical
           service indicators between clinics operating under a genome driven paradigm compared to
           usual care clinics.

        2. Examine whether the public has an interest in extensive genetic testing.

        3. Examine whether the medical staff has an interest and ability to assimilate a genomic
           approach in the routine clinic work.

        4. Identify links between genetic markers (mutations, variants) and different diseases
           (incidence or clinical behavior) or different drug responses (resistance, effectiveness,
           side-effects).

        5. Examine whether the implementation of prolonged personal monitoring devices will lead to
           improved morbidity and mortality indices.

        6. Examine whether measuring genomic variability in the microbiome has implications on
           health status or means of coping with different diseases and different health
           conditions.
