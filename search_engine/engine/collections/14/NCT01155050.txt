      LSUHCSD chronic disease, overweight or obese patients diagnosed with type II diabetes or
      hypertension. Primary emphasis will be on assessing the effect of tele-health home monitoring
      combined with motivational telephone coaching on weight loss and waist circumference as
      compared to self-directed, home monitoring alone, and telephone coaching alone. Secondary
      outcomes such as blood pressure, Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), fasting blood sugar, and cholesterol
      will be examined as well.
