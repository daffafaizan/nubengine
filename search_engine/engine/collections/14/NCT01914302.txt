      • Characterize expressed blood volume ≥1μL across representative, commercially available
      lancing device systems using finger sticks.

      Secondary Objectives: the following characterizations will be performed in the data analysis
      within each device and across each device:

        -  Correlation of Subject pain response to blood volume collected;

        -  Proportion of Subjects that produce sufficient blood to fill a 1µl test strip;

        -  Proportion of Subjects that generate ≥1µl blood volume;

        -  Proportion of Subjects who generate multiple- times the blood volume needed to fill a
           1µl test strip

        -  Proportion of Subjects who generate multiple- times ≥1µl of blood volume

        -  Proportion of Subjects that produce on average (≥1µl) of blood volume on 1st attempt

        -  Proportion of Subjects that produce on average (≥1µl) of blood volume on their first and
           second lancing attempt
