      catheters. Prospective and retrospective patients will be enrolled. The study will include
      patients in the EU who are receiving or have received one of the three subject Medcomp LTHD
      Catheters as their initial HD catheter. The data available and summarized for these products
      are considered sufficient to determine if undesirable side effects exist for the subject
      device and conclude that the device conforms to the requirement on acceptability of side
      effects (2017/745 MDR GSPR Annex 1). Additionally, the benefits of the subject devices
      outweigh the risks, and it can be concluded that the devices conform to the requirement on
      acceptable benefit/ risk profile (2017/745 MDR GSPR Annex 1).
