      PRK and CXL in Krumeich stage 1 and 2 keratoconic eyes. The investigators will be conducting
      a prospective study at the University of Ottawa Eye Institute. A total of 24 patients will be
      enrolled in the study divided into two groups:

      Group 1: PRK performed12-18 months after CXL; Group 2: PRK performed or on the same day as
      CXL

      Participants will be followed at regular intervals for 1 year and information regarding
      visual, refractive, keratometric and higher order aberration outcomes will be collected.

      The researchers aim to investigate the safety and efficacy of combined wavefront guided PRK
      and CXL. Results of this pilot study will used to provide estimates for sample size
      calculation for an extension of the study, which aims to determine whether sequential or same
      day procedure leads to better outcomes.
