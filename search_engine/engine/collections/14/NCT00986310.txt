      the scheduled date of hospitalization in the Epilepsy Monitoring Unit (EMU). At this visit a
      complete physical examination including vital signs and complete neurological examination,
      mental status, cranial nerves, motor examination, deep tendon reflexes, sensory examination,
      coordinator and gait will be performed. Baseline laboratory studies including complete blood
      count, serum electrolytes, renal and liver function studies and serum pregnancy test for
      female patients will also be performed. Study medication will be dispensed at this visit.

      Patients will be randomized to receive either 20 mg/day of fluoxetine (one pill) or placebo
      (one pill), to be started one week prior to the scheduled hospital admission date. The dose
      will be increased to two pills per day on day 1 of hospitalization bringing the total dose of
      fluoxetine to 40 mg/day in patients randomized to receive this medication. On the day of
      discharge from the hospital, the study medication will be reduced to 1 pill per day and the
      patient will be instructed to stop the medication one week following discharge. A follow-up
      clinic visit for the patient will be scheduled 1 month following hospital discharge, as is
      the usual protocol for patients undergoing VET at our institution.
