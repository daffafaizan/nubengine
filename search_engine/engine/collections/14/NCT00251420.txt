    
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients (age 35-70) and asthma patients (age
      20-60) referred to a 4 weeks inpatient rehabilitation program - who agree to participate in
      the project - are randomly assigned to one of three conditions:

        -  Writing about emotional consequences of their disease before the program starts

        -  Writing about physical consequences of their disease before the program starts

        -  Not writing

      All patients are measured (completing questionnaires at home) on: perceived quality of life,
      perceived health status and trait anxiety - 2 weeks before the program, 2 weeks after the
      program and 6 months after the program. FEV1 and 6 min walking distance are measured at the
      beginning and by the end of the program.

      In addition to questionnaires, all patients are asked to:

        -  Write in their own words ( 2 weeks after) to evaluate their stay at the rehabilitation
           clinic; and

        -  Write in their own words (6 months after) about how the disease affects their life at
           that point.

      Both quantitative and qualitative data will be used for analysis purposes.
