      targets appeared at the neutral word position and 10% at the sad word position. The placebo
      training procedure is a classic dot-probe task in which the targets appeared with equal
      probability in the sad (50%) and neutral (50%) word positions. The investigators assess
      attention bias scores, depressive symptoms, trait anxiety, rumination and self-report
      attention control ability at 1-week, 2-week, 4-week,7-week,3-month,4-month, 5-month, 6-month
      and 12-month follow-ups after training.
