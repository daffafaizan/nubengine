    
      This is a double blind, parallel, one centre study to determine if long term oral L-arginine
      administration is able to delay or prevent type 2 diabetes mellitus in patients with IGT and
      Metabolic Syndrome. Two hundred and ninety four subjects were recruited at the
      CardioMetabolic and Clinical Trials Unit of the San Raffaele Scientific Institute. One
      hundred and fourty two patients were randomized to enter the study. Patients were randomly
      assigned to two arms: oral L-arginine (6.4 g/die) or placebo in blind scheme. The treatment
      were maintained for 18 months. Visits will be performed every 3 months for clinical
      evaluation, blood samples, treatment supply and collect data on adverse events, if any.
      Furthermore, patients were contacted every month by telephone to evaluate the accurate
      continuation of the study and they were instructed to phone to the centre in case of possible
      adverse events.
