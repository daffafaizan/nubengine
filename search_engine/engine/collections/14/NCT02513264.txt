    
      The overall goal of the Registry for Asthma Characterization and Recruitment 2 (RACR2) is to
      create a database of participants who are potentially eligible for future Inner City Asthma
      Consortium (ICAC) clinical research studies. The registry will provide an avenue to assess
      various asthma and allergy characteristics, which will result in more efficient recruitment
      for current and future ICAC protocols.

      Potential participants will be recruited via telephone or in person. Those deemed potentially
      eligible for a current protocol or protocol in development may be invited to the clinic for
      further data collection and assessments. This registry allows flexibility in selecting the
      eligibility criteria and data collection to match planned or upcoming ICAC protocols. At each
      stage of data collection, participants may be discontinued, put on hold, or invited to
      participate in further screening activities, depending on the likelihood that they will
      qualify for a future protocol. Participants may opt to withdraw their information or
      discontinue from the registry at any time, in person, by telephone, or in writing.
