      phase 1. An interim analysis may be performed after phase 1 and the remainder (up to 65
      subjects) may be enrolled as part of phase 2.

      The study shall not be blinded prior to, during or post the procedure. All patients
      undergoing an endovascular procedure requiring an arteriotomy created by 14 to 22 F sheaths,
      via the common femoral artery will be screened against the inclusion/exclusion criteria. If
      the patient meets the requirements of the clinical investigation, they shall be invited to
      participate, provide informed consent and shall subsequently be assigned a 'Subject Number'.
      The closure will be percutaneous. An optional adjunctive endovascular balloon may be used to
      control bleeding. All safety data from the study will be assessed by the Data Safety
      Monitoring Committee on a continuous basis.

      The Purpose of the Study is to assess safety and performance of the PerQseal® + Closure
      Device when used with the L PerQseal® Introducer to percutaneously close femoral artery
      punctures and to induce arterial haemostasis in patients undergoing endovascular procedures
      requiring an arteriotomy created by 14 to 22 F sheaths.
