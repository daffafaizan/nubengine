      treatment portion of the study requires patients to visit the BIDMC daily, Monday through
      Friday, for 6 weeks. All participants will receive real cognitive training, but half of our
      participants will receive active TMS treatment and half will receive a placebo TMS treatment.
      However, those receiving the placebo treatment will be offered the real treatment upon the
      completion of the study. This study goes up to approximately 4.5 months.

      TMS is a noninvasive way of stimulating the brain, which is not painful and does not involve
      any needles or any form of surgery. It acts by delivering a magnetic stimulation to a
      particular region of your brain and that, coupled with the cognitive training, is what is
      being looked at in this study. The investigators are examining if this combination of TMS and
      cognitive training will improve your memory function and other mental functions such as
      language, orientation, and thinking or judgment.
