    
      To improve the success rates of pars plana vitrectomy(PPV) which is the most common surgical
      procedure for the repair of primary rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) and to avoid
      silicon oil tamponade and face-down position, all eyes enrolled into this clinical trail
      undergo 27G PPV combined with Healaflow patch and air tamponade which do not need face-down
      position in the postoperative period. HealaflowÂ® (Anteis S.A., Plan Les Ouates, Switzerland)
      consists of over 97% water, sodium hyaluronic acid (22.5 mg/ml) of nonanimal origin
      cross-linked with BDDE (1.4-Butanediol diglycidyl ether), and phosphate- and NaCl-salts to
      maintain a physiological pH (7.0) and osmolarity (305 mOsm/kg).

      At the time of study enrollment, physical examinations, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA),
      intraocular pressure(IOP) will be measured and fundoscopy, OCT, B-ultrasound will be
      performed.

      The patients are going to be followed up for at least 3 months, the main outcome measures are
      postoperative primary and final anatomic outcome, BCVA and complications.
