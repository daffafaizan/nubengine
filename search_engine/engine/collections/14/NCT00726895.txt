    
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate and compare the dose proportionality of 324 mg
      Quinine Sulfate capsules following a single oral dose (1 x 324 mg capsules versus 2 x 324 mg
      capsules) in healthy adult volunteers when administered under fasting conditions.

      Twenty-four healthy, non-smoking, non-obese, male and female volunteers at least 18 years of
      age will be randomly assigned in a crossover fashion to receive each of two Quinine Sulfate
      dosing regimens in sequence with a 7 day washout period between dosing periods. On the
      morning of Day 1, after an overnight fast of at least 10 hours, subjects will receive either
      a single oral dose of treatment A, Quinine Sulfate 1 x 324 mg capsule, or a single oral dose
      of treatment B, Quinine Sulfate 2 x 324 mg capsules. After a 7 day washout period,on the
      morning of Day 8 following an overnight fast of at least 10 hours, subjects will receive the
      alternate regimen. Blood samples will be drawn from all participants before dosing and for 24
      hours post-dose on a confined basis at times sufficient to adequately define the
      pharmacokinetics of Quinine Sulfate. Blood sampling will then continue on a non-confined
      basis at 36 and 48 hours post-dose. A further goal of this study is to evaluate the safety
      and tolerability of this regimen in healthy volunteers. Subjects will be monitored throughout
      the confinement portion of the study for adverse reactions to the study drug and/or
      procedures. Blood pressure and heart rate will be obtained prior to dosing and as scheduled
      following each dose. All adverse events whether elicited by query, spontaneously reported, or
      observed by clinic staff will be evaluated by the investigator and reported in the subject's
      case report form.
