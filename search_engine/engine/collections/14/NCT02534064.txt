      rays. However, because of our sedentary lifestyle and to the low sun exposure during winter,
      the vitamin D status is most frequently deficient. Hence the consumption of enriched food
      could be an efficient strategy to improve vitamin D status.

      The current recommendation for vitamin D intake is 20 µg per day for adults (19-50 yo) and
      between 25 and 37.5 µg per day for people over 50 years old according to the French National
      Medicine Academy. However, the recommended daily allowance (RDA) in France for vitamin D is
      limited to 5 µg corresponding to the maximum enrichment allowed in a food product. The
      current study is designed to evaluate if a daily consumption of two CALIN+ yogurts enriched
      with 5µg of vitamin D is sufficient to improve the vitamin D status in postmenopausal women.
