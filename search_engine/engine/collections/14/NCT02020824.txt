      study, several groups of patients will be distributed according to different conditions:
      exposure to anxiogenous virtual environments and exposure with the ability to control and
      secure the anxiogenous virtual environments.

      The interest of this project is to improve therapy by exposure to virtual reality. Our
      project offers a systematic therapeutic approach (using virtual reality and the concept of
      control) where current therapy are too often approximate. We aim to demonstrate the
      effectiveness of the control of virtual environments on symptomatic and psychophysiological
      levels, to evaluate the adoption of these methods in the couple patients-caregivers and also
      to understand the brain mechanisms (including those prefrontal) involved in this therapy.
