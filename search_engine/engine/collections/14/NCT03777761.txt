      (QT interval corrected for heart rate using Fridericia's method) in healthy individuals. In
      this design, study treatment will be dosed in 3 sequential treatment periods:

      Treatment A: Oral doses of 300mg tucatinib for 5 days

      Treatment B: Oral doses of matching placebo for tucatinib for 5 days

      Treatment C: A single oral dose of 400 mg of moxifloxacin

      Patients will be randomized based on 2-Williams-square design to 1 of 6 treatment sequences
      to maintain the study blind for tucatinib and placebo.
