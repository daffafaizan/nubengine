      posterolateral fusion mass in patients undergoing fusion surgery for spine cancer within 12
      months. II. To evaluate quality of life following the use of ChronOS as measured by (a) pain
      (or lack of pain) associated with pseudoarthrosis and (b) the need for additional treatment
      for instability as a result of hardware failure. OUTLINE: Patients undergo placement of
      beta-tricalcium phosphate bone graft strips posterolaterally during surgery. After completion
      of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 month and then every 3 months for 1 year.
