      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with doxorubicin, etoposide, vincristine, cyclophosphamide,
      and prednisone (EPOCH). II. Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive doxorubicin IV, etoposide IV,
      vincristine IV, and cyclophosphamide IV continuously over days 1-4. Patients also receive
      oral prednisone twice daily on days 1-5 and filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously beginning on
      day 6 until blood counts recover. Treatment continues every 21 days for a maximum of 8
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed
      every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years.
