      (SaMD); it will be used in combination with an electroretinogram (ERG). This study will be
      performed using three different ERG devices, currently marketed and cleared by the health
      authorities (Espion, UTAS and RETeval) to support the analytical, scientific and performance
      validity of the SaMD.

      Anomalies detected by ERG provide an objective measure that may reflect specific underlying
      dysfunctions in patients and thus hold promise to confirm relevant biosignatures in
      psychiatric disorders. Significant differences between patients with SZ, BPI and control
      subjects have been found despite confounding factors; this trial is required to better define
      the impact of patient characteristics on ERG features with a potential to refine the
      interpretation of results.

      This is a multicenter study. Three hundred subjects will be enrolled into three groups: 100
      SZ patients, 100 BPI patients and 100 control subjects (healthy volunteers).

      The primary objective is to further characterize the ERG components in SZ and BPI patients in
      order to develop prediction models that discriminate each pathology.

      The secondary objectives are the evaluation of the repeatability and reproducibility of the
      analysis of the ERG components in control subjects, the assessment of the reliability of ERG
      prediction score for patients following a repeat test, and the evaluation of the impact of
      different ERG devices on the data generated and the prediction models.
