      treatment for gastric cancer will continue to increase. Considering that there are no special
      measures to prevent side effects (bleeding, perforation, etc.) of this procedure, it is
      possible to reduce the large medical costs through the discovery of substances that can
      promote gastric mucosal healing. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) has demonstrated efficacy in
      preclinical endoscopic resection models.

      Aim: Evaluate the efficacy of PRP on participants submitted to ESD.

      Material and Methods: The investigators have evaluated a prospective clinical study. The
      investigators have included 10 participants submitted to ESD. Patients were informed and
      accepted to participate with a written consent. Prior to endoscopy PRP was obtained from
      autologous blood with a commercial kit. Resection was performed with standard technique.
      Immediately after the procedure, autologous PRP is applied to the artificial gastric ulcer
      using endoscopic spray. Participants were followed-up after the procedure.
