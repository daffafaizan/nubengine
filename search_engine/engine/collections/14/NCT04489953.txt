      criteria alone (clinical and immunologic) to define treatment failure as the trigger for
      switching to second-line antiretroviral therapy leads to poorer 6 month and 12 month
      treatment outcomes when compared to combining clinical and immunologic parameters with viral
      load (VL) monitoring.

      In addition the study aimed at obtaining plasma samples from treatment experienced children,
      for future resistance testing. The results of this study may help guide WHO and national
      pediatric ART programs on the need for routine VL monitoring for children initiating HAART in
      resource limited settings, where virologic tests including resistance testing are not readily
      available or affordable.
