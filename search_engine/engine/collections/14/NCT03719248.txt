      an adaptive mechanism to help limit systolic wall stress and preserve ejection fraction (EF).

      Aim: to investigate the effects of sympathetic blockade by HTEA on systolic and diastolic LV
      function in patients undergoing aortic valve replacement (AVR) alone or in addition to
      coronary artery bypass graft (CABG).

      Design: A prospective randomized controlled comparative study. Methods: Eighty patients
      received either general anesthesia ( control group n=40) or with high thoracic epidural
      analgesia(HTEA group n=40). Each group subdivided to normal (LVM) (n=20)or increased(LVM)
      group(n=20), all submitted to (AVR) alone or in addition to (CABG).Perioperative heart rate
      (HR), mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), incidence of ischemic ECG, LV systolic and
      diastolic function changes were measured till 48 h, postoperatively.

      Patients were subjected to ambulatory Holter monitoring, Hemodynamic measures, intraoperative
      transesophageal echocardiography (iTEE) and postoperative Trans Thoracic Echocardiography
      (TTE) to assess myocardial ischemia and Left ventricular systolic/diastolic function.
