      The study is a single-blinded randomized controlled intervention study. Forty postmenopausal
      women with late-onset asthma (>16 years at debut) are recruited from the asthma
      outpatient-clinic at Bispebjerg Hospital or other hospital/practitioner in the region and/or
      by advertisement. The participants are block-randomized into two groups of 20, where one
      group is control and the other undergoes a period of regular exercise training. The
      investigators will be blinded and will not know whether the subjects have trained or not.

      Detailed study design

      Participants allocated to the exercise training group undergo a training intervention
      consisting of 45 minutes of intermittent high intensity aerobic spinning training three times
      per week for 12 weeks. Participants allocated to the control group will continue usual care
      without training. No changes to current treatment will be made by the investigators on any of
      the groups.

      The training will consist of short periods of high intensity intervals where subjects reach
      above 80% of maximal oxygen consumption. Spinning sessions will be fully supervised by
      trained instructors with a bachelor of sports and science or bachelor of medicine and
      conducted in the Department of Nutrition, Exercise and Sports, University of Copenhagen.
      Subjects will wear heart rate monitors to ensure adherence to the training protocol. Within
      two weeks, before and after the intervention, participants from both groups undergo 3 days of
      testing.

      To ensure equal compliance with asthma medication both groups will receive daily electronic
      reminders. Once a week, all participants will be asked about their compliance to their
      medication.
