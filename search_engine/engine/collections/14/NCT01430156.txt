      they arrive in the hospital. The investigators will randomise them to drug or placebo and
      give the infusion prior to induction for their transplant.

      A blood sample will be taken prior to infusion and a renal biopsy will be taken before the
      graft is implanted. These will be used as baseline values.

      Patients will receive standard care from our unit. The investigators will use the routine
      blood test results (urea and creatinine) to determine the function of the graft.

      The investigators will take blood samples 24 hours after infusion of drug/placebo and use
      this to determine the primary outcome. Blood tests will be taken daily and a renal biopsy
      taken on day 5 to fulfil secondary objectives.
