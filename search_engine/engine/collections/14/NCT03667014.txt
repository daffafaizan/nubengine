      quality of life in atopic dermatitis (AD). Thirty patients with moderate to severe AD will
      receive dupilumab for a treatment period of 52 weeks (i.e. last injection on week 48).
      Improvement in patient quality of life after 52 weeks of treatment with dupilumab will be
      evaluated using validated dermatologic and non-dermatologic psychometric instruments. The
      primary endpoint is the improvement in quality of life measured by change in Psychological
      General Well-Being scale (PGWB) at Week 16 from baseline. Additionally, patients will be
      given a video recording device to document their experience with the study drug at home.
      Video footage of patient experiences will be compiled at the end of the study. The compiled
      video footage will subsequently be watched and analyzed to further understand the experiences
      of atopic dermatitis patients, and how undergoing dupilumab treatment alters these patients'
      experiences and attitudes with their skin disease.
