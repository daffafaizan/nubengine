    
      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To evaluate the efficacy, in terms of clinical response, pathologic response, and
           long-term disease-free survival, of a multidrug chemotherapy regimen patients with
           spindle cell or small round cell sarcoma.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

        -  Induction therapy: Patients receive vincristine IV, cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour and
           doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 48 hours on day 1 in week 0. Patients continue to
           receive vincristine IV once weekly in weeks 1 and 2. Patients also receive etoposide IV
           over 1 hour and ifosfamide IV over 1 hour for 5 days in week 3. Treatment repeats every
           6 weeks for 2 courses.

        -  Local control: After completing induction therapy, patients are reevaluated for local
           control therapy. Some patients may undergo surgery and/or radiotherapy (e.g.,
           brachytherapy, intraoperative radiotherapy, external beam therapy). Patients who undergo
           surgery begin consolidation therapy 2 weeks after completing surgery. Some patients
           undergo radiotherapy 5 days a week for 5Â½ weeks beginning at week 12 and/or after
           surgery (weeks 15-16).

        -  Consolidation therapy: Patients receive vincristine IV, doxorubicin hydrochloride IV
           over 1 hour, and cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour once in weeks 12 and 18*. Patients also
           receive etoposide IV over 1 hour and ifosfamide IV over 1 hour for 5 days in week 15.
           Patients are reevaluated for local control therapy at week 21.

      NOTE: *Patients undergoing radiotherapy do not receive doxorubicin hydrochloride in week 18
      or week 24.

        -  Maintenance therapy: Patient receive vincristine IV, doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 1
           hour, and cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour once in week 24. Patients also receive
           etoposide IV over 1 hour and ifosfamide IV over 1 hour for 5 days in week 21. Treatment
           repeats every 6 weeks for 3 courses. In week 36, patients receive vincristine,
           doxorubicin hydrochloride and cyclophosphamide OR etoposide and ifosfamide as before. In
           week 39 patients receive etoposide and ifosfamide as before.

      After completion of treatment, patients are followed periodically for at least 5 years.
