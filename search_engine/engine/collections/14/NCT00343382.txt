      are stratified according to age (18 to 45 vs 46 to 55 vs 56 to 65 vs > 65), concurrent
      tamoxifen therapy (yes vs no vs unknown [e.g., on a blinded clinical study]), concurrent
      aromatase inhibitor therapy (yes vs no vs unknown [e.g., on a blinded clinical study]), and
      perception of severity of vaginal symptoms at baseline (mild vs moderate vs severe). Patients
      are randomized to 1 of 4 treatment arms. The primary and secondary objectives of the study
      are described below.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the effectiveness of pilocarpine hydrochloride for alleviation of vaginal
           dryness in patients with breast cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Evaluate any toxicities arising from pilocarpine hydrochloride in these patients.

        -  Evaluate quality of life of these patients treated with pilocarpine hydrochloride.

      Quality of life was assessed at baseline and then weekly for 6 weeks.
