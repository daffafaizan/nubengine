    
      COPD is a highly prevalent disease, with a prevalence among people 40 years of age or older
      of 10.1% worldwide and 13.7% in China. COPD has become the third leading cause of death
      worldwide. Frequent acute exacerbation and exercise limitation broadly exist in COPD
      patients, especially those in GOLD stage 3 or 4. Although appropriate pharmacological
      therapies have been proven to be effective in COPD management, however, many gaps are still
      to be filled. For example, the adverse effects of pharmacologic therapies can never be
      ignored. The investigator's previous studies suggested that traditional Chinese medicine
      (TCM) has effect on GOLD stage 3 or 4 COPD.

      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial to evaluate the
      effect of Bufei Yishen granule on reducing acute exacerbation in GOLD stage 3 or 4 COPD
      subjects. After a 14-day run-in period, 348 subjects will be randomly assigned to treatment
      group or control group for 52-week treatment. The primary outcomes are frequency and duration
      of acute exacerbation. The secondary outcomes include mortality, pulmonary function, clinical
      symptoms, exercise capacity, quality of life and treatment satisfaction. Safety will also be
      assessed.
