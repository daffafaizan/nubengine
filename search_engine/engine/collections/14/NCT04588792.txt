    
      This double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, parallel-group phase 2/3 study will study
      the utility of nebulized furosemide for pulmonary inflammation in Intubated, mechanically
      ventilated Patients with COVID-19. The primary objective of the study is to establish the
      efficacy and safety of nebulized furosemide for the treatment of respiratory failure
      secondary to COVID-19 infection requiring invasive mechanical ventilation. The secondary
      objective is to delineate the anti-inflammatory properties of furosemide in COVID- 19
      patients using pharmacokinetic / pharmacodynamic analysis. The duration of the intervention
      will be up to 28 days of intervention and patients will be followed till 60 days post
      randomization. Participants will be randomized to either: Intervention Group: 40 mg
      furosemide per dose, given by nebulization (4 mL of 10 mg/mL furosemide in 0.9% saline
      solution) over 30 mins four times daily (Q6H) for up to 28 days OR Control Group: placebo,
      given by nebulization (4 mL of 0.9% saline solution) over 30 mins four times daily for up to
      28 days. One hundred and forty-four (144) evaluable patients will be enrolled in the Phase 2
      study. If evidence of efficacy is found in the Phase 2 portion, these patients will be
      enrolled in the Phase 3 study which aims to recruit 640 patients total (496 additional
      patients to the phase 2 patients).
