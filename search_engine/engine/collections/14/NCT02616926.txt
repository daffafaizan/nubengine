    
      Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging system is the most widely used stage
      classification for HCC management. For patients with intermediate HCC, palliative treatment
      transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) was recommended as first choice treatment. However,
      this recommendation remains controversial. The advice for diagnosis and treatment of HCC from
      former Chinese Ministry of Health indicated that BCLC may not be suitable in China as most
      HCC patients were found in intermediate or advanced stage. In recent years, more and more
      studies declared surgical resection as a better choice for HCC patients in BCLC stage B.
      However, lack of randomization, small sample size and lack of prospective studies limit the
      strength of evidence.

      To solve this dilemma, a prospective randomized control study was performed to compare the
      efficacy (1-, 2-, 3-year survival) between surgical resection group and TACE plus
      radiofrequency ablation group in HCC patients in intermediate stage. This study will provide
      powerful evidence regarding the better treatment option for HCC patients in BCLC B stage,
      which will benefit the treatment efficacy of HCC patients in BCLC B stage.
