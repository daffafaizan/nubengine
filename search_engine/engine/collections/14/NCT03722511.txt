      quality of life and intestinal absorption in patients with Carcinoid Syndrome and
      Neuroendocrine Tumors. The hypothesis is that Enterade® when combined with standard
      supportive care will improve patient-reported quality of life and help maintain the small
      bowel's ability to absorb and retain fluids, possibly leading to a reduction in diarrhea
      frequency.

        -  This is a non-randomized, supportive-care study.

        -  Potentially eligible patients will be screened in the University of Kentucky Markey
           Cancer Center clinics.

        -  During the screening visit, immediately after signing informed consent, the participant
           will be given both flavors of enterade® (original vanilla and refreshing orange) to test
           tolerability and taste.

        -  Eligible subjects will be given a stool diary and will be asked to document daily stool
           output (frequency and consistency of stool), use of anti-diarrheal medication and
           gastrointestinal discomforts (bloating, cramping).

        -  All lab and screening tests should be completed within 2 weeks prior to
           registration/initiation of study.

        -  The study is broken into 3 distinct segments and will apply to all enrolled
           participants: Baseline observation (Weeks 1-4), Enterade® administration period (4
           weeks), Post-Enterade® Period (4 weeks).

        -  After relapse of diarrhea is documented or the 4 weeks of post-Enterade® observation are
           completed (whatever happens first), participants will be given the option to restart
           Enterade® for 1 additional month.
