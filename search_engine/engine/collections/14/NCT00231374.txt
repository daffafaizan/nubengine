      being asked to be in this study. A myelogram is an imaging study with x-rays after an agent
      is put into the spine that shows spinal fluid on the x-ray. It requires insertion of a needle
      into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) inside the spine. CSF is a bodily fluid that bathes the
      brain, spinal cord, and nerve roots. This study is being conducted to measure CSF pressure
      changes with different patient positioning.

      We are motivated to do this research study to better treat patients who develop a spinal
      fluid leak during a myelogram or other spine procedure. The tissue that holds the
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is called the dura. During surgery or other procedures, the dura
      can develop a tear. Dural tears can result in a leakage of CSF. CSF leaks are a recognized
      complication of spinal surgery. Currently, there is no evidence on whether or not a specific
      postoperative spine position is beneficial, especially for cervical (neck spine) CSF leaks.
      The process of dural healing after a dural tear is influenced by CSF pressure. High CSF
      pressure may inhibit dural healing. We want to find the patient position (sitting, lying
      down, or reclining) that reduces the CSF pressure the most. To do this, we want to attach a
      pressure monitor to the needle that is normally placed in the spine for a myelogram and
      measure the CSF pressure.
