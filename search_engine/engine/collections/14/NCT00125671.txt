      extremities, and leads to intermittent claudication, leg ulceration and gangrene. More
      importantly, symptomatic PVD is an ominous sign that widespread atherosclerosis is present
      and patients with this condition suffer a threefold increase in myocardial infarction (MI),
      stroke, and CV death. These CV events are a consequence of rupture of an atherosclerotic
      plaque, which leads to platelet activation and thrombin generation, thrombus formation and
      occlusion of a critical blood vessel. Antiplatelet therapy has been clearly demonstrated to
      reduce major CV events. It is also reasonable to expect that this process may be further
      attenuated by the addition of an anti-thrombin agent (such as warfarin) in combination with
      antiplatelet agents.

      WAVE is a large, international, multicentre, randomized clinical trial in high-risk PVD
      patients to evaluate the additional benefit of moderate intensity warfarin (target INR of
      2.4-3.0) to antiplatelet therapy compared to antiplatelet therapy alone in reducing serious
      cardiovascular events.

      There are currently 80 active centres following participants in Canada, Poland, Australia,
      Hungary, China, Ukraine, and the Netherlands. Following randomization to one of the two
      treatment groups, participants will require clinic or phone follow-up visits every 3 months
      for 2.5 or 3.5 years. For participants on warfarin, INRs will be measured monthly or more
      frequently if required. For participants who stop warfarin therapy prematurely, every attempt
      will be made to have them restart it
