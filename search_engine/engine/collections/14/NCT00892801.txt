    
      Phase I is intended to determine the maximum tolerated dose. Study drug will be administered
      orally, once a day, for 15 days, one day prior to initiation of WBRT at 5 or 10 mg/day during
      the phase I component. One of these doses will be selected as the maximum tolerable dose and
      will be selected for the phase II component.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine the maximum-tolerated dose of everolimus when combined concurrently with
           whole-brain radiotherapy in patients with brain metastasis from stage IV non-small cell
           lung cancer. (Phase I)

        -  To evaluate the median survival of these patients treated with this regimen. (Phase II)

      Secondary

        -  To assess the response rates in these patients. (Phase II)

        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of this regimen in these patients. (Phase II)

        -  To determine time to CNS (neurological) progression, confirmed by MRI, in these
           patients. (Phase II)

        -  To determine time to systemic (non-CNS) progression in these patients. (Phase II)

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of everolimus.

      Patients undergo 10 fractions of whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) beginning on day 0, 5 days
      per week, and receive oral everolimus once daily on days -1 to 13. Beginning 2 weeks after
      completion of WBRT, patients receive oral everolimus once daily for 28 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 2 months for 2 years.
