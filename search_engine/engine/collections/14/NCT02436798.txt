    
      The specific objectives are to:

        1. Determine and compare the cardiac safety profile of ondansetron in children, when used
           for prevention and management of post-operative nausea and vomiting and chemotherapy
           induced nausea and vomiting. Identify clinical factors including pre-existing cardiac
           conditions or physiological conditions that predispose to ventricular arrhythmias,
           concomitant cardiotoxic chemotherapy or concomitant volatile anaesthetic agents and
           investigate their impact on cardiac adverse effects of ondansetron.

        2. Determine and compare the cardiac safety profile of ondansetron when used in pregnant
           women or women of a reproductive age for the treatment of hyperemesis gravidarum or
           post-operative nausea and vomiting. Identify clinical factors including pre-existing
           cardiac conditions or physiological conditions, which predispose to ventricular
           arrhythmias that may support implementation of risk mitigation actions.

        3. Identify genetic variants associated with 5-HT3 antagonist-induced prolongation of QT
           interval.
