      number is much higher in the elderly population and may be as high as 30%. CKD is an
      independent risk factor of cardiovascular disease (CVD). This is called "Cardio-renal
      Continuum". The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAS) plays pivotal roles in both
      cardiovascular and renal functions.

      The increased oxidative stress by activated RAS on vascular endothelium is one of important
      factor to development of Cardio-renal Continuum. The blockade of RAS by angiotensin I
      converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and/or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) has been
      reported to ameliorate the renal disease and CVD; however,they do not completely suppress RAS
      and may induce aldosterone breakthrough that plays important roles for the development of
      CVD. Eplerenone, a selective aldosterone blocker, is effective against essential
      hypertension; however, little is known about the effects of eplerenone on heart and kidney
      functions in elderly hypertensive CKD patients. In this study, we assessed the efficacy of
      eplerenone on heart and kidney functions in elderly hypertensive early stage (stage1
      (eGFR>=90ml/min/1.73m2) and stage2 (eGFR 60-89ml/min/1.73m2)) CKD patients.
