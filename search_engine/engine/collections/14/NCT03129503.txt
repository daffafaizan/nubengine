      different pathophysiological processes in both clinical settings - plaque rupture (RFC) and
      plaque-erosion (IFC) with focus on to the inflammatory process and molecular mechanisms (b)
      identify special signatures including clinical and biochemical markers as biomarkers subject
      to different culprit plaques types and (c) to test its prognostic implications in patients
      after ACS.
