      than one treatment group), dose-ranging study (clinical study where different doses of study
      medication are tested against each other) to evaluate the safety, acceptability,
      pharmacokinetics, and ex vivo pharmacodynamics of a single and multiple intramuscular
      injections of long acting TMC278 to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) seronegative
      (having a negative serum reaction) male and female participants. The study consists of 3
      phases including screening phase, treatment phase, and the follow up phase (approximately 4
      to 6 months after the first dose of study medication). In treatment phase, enrolled
      participants will be divided in to 2 arms, ie, Arm A (female participants) which will be
      further divided in to Arm 1A, Arm 2A, Arm 3A, Arm 4A, and Arm 5A with 12 female participants
      per arm; and Arm B (male participants) which will be further divided in to Arm 1B, Arm 2B,
      Arm 3B, Arm 4B, and Arm 5B with 6 male participants per arm. Safety evaluations will include
      assessment of adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, electrocardiogram, physical
      examination, and vital signs which will be monitored throughout the study. The total duration
      of study for each participant will be approximately 5 to 7 months.
