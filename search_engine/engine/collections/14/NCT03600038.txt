      are systemic barriers to delivering smoking cessation interventions to cancer patients. One
      solution for addressing these barriers is to give patients immediate access to smoking
      cessation treatment via a smartphone application. The Quit2Heal smartphone app is engaging
      and tailored to the specific needs of cancer patients, and can be integrated into routine
      cancer care. The goal of this study is to determine whether Quit2Heal provides higher quit
      rates than the current standard smoking cessation app.
