      while watching a static image of a flower (image group) or to exercise treadmill testing
      while watching a video of 5 amateur runners, running across and fields, giving the patient
      the impression of running within the group (video group). After the exercise test patients
      were asked to score their perceived comfort level and achieved level of their subjective
      physical limit on a 10 point scale.

      Standard exercise treadmill parameters, as well as baseline demographic data were recorded of
      each patient. Patients with missing data was excluded of the analysis.

      Statistic analysis was performed with t-test for normally distributed data and
      Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney-Test for non-normal data.
