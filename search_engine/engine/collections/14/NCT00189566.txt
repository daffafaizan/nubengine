    
      The main purpose of this research study is to find out if treatment of early relapse of
      ovarian or fallopian tube or peritoneal cancer with paclitaxel (Taxol*) weekly administered,
      in lower doses in combination with topotecan (Hycamtin*) or carboplatin will improve efficacy
      compared to weekly administration of paclitaxel in monotherapy. Tolerance in the three groups
      will be compared.
