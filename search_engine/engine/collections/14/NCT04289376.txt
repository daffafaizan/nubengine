      will be required to have experience in baseball or softball at the high school level or above
      within the last 10 years. A further 10 subjects will be recruited who did not have baseball
      experience at or above the high school level. Upon entering the laboratory, the experiment
      will be explained to the subjects. Subjects will be consented. Then, the subject's visual
      acuity and stereoacuity (depth perception) will be measured.

      If subjects continue on to the experiment, they will also be asked to complete a short survey
      on previous baseball experience.

      Subjects will sit approximately 35 feet and facing a projector screen. They will then
      participate in trials in which they mimic catching a ball thrown by a pitcher. Six different
      pitch videos will be shown. The subjects will then attempt to catch the ball for each video.
      The movement of the subject's eye will be tracked using an eye tracker.
