      spectroscopy (NIRS, Invos 5100; Somanet- ics Corporation, Troy, MI) will be performed on all
      patients with 4 optodes (right and left temporal area, arm and leg). Continuous rSO2 values
      will be stored on a hard disk with a 15 seconds update within intraoperative period and first
      4 hours after the surgery. Desaturation phases (saturation decrease more than 20% of the
      basal value for more than 15 seconds) will be correlated to operative procedure or events.
      Postoperative adverse events will be collected. A correlation between desaturation and
      postoperative adverse events will be done with a multiple linear regression model.
