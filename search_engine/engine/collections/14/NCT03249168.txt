      Post laparoscopic shoulder pain is caused by irritation and/or injury of the diaphragm and
      phrenic nerve by local acidosis and irritative effect of carbon dioxide during
      pneumoperitoneum or distention forces on the diaphragm. Duloxetine is a selective serotonin
      and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor antidepressant . It is used to treat major depressive
      disorder in adults. Duloxetine is also used to treat general anxiety disorder. It is also
      used in adults to treat fibromyalgia (a chronic pain disorder), or chronic muscle or joint
      pain (such as low back pain and osteoarthritis pain). Duloxetine is also used to treat
      diabetic neuropathy. Previous studies focused on the use of gabapentin and pregabalin (both
      are antineuropathic pain medications) to prevent post laparoscopic shoulder pain after
      laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy and laparoscopic cholecystectomy showed favorable results and
      since duloxetine is an antineuropathic pain medications we assume its use will ameliorate
      diaphragmatic irritation and hencepost laparoscopic shoulder pain.
