      have great initiative and passive bending capacity and have greatly expanded its application.
      In our clinical practice, we have found that IPA (Infundibulopelvic angle) is no longer a
      decisive factor for the success of f-URS（flexible ureteroscope） surgeries. Thus, we think it
      is necessary to have further study on the effect of anatomy of renal collecting system for
      f-URS surgeries.
