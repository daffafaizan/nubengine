      quality assurance in medicine a detailed clinical characterization of the TAVI-population was
      required. Furthermore, a detailed description of the procedure and peri-procedural
      complications until discharge was required. In our center we designed and are routinely using
      a TAVI database which fulfills the authority requirements as well as has additional data
      needed for planning and documentation of TAVI procedure. Since there is already a
      considerable number of TAVI patients in this database we aim to perform statistical analyses
      answering different question in this filed.
