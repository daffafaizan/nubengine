    
      VALTIVE1 is a multi-centre, single arm, non-interventional biomarker study, which will enrol
      176 participants who are 16 years or older and who have FIGO stage IIIc/ IV ovarian cancer on
      treatment with first-line platinum-based chemotherapy and bevacizumab. Potential participants
      will be identified at their treating hospital.

      The definition of vascular response is either (i) stable or reduced concentrations of Tie2
      after 6 weeks of treatment or (ii) a confirmed reduction in plasma Tie2 of >10% within 9
      weeks of starting treatment.

      Patients enrolled into the VALTIVE 1 study will provide blood samples twice before treatment
      with bevacizumab and then at the end Cycles 1, 2, and 3, at the end of cytotoxic
      chemotherapy, at 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, at the end of treatment, and at disease
      progression. The early samples will be used to refine the definition and number of required
      samples needed to define a Tie2-vascular response. Samples collected at 3 months, 6 months, 9
      months, at the end of treatment, and at disease progression will be used to investigate the
      relationship between Tie2-defined vascular progression and RECIST1.1- or clinically-defined
      Progression Disease (PD).

      While the patients receive single agent maintenance bevacizumab, patients will undergo
      RECIST1.1 scanning at 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, end of treatment and at disease
      progression, if not before. These scans will also be reported to RECIST 1.1.

      Progressive disease will be defined by the date of radiological or clinically identified
      progressive disease or death.
