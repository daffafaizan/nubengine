    
      Femur head necrosis is one of the major side effects of corticosteroid therapy. Since
      corticosteroids are metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 (CYP) 3A, a low endogenous
      activity of this enzyme may contribute to the pathogenesis of ONFH. The purpose of the
      present study was to examine the possible association of hepatic CYP3A activity and the
      susceptibility to femur head necrosis in patients treated with corticosteroids.
