      asthma, and investigate what is the most efficient and increases the physical capacity, and
      quality of life and reduces the inflammatory mediators.

      Sixty asthmatic adults will be randomly assigned into two groups: CT (Continuous training) or
      IT (Interval training). CT will have treatment 2x week, 40 min./session, 60-75% of maximum
      heart rate intensity and IT also 2x week, 40 min./session, 80-140% of the maximum load
      intensity, both performed in ergometer cycle by 24 weeks.
