      colonoscopy is the best technique to identify polyps, polyps can be missed even in expert
      hands. Inspection of the bowel occurs predominantly during colonoscope withdrawal. Tailoring
      a patients position according to the segment of bowel being examined (dynamic position
      change) is a technique that has been shown to improve visualisation of the bowel wall and
      polyp detection. However, changing patient position during colonoscope withdrawal has not
      been widely accepted in clinical practice. This may be because of a lack of awareness of the
      literature, a perception that the benefit is negligible and the inconvenience of changing a
      patients position in addition to the small number of publications demonstrating this to be
      beneficial. We plan to compare the detection of polyps when colonoscope withdrawal is done
      with dynamic position change (a planned series of position changes to optimise mucosal
      visualisation) and the supine position (laid on back). These strategies will be compared by
      performing a double colonoscope withdrawalÍ¾ The first withdrawal will be performed either
      supine or in the dynamic position. This will be followed by a second insertion and withdrawal
      in the alternative position. The order in which these strategies are performed will be
      randomised i.e. supine then dynamic or dynamic then supine.
