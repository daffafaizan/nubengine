        -  Determine the relationship between UGT1A1 genotypes and drug pharmacokinetics and
           occurrence of gastrointestinal toxicity in cancer patients previously treated with
           flavopiridol on protocol NCI-97-C-0171C.

      OUTLINE: Genomic DNA from pre-existing samples of serum or plasma from each patient is
      analyzed for UGT1A1 gene by polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing. Results are then
      analyzed for a possible association between UGT1A1 genotypic variation and susceptibility to
      flavopiridol.

      Patients do not receive the results of the genetic testing, and the results do not influence
      the type or duration of treatment.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study.
