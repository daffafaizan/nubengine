      disorder. PCT leads to variation in scapular and humeral kinematics. Two techniques
      considered in our study for regaining normal range of motion at shoulder joint and improving
      PCT, one is the pragmatic posterior capsular stretch (PPCS) & the other one is cross body
      stretch (CBS) Objective: The aim of our study id to compare the short term effect of PPCS
      versus CBS on range of motion on shoulder joint in healthy individuals. And to evaluate the
      feedback of subjects regarding both the interventions.

      Methodology: Through RCT 30 asymptomatic subjects (15 males, 15 females) . A simple random
      sampling technique was used. Subjects were screen through a functional movement screening
      tool. The change in hand behind neck and hand behind back will be measured through measuring
      tape. Shoulder ROM and functional movements for both the stretches will be campared
