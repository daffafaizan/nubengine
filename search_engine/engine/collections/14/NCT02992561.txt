      treatment or waitlist control group, respectively. The treatment will be provided by

      up, sociodemographic data, trauma exposure, perpetrated violent acts, PTSD, recent
      aggression, functionality and drug dependency will be assessed. The interviews will be
      conducted by blind Congolese psychological interviewers after an intensive 3-weeks training
