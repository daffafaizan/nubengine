      recurrent cardiovascular events, such as heart attack or stroke, in patients who have already
      experienced at least one cardiovascular event. This study will investigate if the addition of
      150,000 international units of cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) by mouth every 2 months to a
      subject's medication regimen will prevent further cardiovascular events.
