      We will conduct a retrospective cohort study. After obtaining all required ethics approvals,
      we will obtain data from the ARISE, CHEST, and ADRENAL studies. We will obtain from each
      dataset, for each trial participant with sepsis, data regarding; Demographic details,
      co-morbidities, pre-morbid living situation, baseline severity of illness, receipt of and
      duration of organ support during the index hospitalisation, Duration of ICU stay during index
      hospitalisation, ICU mortality, Hospital length of stay (LOS) and mortality for index
      hospitalisation, Discharge destination from index hospitalisation, readmissions to hospital
      up to 2 years, long term mortality, and quality of life as measured by the EQ5D at longest
      follow-up.

      The primary objective of the study is to assess the association between Days Alive and Out of
      Hospital at day 90 and longer-term quality of life as measured by the EQ5D.

      Secondary objectives include:

        -  To describe the characteristics of DAOH90 in patients with sepsis and septic shock with
           respect to the distribution and the pattern of variability

        -  To assess the construct validity of DAOH90, by testing the association between baseline
           variables and process of care variables and DAOH90, with the hypothesis that indicators
           for more "sickness" will be associated with fewer DAOH

             -  Higher age

             -  Higher APACHE II

             -  Higher baseline lactate

             -  Higher SOFA score at baseline

             -  Premorbid accommodation in a long term care facility compared to independent living

             -  More co-morbidities at baseline

             -  Requirement for more organ support: requirement for 1, 2 or 3 (CVS, Resp, RRT)
                organ supports, and duration of organ support

             -  Participants with septic shock compared to sepsis

             -  Longer duration of admission for the index ICU admission

             -  Longer duration of hospital admission for the index hospitalisation

        -  To assess the extent to which DAOH90 captures long term mortality and resource use, by
           comparing the DAOH at day 90 to the DAOH at day 30, day 180 and day 365.

      Sensitivity analysis For the primary analysis we will calculate the Days Alive and Out of
      Hospital with DAOH=0 for all patients who die prior to day 90, regardless of whether the
      death occurred in hospital or subsequent to discharge.

      We will conduct a sensitivity analysis with Days Alive and Out of Hospital = the number of
      days alive and out of hospital prior to death. For example of a patient had a one week
      hospital admission and then spent 5 days at home prior to death the number of days alive and
      out of hospital = 5.

      We will conduct a subgroup analysis based on:

        -  The group of trial participants who were admitted to the ICU directly from the Emergency
           Department compared to those admitted from the Operating Theatre or ward

        -  Sex
