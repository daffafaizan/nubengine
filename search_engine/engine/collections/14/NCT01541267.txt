      target of therapy to reduces both proteinuria and the rate of decline of the glomerular
      filtration rate in non-diabetic chronic renal diseases. Despite recent progress, however,
      there is still no optimal therapy that can stop the progression of these nephropathies.
      Therefore, it is necessary to optimize such treatment for further improving renal outcome.

      The aim of the present study was to compare the effects of three different types of RAAS
      blockade: (1) mineralocorticoid receptor blocker (MRB) + angiotensin receptor antagonist
      (ARA); (2) direct renin inhibitor (DRI) + ARA and (3) double maximal dose of ARA on 24 hours
      proteinuria in patients with non-diabetic chronic kidney disease
