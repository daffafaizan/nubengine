      of maximally debulked patients with stage III/IV endometrial carcinoma treated with
      whole-abdominal irradiation vs. doxorubicin/cisplatin. II. Compare the incidence and type of
      acute and late adverse events observed with these two treatment regimens. III. Compare
      changes in fatigue, elimination, and neurologic impairment that impact on quality of life in
      patients treated with these two regimens. IV. Assess the difference in short-term versus
      long-term impact on quality of life between the two treatment groups. V. Compare
      quality-of-life outcomes over time between these two treatment groups.

      OUTLINE: Randomized study. Arm I: Radiotherapy. Whole-abdominal irradiation using equipment
      with photon energies ranging from 6 to 25 MV. Arm II: 2-Drug Combination Chemotherapy.
      Doxorubicin, DOX, NSC-123127; Cisplatin, CDDP, NSC-119875.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: It is anticipated that 355 patients will be entered over 7.4 years.
