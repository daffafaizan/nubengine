      cGy/20 fractions over 28 days) with a conventional schedule (6600 cGy/33 fractions over 45
      days) in men receiving radiotherapy for Stage T1a moderately or poorly differentiated, or
      T1b, T1c, or T2 prostate cancer. The primary outcome is local control in the prostate and
      secondary outcomes include toxicity, disease free survival, survival, quality of life and
      economics.
