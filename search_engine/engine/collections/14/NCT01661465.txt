      critical for both effective current treatment of the presenting clinical issue and prevention
      of future incidents. Identification, engagement and treatment of substance use disorders
      decreased trauma and emergency department visits and medical comorbidities (Bertholet et al.,
      2005; Kaner et al., 2007). To ensure consistent documentation of alcohol and substance use,
      the emergency medicine is initiating a new standard of care for substance use screening: the
      use of a brief self-evaluation questionnaire on alcohol, tobacco and illicit substance use to
      be completed in triage. This questionnaire will allow emergency medicine patients presenting
      to the emergency room. This research study will perform a chart review on all self-evaluation
      questionnaires on alcohol, tobacco and substance use to determine the prevalence of use of
      specific substances in this patient population and associated demographic predictors and
      medical comorbidities. This study will also review medical records after one year of the
      index emergency room visit to establish rates or re-presentation and hospitalization
      correlated with different substance use.
