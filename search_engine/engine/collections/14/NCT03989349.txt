    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center, parallel-group study in
      adult and adolescent subjects of age 12 years and above with moderate-to-severe AD. Eligible
      subjects must have a documented history of inadequate response to topical AD medication(s).
      Approximately 750 subjects will be randomized in 2:1 to receive either nemolizumab or
      placebo, stratified by baseline disease severity (Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) = 3,
      moderate; IGA = 4, severe) and peak pruritus numeric rating scale (PP NRS) severity (PP NRS =
      7; PP NRS < 7).
