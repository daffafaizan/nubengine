    
      To investigate the following parameters in HIV-infected patients switching antiretroviral
      therapy from TDF/FTC/nevirapine to TDF/FTC/rilpivirine for 60 days:

        -  CSF exposure and CSF : plasma ratio of rilpivirine

        -  Safety and tolerability of switching antiretroviral therapy from TDF/FTC/nevirapine to
           TDF/FTC/rilpivirine

        -  Changes in cerebral metabolites measured via 1-H MRS after switching antiretroviral
           therapy to TDF/FTC/rilpivirine

        -  Seminal fluid exposure of rilpivirine
