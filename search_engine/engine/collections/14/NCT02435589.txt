      Inaccurate pain assessment and the resulting inadequate treatment of pain in critically ill
      adults can have significant physiological and psychological consequences.

      The investigators will examine whether a systematic pain assessment approach can improve
      patients outcomes.

      120 ICU patients will be randomized either to control or intervention group. The control
      group will receive standard care plus pain assessments but nurses and physicians will be
      blind of these results. The intervention group will receive standard care plus systematic
      pain assessment and the results will be notified to nurses and physicians.
