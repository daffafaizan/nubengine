      formation by the deposition of apical tissues subsequent to disinfection of a necrotic root
      canal and its contents and creation of a scaffold upon which cells can proliferate. While the
      proposed treatment protocol is currently being used in clinical practice and has been shown
      to be successful in case reports and case series, the nature of the proliferating apical
      tissues remains unknown. Thus, this study is uniquely positioned to address a critical gap in
      knowledge in the regeneration of a functional pulp-dentin complex. Moreover, results obtained
      from pediatric cases may well provide the essential foundation of knowledge for endodontists
      to apply this knowledge to the more difficult situation of regenerating the pulp-dentin
      complex of the full mature permanent tooth.
