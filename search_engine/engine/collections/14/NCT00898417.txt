      Primary

        -  To develop a serum proteomic classifier using matrix-assisted
           laser-desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry analysis of blood samples
           from patients with non-squamous cell non-small cell lung cancer to predict benefit, in
           terms of survival and time to progression, from treatment with bevacizumab in
           combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel.

      Secondary

        -  To better quantitate candidate biomarkers by using more advanced mass spectrometric
           technologies, including multiple-reaction monitoring and heavy-labeled peptides.

      OUTLINE: Previously collected pre-treatment samples of serum or plasma are randomly selected
      from patients enrolled on protocol ECOG-4599 (i.e., 60 from the bevacizumab arm and 30 from
      the control arm). Samples are analyzed by matrix-assisted laser-desorption/ionization
      time-of-flight mass spectrometry to identify patterns from protein spectra that correlate
      with patient survival.
