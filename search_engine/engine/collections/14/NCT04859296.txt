      occasional cannabis smokers is to ascertain the dose-dependent analgesic and
      appetite-stimulating effects of ecologically relevant doses of cannabigerol (CBG) alone and
      in combination with a sub-analgesic / sub-appetite stimulating, minimally psychoactive dose
      of THC and an analgesic, appetite-stimulating, but intoxicating dose of THC.
