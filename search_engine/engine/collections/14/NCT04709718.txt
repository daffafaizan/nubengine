      to 20% . They are most often discovered incidentally on imaging studies. Typical hemangiomas
      usually do not increase in size over time and therefore are unlikely to cause symptoms. Giant
      hepatic hemangiomas (GHH) are defined as hemangiomas larger than 5 cm . They are usually
      responsible for overt clinical symptoms and complications consisting, most often, of upper
      abdominal pain, hemorrhage, biliary compression, or a consumptive coagulopathy that may
      require prompt surgical intervention or other treatments . Management of liver hemangiomas
      ranges from close observation to surgery depending upon the site, size and symptoms .

      It is widely accepted that intervention is indicated only for symptomatic hemangiomas.
      Surgical resection is indicated in patients with abdominal complaints or complications, or
      when diagnosis remains inconclusive. The ideal surgical treatment for GHH is still
      controversial. Enucleation is the preferred surgical method based on the existing literature.
      In this study, we report our 17-year experience of clinical management of GHH.
