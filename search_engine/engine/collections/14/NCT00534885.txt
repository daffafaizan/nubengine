      vaccine. Each dose contained 250 U HAV antigen in 0.5 milliliter.

      Total 400 subjects were enrolled and assigned into four groups, each receiving one of the
      three lots of HealiveÂ® or an established control vaccine at month 0 and 6. Anti-HAV titers
      were determined at month 1, 6 and 7. Anti-HAV titer over 20 mIU/ml is defined as
      seroprotection.

      After the full immunization schedule, written informed consents were obtained from subjects
      who would like to participate in the follow-up study. Blood samples of these subjects were
      collected at month 18, 30, 42, 54, 66, 112,138 after the first injection to evaluate the
      seroconversion rates (SCRs) and geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) of antibody against
      hepatitis A virus. Serological results of the follow-up study were then used to explore
      suitable statistical model for predicting the persistence of hepatitis A vaccine-induced
      antibodies.
