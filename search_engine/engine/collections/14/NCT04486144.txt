      support an immune function benefit. Up to 100 patients that are COVID-19 positive in the
      ambulatory setting will be invited to participate. After informed consent is obtained,
      patients will be in either the Intervention Group (receive extract) or Comparison Group (did
      not receive extract). A baseline assessment and record review will be conducted to assure
      eligibility criteria. Patients in the Intervention Group will be given .5 ml (6.25 mg of
      extract) every 6 hours for 5 days, total of 25 mg per day / 125 mg for 5 days. Patient vital
      signs (temperature, pulse oximetry, blood pressure) and CDC symptoms / side effects will also
      be tracked. A dedicated medical oversight team with 24 / 7 access to care will be provided to
      monitor safety and tolerance. Patients will be followed for 10 days. Baseline antibody,
      RT-PCR, and live virus will be collected on Day 1, Day 5, and Day 10. A Data Monitoring
      Committee at the Schull Institute will meet weekly to review data.
