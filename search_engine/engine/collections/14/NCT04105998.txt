      oxytocin. First, the study team proposes to examine the influence of oxytocin on heart rate
      variability with focus on its effect on high frequency variability, most commonly ascribed to
      parasympathetic nervous system activity acting to brake sympathetic tone. Intranasal oxytocin
      has been demonstrated to have a large effect size on this measure which can be repeated at
      frequent intervals. As a secondary assessment of parasympathetic activity, the study team
      will measure high frequency fluctuation in pupil diameter, termed hippus, which also reflects
      parasympathetic nervous system activity. This outcome measure can be assessed in 3 seconds
      using equipment currently being used under Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved
      protocols.
