    
      About 1400 patients derived from Korean patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) receiving
      percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with BES(Biolimus-eluting stent, BiomatrixTM) in a
      routine manner will be enrolled in the investigators trial.

      These patients will be randomized 1:1 to either prasugrel 5mg once daily MD or clopidogrel
      75mg once daily MD after successful PCI with BES .

      The investigators excluded the patients with age ≥75 years, body weight <60 kg, or history of
      TIA (transient ischemic attack) or stroke. Follow-up data will be collected until 1-year
      after index procedure.

      Primary efficacy end-point defined as the composite of cardiac death, non-fatal MI, stent
      thrombosis and ischemic driven target vessel revascularization and safety end-points as BARC
      (the Bleeding Academic Research Consortium) type ≥ 2 bleeding.
