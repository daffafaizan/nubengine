      letrozole (an inhibitor of androgen-to-estrogen conversion), and reduced hydrocortisone dose
      can normalize the growth and adult stature of children with congenital adrenal hyperplasia,
      and can avoid the complications of supraphysiologic glucocorticoid dosage, 60 children with
      this disorder will be randomized to receive either the above regimen or conventional
      treatment until they have reached age 13 years in a girl or age 14 in a boy. After these ages
      boys will receive the conventional treatment and girls will receive conventional treatment
      plus flutamide. In girls, flutamide will be continued until 6 months after menarche. All
      children will be followed until they have attained final adult height. The principal outcome
      measures will be adult height, body mass index, and bone density.
