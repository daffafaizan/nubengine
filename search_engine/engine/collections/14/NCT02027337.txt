      parameters of hemostasis in women that use combined oral contraceptives with antiandrogenic
      activity for contraception and treatment. Considering relationship between lipoperoxidation
      in platelets and hemostasis we expect that limitation of lipoperoxidation by antioxidants can
      restrict hypercoagulation and decrease risk of thrombosis.

      The purpose of this study is decrease of thrombosis risk in women that use combined oral
      contraceptives containing 20 mcg ethinylestradiol/3 mg drospirenone, 30 mcg
      ethinylestradiol/3 mg drospirenone, 35 mcg ethinylestradiol/2mg cyproterone acetate. Half of
      the women of each arm (group) receive only combined oral contraceptives (COC), other women
      receive combined oral contraceptives and antioxidant complex Selmevit.

      The blood tests conduct on 19-21 days of the menstrual cycle before COC use (control group)
      or on 19-21 days of COC use after 1, 3, 6 and 12 cycles.

      Also we investigate subjective tolerability, therapeutic effects, menstrual cycle control and
      adverse effects of COCs in women that have or have no antioxidant complex Selmevit
