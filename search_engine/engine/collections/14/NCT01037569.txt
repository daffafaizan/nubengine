    
      This is a single-center, investigator-initiated study to determine the best method for
      analyzing the presence or absence of illicit environmental drug exposure in children placed
      into protective custody in Sacramento County. In collaboration with the National Institutes
      of Health (NIH), National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA) we will use diagnostic procedures to
      determine the presence of illicit drugs in the following three samples: (1) hair; (2) oral
      swab; and (3) urine. These samples will be sent to a designated NIH lab site where 100
      de-identified samples will be analyzed for methamphetamine, amphetamine, Ecstasy (MDMA), and
      MDEA.
