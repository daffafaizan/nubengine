      adverse effects in hospitalized patients. During storage, RBCs undergo cumulative changes
      that reduce their survival in vivo, and have been associated with impairment in oxygen
      transport and adverse outcomes. Transfusion of older RBCs results in increased NTBI levels in
      healthy adults, and elevated NTBI levels have been associated with increased morbidity and
      mortality in hospitalized patients. Transfusion of PRBCs has also been associated with
      up-regulation of inﬂammatory cytokines. Pediatric patients are exposed to PRBC transfusions;
      however, this patient population has not been previously studied for these outcomes.

      According to current practice guidelines, PRBCs are stored in the blood bank up to 42 days
      prior to transfusion. In this study, blood sample will be collected from pediatric ICU
      patients prior to every PRBC transfusion and again 2-6 hours post-transfusion to determine
      iron parameters, inﬂammatory marker concentrations, and growth of microbial pathogens in
      vitro.

      The investigators hopes to further the understanding of the effects of blood storage on
      outcome in children, thereby making transfusion safer and more effective.
