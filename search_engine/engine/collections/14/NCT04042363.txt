    
      This is a randomized, controlled, prospective, interventional, blinded trial which aims to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of transorbital electrical nerve stimulation on
      remyelination and neuroprotection after an acute episode of retrobulbar optic neuritis in
      patients with multiple sclerosis (MS).

      Expected Explorations: The study is composed of 14 visits: a screening/inclusion visit with
      neurological and ophthalmological evaluation, electrophysiology, MRI and
      Magnetoencephalography (MEG), 10 transorbital electrical stimulation or sham stimulation
      visits and finally 3 follow-up visits and evaluations (neurological and ophthalmological).
      Patient's participation will last 49 weeks (inclusion visit and 48 weeks of follow-up).
      Participation of healthy volunteers will last one day.

      MS patients diagnosed with an optic neuritis will be randomized either in the active arm
      (transorbital electrical stimulation of the optic nerve - 10 sessions during 2 consecutive
      weeks) or in the placebo arm (sham stimulation - 10 sessions during 2 consecutive weeks)
      Expected benefits: Electrical stimulation of the optic nerve after an acute episode of
      retrobulbar optic neuritis may promote remyelination in the optic nerve and a better
      long-term visual outcome.
