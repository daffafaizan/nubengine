    
      Patients will be recruited in a sequential mode after signing the usual informed consent (IC)
      as well as the consent to accept participation in the study.

      The intervention will be carried out as usual and, once the radiological checks have been
      carried out, an ultrasound of the wrist extensor compartments will be performed. Compartments
      will be studied individually in order to detect invasion of the dorsal cortex by the screws.

      All surgeries will be performed only by members of the upper limb trauma team or hand surgery
      unit.

      Postoperative follow-up will be the standard one prior to the present study.
