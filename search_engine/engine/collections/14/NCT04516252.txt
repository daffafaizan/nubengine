      benefits of informed and attached dog ownership among treatment-na√Øve overweight or obese
      adolescents. It is based upon a socioecological model of health behavior that pursues
      multiple levels of influence, including those extending across species lines such as physical
      activity. BodyWorks, a Comprehensive Behavioral Family Lifestyle Interventions (CBFLI), a
      national, empirically validated, curriculum-based 8-week program (orientation and 7 weeks of
      curriculum) will be offered at Children's Hospital Los Angeles AltaMed Division of General
      Pediatrics, a Federally Qualified Healthcare Center. The aims of the study are: Specific Aim
      1: Using current empirical evidence in veterinary medicine, to develop a Canine Health
      Literacy module (CHL) to be delivered as part of the existing, empirically tested BW
      curriculum to increase adolescents' health literacy about their dogs' physical activity
      needs, weight status, and nutrition. Specific Aim 2: Test the feasibility and acceptability
      of a concurrent approach using physical activity trackers and Ecological Momentary
      Assessment. 2(a): Test the feasibility and acceptability of objective measurement of physical
      activity using wireless fitness trackers for adolescents (FitBit Ace), their parents (FitBit
      Flex2), and their dogs (FitBark); 2(b): Test the feasibility and acceptability of using
      mobile phones for Ecological Momentary Assessment of types and contexts of adolescent's
      physical activity with dogs. Specific Aim 3: To establish the size of the effect, and the
      variability associated with the 8 week-long BW + CHL module, as compared with the control
      group who received the standard BW program in 3(a) adolescents' positive affect during or
      after physical activity with the dog, as measured by the Ecological Momentary Assessment
      using prompts on mobile phones; and 3(b) levels of overall physical activity for the
      adolescents, their parents, and the dogs as measured by the FitBit Ace (adolescents), FitBit
      Flex2 (parents), and FitBark (dogs). The project will establish feasibility, acceptability,
      attrition, and protocol compliance, and will collect pilot data needed for power calculations
      in preparation for an R01 Randomized Controlled Trial as a next step to test the
      effectiveness of our enhanced BW+CHL program. This project represents a significant
      methodological and theoretical advancement in the field of Human-Animal Interaction (HAI) and
      in research on overweight and obesity.
