      of memory and muscle control). CPI-1189 may be able to postpone AIDS dementia or slow it
      down.

      In this randomized, double-blind study, 48 HIV-infected, otherwise healthy, male volunteers
      receive either multiple-dose CPI-1189 or placebo by mouth for 15 consecutive days. Each
      dosing group begins 6 weeks following the start of the preceding group. Volunteers enter the
      study site the night before dosing on Days 1 and 15 and remain at the study site for 72 hours
      following dosing. Throughout the study, volunteers have physical exams and donate samples of
      blood, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, and sperm.
