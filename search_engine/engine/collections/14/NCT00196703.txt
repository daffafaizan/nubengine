           receptor antagonist memantine requires to be explored in this population. The rationale
           for using memantine in post-stroke aphasia comes from recent studies on vascular
           dementia. Data extracted from a recent Cochrane review of randomized controlled trials
           of memantine in different types of dementia (vascular dementia, Alzheimer's disease,
           mixed dementia) reveal, after 6 weeks of treatment, beneficial effects on cognition
           (including language), activities of daily living, behavior and global scales as well as
           in the global impression of change.

        -  Recovery from aphasia is possible even in severe cases. While speech-language therapy
           remains as the mainstay treatment of aphasia, its effectiveness has not been
           conclusively proved. This has motivated the planning of more rational therapies (e.g.,
           constraint-induced language therapy [Pulverm√ºller et al., 2001; 32: 1621-1626]).

        -  In addition, the neural correlates of improvement of language function can now be
           readily detectable with event-related potentials. This is a noninvasive technique that
           can detect in real time functional brain changes during recovery promoted by the
           combined action of memantine and constraint-induced language therapy.

        -  The aim of the present study is to assess the efficacy, safety profile, and functional
           correlates of memantine paired with massed language therapy in a sample of patients with
           chronic poststroke aphasia.
