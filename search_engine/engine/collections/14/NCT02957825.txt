      alone. After major surgery, the complication rate is conservatively estimated at 25%, with a
      rate of 15% for major complications. In these patients, the most important problems are a
      failure to timely detect developing complications and a failure to adequately rescue those
      patients. Currently, measurement of vital signs and standardized assessment of patient
      wellbeing are routinely performed intermittently for every 8-12 hours, which may lead to a
      failure to detect of patients with complications.

      The aim of this study is to test the hypothesis that continuous wireless monitoring on the
      postsurgical ward will improve patient outcome, measured as disability-free survival at three
      months after surgery. Further, the investigators hypothesize that this tight control regimen
      decreases length of hospital stay and treatment costs in patients with complications.

      The investigators will carry out this study as an interventional, randomized (per surgical
      ward), prospective, clinical trial; participating wards will be included using a
      stepped-wedge design.

      Primary outcome is disability-free survival at three months after surgery.
