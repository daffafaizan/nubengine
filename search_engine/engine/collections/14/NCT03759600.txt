      people who have the homologous recombination deficiency (HRD)-positive, advanced, relapsed,

      study will look at the efficacy and safety of niraparib in Japanese participants.

      The study will enroll approximately 16 participants. Participants will be enrolled to one
      group and after that will be asked to take niraparib capsules at the same time each day
      throughout the study:

      - Niraparib 300 mg

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in Japan. The overall time to participate in this
      study is approximately 23 months. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic in the
      treatment period, and the post-treatment period including follow-up assessments after the
