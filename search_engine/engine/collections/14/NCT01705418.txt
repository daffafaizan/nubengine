      motor symptoms in advanced Parkinson's disease (PD), its behavioral and psychiatric effects
      are strongly debated, with some studies showing a worsening or new onset of behavioral and
      psychiatric issues after STN stimulation and other showing an improvement. However, these
      data are based mainly on case reports and retrospective series.

      Recently, the investigators group has conducted a prospective study assessing behavior and
      psychiatric symptoms in patients undergoing STN stimulation up to one year after surgery.
      After subthalamic stimulation non-motor fluctuations improved and pathologic
      hyperdopaminergic syndrome, i.e. behavioral addictions (including pathological gambling,
      hypersexuality, binge eating, compulsive shopping, â€¦), compulsive use of dopaminergic
      treatment and dopaminergic dysregulation syndrome (defined as the association of one or more
      behavioral addictions to compulsive use of dopaminergic treatment), disappeared. These
      findings represent a milestone because, if confirmed, the indications of STN stimulation
      might be extended beyond motor complications. To date, there are several long-term studies on
      motor and cognitive effects of STN stimulation, whereas no long-term longitudinal data on
      neuropsychiatric effects do exist. Therefore, the investigators designed a long-term
      prospective study, assessing over 3-8 years behavioral and psychiatric effect in the same
      cohort of patients included in the one-year study. This study will allow to better evaluate
      the change in non-motor fluctuations and of behavioral issues in the long-term with a
      standard management.
