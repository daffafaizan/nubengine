      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) from the multi-center (8 units in the country) will be
      enrolled. The IBS Severity Inventory (IBS-SSS) and IBS Quality of Life Scores (QOL) will be
      used to evaluate the effect of treatments. Retreatment patients who are initially treated and
      not satisfied with the improvement of symptoms and quality of life will be treated with
      Rifaximin for 2 weeks. Fecal specimens will be collected from patients who responded to
      treatment, and the fecal bacteria will be analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction
      (PCR) using 16 S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) gene. Patients who responded to Rifaximin
      treatment will be randomized into A (Probiotics group) and B (Placebo group). IBS symptom
      grade score and quality of life score will be evaluated before and after treatment, and fecal
      specimens of the responding patients will be collected for intestinal probiotics and harmful
      bacteria detection.
