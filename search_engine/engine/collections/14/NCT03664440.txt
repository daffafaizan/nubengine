    
      A single-center randomized controlled, non-inferiority trial to study 48-week treatment
      outcomes of RPV as a switch therapy was conducted at Ramathibodi Hospital, a tertiary care
      health center in Thailand from December 2016 to October 2017 Eligible patients who currently
      received TDF/3TC/NVP (group A) or TDF/FTC/NVP (group B) were block 4 randomly assigned (1:1)
      by computer-generated random numbers, to continue their current regimen of NVP 200 mg twice
      daily plus TDF/3TC (group A1) and plus TDF/FTC (groupB1), or to switch from NVP to RPV 25 mg
      once-daily plus TDF/3TC (group A2) and plus TDF/FTC (groupB2). Patients were advised to take
      RPV with a meal. Patients were scheduled trial visits at baseline, week 12, 24, 36 and week
      48. The laboratory assessment was performed at baseline week 24 and week 48.
