      Oxygenation is usually applied during the procedure to prevent the occurrence of
      desaturation. Conventional oxygen is typically administered by conventional nasal cannula, by
      nasopharyngeal catheter or by a facemask with mild flow of oxygen. The flow of standard
      oxygen is limited to 15L/min.

      High-flow nasal cannula oxygenation is a new method of humidified and heated oxygenation with
      a higher flow rates (up to 70L/min).

      The primary outcome will be the incidence of hypoxia defined by pulsed saturation with oxygen
      (SpO2) â‰¤92%. The investigator's hypothesis is that high-flow nasal oxygen therapy will
      decrease the frequency of hypoxemia during gastrointestinal endoscopy under sedation.
