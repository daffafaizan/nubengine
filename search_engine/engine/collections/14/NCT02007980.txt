    
      The aim of this study is to identify the root cause for the significant discolouration of
      Boston Scientific Percuflex based stents observed in some patients, particularly those from
      Japan. We will also test and compare them to stents from Canadian patients. Furthermore, we
      will determine whether the discolouration promotes bacterial adhesion and/or encrustation of
      the stent.
