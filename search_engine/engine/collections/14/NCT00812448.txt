      physiological activities such as antiviral effects. Recent in-vitro experimental studies have
      revealed that tea catechin extracts possess the effects on the prevention of influenza
      infection. However, a limited number of studies have been conducted on the clinical effects.
      Based on these backgrounds, we designed a prospective randomized controlled study to evaluate
      the effects of tea catechin extracts containing mask on the prevention of influenza
      infection.
