      physical activity and consumption of major macro- and micronutrients by women during
      pregnancy on DNA methylation and expression of genes involved in neuroendocrine regulation
      and development of metabolic diseases in offspring, as well as functional characteristics of
      human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). For the purpose of the study women with GDM
      are randomised to 2 treatment groups per glycemic targets ( very tight and tight-moderate
      glycemic targets). Data on glycenmic levels during the study and consumption of major macro-
      and micronutrients will be collected using a mobile application with electronic dairies
      report forms.
