      in 25% to 30% of all clavicle fracture.The management of fractures of the distal clavicle has
      been a matter of debate in literature. Neer in 1968 suggested a new classification and
      proposed general treatment guidelines . Type I and type III fractures are generally treated
      non-operatively. For type II fractures, surgical management is the treatment of choice .There
      are numerous operative techniques reported in the past. The methods of surgical treatment
      could be summarised as follows:

        1. Fixation in terms of K-wires and different pins such as the Steinmann pin, and Knowles
           pin. This fixation could also be augmented with concomitant tension band wires

        2. Coracoclavicular indirect fixation with the use of screws, suture anchors, Dacron graft
           or Mersilene tape

        3. Open reduction and clavicular plate fixation with the use of different plate systems
           such as the Balser plate,locked plate,hook plate, etc.

      Different surgical techniques have their own advantages and disadvantages With more than 20
      techniques described so far, no single fixation is ideal and perfect. There is still no
      consensus regarding the best surgical method to fix these fracture ,the investigators choose
      two of the most common of these methods and evaluate & compare best radiological & clinical
      outcomes of both.
