      flywheels with a moment inertia of 0.07 kg m-2). Immediately after baseline measures,
      subjects performed 10 sets x 10 repetitions parallel squats using a gravity-free training
      device flywheel with 2 minutes of recovery between sets. The squat exercise was chosen as
      basic movement because of its similar muscles recruitment to many athletic movements
      patterns. Furthermore, the squat exercise is one of the main exercises used to improve the
      lower-body strength. The required technique was demonstrated to all subjects before beginning
      the eccentric session, and they were coached during the protocol to be sure adequate
      technique and maximal effort in each repetition were maintained. All participants performed 5
      min on a treadmill to warm up before performing the eccentric bout.

      Description of the foam roller intervention The foam-rolling technique was based on a
      previously published protocol. In both protocols, the technique was repeated on both legs for
      1 min for a total of 5 sets, with a 30-s rest between sets. The cadence for both techniques
      (NVFR and VFR) was fixed at 3:4 using a metronome.

      Using a protocol adapted from previous study, subjects began in the plank position with the
      foam roller at the most proximal portion of the quadriceps of both legs, with as much of
      their body mass as possible on the foam roller.

      Non-Vibration Foam Rolling (NVFR) Group: subjects performed the FR protocol using a
      custom-made foam roller composed of a polystyrene foam cylinder (15-cm diameter × 35-cm
      long).

      Vibration Foam Rolling (VFR) Group: subjects performed the same protocol using a foam roller
      with vibration (frequency: 18 Hz) composed of a polystyrene foam cylinder (15-cm diameter ×
      35-cm long).
