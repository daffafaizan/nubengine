    
      This is a single-blind (blinded expert grader), parallel group, randomized, half-face study
      being conducted at one clinical site. On 1 side of the face, the subject will apply 1 of the
      2 test products, a topical antibiotic and benzoyl peroxide or benzoyl peroxide and adapalene
      and the contra lateral side of the face will remain non-treated to serve as a control.
      Approximately 25-30 male and female healthy subjects will be randomly assigned to each
      product.

      The subjects will be entered into a 2-week treatment phase. The once-daily applications for
      the study medication will be supervised at the site, Monday through Friday of each week.
      Subjects will apply the study product at home on Saturdays and Sundays.

      A blinded expert grader will rate comparative product tolerance on each week day (excluding
      Saturdays and Sundays) during the study before study product is applied.

      Subject questionnaires will be completed along with collection of all adverse events.
