      elderly persons. Prefrail participants are recruited according to the frailty score of Fried.
      Taking into account, that vitamin D supplementation reduces falls and improves muscle
      strength in older people, all participants are supplemented by vitamin D. Two different
      training methods are tested.

      After a run-in period of supplementation of vitamin D for two months, participants will be
      randomized into three different equally sized groups (n=25): Group A will receive power
      training. Group B will have progressive strength training. Group C will serve as a control
      group. They will receive a consultation about leading a healthy life with special attention
      being paid to nutrition and physical activity. The intervention period lasts for 12 weeks.
      The 60 minutes training sessions will be held two times a week by members of the Institute of
      Sport Science and Sports of the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg. Follow-up visits are
      scheduled three and six months after intervention period.
