      Safety and Health classification 99% Airborne Particle Filtration (N99) will have increased
      fit and seal as well as user comfort and acceptance over disposable National Institute for
      Occupational Safety and Health classification 95% Airborne Particle Filtration (N95) filter
      facepiece respirators (FFR). The study team is proposing to assess the acceptance and
      functional usability of the OSR-M1 in Wake Forest Baptist Health System as a N95 disposable
      FFR alternative for improved protection and economy.

        1. Assess the effectiveness and causation of successful/unsuccessful fit testing of the OSR
           M1 APR by measuring anthropometry of facial features and performing quantitative fit
           testing of clinicians.

        2. Determine usability, initial and long-term acceptance of the OSR M1 APR relative to
           standard issue disposable FFRs through user survey and assessment.
