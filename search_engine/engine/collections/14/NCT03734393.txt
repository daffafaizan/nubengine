      donor is safe with regards to survival and major transplant-related and HIV-related
      complications compared to receiving a liver from an HIV-uninfected deceased liver donor
      (HIVD-). Those participants who have accepted an HIVD- organ will be randomized to be
      followed in the full study or followed in the nested observational group
