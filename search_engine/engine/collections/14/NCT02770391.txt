    
      Primary Objective: To evaluate the differential effect of neo-adjuvant leuprolide and
      Apalutamide on dihydrotestosterone (DHT) concentration in benign prostate tissue based on
      HSD3B1 genotype.

      Secondary Objective(s): To evaluate the differential effect of neoadjuvant leuprolide and
      Apalutamide on other androgen (testosterone (T), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA),
      androstenediol, 5α-androstanedione (5α-dione), androstenedione (AD), androsterone and
      5α-androstanediol) concentrations in benign and malignant prostate tissue based on HSD3B1
      genotype.

      To compare the level of DHT, T, DHEA, androstenediol, 5α-dione, AD, androsterone and
      5α-androstanediol between normal and malignant prostate tissue after neoadjuvant treatment
      with leuprolide and Apalutamide

      To determine the safety of the combination of Leuprolide and Apalutamide administered prior
      to radical prostatectomy

      To evaluate prostatic specific antigen (PSA), FKBP5, TMPRSS2, EZH2, H3K27 and UBE2C tissue
      expression (via immunohistochemistry (IHC) and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR))
      in benign and malignant prostate tissue after treatment with Leuprolide and Apalutamide.
