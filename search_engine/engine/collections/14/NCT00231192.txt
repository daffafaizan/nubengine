      treatment of new-onset CFRD. This hypothesis will be tested using the following aims:

      Specific Aim 1: To determine the effect of three months of repaglinide and insulin treatment
      upon blood glucose (BG) and insulin excursion during an oral glucose tolerance test.

      Specific Aim 2: To determine the effect of three months of repaglinide and insulin treatment
      upon BG as measured by continuous glucose monitoring, fasting BG, 2-hour post-prandial BG,
      hemoglobin A1C, and serum fructosamine.

      Secondary Aim 1: To determine the effect of three months of repaglinide and insulin treatment
      upon weight, body mass index, and lean body mass in adolescents with new-onset CFRD.

      Secondary Aim 2: To determine the effect of three months of repaglinide and insulin treatment
      upon pulmonary function in adolescents with new-onset CFRD.

      Secondary Aim 3: To determine the effect of three months of repaglinide and insulin treatment
      upon quality of life in new-onset CFRD.
