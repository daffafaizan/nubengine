      and a high quality of life. Roughly half of the individuals diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis
      (MS) have difficulty remembering new information and this is likely associated with poor
      acquisition of new information. There are only a limited number of studies that have
      investigated memory consolidation in MS. The current study will investigate the role of
      interference during the consolidation time period of memory formation.
