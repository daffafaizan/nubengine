    
      At the Screening Visit (SV), written informed consent will be obtained from the subject by
      the Investigator or designee before the performance of any other protocol-specific procedure.
      The Investigator will select the Index (study) ulcer. Each subject will have only one DFU
      selected as the Index (study) ulcer. If the subject has more than one ulcer at the SV, the
      Investigator will select the largest ulcer that meets the eligibility criteria of the
      protocol as the Index (study) ulcer.The SV is designed to determine whether subjects are
      eligible to proceed to the Treatment Phase of the study. Those subjects who meet the
      eligibility criteria will transition to Treatment Visit 1 (TV1) on the same day as the SV.

      Subjects who meet eligibility criteria at the SV will receive Meso Wound Matrix (DSM
      Biomedical, Exton, PA) and standard of care. During the Treatment Phase, subjects will be
      evaluated on a weekly basis. Efficacy evaluations each week will include Investigator
      assessment of ulcer healing and measurements of ulcer size using digital photographic
      planimetry. Safety evaluations during the Treatment Phase will consist of adverse event
      assessments at each visit. Subjects may receive up to eight applications of Meso Wound
      Matrix. Subjects whose study ulcer does not heal after eight applications will receive only
      SOC treatment for 4 additional weeks. Subjects whose ulcers do not achieve closure at or by
      12 weeks or who experience an amputation will be deemed treatment failures.
