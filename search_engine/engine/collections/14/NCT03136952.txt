      University Hospital. This population has been chosen because it is an age group that is
      homogeneous and suits our aim "two different measuring points (frontal and occipitalt) of
      sensors for regional cerebral oxygenation in children under 1 yrs old, during general
      anesthesia and surgery. We will use a INVOS 5100 (the latest version of INVOS). A sensor will
      be applied, frontally and occipital on the head.

      Patients will be enrolled consecutively when they have been planned for surgery, at
      Salhgrenska University Hospital.

      Perioperative data will be registered in 5-minute intervals from frontally and occipital
      measurements. The measurements begin before the patient is anesthetized and ends when the
      patient is extubated.

      All monitoring data during the general anesthesia will be obtained and documented in a data
      sheet.
