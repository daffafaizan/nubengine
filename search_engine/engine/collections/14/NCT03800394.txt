      adolescents with and without TB coinfection. As the clinical effects of TDF and FTC are
      related to the intracellular concentrations of the phosphate anabolites, called TFV-DP and
      FTC-TP, there is a need to understand the cellular pharmacology of TDF interactions in
      African HIV-infected adolescents with and without TB, as the study team cannot extrapolate
      from US patients not on antituberculosis (anti-TB) drugs. This study will enroll HIV-infected
      adolescents aged 10 to 18 years old with and without TB coinfection who are already
      established on ART. The study team hypothesize that younger age, adenosine triphosphate
      (ATP)-binding cassette subfamily C (ABCC) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and anti-TB
      therapy may influence the intracellular TFV-DP and FTC-TP concentrations in adolescents.
