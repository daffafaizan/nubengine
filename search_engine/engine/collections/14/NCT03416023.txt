    
      This is a multicentre, open-label, single-arm clinical study that will assess the safety,
      performance and durability of the TIES® transcutaneous titanium implant in patients requiring
      a permanent ileostomy (a surgical procedure that involves connecting the small intestine to
      the skin to create an opening).

      The Transcutaneous Implant Evacuation System (TIES®) is a medical device designed to enable
      continence control for patients who would otherwise need to wear an ileostomy bag.

      Eligible subjects will undergo a conventional ileostomy procedure under general anaesthesia
      and have the TIES® Port implanted. To date, the TIES® has been evaluated in 11 patients in 2
      clinical studies. This study aims to collect more data that will assess performance,
      durability, safety and the impact that the TIES® has on a patient's quality of life.

      The study will enroll 50 patients across Europe that require a permanent ileostomy, including
      patients with ulcerative colitis, familial adenomatous polyposis coli or other diseases such
      as Crohn´s disease.

      Study subjects are expected to participate for approximately 1 year following surgical
      placement of the TIES® Port. Participation will involve a screening period, surgical
      implantation of the device (in-patient) and scheduled follow-up assessments out to 1 year
      post implant.
