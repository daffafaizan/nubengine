      treatment, there are no effective interventions so far. For secondary metastatic cancer, only
      the lesions visible under ultrasound can be used, one by one for local ablation and
      chemotherapy, but people may develop new tumor lesions. Therefore, the treatment of potential
      tumors and recurrent tumors after ablation is a very important clinical issue. Therefore,
      this study will include primary liver cancer, as well as secondary metastatic malignant liver
      cancer, such as colorectal cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer, and other cancers with a high
      incidence in Chinese patients, and detection of immune cells by surgery, and through various
      biomarkers to explore its mechanism and efficacy.
