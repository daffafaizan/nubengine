      I. To determine the feasibility of a home-based individualized progressive resistance
      training (PRT) program in sarcoma survivors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess secondary measures of feasibility of a home-based, individualized PRT program in
      sarcoma survivors.

      II. To determine if a 3-month PRT program improves physical function in sarcoma survivors.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine if a 3 month resistance training program improves body composition and bone
      mineral density.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients complete a series of progressive resistance training exercises at home twice weekly
      over 1 hour and receive instructional guidance from an exercise physiologist via
      videoconferencing once per week during one of these sessions for up to 12 weeks.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 3 months.
