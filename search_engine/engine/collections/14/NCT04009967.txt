      prostate cancer patients with newly diagnosed non-metastatic prostate cancer (Gleason grade
      â‰¥8 on biopsy) with positive tumor by FDG-PET (SUV max >4) who chose to undergo radical
      prostatectomy and lymph node dissection as primary treatment.

      The trial will meet its endpoint if a reduction in cancer extent, proliferative index and
      increased apoptosis, as well as an induction of favorable immune cell infiltration and immune
      checkpoint expression profiles are observed after treatment compare to baseline..
