      produced by Helicobacter pylori. We hypothesize that H. pylori, VacA toxin, and other toxins
      within the gastrointestinal tract and/or oropharynx are also found in the lung and may
      contribute to decline in lung function. Analyses of gastrointestinal, oropharyngeal, lung and
      blood specimens will improve the understanding of H. pylori, VacA toxin, and other toxins as
      well as their potential role in pathophysiology of disease. The objectives of this
      exploratory protocol are to procure gastrointestinal, oropharyngeal, lung and/or blood
      specimens from healthy research volunteers and subjects with lung disease (e.g.,
      lymphangioleiomyomatosis, asthma, sarcoidosis, pulmonary fibrosis) and to analyze these
      specimens for H. pylori, VacA toxin, and other toxins. We hypothesize that the toxins may
      have a role in the pathogenesis of lung disease and in the subclinical decline in lung
      function seen with aging.
