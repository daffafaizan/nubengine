      Abiraterone has regulatory approval in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer
      (mCRPC) in both chemotherapy-naïve and in the post-docetaxel setting based upon results from
      two randomized phase III studies. Abiraterone is also proven to extend survival in the
      metastatic, hormone-naïve population based on two phase III studies. Abiraterone is a
      castrating agent, but, other than a small first in human study, all clinical studies have
      been done in conjunction with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues. Maintaining
      castrate level of serum testosterone is critical in the treatment of metastatic prostate
      cancer. It is unknown if GnRH analogues must be continued to maintain castrate levels of
      serum testosterone in patients treated with abiraterone.
