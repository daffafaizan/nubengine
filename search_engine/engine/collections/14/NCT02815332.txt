    
      This is a phase 2b, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled study to Assess the Safety
      and Efficacy of BPX-01 Minocycline Topical Gel in the Treatment of Moderate to Severe
      Inflammatory Acne Vulgaris.

      Study Population: Approximately 225 male or female subjects aged between 9 and 40 years with
      moderate to severe inflammatory non-nodular acne vulgaris will be included in this study.

      Number of Sites: Approximately 15 centers from the United States will participate in this
      study.

      Study Duration: Overall study duration is expected to be approximately 24 weeks (6 months).
      The study duration for individual subjects is approximately 16 weeks (including the screening
      period).

      Hypothesis: BPX-01 improves disease condition in subjects with moderate to severe
      inflammatory non-nodular acne vulgaris compared with vehicle.

      Objectives:

      Primary:

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of BPX-01 minocycline 1% or 2% topical gel in the treatment of
           inflammatory non-nodular acne vulgaris

      Secondary:

        -  To evaluate the plasma level of minocycline after once daily application of 1% or 2% BPX
           01 topical gel

        -  To evaluate the safety of BPX-01 minocycline 1% or 2% topical gel

      Endpoints:

      Primary Efficacy Endpoint:

        -  Absolute mean change from baseline in inflammatory lesion counts at Week 12

      Secondary Efficacy Endpoint:

        -  Proportion of subjects with at least a two-grade reduction in IGA at Week 12
