      Following approval by the Hospital Ethics committee of the University Hospital Antwerp and
      all participating hospitals, all-in term (37-42 weeks of gestation) pregnant women planned
      for a caesarean section will be asked to participate in this trial.

      Patients will be randomised to receive either spinal prilocaine with sufentanyl or spinal
      bupivacaine with sufentanyl.The patient, the anaesthetist performing the CSE and the observer
      are not aware of the local anaesthetic solution administered.

      Preoperative a combined spinal epidural puncture will be performed in the sitting position at
      the level of L2-L3 or L3-L4 . Vital parameters will be registered at regular intervals. Block
      characteristics ( onset, duration and intensity of the sensory block and motor block) will be
      measured at regular intervals.

      Patients with insufficient analgesia will receive a top up dose of 5 ml lidocaine 2 % via the
      epidural catheter.

      Time of birth, neonatal outcome (Apgar score 1 min, 5 min and 10 minutes after birth) and
      admission to the nicu as well as umbilicus venous and arterial blood gasses are recorded.

      Patients will be discharged from the PACU when motor block reached a Bromage score 1 Time
      intervals of discharge to the ward will be registered.At the maternity ward the time of first
      contact of the baby and the mother and first breast feed (if applicable) will be registered.

      One week postoperative patients will be called and asked if they experienced any
      postoperative symptoms like headache, micturition problems or symptoms resembling Transient
