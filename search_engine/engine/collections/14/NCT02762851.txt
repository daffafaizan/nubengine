      that infection due to influenza may precipitate vascular events such as myocardial
      infarctions and strokes. There is some evidence that influenza vaccination may prevent such
      events but the data are inconclusive. The investigators propose a randomized controlled trial
      to assess whether influenza vaccination will prevent vascular illness. Adults with clinical
      heart failure will be randomized to inactivated influenza vaccine or saline placebo each year
      for three consecutive years. They will be followed over six months for a composite of
      cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke and hospitalizations
      for heart failure using standardized criteria. Rigorous demonstration of influenza vaccine
      leading to a reduction in major adverse vascular events in patients with heart failure would
      lead to a major change in how these patients are managed. Given the large burden of disease
      both in Canada and globally, the possibility to reduce cardiovascular and stroke related
      death is a compelling reason to conduct this trial.
