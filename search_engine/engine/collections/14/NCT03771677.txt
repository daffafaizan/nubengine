      globally.How to make more patients with chronic hepatitis B get clinical treatment through
      the existing anti-viral treatment is an urgent problem to be solved.This study is a random,
      multi-center and open experiment,the collaborators includes the second people's hospital of
      zhongshan city, the eighth people's hospital of guangzhou city, and the first people's
      hospital of foshan city.

      Patients with chronic hepatitis B who were treated with NAs for over 1 year,HBsAg
      quantificationâ‰¤1500 IU/mL, HBeAg negative and serum HBV DNA quantification <100 IU/mL were
      enrolled in this study. In our study, the enrolled patient's IFNA2p.Ala120Thr without
      variation and ISGs>0.05 were divided into two groups. After randomized grouping and giving
      informed consent,in one group, patients continued NAs for another 48 weeks. In another group
      , patients switched to peg-interferon-2a monotherapy for 48 weeks.Patient's BMI, genotype,
      family history, smoking history, drinking history, other medical history, suspected
      transmission channels, types and time of use were recorded in this study.Moreover, Patients
      were assessed every 12 weeks,included liver and kidney function, blood routine, HBV cccDNA,
      HBeAg quantification, HBsAg quantification, pgRNA and so on.In addition,liver imaging
      examination and liver hardness test were assessed every six months.

      In this study, the "accurate" and "individualized" selection of the long-term interferon
      anti-hbv treatment will be conducted. Before the treatment, "optimal patients" and "optimal
      treatment" are selected, in an attempt to improve the response rate and efficacy of
      interferon,which can improve the cure rate of hepatitis b,proceeding "Individualized"
      anti-hbv treatment more scientifically and precisely.
