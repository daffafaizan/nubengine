    
      Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin (CMA-676) is a chemotherapeutic agent consisting of recombinant
      humanized anti-CD33 antibody conjugated with calicheamicin, a highly potent cytotoxic
      antitumor antibiotic. The antibody portion of Gemtuzumab binds specifically to the CD33
      antigen, a sialic acid-dependent adhesion protein expressed on the surface of leukemia
      blasts, normal and leukemic myeloid colony-forming cells, including leukemic clonogenic
      precursors, but excluding pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells and nonhematopoietic cells.
      This results in formation of the complex that is internalized, upon which calicheamicin
      derivative is released with in the lysosomes of the myeloid cell. The free calicheamicin
      derivative then binds to the DNA, resulting in DNA double strand breaks and consequential
      cell death.
