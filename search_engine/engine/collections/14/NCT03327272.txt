      is reduced in the subjects receiving a local injection of methylprednisolone when compared to
      placebo following XLIF.

      The investigators hypothesize that subjects undergoing XLIF who receive local
      methylprednisolone will have:

        1. Reduced incidence and duration of postoperative pain and neurologic injury

        2. Shorter hospital stay

        3. Better short- and long-term outcomes

      The study also aims to answer the following questions:

        1. Do subjects who receive local corticosteroids have a reduced incidence and duration of
           postoperative pain and neurologic deficit compared to those who receive placebo?

        2. Do subjects who receive local corticosteroids have a reduced hospital stay compared to
           those who received placebo?

        3. Is local corticosteroid therapy associated with improved short and long-term outcomes?
