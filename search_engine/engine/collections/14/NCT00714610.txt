      have undergone metal on metal total hip arthroplasty.

      The effect of the presence of bilateral large-head MOM THA on circulating metal ions levels
      has not been thoroughly studied. Metal ion levels in patients with unilateral MOM vs
      bilateral MOM resurfacing and small-head THA have been reported; however, to the
      investigators knowledge, no study has investigated the differences in serum metal ion levels
      in unilateral vs bilateral largehead (â‰¥38 mm) MOM THA. The objective of this study was to
      compare serum cobalt and chromium levels in patients who have undergone unilateral vs
      bilateral large-head MOM THA to better understand the effect of the presence of bilateral
      implants on circulating metal ion levels. The investigators believe that further
      understanding baseline levels in well-functioning MOM THA will increase the clinical utility
      of checking serum metal ion levels in the workup of the painful MOM THA. The investigators
      hypothesis was that serum metal ion levels in patients with well-functioning bilateral
      large-head MOM THA would be higher than levels in patients with well functioning unilateral
      large-head MOM THA, but these levels would not approach those seen with metallosis.
