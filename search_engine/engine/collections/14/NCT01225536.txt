      cycles/cohorts of therapy will consist of the oral administration of ARQ 736 twice or four
      times a day, one hour prior to or two hours after the meal for 28 days continuously. Tumor
      assessments (CT scan or MRI) will be performed at Baseline, and every two cycles (every eight
      weeks) thereafter or as otherwise clinically indicated. For early assessment of evidence of
      biological activity of the tumor PET scan may be performed at Baseline and four weeks from
      the administration of the first dose of ARQ 736 (approximately Cycle 2 Day1).
