      week, with a 2 out of 3 chance of receiving Phenylbutyrate at a standard adult dose, with
      visits on study days 1, 4, and 7. The study will last an additional 2 weeks to determine
      whether the effects of the Phenylbutyrate or Placebo persist for any length of time, with
      visits on study days 14 and 21. Every participant will receive the Genistein during the NPD
      on days 1 and 7. The dose of Genistein used will not be escalated and will be the same for
      every participant.

      Safety evaluations at each visit will include a history, and physical exam and mental status
      exam, blood and urine tests, and lung function tests. The main physiologic outcome of the
      trial will be the assessment of salt and water transport NPD. In this way, we will assess
      whether genistein enhances the effect of phenylbutyrate to improve chloride transport in the
      nose by topical application of genistein to the nasal mucosa during the NPD procedure on
      study days 1 and 7.
