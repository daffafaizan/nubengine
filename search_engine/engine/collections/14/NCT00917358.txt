      annual incidence of 3-80% and 2.9%, respectively. The high incidence and prevalence in thse
      patients are attributed to potential nosocomial exposure to hepatitis C virus during
      dialysis, resulting in high rates of acute hepatitis C virus infection. It is estimated that
      about 65-80% of the patients who have acute hepatitis C will evolve to chronic infection,
      leading to chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation, and hepatocellular carcinoma
      (HCC). Currently, interferon and pegylated interferon monotherapy remains effective to treat
      acute hepatitis C in ordinary patients, with the sustained virologic response (SVR) rates
      ranging from 65-90% after 12-24 weeks of therapy. However, few data regarding the efficacy
      and safety of interferon-based monotherapy is known till now. Treatment of weekly 135
      pegylated interferon alfa-2a has shown superior safety to thrice weekly 3 million unit (MU)
      standard interferon alfa-2a for dialysis patients with chronic hepatitis C. Under the
      excellent safety profiles of treating dialysis patients with low dose pegylated interferon
      alfa-2a, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of weekly 135 ug pegylated interferon alfa-2a for
      a total of 24 weeks for dialysis patients with acute hepatitis C, and also evaluate the SVR
      rate by retrospective chart review for dialysis patients with acute hepatitis C who did not
      receive interferon-based therapy to evaluate if early intervention for these patients will
      improve overall disease outcome.
