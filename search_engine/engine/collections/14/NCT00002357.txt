    
      Patients are randomized to receive one of three doses of HBY 097 with or without AZT or AZT
      alone for 12 weeks (AZT monotherapy arm eliminated per 1/19/96 amendment). All patients at a
      given dose level of HBY 097 must be enrolled and adequate safety data obtained before
      escalation in subsequent patients begins. Additional patients are entered at the optimal dose
      of HBY 097. Patients are evaluated weekly for the first 4 weeks and then every 2 weeks for
      the next 9 weeks.

      PER AMENDMENT: Enrollment to the lowest dose cohort is completed.
