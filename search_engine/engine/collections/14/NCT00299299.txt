      RPM system senses the respiration motion of the patient by tracking a pair of reflective
      markers on a lightweight "marker block" constructed of a synthetic material. This block is
      placed on the patient's abdomen.

      During Radiotherapy, the beam is only switched on at pre-determined phases of respiration.
      The appropriate phase of respiration is determined by the RPM system. This implies a reliable
      correlation of external block motion to internal hepatic movement. This correlation is not a
      simple one, and requires "modeling".
