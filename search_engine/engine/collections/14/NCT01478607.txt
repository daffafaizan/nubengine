      patients will receive a QUTENZA patch applied for 30 minutes to the feet; in the second
      group, patients will receive a QUTENZA patch applied for 60 minutes to the feet. In both
      these groups patients will also continue to receive their normal treatment (Standard of Care
      (SOC)) for their peripheral neuropathic pain (PNP) and may receive further QUTENZA patch
      applications in the same way during the study. The third group will not receive a QUTENZA
      patch but will continue to receive their normal treatment for their neuropathic pain (SOC).
      Subjects will be involved in the study for up to 15 months and will have to visit the clinic
      at least 9 times.
