      colorectal surgeons and randomly divided into two groups according to the method of
      anastomosis: - the end-to-side anastomosis group and the side-to-side anastomosis group.
      After the surgery, enhanced recovery program will be implemented. The primary endpoint is the
      cumulative recovery rate according to the method of anastomosis. The cumulative recovery rate
      is defined as the percentage of patients who are satisfied with all aspects of recovery time,
      including i) tolerance of diet for 24 hours, 2) analgesic-free (oral or intravenous (IV)
      analgesic drugs not necessary after cessation of patient-controlled analgesia (PCA)), 3) safe
      ambulation (ambulation of 600m without assistance), 4) afebrile status without major
      complications (fever was defined as body temperature greater than 37.2Â°C at axilla).
      Secondary endpoints are postoperative hospital stay, complications, the failure rate of the
      enhanced recovery program, and the readmission rate within 1 month after surgery. The
      expected cumulative recovery rate in postoperative day 7 is 90% in the end-to-side
      anastomosis group and 70% in the side-to-side anastomosis group. The sample size of 130
      patients was calculated as follow: Based on the assumption that cumulative recovery rate will
      increase to 20% using the end-to-side anastomosis, it was calculated that 65 patients should
      be in each group. The sample size was calculated by the formula for a power 80%, alpha error
      of 0.05 and dropout rate of 10%.
