      or short stent length after signing an informed consent prior to their surgery. They keep a
      pain diary and medication diary for a two week period after the stent is placed. These are
      turned in at the two week post-op visit. Patients also complete a quality of life and urinary
      symptom score questionnaire pre and post operatively.
