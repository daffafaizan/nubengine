      system. Generating a massive and transient release of antigens, RFA could boost lymphocyte
      proliferation and production of inflammatory cytokines in response to tumor extracts. Herein,
      the investigator aims to demonstrate that RFA can amplify the specific T cell response in
      metastatic cancer patients. In order to ensure this, he plans to assess and quantify tumor
      infiltrating lymphocytes through tumoral biopsies. He also plans to measure the CD4, CD8 and
      NK lymphocytes release, the circulating DNA and tumoral cells release, during RFA of lung
      metastases. On tumoral biopsies, the expression of PDL-1 ligand will also be evaluated and
      measured. Participants with bilateral metastases or with 5 or more unilateral metastases will
      be recruited. The two RFA interventions will be carried out within 4-6 weeks of each other.
      Blood samples and tumoral biopsies will be performed during each intervention. Biopsies will
      be performed on a metastasis before the thermal ablation. Blood samples will be performed
      just before RFA, 30 min after RFA and one day after. Analysis, identification and measure of
      lymphocytes release will be performed with flow cytometry. All analysis and measurements will
      be performed in the Bio-Pathology department of Institut Bergoni√©.
