      stent implantation to prevent restenosis and stent thrombosis. However, variable platelet
      response and potential resistance to therapy have emerged with clopidogrel. Several studies
      showed that clopidogrel resistance is associated with increased cardiovascular events after
      coronary interventions. New antiplatelet therapeutic strategy of is needed in case of
      clopidogrel resistance. We started this study to compare the effect of double dosing of
      clopidogrel to 150mg per day and adding cilostazol to standard dose of clopidogrel after the
      insertion of drug-eluting stent in patients with clopidogrel resistance.
