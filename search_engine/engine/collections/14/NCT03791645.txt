      (Sudarshan Kriya Yoga) program, a mind-body intervention, as an adjuvant therapy for people
      suffering with opioid use disorder (OUD), in Columbus, Ohio. Previous research carried out in
      India in 2015, has demonstrated that SKY significantly improved the quality of life among
      people with OUD, however, the suitability, acceptability of SKY program has not been tested
      among American population. SKY differs from mindfulness and other meditation processes in
      that, it is a more physiological, rather than cognitive process. It involves controlled
      breathing techniques that can be easily mastered, and do not require mental effort. The
      investigator's goals are to a) DEMONSTRATE the feasibility, acceptability and efficacy of SKY
      program as an adjuvant therapy for American population suffering with OUD. Studies will be
      carried out in OUD subjects at Mary Haven clinic in Columbus. The efficacy of SKY will be
      measured using psychometric questionnaires. Feasibility and acceptability will be measured by
      attendance and attrition.
