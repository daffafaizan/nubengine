    
      Summary:

      The CVRx BAROSTIM THERAPY in Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction (HFpEF) Registry
      will be performed with subjects who have been recently implanted with the BAROSTIM NEO System
      in accordance with CE-Mark approved criteria for resistant hypertension and have evidence of
      HFpEF per the registry enrollment criteria. Subjects must be enrolled within 30 days from
      implant but prior to therapy activation. Up to 70 subjects will be enrolled at up to 10
      sites. Data should be obtained from standard of care measurements taken prior to implant, at
      enrollment/baseline, and at 3 and 6 months after the device was implanted, at which time each
      subject will be exited from the registry.
