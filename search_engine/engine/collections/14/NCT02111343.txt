      participants identified with CAPD to an auditory training (AT) group or a no intervention
      (Control) group. Both groups were matched for age and gender. Baseline measures were
      conducted prior to the randomisation process.

      Participants from the AT group were given a 3-month home therapy using a CBAT programme
      developed for this study, while participants from the control group received no intervention
      for the same period of time. Apart from regular school attendance and activities, all
      participants were requested to discontinue any other auditory-based interventions, which
      might affect the outcomes of this study. All the participants were assessed again after the
      conclusion of the training period.

      After the end of the intervention, participants from the AT group were requested to undergo a
      no-intervention phase for a period of 3 months before another assessment. This was intended
      to examine the sustainability of any improvement made through the CBAT programme.

      An auditory test and two validated questionnaires were used as outcome measures, administered
      at baseline, and at post-3 months (immediately post-intervention).
