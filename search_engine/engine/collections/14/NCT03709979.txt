      between the pharyngeal - laryngeal axis and the oral cavity axis is narrow. A roll inserted
      under the shoulders of the infant will help line up the oral, laryngeal, and pharyngeal axes
      making direct laryngoscopy easier.

      The investigators hypothesized that laryngoscopic view and intubation conditions using C-Mac
      videolaryngoscope with Miller Blade size 0 and 1 would be better with a roll under shoulder
      in children under 2 years.
