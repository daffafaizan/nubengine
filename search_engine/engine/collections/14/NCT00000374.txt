      second-generation antipsychotic drugs: olanzapine, risperidone.

      Long-term studies of first-episode schizophrenia patients have clearly indicated excellent
      initial responsiveness of positive psychotic symptoms to treatment with conventional
      antipsychotic medications. However, in the years immediately following this initial good
      response, morbidity increases. Relapses, often multiple ones, are the rule and are usually
      precipitated by medication noncompliance. There is some evidence that the second-generation
      antipsychotic drugs may have superior efficacy in terms of these outcome domains. However,
      these newer agents have been studied primarily in chronic and/or treatment-resistant patient
      samples and there are virtually no long-term studies or studies comparing the new drugs with
      one another.

      First episode patients are randomly assigned to treatment with olanzapine or risperidone for
      3 years. Outcome measures for the initial episode include psychopathology (positive,
      negative, and affective symptoms), side effects, neurocognition (executive function, memory,
      and attention), social and occupational function and service utilization. The effects on
      long-term course are measured in terms of frequency and timing of relapses, level of recovery
      from subsequent episodes and prospectively assessed course of psychopathology, neurocognitive
      function, social/vocational function, and service utilization.
