      estimated 20% of older Veterans. Those with PAD ambulate with slow gait and experience
      decreased leg strength, dysmobility, reduced quality of life, serious morbidity and often
      premature death. It is estimated that over 60% of individuals with PAD are overweight or
      obese. While PAD itself worsens mobility, obesity adds a further functional burden to older
      adults with PAD. Individuals diagnosed with PAD, who are also obese typically claudicate 40%
      more quickly than non-obese individuals and take 20% longer to recover after claudication.
      Studies of older obese adults without PAD have demonstrated that the combination of exercise
      and weight loss is more effective at improving physical function and body composition than
      exercise alone. While these findings likely translate to older adults with PAD, this
      hypothesis has yet to be tested. This study is designed to determine whether weight loss and
      exercise (WL+EX) versus exercise ( EX ) alone will 1) improve mobility function (walking
      ability) to a greater extent than exercise alone and 2) determine the mechanisms underlying
      changes in mobility function by measuring muscle microvascular perfusion and composition. The
      investigators hypothesize that a combined intervention of weight loss and exercise (aerobic
      and restive) will result in greater improvements in mobility function through improved muscle
      perfusion and reduced muscle fat infiltration than exercise alone in obese Veterans with PAD.
