      superiority of RFCA to medical treatment has been continuously reporting, so RFCA is globally
      performed nowadays. Acute pericardial effusion could occur during RFCA as complication, that
      might be developed to cardiac tamponade needed immediate pericardiocentesis. The inflammation
      developed after pericardiocentesis might be associated with the recurrences of atrial
      fibrillation, it could be presumed by the frequent occurrence of atrial fibrillation after
      open-heart surgery. The inflammation can be suppressed by administration of colchicine and
      the effects of colchicine have been proven to decrease the development of atrial
      fibrillation.
