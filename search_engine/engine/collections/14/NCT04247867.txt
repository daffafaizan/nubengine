      achieved serum concentrations of selected protein bound uremic toxins by dialysis with a
      medium cut-off membrane (Theranova, Baxter AG, USA) and online hemodiafiltration with a
      standard "high-flux" dialysis membrane. In the second phase, both dialysis purification
      methods will be supplemented by a change in the diet with increase of the daily intake of
      dietary fiber to 30g and addition of a short-chain fatty acid propionate in the dose of 1 g
      daily.

      The main outcome of the study is the serum concentration of p-cresol sulphate. Secondary
      outcome is the serum concentration of indoxyl-sulphate and trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO).
      Serum albumin concentration and lean body weight of patients represent safety outcomes for
      this study.

      This investigator-initiated research project has been entirely planned and will be conducted
      by the clinical researchers in a tertiary University Medical Center Ljubljana.

      The study will include 50 chronic prevalent stable dialysis patients in the following
      periods:

        -  2 weeks of wash-in period with standard bicarbonate haemodialysis and standard high-flux
           dialysis membrane,

        -  then the patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either one of the two study arms:

        -  (interventional study arm) 4 weeks of dialysis with medium cut-off (Theranova) membrane
           (first phase), then dialysis for 4 weeks with the same membrane and increased fiber
           intake (second phase),

        -  (control study arm) 4 weeks of dialysis with a high-flux membrane using on-line
           haemodiafiltration (first phase) and 4 weeks of high-flux membrane haemodiafiltration
           and increased fiber intake (second phase),

        -  finally, all patients will undergo a 4 week wash-out period with a standard bicarbonate
           haemodialysis using standard high-flux dialysis membrane identical to wash-in period.

      Measurement of the study end-points will be carried out at the end of 2-week wash-in period,
      each 4-week period and at the end of 4 week wash-out period.
