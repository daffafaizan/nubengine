      (LAI) added to a multi-drug regimen in participants with non-tuberculous mycobacterium (NTM)
      lung infections due to Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) who are refractory to therapy and
      failed to convert in Study INS-212.

      Participants participating in Study INS-212 who had not achieved the INS-212 protocol
      definition of culture conversion (3 consecutive monthly negative sputum cultures) or who had
      experienced a relapse or recurrence (agar positive or more than 2 consecutive broth positive
      results after culture conversion had occurred) by Month 6, as determined by their sputum
      culture results from Day 1 through Month 6 and confirmed at their scheduled Month 8 visit,
      were eligible to participate in Study INS-312. For participants who chose to participate in
      Study INS-312, the Month 8 visit of Study INS-212 became their end of treatment (EOT) visit;
      these participants were then asked to provide written informed consent for Study INS-312 and
      were enrolled directly into Study INS-312 after having met all eligibility criteria.

      Participants in Study INS-212 had either received 590 mg LAI plus an MDR (LAI + MDR arm) or a
      multidrug regimen alone (MDR alone arm). All participants in this safety extension study were
      to continue the multidrug antimycobacterial regimen that they were receiving during Study
      INS-212 and will receive LAI 590 mg administered daily (QD) for up to 12 months. The
      participants will remain in the study for up to a total of 13 months (up to 12 months
      on-treatment plus 1 month off LAI treatment for safety follow up).
