      couple may have favorable impact on conception and pregnancy.

      The investigators propose to undertake a controlled trial of the efficiency of an integrated
      global care program. This trial of an intervention on lifestyle factors will be compared with
      the ""cohort multiple randomised controlled trial"" methodology in order to strengthen
      external validity by limiting bias that may result from initial consent to randomisation, or
      from deception of allocated treatment.

      At any visit in a participating ART center, all attending couples will be invited to
      participate in an observational survey in order to allow access to their data. In this whole
      cohort, all eligible couples will be identified as consultations go. An ""on the fly""
      randomisation process (ration 2 usual / 1 experimental) will select candidate couples from
      all eligible ones, who will be ten offered the experimental PEPCI intervention. In case of
      refusal of the experimental care, they will be given the usual care.
