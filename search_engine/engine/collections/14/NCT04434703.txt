      Anesthesia will be given then flapless atraumatic extraction using periotomes followed by
      forceps after luxation. For all groups, the socket will be debrided using curette then

        -  group A, the socket will be filled with A.PRF

        -  group B the socket will be filled with PRF.

        -  group C no bio-additive will be added.

        -  Criss cross horizontal mattress suture will be applied to close the extraction wound.

      PRF and A-PRF preparation :

      10 ml of blood will be drawn from each patient by vein puncture of the antecubital vein.

        -  Plateletr ich fibrin (PRF) is 3000 rpm and 10 minutes without addition of anticoagulant

        -  Advanced platelet rich fibrin (A-PRF) is 1300 rpm and 8 minutes.
