      the shape and pumping ability of the heart. These changes can lead to heart failure. An
      enzyme called metalloproteinase (MMP) plays a role in this damage.

      The main purpose of the study is to test whether a possible new drug (called PG-116800) that
      interferes with the MMP enzyme can prevent some of the damage to heart muscle in patients who
      have had a heart attack. The study will also supply information regarding possible uses of
      this compound in cardiovascular disease.

      This is a Phase II "proof-of-concept" study; that is, it is a first attempt to treat sick
      people with the drug to see if it works.

      The study is interventional since we will be using a drug to interfere with the heart tissue
      damage that follows a heart attack.
