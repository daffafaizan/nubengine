      on LV myocardial deformation and remodeling both in the acute myocarditis phase and follow-up
      period (about 2 years later). The investigators will use a combined approach including strain
      echocardiography to asses left ventricular myocardial deformation and late gadolinium
      enhancement (LGE)cardiac magnetic resonance for the assessment of left ventricular damage.
