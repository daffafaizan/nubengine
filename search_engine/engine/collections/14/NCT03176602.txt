      General Hospital, and all the intensivists and nurses will be blinded to the objectives of
      the study. All patients admitted to the ICU will be consecutively included in the study. For
      patients readmitted to the ICU during the same hospitalisation, only data from the first
      admission will be collected.

      As per routine care, all patients will have their nutritional status assessed by the
      dietitian within 48 hours of ICU admission. Information required for the nutritional
      assessment (SGA) will be obtained from the patients or their main care givers, and
      nutritional status will be dichotomized into well-nourished and malnourished.

      The electronic medical records automatically and prospectively collects all data required to
      calculate the mNUTRIC. At the end of the study, the mNUTRIC will be retrospectively
      calculated. Patients with values of "0-4" will be classified as low-mNUTRIC and "5-9" as
      high-mNUTRIC.

      The primary outcome will be hospital mortality and all patients will be followed until
      discharge or death, for up to one year after admission to the ICU.

      Agreement and mortality discriminative value (i.e. discrimination) of the 2-category
      classification of mNUTRIC (Low- and high-mNUTRIC) and SGA (SGA-A and SGA-B/C) will be
      assessed by Kappa statistics and C-statistics respectively.

      A multivariate logistic regression will be used to generate the adjusted odds ratios that
      quantify the association between high-mNUTRIC, malnutrition, and their combination (mNUTRIC â‰¥
      5 and SGA-B/C) with hospital mortality.
