      40%. Besides prone positioning, the best approach of management is low tidal volume
      ventilation (LTV). This 'protective ventilation' strategy is not aways effective to improve
      oxygenation and is associated with an increased requirement of sedation and neuromuscular
      blocking agents, which increase length of stay and morbidity. APRV is a ventilatory mode
      based on relatively high and sustained continuous positive pressure, combined with a short
      phase of release to allow carbon dioxide removal. It also allows unrestricted spontaneous
      breathing throughout respiration, independent of the ventilator cycle. Providing sustained
      inflation while limiting duration and frequency of release phase permits limiting volume
      loss, resulting in progressive and improved alveolar recruitment, an increased alveolar
      surface area available for gas exchange and improved ventilation-perfusion matching.

      In this multi-center, prospective, randomized, controlled, open trial, the investigators aim
      to compare the effects and safety of the early application of time-controlled adaptive method
      of APRV and conventional ventilation with LTV strategy in patients with severe to moderate
      ARDS.
