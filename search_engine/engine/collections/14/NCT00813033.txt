      their child's healthcare providers. Many things affect the quality of the consenting process
      including the parents' level of health literacy, English proficiency and cultural
      perspectives. Our long-term goal is to develop a standardized consenting process that
      ultimately addresses the needs of the patient and the patient's family so that a truly
      informed decision can occur. The specific hypothesis is that incorporating the use of a
      multimedia patient decision aid to assist in the education of patients and their families
      about an invasive medical procedure (i.e. gastro-endoscopy) will improve knowledge and
      positively impact the ability of the parent to act on this knowledge when making decisions
      regarding their child's health care.
