      preoperative area where safety monitoring will occur. The tumor resection occurs
      approximately 2 hours after being brought back to the operating room and so there is no wait
      time between infusion and being taken back to operating room. Intraoperative fluorescent
      imaging will be utilized in parallel with the standard operating procedure to capture images
      during surgery. Images also will be taken of the excised specimen on the back table. The
      excised specimen will be sent to the pathology department for fluorescent imaging and
      immunohistochemistry for FR. Subjects will have a 2-5 day hospital stay (normal nephrectomy
      recovery period) where safety measurements will be taken. Final safety measurements will be
      taken at the 10-day and 1-month follow-up visits.
