      study performed in rheumatology consultations, of both public and liberal sectors. Eligible
      patients are recruited by successive inclusions until the end of the recruitment period, set
      at one year. A Scientific Committee validates the scientific writing, a Steering Committee
      supervises the clinical operations of the project and a Data Review Committee supervises the
      management of the data and carries out all the missions of audit and control of validity of
      the collected data, as well as the planning of statistical analysis.

      Collected data are managed by the DACIMA Clinical SuiteÂ®, the electronic data capture
      platform which complies with the FDA 21 CFR part 11 requirements (Food and Drug
      Administration 21 Code of Federal Regulations part 11), the HIPAA specifications (Health
      Insurance Portability and Accountability Act), and the ICH standards (International
      Conference on Harmonisation).
