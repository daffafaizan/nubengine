      patients went to health institutions to receive treatment and other extra- institutional in
      which the medication was delivered in the place of choice for treating patients.

      Measuring the effectiveness ( compliance and cure ) was made from a controlled clinical trial
      , randomized , partially blinded . The measurement of family and institutional costs , direct
      and indirect , will be based on the activities.
