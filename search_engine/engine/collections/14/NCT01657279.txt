    
      A convenience sample of 111 practicing clinicians (general and vascular neurologists,
      internists, and ER physicians) predicted the outcomes of 5 stroke patients based on case
      summaries. Cases were randomly selected as being representative of the 10 most common
      clinical scenarios (n=1,415) from a pool of over 12,000 patients admitted to stroke centers
      in Ontario, Canada. Stroke cases had known clinical presentation, comorbidities, stroke
      severity, and outcomes.

      All participants are active practicing physicians caring for patients with acute stroke.
      Conditions were standardized to mimic clinical practice.

      Main outcomes of interest included 30-day mortality and death or disability at discharge.

      Secondary outcome: death or institutionalization at discharge
