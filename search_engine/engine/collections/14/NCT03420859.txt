      cross-sectional investigation of the intimate hygiene questionnaire at baseline as compared
      to abnormal vaginal microbiota. We plan to make focused interview of N=30 patients to cover
      any additional female hygiene details not covered in the original questionnaire. After this
      investigation we may include new questions after the interim analysis - given that the study
      proceeds. In this case we plan to publish the first results of the intimate hygiene habits of
      the patients enrolled until interim stage.
