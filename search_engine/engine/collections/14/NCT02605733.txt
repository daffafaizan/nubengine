      non-invasive technologies. First, amplitude integrated electroencephalography (EEG), a
      "simplified" EEG with four sensors (single channel), enables continuous non-invasive
      monitoring of cerebral activity. Second, near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is another
      non-invasive technology that allows continuous real-time measurement of regional tissue
      oxygen utilization of the brain. Both technologies have been used in newborns and have been
      predictive of brain injury or neurodevelopmental impairment.
