      verbal expression via slide, with a duration of 20 minutes and in the form of a single
      session. Our leaflets contained the same information as the OP education program.

      Face-to-face interviews include; Revised 2011 Osteoporosis Knowledge Test (rOKT) (0-32
      points) for OP knowledge levels; National Osteoporosis Foundation daily calcium intake scale
      [NOF, (mg)], Physical Activity Scale For The Elderly (PASE, 0-763 points), smoking and
      alcohol use status (Yes/No) and quantities (cigarette pack/per week, alcohol unit/per week),
      frequency of falls (times/last 1 month) were questioned for effects on daily life.
