    
      This is a single-center, randomized, placebo-controlled pilot study to assess the efficacy
      and safety of adding Metformin to the standard treatment for patients with HBeAg-positive
      chronic hepatitis B. Sixty subjects who meet the eligibility criteria will be randomized to
      the experimental arm and comparator arm according to a 1:1 ratio. The participants in the
      experimental arm will be treated with Metformin (sustained release tablet, 1000 mg, once a
      day(QD), 24 weeks) and Entecavir (tablet, 0.5 mg, QD, ongoing treatment). The participants in
      the comparator arm will be treated with Placebo (two tablets, QD, 24 weeks) and Entecavir
      (tablet, 0.5 mg, QD, ongoing treatment). The primary endpoint for efficacy assessment is the
      cumulative rate of HBsAg loss at week 36 after enrollment; the secondary endpoint for
      efficacy assessment is the decrease in quantitative HBsAg from the baseline at week 36 after
      enrollment. The secondary endpoint for safety assessment is the cumulative incidence of
      adverse events at week 36 after enrollment.
