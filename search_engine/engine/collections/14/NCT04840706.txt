      therapy. Until now, few studies have investigated the effect of HFNC therapy on hypercapnic
      COPD patients and the number of patients recruited in these studies is limited. AirvoTM
      therapy could be good choice of treatment for those COPD patients that are not compliant to
      NIV but need treatment for hypercapnia in order to reduce COPD exacerbations and enhance
      QOL.The aims of the study are to compare long-term one-year outcome with or without AirvoTM
      in stabile hypercapnic COPD patients, who are non-compliant to NIV after an acute
      exacerbation of COPD.
