      treatment with two proven mitochondrial enhancers, acetyl-L-carnitine (ALCAR) and α-lipoic
      acid (ALA), has significantly greater efficacy than placebo as an augmentation treatment in
      bipolar depressed patients who display an incomplete response to conventional treatments. We
      propose to test this hypothesis by performing a 15-week placebo-controlled, double-blind,
      parallel group, flexible-dose study investigating the use of ALCAR and ALA as an augmentation
      to treatment as usual in depressed bipolar patients. We will compare the efficacy of
      acetyl-l-carnitine (ALCAR) at doses of 1000-3000mg/day and alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) at doses
      of 600-1800mg/day with placebo on symptom improvement in individuals diagnosed with bipolar
      disorder type I, current episode depressed. Improvement will be assessed using the 21-Item
      Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale
      (MADRS), the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS), and the Clinical Global Impression-Severity and
      Improvement Scales (CGI-S and CGI-I).

      Furthermore, we hypothesize that improvement in depression symptoms following treatment with
      ALCAR and ALA will be associated with increases in phosphocreatine (PCr), beta-nucleoside
      triphosphate (β-NTP), and intracellular pH in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) both at
      week 1 and week 12 of treatment.
