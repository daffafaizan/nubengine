      detected by scintigraphy and normal coronarography (Ischemic Patient - IP) and 25 healthy
      non-ischemic individuals (Control Group - CG). All of them were submitted to anamnesis, serum
      markers (Intercellular Cell Adhesion Molecule [ICAM], Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule[VCAM],
      adiponectin, endothelin, LDL-oxidized and CRP-US), NVC and VOP. Exclusion criteria were:
      inflammatory diseases, cancer patients, recent traumas, Diabetes Mellitus, obese individuals
      with BMI> 35 kg/m², uncontrolled hypertensive patients, and those with active infectious
      processes. In the NVC,capillary diameters were observed, as well as red blood cells velocity
      in the capillaries (RBCV, mm/s), maximum red blood cells after 1 minute ischemia (RBCVmax,
      mm/s) and time to reach maximal velocity (TRBCVmax) and, regarding VOP,the baseline blood
      flow (ml/min), post 5 minute ischemia flow and vascular resistance (mmHg/ml/min) were
      evaluated. Data were analyzed using Student's t-tests for independent or Mann-Whitney
      samples; χ2 or Fisher exact. The absolute and relative variations (delta) of plethysmography
      measurements versus baseline in each group were analyzed by the Wilcoxon signed-ranks test
      and compared between the groups by the Mann-Whitney test. For correction of confounding
      factors, age and BMI, it was used Covariance Analysis (ANCOVA).
