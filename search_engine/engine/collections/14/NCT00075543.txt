      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of docetaxel and oxaliplatin in patients with stage
           III or IV ovarian epithelial cancer.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the tolerance profile of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine a recommended phase III dose of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the efficacy of this regimen, in terms of objective response rate and
           radiological and biological response rate (CA 125), in these patients.

        -  Determine the complete pathological response in patients treated with this regimen as
           first-line therapy.

        -  Determine the duration of the objective response in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the time to progression in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study.

      Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour and oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1. Treatment
      repeats every 3 weeks for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Patients are followed monthly for 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30-39 patients will be accrued for this study.
