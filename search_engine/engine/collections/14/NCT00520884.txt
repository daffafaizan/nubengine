      prior year plus at least 2 of the 4 remaining Fried criteria for frailty and five healthy
      women without any frailty criteria were enrolled. Women with conditions that can cause weight
      loss or taking an appetite stimulant or corticosteroids were excluded. Each woman completed
      two 180 minute infusions, one week apart, assigned randomly: a graded ghrelin infusion of
      2.5, 5.0, and 10.0 pmol/kg/min for 60 minutes each and an equivalent placebo (saline)
      infusion. A meal of standardized composition was provided after each infusion and intake
      quantified. Samples were collected every 30 minutes for growth hormone (GH), and total and
      active ghrelin. Additional samples were collected every 60 minutes for glucose, insulin, free
      fatty acids, leptin, adiponectin, resistin, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists
      (GLP-1), and cortisol. Adverse events were collected during the infusion and by telephone 24
      hours later. Non-parametric methods were used to compare differences in response to the
      ghrelin and placebo infusions 1) in all women and 2) between frail and healthy women.
