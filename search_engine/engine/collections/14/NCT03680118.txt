      tissues. This blocks the fast-duplicating connective and epithelial cells from colonizing the
      regenerating site.

      Collagen membranes have been successfully used as a barrier membrane in clinical practice.

      They have the advantage of being resorbable and pose less post-operative complications. On
      the other hand, collagen membranes are not rigid, causing a difficulty in maintaining the
      vertical height of the particulate bone graft placed onto the ridge.

      Alternatively, titanium meshes have been used with success in clinical practice and display
      both advantages and disadvantages. They provide tenting effect thanks to their rigidity and,
      being moldable, can be easily given the shape needed to cover the defect.

      However they must be removed, not resorbable, require time-consuming shaping and pose
      complications as flap dehiscence.

      Choice of the comparator:

      Current studies have shown that using titanium mesh as a barrier to protect the bone graft
      during GBR can be considered successful in terms of vertical bone gain.

      There might be variable in other findings which could be attributed to differences in the
      methodology, such as using other membranes over the titanium mesh (collagen or PTFE
      membranes).
