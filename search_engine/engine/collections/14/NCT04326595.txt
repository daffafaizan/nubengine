      of gestation .This diagnosis concerns 10-15% of all pregnancies and is made based on
      additional tests such as serial determinations of chorionic gonadotropin concentration and
      imaging examinations ultrasonography. Depending on the clinical presentation and results of
      ultrasonography, miscarriages can be divided into complete spontaneous miscarriage, and
      incomplete miscarriage, when the width of the echo of residual tissues in the uterine cavity
      exceeds 10 mm on ultrasonography and is accompanied by the presence of clinical symptoms such
      as vaginal bleeding and abdominal pain .The other type of miscarriage is defined as retained
      products of conception (RPOC) and refers to the state when the gestational sac contains the
      embryo with crown-rump length (CRL) of > 7 mm but embryonic cardiac activity is invisible.
      Empty gestational sac is diagnosed when the gestational sac with a diameter of > 25 mm and
      without an embryo is visible in the uterine cavity on ultrasonography .

      Histopathological examination of products of conception is an integral and a routine
      component of the management of patients with early pregnancy failure . Two important primary
      reasons for such an examination are to confirm the presence of an intrauterine gestation and
      to exclude gestational trophoblastic disease in the form of partial or complete hydatidiform
      mole .
