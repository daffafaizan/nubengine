    
      All patients whom on admission to the ICU (surgical, burn, & cardiac) who are expected to
      receive intensive insulin therapy for at least 72 hours are eligible to be enrolled. Once
      enrolled, the patients will be randomized to one of two groups: the experimental (intravenous
      GLP-1 infusion for 72 hours) or control groups (intravenous 0.9% sodium chloride (NaCl)
      infusion for 72 hours) in a double masked fashion. While enrolled, all patients will receive
      standard-of-care insulin therapy. Both groups will be maintained on the standard ICU specific
      protocol for glucose control.
