      arthritis. Many patients experience moderate to severe pain during the early postoperative
      period, as the surgery involves extensive bone resection and postsurgical serum levels of
      cytokine interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein may be elevated.Furthermore, many patients
      suffer postoperative nausea and vomiting after total knee arthroplasty . The inflammatory
      response after TKA is pronounced and a result of cumulative effects of anaesthesia and
      mechanical stress . Inadequate management of postoperative pain is relevant with a series of
      undesirable effects, including progression to a persistent pain, delayed functional recovery,
      increased the economic burden and patient dissatisfaction. Steroids may be associated with
      decreased levels of interleukin-6 and C reactive protein and may, thus, relieve the pain
      associated with surgery. Dexamethasone is a long-acting glucocorticoid that has been reported
      to inhibit peripheral phospholipase A, which decreases the pain-aggravating agents from the
      cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways . In addition, it reduces postoperative nausea and
      vomiting by exerting a central antiemetic effect by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis and
      the release of endogenous opioids[5] . Some studies also reported potential adverse events,
      such as infection .
