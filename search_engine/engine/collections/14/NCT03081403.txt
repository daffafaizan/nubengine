      sensitive skin. A sensitive skin is characterized by the occurrence of tingling sensations,
      tightness, heat, burning, itching or pain triggered by non pathogenic factors such as wind,
      heat, cold, water , cosmetics, toiletries, stress...

      The Quantitative sensory testing (QST) is a physico-psychic method that uses gradients
      stimuli of different modalities to measure a subjective somatosensory response. This allows
      to characterize sensory dysfunction by assessing the participation of small and large nerve
      fibers.

      The aim of this project is to characterize the presence or absence of a neurological disorder
      in patients with sensitive skin. This discovery would be a decisive argument to reinforce the
      suspicion that sensitive skins is linked to a small fiber neuropathy.
