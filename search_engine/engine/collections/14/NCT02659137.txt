    
      A prospective, single center, non-randomized pilot study in which patients will undergo an
      electrophysiology (EP) study during the TAVI procedure.

      All patients eligible for inclusion will undergo an electrophysiology (EP) study during the
      TAVI procedure. For the purpose of EP measurements, a His-catheter will be placed at the
      beginning of the procedure and remain in the same location until the end of the procedure.

      Continuous HV measurements will be collected, together with a continuous surface ECG, during
      the entire TAVI procedure. The different steps in TAVI procedure will be registered.

      During the study, patients will undergo regular electrocardiographic examinations at the
      outpatient clinic (before implantation, after implantation, before discharge and after 6
      weeks, 6 and 12 months post-implantation). These are part of the standard healthcare after
      the TAVI procedure.

      The research protocol has been approved by the ethical committee (METC).
