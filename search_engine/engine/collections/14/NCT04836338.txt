    
      The overall purpose of this study is to assess the functionality & impact of the use of the
      newly designed GlideScope Spectrum pediatric video laryngoscope blades and stylet for the
      orotracheal intubation of neonates and pediatric patients, utilizing manikin models. The
      hypothesis is that the Spectrum laryngoscope blades and stylet can improve the time and/or
      success of orotracheal intubation in a manikin.

      Secondary aims of this study include assessing the impact of Spectrum pediatric video
      laryngoscope blades under simulated normal and difficult airway conditions on glottic view
      grade, mouth space, ease of blade insertion, ease of tracheal tube insertion, mechanisms of
      tracheal tube insertion impediment, and perceived overall clinical & functional usefulness in
      airways with predictors of difficult intubation.
