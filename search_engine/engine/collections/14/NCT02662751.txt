    
      The secondary objectives are:

      A. To compare the patient pathways between the two arms in terms of time to diagnosis, and
      duration of hospitalization.

      B. To compare the consumption of imaging exams (number and type) and total body irradiation
      between the two arms.

      C. To compare the diagnostic efficiency between the two arms in terms of detection of
      predefined lesions, and performance ratios.

      D. To study the thickness of the left atrial wall as a risk factor for permanent atrial
      fibrillation.

      E. To compare the distribution of suspected neoplasms between the two groups, as well as the
      number of detected incidentalomas.

      F. To compare the survival and the incidence of new cardiovascular events between the two
      arms at 12 months and 36 months.

      G. To compare the quality of life between the two arms at 12 months and 36 months.
