      non-AD dementia. There will be 2 visits (up to 30 days apart), and a telephone follow-up
      visit.

      This protocol does not include treatment of subjects. Lumbar puncture and phlebotomy are
      routine clinical tasks and are associated with a low level of risk. All adverse events will
      be documented and reviewed by the PI.
