      the Dante Pazzanese Institute of Cardiology. The patients had an established diagnosis of
      cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or valve regurgitation) by previous
      electrocardiogram and/or Doppler echocardiography and all had surgical indication (coronary
      artery bypass, valve replacement or combined surgery). Patients with prior neurological
      disease (previous stroke or muscular dystrophies) or cognitive impairment resulting from
      previous injury or who refused to participate in the study were excluded.

      Twenty-four hours before the surgery patients were evaluated by Frailty score as described
      elsewhere and divided into 2 groups: No-Frailty (Frailty score 1 or 2) and Pre-Frailty
      (Frailty score 3 or 4). If the patient had Frailty score higher than 5 were excluded from the
      study.

      After surgery all patients were admitted at the intensive care unit (ICU) following the
      institutional mechanical ventilation protocol. Immediately after admission heart rate, mean
      arterial pressure, and oxygen pulse saturation (SpO2) were measured with a Dixtal monitor (DX
      2010). After ICU admission all participants were followed up for main outcomes: hospital
      discharge, stroke, infection or death. In addition the investigators also measured length of
      stay, the duration of mechanical ventilation, vasopressors usage and the needed of
      physiotherapy indication after hospital discharge. All study participants receive medical and
      physiotherapy care according to the routine of the institution.
