      their disease course including fatigue, pain, anxiety and depression. Palliative care is
      defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as "an approach that improves the quality of
      life of patients and their families facing the problems associated with life threatening
      illness, through the prevention and relief of suffering by means of early identification and
      impeccable assessment and treatment of pain and other problems, physical, psychosocial and
      spiritual."

      The University of Michigan Symptom Management and Supportive Care Program works together with
      patient's oncology team to manage cancer related and treatment related symptoms. They offer a
      wide range of services including: pain and symptom management, medication management,
      nutritional counseling, expedited access to psychiatric oncology, anesthesia pain service and
      physical medicine and rehabilitation. Studies have demonstrated an improvement in quality of
      life, symptom burden and patient/care giver satisfaction when palliative care is part of
      routine oncologic care. Currently, in gynecologic oncology, palliative care is incorporated
      on a case by case basis, instead of in a standardized approach. We hope this study will
      provide a standardized tool to identify gynecologic oncology patients receiving chemotherapy
      who would benefit from a referral to a symptom management clinic.

      This study will provide a screening mechanism to identify advanced stage or recurrent
      gynecologic oncology chemotherapy patients with palliative care needs and determine which
      symptom management option provides the best improvement in symptom burden, that performed by
      a specialty clinic staffed by providers formally trained in palliative care or that provided
      by the patient's gynecologic oncologist. This study has the potential to change practice by
      providing a triage tool that will identify patients that will most benefit from specialty
      palliative care services and could result in improved quality of life for our patients.
