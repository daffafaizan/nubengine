      presentation of individual patient and disease-specific information and the fulfilment of
      indication criteria. Furthermore, it will present health information about knee replacement
      to empower the patient. To investigate the effect of the tool on decision quality, we choose
      a prospective multi-center, stepped wedge, cluster randomized controlled trial (SW-RCT)
      design.
