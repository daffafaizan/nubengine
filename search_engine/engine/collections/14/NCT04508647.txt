      achieved when single agent rituximab was used in these subsets. The investigators assume that
      by administering ublituximab (both as a single agent and in combination with umbralisib for
      individuals who fail to achieve a CR [Complete response] with the single agent), the CR rate
      will increase to 50%. Efficacy will be assessed using the proportion of patients treated with
      ublituximab alone or with ublituximab administered in combination who have a complete
      response. Thus, the investigators will test the efficacy of ublituximab using a difference in
      proportions design by comparing an expected study population control rate of 50% to the
      comparison proportion being determined by the historical control CR rate of 30%. In other
      words, the null hypothesis is that the true response rate is 30%, and it will be formally
      tested against a one-sided alternative that the response rate is 50%.
