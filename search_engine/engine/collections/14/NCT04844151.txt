    
      Acute myocarditis is an inflammatory disease of the heart muscle. Its clinical presentation
      and its etiologies are multiple and make it a complex disease to treat. Its course also
      varies, ranging from complete clinical recovery to recurrence of ventricular arrhythmia or
      progression to chronic dilated heart disease, while being difficult to predict. The long-term
      prognosis is poorly understood.

      Consecutive patients hospitalized in a tertiary university referral center cohort from 2006
      to 2041 for an acute myocarditis will be ambispectively or prospectively analyzed. This
      project will establish a registry including up to 400 patients in the ambispective analysis
      cohort from 2006 to 2021 and 1000 patients in the prospective analysis cohort during a 20
      years inclusion period.

      The aim of the study is to describe the characteristics of patients hospitalized for an acute
      myocarditis and to evaluate their association wih the long term (until 20 years) prognosis.

      Features of interest will include :

        -  Clinical

        -  Biological

        -  Etiological

        -  Echocardiographic

        -  Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging

        -  Genetics (for the prospective cohort)

        -  Anatomopathological

      The collection of clinical, biological and radiological data will represent an unique source
      allowing research teams in the coming years to access the data necessary to answer various
      specific questions (pathophysiological, diagnostic, prognostic) relevant to the state of
      knowledge on this pathology.
