      treatment of vaginal candidiasis, alone or as an adjunct to antifungal treatments, as well as
      the effectiveness of a Lactobacillus strain as maintenance treatment after antifungal
      treatment to reduce the recurrence rate of candidiasis However, to date, no studies have
      evaluated the oral efficacy of a probiotic strain of Lactobacillus originally isolated from
      breast milk in the prevention of new vaginal yeast events in women with recurrent vaginal
      yeast infections.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the consumption of the one
      probiotic strain in the prevention of new vaginal candidiasis events in women with recurrent
      vaginal candidiasis. This is a preliminary study whose purpose is to know if this probiotic
      is effective in reducing the number of candidiasis events and / or increasing the time
      between possible relapses in women diagnosed with RVVC.
