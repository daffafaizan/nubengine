      also prominent in Israel and has led to a dramatic increase in mental health treatment demand
      resulting in long wait times and low treatment acceptance rate. To address the critical need
      in crisis intervention for children and adolescents at suicidal risk, the investigators
      developed an ultra-brief acute crisis intervention, based on Interpersonal Psychotherapy
      (IPT). IPT is an evidence-based intervention for various psychopathologies among different
      age groups. The current adaptation of IPT-A is comprised of five weekly sessions, followed by
      monthly follow-up caring email contacts to the patients and their parents, over a period of
      three months.
