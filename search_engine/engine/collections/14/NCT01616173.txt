      sciatic nerve block to serve as the primary anesthetic and as part of a multi-modal
      post-operative analgesic plan. Perineural dexamethasone has been investigated as an adjuvant
      for brachial plexus nerve blocks but its effect on sciatic nerve block outcomes has yet to be
      determined. More importantly, it is not known whether the beneficial effect of perineural
      dexamethasone on analgesia duration leads to a better quality of surgical recovery. We
      hypothesized that perineural dexamethasone leads to a better quality of postsurgical recovery
      than intravenous dexamethasone or saline control.
