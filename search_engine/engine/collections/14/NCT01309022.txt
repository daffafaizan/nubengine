      Islet transplantation is an experimental therapy in people with difficult to control Type 1
      diabetes (T1D). Insulin producing cells (islets) are isolated from a pancreas. After the
      cells are prepared, the islets are put into the subject's liver. These transplanted islets
      may produce insulin that the subject's islets can no longer make. In order to help keep up
      the function of the transplanted islets, immunosuppressive medications must be given
      indefinitely or for as long as the study doctor determines is necessary. The medications
      serve to modify the immune system that normally tries to destroy (reject) new islets.

      Participants in this study have received up to three islet cell infusions as a previous
      participant in the ITN005CT (NIS01) protocol. They also received a maintenance
      immunosuppressive treatment regimen consisting of a combination of orally administered drugs
      (tacrolimus (Prograf速), sirolimus (Rapamune速), mycophenolate mofetil (MMF, Cellcept速), and/or
      mycophenolic acid (MPA, Myfortic速).) This protocol provides a way to supply these
      immunosuppressive medications to subjects whose islets continue to function and make
      C-peptide.

      Routine study follow-up visits will occur on an annual and -as warranted basis.
