      excessive cardiovascular disease burden in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Nitric
      oxide (NO), a modulator of neurovascular function, may be linked to adrenergic vascular
      responsiveness. The central HYPOTHESIS is that the reduction in endothelial nitric oxide (NO)
      bioavailability contributes to the enhancement of α1-adrenoceptor vasomotor function in
      patients with CKD.

      Specific Aims: In patients with mild to moderate CKD, compared to matched hypertensive and
      normotensive controls without CKD:

        1. Determine if α1-adrenoceptor vasoreactivity is enhanced less by inhibition of
           endothelial NO

        2. Determine whether α1-adrenoceptor vasoreactivity correlates with plasma levels of the
           endogenous NO inhibitor, asymmetrical dimethylarginine.

      Methods: CKD will be confirmed by I125-iothalamate glomerular filtration rate. Regional
      α1-adrenoceptor vasoreactivity (sensitivity [EC50], reactivity [slope]) will be assessed by
      venous plethsymography using a graded intra-arterial infusion of the α1-adrenoceptor agonist,
      phenylephrine. Comparisons of vasoreactivity at baseline and during infusions of L-NMMA will
      be made between hypertensive non-diabetic subjects with glomerular filtrations rates between
      30-70 ml/min age-, gender-, ethnicity- and % body fat-matched hypertensive and normotensive
      subjects with normal kidney function. In addition, plasma levels of the endogenous NO
      inhibitor, asymmetric dimethylarginine will be measured in the hypertensive subjects with and
      without CKD and compared to vasoreactivity.

      Significance. These studies will provide insight into the mechanisms of the pathogenesis of
      enhanced α1 vasoreactivity in subjects with progressive renal disease.
