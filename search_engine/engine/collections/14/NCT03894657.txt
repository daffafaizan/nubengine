    
      OrkambiÂ® is a combination of Ivacaftor (a CFTR channel potentiator) and Lumacaftor (a
      corrector partially rescuing the traffic of mutated CFTR). This treatment is now marketed in
      France for patients homozygotes for the mutation p.Phe508del, aged 12 and above. Systematic
      use of this product is a concern due to the lack of predictive markers of efficacy, the
      highly variable respiratory improvement in patients and potential serious side effects.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate the predictive value for improvement of the
      respiratory function after 24 weeks of Orkambi treatment of an in vitro test. This test
      quantifies the correction of CFTR activity as assessed by the change of cyclic AMP (cAMP)
      dependant chloride (Cl-) secretion in patient derived Human Nasal Epithelial (HNE) derived
      primary culture after Lumacaftor/Ivacaftor 48 hours incubation.
