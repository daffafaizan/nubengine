        1. All Babies that meet inclusion criteria would immediately given surfactan. Babies will
           do echocardiography, blood gas analize, blood sample, transcutaneous monitor. After that
           babies will be randomized, the intervention group will get standart protocol + lung
           recruitment maneuver (LRM) and another group get standart protocol only.

        2. The lung recruitment maneuver (LRM) will be done by increasing of PEEP 0,2 cm H2O every
           3 minutes, until reach the opening pressure. After that PEEP decrease gradually until
           get the closing pressure. Than the investigators will back to the opening pressure for 3
           minutes, and the final PEEP will be put back 0,2 above closing pressure.

        3. After 3rd days (72 hours) babies, the investigators will exime serum levels of surfactan
           protein-D, CD-31+ and CD-42b- , blood gas , tc-pCO2 - PaCO2 , tcO2 index.

        4. After that babies will observe within 28 days to detect Bronchopulmonary dysplasia
