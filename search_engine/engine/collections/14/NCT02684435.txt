    
      This is an investigator-initiated, prospective study designed to evaluate the accuracy of
      contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) with microbubble contrast agent (perflutren lipid;
      DefinityÂ®) to identify malignancy in patients with kidney disease, a known risk factor for
      kidney malignancy, in whom a conventional ultrasound (US) shows an indeterminate cystic
      kidney lesion.

      The primary objective of the study is to estimate the sensitivity of CEUS in diagnosing
      kidney malignancy in patients with a risk factor for kidney malignancy and compare it to the
      current gold standard test in this patient population. Secondary analysis will include more
      optimal contrast-enhanced imaging with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI) in a subset of patients who can receive these studies. The study outcome will lead to
      immediate clinical application in patients with chronic kidney disease. Given the
      cost-effectiveness and adverse event profile, it has excellent potential to become
      established as first line diagnostics in the general patient population as well.
