      lead to painful degenerative arthritis that necessitates surgical arthrodesis for pain
      relief. Surgical arthrodesis in this region though is associated with a high risk of osseous
      non-union (depending on the exact location up to 40%) despite standardized preparation and
      fixation techniques. The development of osseous non-union is associated with certain patient
      characteristics like active smoking, nutrition etc. Compliance to partial weight-bearing
      during the early postoperative phase is another contributing factor.

      The current study aims at evaluating the effect of biofeedback of correct partial weight
      bearing on the rate of osseous non-union compared to conventional patient instruction without
      biofeedback.

      All patients will postoperatively be provided with a lower- leg unloading orthosis furnished
      with a weight sensor that will - according to randomization - give feedback if a predefined
      weight threshold has been crossed or just measure weight-bearing without feedback.
