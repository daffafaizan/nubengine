      I. Determine the radiographic response proportion in patients with refractory or recurrent
      primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) to ibritumomab tiuxetan (yttrium Y 90
      ibritumomab tiuxetan) when given as an intravenous infusion.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the progression free survival of patients treated with ibritumomab tiuxetan when
      given as an intravenous infusion.

      II. Determine the overall survival of patients treated with ibritumomab tiuxetan when given
      as an intravenous infusion.

      III. Establish the toxicity profile of ibritumomab tiuxetan in this patient population.

      IV. Use positron emission tomography (PET)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to map the
      distribution of Y-90 ibritumomab tiuxetan, and calculate the Gy delivered based on the
      activity found within tumor.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive rituximab intravenously (IV) on day 1. Within 7 to 9 days, patients receive
      rituximab IV and yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan IV in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity. Distribution and dose absorbed dose will be assessed on day 11.
      Quality of life will be assessed at screening, at day 1, 36, 92, and at each follow-up visit.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3-6 months for 2 years.
