      thromboembolism (VTE).Specific objectives were to compare the efficacy, safety and cost
      effectiveness of unfractionated heparin (UFH) and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) when
      each is administered subcutaneously (sc), twice daily, in weight -adjusted, fixed doses; and
      to determine if the anticoagulant response (anti-Factor Xa heparin levels, APTT results)
      influence efficacy and safety of UFH and LMWH, independently of dose.
