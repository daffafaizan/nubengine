      pembrolizumab followed by a standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen. Both cohorts will
      receive 4 cycles of dose-dense AC followed by 12 doses of weekly paclitaxel. Paclitaxel will
      be combined with carboplatin for Cohort A (TNBC). The primary safety objective will be to
      evaluate the safety and toxicity of sequential decitabine plus pembrolizumab followed by
      dose-dense AC, weekly paclitaxel (or paclitaxel plus carboplatin) administered as neoadjuvant
      therapy. If the breast tumor is resectable following completion of all protocol therapy,
      breast-conserving surgery or mastectomy and axillary surgical staging (either sentinel node
      biopsy and/or axillary dissection) will be performed.
