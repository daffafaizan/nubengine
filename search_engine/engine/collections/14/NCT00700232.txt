      aminotransferase activity or bile acid concentration, with recovery after delivery. Patients
      with intercurrent liver disease were excluded.

      The entire ABCB4 gene coding sequence and the promoter region were analyzed, during the
      routine medical management, by single strand conformation polymorphism and/or sequencing in
      50 unrelated Caucasian patients with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy.

      The genomic variants detected in these patients with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy
      will be sought in 100 control women from Caucasian origin recruited in the same hospital.
