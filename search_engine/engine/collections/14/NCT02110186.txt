    
      The purpose of this study is to compare outcomes of (1) discectomy with posterior dynamic
      stabilization with those of (2) discectomy alone or (3) discectomy with internal fixation and
      fusion.

      Study aims are:

        1. To demonstrate superiority of discectomy with posterior dynamic stabilization over
           discectomy alone and discectomy with internal fixation and fusion in range of motion at
           the operated level;

        2. To demonstrate non-inferiority of discectomy with posterior dynamic stabilization
           compared to discectomy alone and discectomy with internal fixation and fusion in
           functional outcomes as measured by change in Oswestry Disability Index;

        3. To compare radiological, clinical, patient-reported and safety outcomes among the three
           surgical approaches.
