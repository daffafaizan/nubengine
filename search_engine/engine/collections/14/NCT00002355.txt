      In Stage 2 (randomization), patients are enrolled in either the immediate treatment group or
      delayed treatment group. Immediate treatment consists of intravitreal ISIS 2922 every 7 days
      for 3 injections (Induction) then every 14 days for 18 weeks (Maintenance). Patients in the
      delayed treatment group receive no immediate anti-CMV treatment but are monitored weekly for
      disease progression. If disease progresses, patient receives ISIS 2922 on an identical dosage
      regimen as those on immediate treatment. Patients may continue ISIS 2922 on a biweekly
      extended maintenance schedule if dose is considered safe and the CMV retinitis is clinically
      controlled. Per 2/8/96 amendment, patients are now in Stage 2 at 150 mcg.
