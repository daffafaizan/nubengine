      academic teaching hospital. The study will be performed between January 2014 to December
      2015. All patients meeting the diagnostic criteria of AECOPD and admitted to ICU are
      potentially eligible for the present study. Relevant demographics and laboratory measurements
      are obtained. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is performed immediately after ICU
      admission by experienced intensivists. Cox proportional hazard regression model is fitted by
      using stepwise forward selection and backward elimination technique. If linear assumption is
      not satisfied, the linear spline function will be used.
