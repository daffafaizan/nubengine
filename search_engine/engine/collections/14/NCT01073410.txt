    
      This is a cross-sectional study in patients with asthma and healthy controls in which we will
      analyze how the expression or function of CHIT1, AMCase, and TGFb pathway genes in the
      asthmatic airway is affected by genetic variation in these genes. We propose detailed
      phenotyping of the asthmatic subjects and the healthy controls, including collection of
      induced sputum, exhaled air and detailed physiologic measures including measures of airflow,
      lung volumes, and methacholine responsiveness as well as collection of airway cells and
      tissues by bronchoscopy. We will determine the relative expression of CHIT1 and AMCase in
      specific lung compartments (large airways, small airways, epithelial cells, macrophages) and
      the effects of genetic variants in CHIT1 and AMCase on expression of splice variants and
      levels of chitinase activity in the airway. These human samples will also allow us to
      determine if any of the multiple TGFb pathway genes analyzed show differential expression in
      the lung in asthma.
