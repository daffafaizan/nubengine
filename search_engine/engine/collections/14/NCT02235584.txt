      and after the development of insulin resistance and/or glucose intolerance.The insulinotropic
      properties of GLP-1 and GIP are greatly reduced in type 2 diabetes.

      Since the development of type 2 diabetes is preceded by insulin resistance and glucose
      intolerance we wanted to examine the insulinotropic properties of GLP-1 and GIP in the early
      stages of type 2 diabetes.

      To do this, we want to induce insulin resistance and/or glucose intolerance. This is achieved
      by 5 days of treatment with dexamethasone.

      Subjects are studied on 4 different days in randomized order, with an oral glucose tolerance
      test (OGTT) and glucose clamps + infusions of GLP-1, GIP and NaCl before and immediately
      after 5 days treatment with dexamethasone, 2mg bid. On day 1, 2 and 3 after the 5 days of
      dexamethasone, 2mg dexamethasone was given in the afternoon after the tests to ensure
      unchanged insulin resistance
