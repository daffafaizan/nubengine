      on gastric motor functions, satiation, satiety and weight in obese patients. Subjects were
      randomized to liraglutide or placebo. Liraglutide or placebo was escalated by 0.6mg/day each
      week for 5 weeks and continued until week 16. At baseline and after 16 weeks' treatment, the
      investigators measured weight, gastric emptying of solids (GES), gastric volumes, satiation
      (maximum tolerated volume of liquid nutrient drink), and satiety. GES was also measured at 5
      weeks.

      During the study, the subjects received standardized dietetic and behavioral advice for
      weight reduction therapy. All subjects were given a standard text for information and met
      with a behavioral psychologist who has expertise in obesity treatment at the baseline visit
      and at visits at weeks 4,8, and 12. Additionally, the subjects had brief contact with a
      member of the study team every 4 weeks to inquire about their adherence to study protocol,
      any difficulties they were experiencing, whether they were reading their text assignments,
      and to answer any additional questions.
