      therapy and surgery might improve oncological outcomes. Besides, those patients who achieve a
      good response might benefit from active surveillance, avoiding surgical comorbidities. This
      optimal interval is yet to be defined. This study will aim to better define the role of time
      interval between the end of neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) and TME in Spanish regions, together
      with analyzing the importance of restaging MRI and define the basis for implementing a "watch
      and wait" protocol.
