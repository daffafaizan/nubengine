      testing of interventions. The formative research leading to and including intervention
      development is completed in Stage 1a. A pilot study to provide acceptability/feasibility data
      and obtain effect size estimates of the intervention's strength in changing a desired outcome
      is conducted in Stage 1b. If Stage 1b results are "promising," the intervention moves to full
      scale efficacy testing in Stage 2 using the classic experimental design of a randomized
      control trial (RCT). The intervention is ready for Stage 3 effectiveness testing only after
      its efficacy has been demonstrated in at least two Stage 2 trials.
