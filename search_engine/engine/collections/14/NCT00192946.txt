    
      Patients with bundle branch block have a delayed electrical activation of the left ventricle
      causing abnormal contractility of the left ventricle.

      We hypothesize that patients may benefit from short term (= 72 hours) CRT (Cardiac
      Resynchronization Therapy) in the early phase after open heart surgery.

      Patients: reduced LV function and bundle branch block.

      Study type: randomisation to CRT versus standard postoperative treatment

      Study variables: cardiac output, echocardiographic measures, p-BNP and hours with inotropic
      therapy.
