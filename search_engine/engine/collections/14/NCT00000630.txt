      HIVAC-1e and gp160. Specific questions to be addressed in this part of the study include:
      Does combination vaccination result in a synergistic (added) response not predicted by just
      the addition of a second vaccination, and does this synergism depend on the unique priming
      effect of a vaccinia recombinant, or will any combination do?

      Volunteers will be randomized to one of four groups. Group A (20 volunteers) will receive
      gp160 (VaxSyn) followed two months later by a repeat dose. Group B (20 volunteers) will
      receive VaxSyn followed two months later by HIVAC-1e. Group C (20 volunteers) will receive
      HIVAC-1e followed two months later by VaxSyn. Group D (10 volunteers) will receive HIVAC-1e
      followed two months later by HIVAC-1e. For volunteers in Groups A, B, and C who do not react
      to the initial vaccination, a second attempt to obtain a reaction may be made 7 or more days
      following the initial inoculation. Per addendum, two additional booster inoculations are
      given: one at 6 months or later post initial inoculation (Groups A, C, and D receive VaxSyn
      and Group B receives HIVAC-1e) and another at 12 months or later (all Groups receive VaxSyn).
