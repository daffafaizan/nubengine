    
      This is a multicenter, prospective, study, evaluating the efficacy of CE versus IC plus MRE
      for detecting active Crohn's Disease (CD) in the small bowel and colon in subjects with known
      CD and mucosal disease.

      A screening visit will be performed within 30 days prior to baseline procedures to assess
      pre-procedure eligibility. At this visit the following assessments will be performed:
      Informed Consent, Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria, Demographics, Montreal Classification,
      Medical History, Previous GI procedures, Surgical history, Laboratory tests and pregnancy
      tests.

      At baseline, subjects with known CD on routine evaluation (e.g. history, physical exams,
      labs) and a recent history of mucosal disease (within the last 2 years and diagnosis based on
      radiologic, endoscopic, or histologic findings) OR subjects with known CD and active disease
      based on clinical judgment based on symptoms, laboratory data or other clinical information
      will undergo Magnetic Resonance Enterography (MRE), Capsule Endoscopy (CE) and
      Ileocolonoscopy (IC), to assess presence or absence of CD across the small and large bowel.
      Also, at baseline the following assessments will take place: Laboratory tests, Pregnancy
      test, Concomitant medications, Patient satisfaction questionnaire and Adverse Events (AE).

      Subjects will be exited from the study once all Baseline Procedures have been completed and
      AEs resolved.

      All CE videos, IC videos and MRE images will be evaluated by central readers.

      The planned number of subjects is 352. Subjects will be enrolled at up to 40 sites in the
      United States, Israel, and Austria. Study duration is expected to be up to approximately 1.5
      years. The expected duration of each subject's participation is approximately 1 month.
