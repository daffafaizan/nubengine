      sufficient effect of medical treatment for erectile dysfunction (tablets or injection
      therapy).

      Each participant will fill out two validated sexual function questionnaires: IIEF-5
      (International Index of Erectile Function), and EHS (Erection Hardness Score).

      Our treatment protocol consists of one treatment sessions per week for 5 wk. The shockwaves
      are delivered to the distal, mid, and proximal penile shaft, and the left and right crura.
      The duration of each LI-ESWT session was about 20min, and each session comprised 500 shocks
      per treatment point (3000 per session) at an energy density of 0.15 mJ/mm2.

      Patients are randomized to active treatment or placebo.By placebo added a blocking membrane
      in the machine, handling is carried out exactly the same way as the active treatment. None of
      the attending staff members will be familiar with who receive active and who receive placebo
      treatment.

      For evaluation, the International index of erectile function (IIEF-5) will be used after 1,
      3- and 6-mo follow-up.
