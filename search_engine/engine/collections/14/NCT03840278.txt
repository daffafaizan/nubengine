      in the insulin-only configuration and the bihormonal configuration with dasiglucagion in 10
      adult subjects (â‰¥ 18 years old) with type 1 diabetes in a random-order crossover study under
      real-world conditions. The study will assess the safety and reliability of both iLet
      configurations. Our primary objective is to assess whether the iLet operates as designed
      comparing the insulin-only configuration of the Gen 3.2 iLet bionic pancreas system with the
      bihormonal configuration of the device using dasiglucagon at a concentration of 4 mg/ml. Our
      secondary objective is to assess the impact of both configurations of the Gen 3.2 iLet bionic
      pancreas system on glycemic control, quality of life, and treatment satisfaction among study
      participants, their caregivers, partners, and/or family members. The study follows a
      2-treatment, 2-period crossover design, 2 and will consist of two 7-day study arms in random
      order: one bihormonal bionic pancreas arm using insulin lispro or insulin aspart and
      dasiglucagon, and one insulin-only bionic pancreas arm using insulin lispro or insulin
      aspart.
