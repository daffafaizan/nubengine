    
      Prospective, multi-center, single-arm, single blinded (Philips hair counter) study in healthy
      women of skin types I up to and including V.

      Safety and efficacy of hair removal with the Investigational Philips IPL-device will be
      investigated.

      In-clinic, each study subject will undergo twelve IPL-treatments at four areas bilaterally
      (face, axilla, bikini line, and legs) with an investigational IPL device applied by a device
      operator.

      Hair re-growth in four body areas, face, axillae, bikini line and leg will be evaluated
      separately.

      After the 4 bi-weekly treatments, one follow-up visit will be organized. After the completion
      of full treatment cycle (12 treatments), subjects will be followed for 1 and 3 months
      (short-term follow-up) and for 6, 9 and 12 months (long-term follow up).
