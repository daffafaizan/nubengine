      dietary magnesium intake and blood pressure. Except for blood pressure, magnesium may also
      beneficially affect other cardiovascular risk markers. Whether all these effects translate
      into improved vascular function is not known. Different vascular function markers at various
      stages on the pathway between diet and disease exist. One of these markers, vascular
      stiffness, is closely related to the process of atherosclerosis, an independent
      cardiovascular risk factor, and predictive of future cardiovascular events and mortality. A
      recently published intervention study showed that oral magnesium citrate supplementation of
      350 mg per day for 24 weeks was well-tolerated and improved vascular stiffness by 1.0 m/s.
      Importantly, it was not established whether the beneficial effect on vascular stiffness was
      due to the supplementation of magnesium or due to citrate. This may involve effects on gut
      microbiota and systemic metabolic effects. The current study was designed to (1) reproduce
      the result of the earlier study and to (2) investigate whether there is a difference between
      different commonly used magnesium salts (magnesium citrate, magnesium sulphate and magnesium
      oxide) in terms of effects on vascular stiffness, blood pressure and gut microbiota.
