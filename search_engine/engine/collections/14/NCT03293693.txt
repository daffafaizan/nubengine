      containing low (0.5 g / 100 g of product), medium (3.5 g / 100 g of product) and high (8 g /
      100 g product) amount of beta -glucans, respectively. The test meals are in the form of
      cereals. All participants will eat the three test meals three constitutive days with 2 weeks
      apart. At day four, the participants will perform a postprandial glucose test (OGTT, 75 g
      glucose in 150 ml water) at Oslo and Akershus University College. Blood samples will be taken
      before and at different time points after glucose test.

      At the screening visit the participants will be asked to limit the intake of dietary fiber
      from grains two weeks prior to the baseline visit (0) and during the study. Otherwise,
      participants will be asked not to change their diet and exercise habits during the study
      period.

      At the baseline visit (visit 0) an OGTT will be performed. OGTT will also be performed at
      visit 1, 3 and 5 after intake of low, medium and high beta-glucan, respectively.

      The participants will receive the test meals at visit 1, 2 and 4.
