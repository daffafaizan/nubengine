      underwent COH with 150 IU rFSH as starting dose, we separated them in 3 groups (n:30 each):
      Groups 1 and 2 received a 0.25mg daily dose of GnRH antagonist when a follicle 14mm in
      diameter was observed. hCG 250g was given to group 1 while group 2 received triptorelin 0.2mg
      when leading two follicles were 17mm. Group 3 was stimulated with standard long protocol, hCG
      was given following similar criteria.

      Blood was collected the day of hCG/aGnRH administration as well as the day of egg retrieval,
      and follicular fluid from the first two mature follicles was also frozen. We collected
      granulosa cells (GC) of 10 patients of each group as well Levels of VEGF, sVE-Cadherin an
      Angiopietin 2 were determined by ELISA in serum and in follicular fluid.

      Results were analyzed via ANOVA.Data are expressed as meanÂ± SEM. A significant difference was
      defined as p< 0.05.
