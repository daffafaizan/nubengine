      taking medication will be twice-randomized: first to active neurofeedback (n=26) vs. sham
      neurofeedback (n=13), and simultaneously to 2 vs. 3 times a week treatment frequency (at
      least 18 in each frequency, 12 active and 6 sham) for 40 treatments. At treatment 24, major
      assessments will include measures of satisfaction and blinding, and subjects will be given
      the option of switching to the opposite treatment frequency for the remaining 16 treatments
      to generate a practical measure of schedule palatability. Major assessments (at baseline,
      treatment 12, treatment 24, treatment 40, and follow-up) will include measures of symptoms,
      functional impairment, academic performance/achievement, and neuropsychological tests of
      attention, vigilance, and executive functioning. Every 3 treatments parents will rate ADHD
      symptoms and every 6 treatments teachers will rate, to track the response curve over time.
      Baseline EEG arousal and ADHD subtype will be examined as possible moderators. By determining
      the optimal frequency and number of treatments and demonstrating feasibility of double
      blinding, this pilot study should pave the way for a definitive large RCT of neurofeedback.
