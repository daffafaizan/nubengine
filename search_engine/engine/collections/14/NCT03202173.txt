      in comparison to the gold standard of histopathological examination, as well as developed an
      easy-to-use and straightforward scoring system for the identification of NPC on the basis of
      morphological and architectural criteria in order to enable a valid and reproducible CLE
      assessment even for non-experts in their daily clinical practice.
