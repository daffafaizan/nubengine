      clinical, pathological, molecular data and treatment parameters of lung cancer patients
      (NSCLC and SCLC) who are referred to a tertiary Oncology Clinic. Documentation will include:
      a) Patient demographics, co- morbidities, tobacco exposure in pack-years, b) Disease related
      parameters: method of diagnosis, histological type, disease staging (according to 7th edition
      of TNM for lung cancer) and metastatic sites if any, c) Molecular status: mutation status for
      Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR), Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK), Proto-oncogene
      tyrosine-protein kinase ROS, Hepatocyte Growth Factor Receptor (HGFRor cMET), Human Epidermal
      Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2), proto-oncogene B-Raf, and Programmed-Death Ligand 1 (PD-L1)
      testing when available, d) Type of treatment (surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, targeted
      therapies, immune-therapy), and Line of treatment (neo-adjuvant, adjuvant, 1st, 2nd, 3rd,
      palliation therapy), e) Clinical outcome: Overall Survival (OS), Response Rate (RR), and
      Progression Free Survival (PFS).
