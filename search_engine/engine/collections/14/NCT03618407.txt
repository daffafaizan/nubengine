      and harmful factors, but frequent severe coughing has a serious impact on the patient's work,
      life and social activities. Upper respiratory tract viral infection is a common cause of
      coughing. Many patients have a long duration of cough after suffering from flu. Cough can
      last for several weeks, and most often have irritating dry cough or a small amount of white
      mucus sputum. This type of cough is also often referred to as "subacute cough" or
      "post-infection cough." The mechanisms that cause this cough have not been fully elucidated,
      and the effect of conventional treatment is not good, and chest imaging has no obvious
      abnormalities. The use of large amounts of antibiotics is ineffective or ineffective.
      Antihistamine H1 receptor antagonists and central antitussives are often only effective or
      ineffective in the short term. The effects of various bronchodilators and even hormone drugs
      are not clear. Due to the poor efficacy of multiple treatments, patients are repeatedly
      subjected to various tests, which not only increases the pain but also aggravates the
      economic burden.

      Therefore, it is necessary to further clarify the causes and treatment measures of
      post-influenza cough patients.
