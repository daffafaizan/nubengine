      aspergillosis or mucormycosis who received treatment with at least one dose of isavuconazole
      in the hospital setting.

      Patients will be recruited in approximately 20 sites across 5 countries in Europe. Patients
      will be followed from isavuconazole initiation (index event) until six-months post-index
      treatment discontinuation, death, loss to follow-up, or 31 December, 2019, whichever occurs
      first.

      De-identified data on patient demographics, disease characteristics, treatment effectiveness,
      safety outcomes, isavuconazole treatment patterns, and HCRU will be collected from patient
      medical records and entered into an electronic data capture (EDC) system by site staff.
      Follow-up data will include details of treatment over time and clinical, radiological,
      mycological, and healthcare resource utilization outcomes. As this study is retrospective,
      information pertaining to patient care will already be documented in patient medical records
      at the time of chart abstraction.
