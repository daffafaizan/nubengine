      quality of life following prostatectomy by asking you direct questions, collect information
      from medical records and phone interviews.

      Information about your prostate cancer treatment, and related health concerns, and
      information regarding the cost of care, may also be collected from your medical record, other
      medical center sources, and your primary care provider (PCP). Clinical information will be
      collected: prior to beginning treatment (prostatectomy); 6 month, 12 months, 18 months, and
      24 months after your prostatectomy; once a year thereafter for possibly up to 12 years.

      You will be asked to take part in six telephone interviews regarding quality of life,
      possible therapy side effects, and satisfaction with prostate cancer therapy. Each phone
      interview should last 15-25 minutes. All questions are voluntary. The phone interviews will
      be conducted: prior to beginning treatment (prostatectomy); 2 months, 6 months, 12 months, 18
      months, and 24 months after prostatectomy; 10 additional phone interviews may be conducted
      (once a year thereafter, for possibly up to 12 years).
