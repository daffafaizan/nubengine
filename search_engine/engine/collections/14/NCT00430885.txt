      disease. The project deals with unresolved issues in the intersection between cardiology,
      immunology and molecular biology.

      IVIG/placebo will be given as an induction therapy for 5 days and thereafter as monthly
      infusions for 5 months. Change in left ventricular remodeling will be assessed at baseline,
      and 6 and 12 months with MRI and echocardiography.

      The objectives are:

        1. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effect on IVIG on LV remodeling
           and function: LV remodeling will be evaluated with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
           which offers an unsurpassed precision in the measurements of heart volumes and function.
           End points will be LV-end systolic and diastolic volume (LVESV, LVEDV), regional wall
           motion score index (WMSI), and LV-ejection fraction (LV-EF).

        2. The secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the effect on IVIG on the
           myocardial marker B-Type Natriuretic Peptide (BNP). BNP is a sensitive marker of the
           degree of HF besides being a prognostic indicator 18-20.

        3. The tertiary objective of this study is to evaluate the effect on IVIG on:

           a. Quality of life. b. Effect on New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class. c.
           Effect on immunological variables. i. Inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha, IL-6,
           IL-18. ii. Anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10 and transforming growth factor beta
           iii. Chemokines such as monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, IL-8 and CCL21. iv.
           Regulators of hypertrophy such as matrix metalloproteinases, their endogenous inhibitors
           (i.e., TIMPs) and procollagen III N-terminal.

           d. Effect on neurohormones. e. Withdrawals. f. Side effects.
