      of the revised algorithm in increasing ART initiation, compared to standard care, among
      non-pregnant adult patients. Six hundred HIV-infected adult patients not yet on ART will be
      enrolled during a routine clinic visit and randomized to receive the intervention or standard
      care. Patients in the intervention arm will be administered a revised version of the SLATE
      screens, including the TB add-on; those found eligible under the algorithm will be offered
      immediate treatment initiation, while those who are not eligible will be referred for
      standard clinic care. Patients in the standard arm will be referred for ART initiation under
      standard clinic procedures. All care after the initial visit will be by the clinic under
      standard care. Primary outcomes will be ART initiation within 7 days of study enrollment and
      viral suppression within 8 months of study enrollment.

      The study is being conducted at three healthcare facilities (clinics) in South Africa. In
      September 2017, the South African National Department of Health instructed all clinics to
      offer same-day ART initiation to eligible patients but provided little guidance on
      determining eligibility. SLATE II will help to create such guidance. If successful, it will
      improve on the SLATE approach to collecting and interpreting a minimum set of patient data
      that will avoid delaying treatment initiation for the majority of patients who are eligible
      for immediate ART, while deferring initiation in the minority who should not start
      immediately.
