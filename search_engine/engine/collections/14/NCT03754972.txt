      consented to surgical treatment consisting of either decompression alone or decompression
      plus fusion will be invited to participate in the study. The initial surgical plan will be
      recorded prior to reviewing the sagittal plane shear index (SPSI). The sagittal plane shear
      index will be calculated flexion-extension radiographs. The measurements required to
      calculate SPSI will be obtained using previously validated methods. SPSI greater than 2
      indicates that the translation-per-degree of rotation (TPDR) is above the upper limit of the
      95% confidence interval observed in several hundred asymptomatic and radiographically normal
      individuals. SPSI will be reported to the surgeon after recording the pre-SPSI surgical plan.
      The surgeon will then decide whether to change the surgical plan. For example, if the initial
      surgical plan was to only decompress a level, and SPSI is greater than 2, the surgeon may
      plan to add fusion to the decompression. Conversely, if the initial plan was decompression
      plus fusion, and the SPSI indicates that the level is objectively stable, the post-SPSI plan
      may be to only decompress the level. The proportion of surgical plans that change after
      reviewing the SPSI report will be determined. If the proportion of surgical plans that change
      is greater than 15%, further research will be undertaken to explore whether deciding, based
      on objective measurement of spinal stability, whether to add fusion to decompression of a
      stenotic lumbar level will have a significant effect on clinical outcomes.
