      radiographic fusion) of Vivigen (cellular allograft product) and rhBMP-2 in patients who
      undergo a single level lumbar instrumented fusion. Specifically, when compared to their
      control group counterparts treated to rhBMP-2, we hypothesize that the intervention group
      administered Vivigen would, following surgery, experience:

        1. Comparable mean postoperative leg/back pain score, where the pain scores are obtained
           using the numeric rating scale of 0-no pain, to 10-worst pain possible

        2. Comparable inpatient length of stay (LOS)

        3. Comparable postoperative Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) score (0-no disability, to
           100-maximum disability possible), two weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year
           postoperatively

        4. Comparable fusion rates, evaluated via CT scan I year postoperatively
