      interactions between human, vector and environmental factors. A community-based study carried
      out between 1999 and 2001 showed that regular forest activity was a strong risk factor for
      malaria infection. Untreated bednets had a significantly protecting effect for villagers,
      except for those regularly sleeping in the forest, who suffered a significantly higher number
      of clinical attacks. Thus, there is need to target this high-risk group with new intervention
      based on long-lasting insecticidal materials. Hammocks are extensively used by people working
      in the forest, therefore long-lasting insecticidal hammocks (LLIH) could achieve a good
      individual protection.

      The Investigators proposed to evaluate their effectiveness in a community-based trial,
      comparing them to the standard vector control methods (insecticide-treated nets): communities
      have been grouped into clusters of about 1000 Ã®nhabitants, and clusters were randomized to
      either the active intervention or the active control, and followed up for 24 month.
