      patients are diagnosed as extensive. The median survival time of the disease is only 9 to 10
      months, and the 2-year survival rate is less than 10%. Fluzoparib is an oral potent,
      selective poly-ADP ribose polymerase-1 (PARP-1) and PARP-2 inhibitor. Apatinib is an oral
      selective vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) inhibitor.This open-label, dose
      finding phase Ib trial studies the tolerability and the best dose of fluzoparib in
      combination with apatinib as second-line treatment of patients with extensive stage small
      cell lung cancer. The safety and efficacy of fluzoparib in combination with apatinib will be
      explored.
