      into 2 sequential cohorts. Cohort 1 will be conducted in 12 patients at a single center. For
      each patient, there will be up to 4 sequential phases: a screening phase of up to 6 weeks, an
      open-label treatment phase of up to 4 weeks, an optional open-label treatment phase of up to
      1 week, and a follow-up phase of up to 1 week (if applicable). Cohort 2 will be conducted in
      20 patients and will be a multicenter, double-blind (neither physician nor patient knows the
      treatment that the patient receives), randomized (the study drug is assigned by chance),
      placebo-controlled (an inactive substance that is compared with a drug to test whether the
      drug has a real effect in a clinical trial) design. For each patient, there will be up to 4
      sequential phases: a screening phase of up to 6 weeks, a double-blind treatment phase of up
      to 4 weeks, an optional open-label treatment phase of up to 1 week, and a follow-up phase of
      up to 1 week (if applicable). The total study duration for each patient will be maximally
      about 12 weeks. Participant safety will be monitored throughout the study.
