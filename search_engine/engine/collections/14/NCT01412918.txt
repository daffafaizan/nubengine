    
      Up to 50 million Americans have tinnitus on a regular basis with between 2-3 million
      suffering from tinnitus where it affects daily living. The Inhibitor™ Tinnitus Masking Device
      is a new tinnitus treatment device recently available in the United States for use of
      temporary relief of tinnitus. The device emits an ultra high frequency sound for 60 seconds
      via bone conduction when applied to the mastoid. Patients reporting tinnitus will be provided
      the opportunity to demonstrate the device to observe any changes in their tinnitus. The
      device may be demonstrated up to 5 times. The investigators will be recording the the degree
      and duration of change in tinnitus perception following treatment with the Inhibitor™
      Tinnitus Masking Device. Patients may provide a genetic sample (typically via saliva sample)
      to look for expression of a particular genetic marker that may be associated with tinnitus.
      The investigators will be collect samples from both people with tinnitus and those without
      tinnitus to use as a control.
