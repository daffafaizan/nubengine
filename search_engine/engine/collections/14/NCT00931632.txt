    
      Multi-center, double blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial. Infants who meet
      all enrollment criteria at any point during days 5 to 14 after birth will be randomized to
      inhaled NO starting at 20 ppm, or matching placebo, by means of a blinded INOventÂ® delivery
      device. All infants will receive 24 days of therapy, following a dose reduction schedule.
      Infants who are extubated before 24 days will continue therapy via nasal continuous positive
      airway pressure (CPAP) or nasal cannula to complete 24 days' of therapy. The primary outcome
      measure will be survival without BPD at 36 weeks gestational age using a physiologic
      assessment of BPD.
