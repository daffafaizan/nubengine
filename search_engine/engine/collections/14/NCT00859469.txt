    
      Oxaliplatin (ELOXATIN®) is an organoplatinum complex which exerts its cytotoxic effect
      chiefly through inhibition of tumoral DNA synthesis and repair, leading to cellular
      apoptosis. The antiproliferative activity of oxaliplatin has been shown to approximate that
      of cisplatin or carboplatin in different tumor types.

      This is a phase II clinical trial of Oxaliplatin (ELOXATIN®) plus gemcitabine as first or
      secondline chemotherapy for patients with malignant pleural or peritoneal mesothelioma. This
      study aims to determine the objective tumor response rate for Oxaliplatin plus gemcitabine
      given every 14 days in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma and/or malignant
      peritoneal mesothelioma who have no more than one prior chemotherapy regimen. A total of 29
      patients are expected to be enrolled in the study, each with a participation duration of 6
      months.

      Patients will be screened using standard health care assessments and tests. All of these
      tests must be done within 4 weeks before patients begin treatment. Patients who are deemed
      eligible will start the treatment cycle, defined as an interval of 14 days, and comprising of
      treatment with Gemcitabine followed immediately by Oxaliplatin. The study drugs will be
      administered in the following manner: Gemcitabine, at 1000 mg/m² IV infusion over 90 minutes,
      then Oxaliplatin, at 100 mg/m² IV infusion over 2 hours.

      In the absence of specific indications for discontinuation of study drugs, patients will
      routinely be offered 6 cycles of therapy. Further cycles may be given if in the opinion of
      the investigator this is in the patient's best interest.
