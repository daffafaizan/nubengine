      the long-term safety, long-term effectiveness, and survival rate in subjects implanted with
      the remedē System from the remedē System Pivotal Trial. Only subjects who were implanted and
      actively being followed as part of the remedē System Pivotal Trial are eligible. An
      individual subject's participation is expected to continue to five years post remedē System
      implant.
