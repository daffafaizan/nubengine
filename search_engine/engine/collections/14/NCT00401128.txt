        -  Determine the response rate in patients with epithelial (clear or nonclear cell) renal
           cell carcinoma (RCC) treated with gemcitabine hydrochloride and irinotecan
           hydrochloride.

        -  Compare the response in patients with clear cell RCC vs nonclear cell RCC treated with
           this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxicities of this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

      Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes and irinotecan hydrochloride IV
      over 90 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for at least 6 courses in
      the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
