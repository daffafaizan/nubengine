      primary amyloidosis following treatment with myeloablative chemotherapy and hematopoietic
      stem cell reconstitution. II. Evaluate the toxicity of high dose melphalan in this patient
      population.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously daily beginning on day 1 of the
      peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) collection period and continuing until PBSC collection is
      completed. PBSC are collected beginning on day 5 of the collection period and continuing
      until the final target cell count is reached or for up to a maximum of 7 collections. If
      sufficient PBSCs are not harvested within a maximum of 7 collections, the patient is removed
      from the study. Within 30 days of PBSC collection, patients receive melphalan IV on day -1 of
      the infusion period and PBSC infusion on day 0. The infusion period continues until day 30.
      Patients receive G-CSF subcutaneously daily starting on day 1 and continuing until blood
      counts recover. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 3 months for 3
      additional years, and yearly thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 33 patients will be accrued for this study over 2 years.
