    
      This is a phase 2, randomized, active-controlled, double-blinded, multi-site study to assess
      the safety and immunogenicity of BioThrax (Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed) and AV7909 (Anthrax
      Vaccine Adsorbed plus CPG 7909 adjuvant) using a post-exposure prophylaxis dosing regimen in
      adults ≥ 66 years of age in stable health. The safety and immunogenicity profile of BioThrax
      and AV7909 in adults ≥ 66 years of age will also be compared to the safety and immunogenicity
      profile of subjects 18-50 years of age in stable health. The main study goal is to determine
      optimal dosing for AV7909 in the elderly population. Subjects will receive either 3 doses of
      BioThrax, 3 doses of AV7909, or 2 doses of AV7909 and 1 dose of placebo. Doses will be
      administered approximately 14 days apart. Subjects will be followed for safety assessment for
      12 months following the last dose. The expected study duration is approximately 14 months per
      subject.
