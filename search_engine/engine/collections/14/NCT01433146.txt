    
      120 prospective patients, with non-metastatic colorectal cancer, will be evaluated with
      questionnaires and auto-questionnaires in order to assess temperament, anxiety and
      depression. The immunity status will be assessed by a blood sample with the aim to evaluate
      cell-mediated immunity.

      Survivall will be related to level of anxiety/temperament/depression and cell-mediated
      immunity.

      Univariate and multivariate model analisys will be performed in order to evaluate if
      anxiety/temperament/depression and cell-mediated immunity can be considered as prognostic
      factors.
