      genetically-defined HeFH. Once recruited, participants will be asked to complete web-based
      questionnaires on diet, medication and lifestyle. They will thereafter complete a clinical
      assessment at the Clinical Investigation Unit of the NUTRISS-INAF Research Centre. Study
      staff will measure participants' height, weight, and waist circumference. Participants' blood
      pressure will be measured using an automatic blood pressure monitor (BP Thru, Omron) after
      sitting quietly for 10 minutes. Three sequential readings will be taken with three minutes
      between readings. Fasting blood samples (10 mL) will be collected from an antecubital vein.
      Body composition will be assessed with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Finally,
      participants will be asked to provide the full list of medication they are using, including
      type, dose and duration of use. Later on the same day, participants will undergo the
      non-contrast CT scan at the Quebec Heart and Lung Institute. Multidetector CT scans without
      contrast will be performed using a 256 slices helical scanner (Brilliance iCT, Philips).
