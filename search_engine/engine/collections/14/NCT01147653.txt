      through stroke, hypoxic insult or hemorrhage. Currently available treatments for patients
      with cerebral palsy are supportive, but not curative. Umbilical cord blood (UCB) has been
      shown to lessen the clinical and radiographic impact of hypoxic brain injury and stroke in
      animal models. UCB also engrafts and differentiates in brain, facilitating neural cell
      repair, in animal models and human patients with inborn errors of metabolism undergoing
      allogeneic, unrelated donor UCB transplantation. We hypothesize that, in the setting of brain
      injury, infusion of autologous UCB will facilitate neural cell repair resulting in improved
      function in pediatric patients with cerebral palsy.
