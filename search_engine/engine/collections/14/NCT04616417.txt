      oocyte cryopreservation methods for fertility preservation in women with a potential medical
      or non medical risk of loss of fertility. Women wishing to preserve their oocytes using
      cryopreservation will be informed of the risk and limitations of the procedures involved in
      ovarian hyperstimulation, oocyte recovery, cryopreservation and subsequent viability after
      warming. Women who consent to the procedure will undergo standard controlled ovarian
      hyperstimulation (COH) and oocyte retrieval procedures currently in use for IVF. Following
      harvest all eggs obtained will be evaluated for degree of fragmentation and maturation
      status. The oocytes will be cryopreserved using kits of media and devices currently approved
      for use in the vitrification of fertilized eggs and embryos, and the cryopreserved oocytes
      will be stored for future patient use in a long term storage facility in Minnesota (Reprotech
      Ltd.). Patients with stored oocytes will be contacted annually to determine the outcome of
      any oocyte warming procedures (oocyte thawing, fertilization and embryo transfer).

      We will obtain a structured fertility focused quality of life questionnaire (FertiQol) and
      survey to assess one year after harvest the impact of the process. We will compare cancer
      patients to those patients undergoing oocyte cryopreservation for non-medical reasons
