      I. To assess safety of the combination and identification of the recommended dose (RD) for
      combination therapy. (Phase I) II. To evaluate preliminary efficacy and tolerability of the
      combination RD of regorafenib and pembrolizumab. (Phase II)

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. The associations between biomarkers and clinical outcome will be investigated.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of regorafenib followed by a phase II
      study.

      Participants receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 and
      regorafenib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-14. Courses repeat every 21 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up periodically.
