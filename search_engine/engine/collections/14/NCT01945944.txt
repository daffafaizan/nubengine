      hours survived to PICU discharge, while 100% of children mechanically ventilated for < 96
      hours survived to PICU discharge. Interventions that decrease duration of mechanical
      ventilation may improve outcome by limiting ventilator-induced lung injury, sedative
      medication usage and ventilator-associated pneumonia. Obstructive airway secretions may
      prolong mechanical ventilation by causing atelectasis and endotracheal tube obstruction, with
      resultant cardio-respiratory instability. Nebulized hypertonic saline (HTS) is used to
      decrease mucus viscosity and increase mucociliary clearance in patients with diseases such as
      cystic fibrosis and bronchiolitis, and has been used to enhance airway clearance in
      mechanically ventilated children. Administering nebulized HTS to mechanically ventilated
      children may facilitate airway clearance and shorten mechanical ventilation.

      In a randomized study of children < 2 years old following cardiac surgery, patients given
      dornase, another mucolytic agent, had a significantly decreased duration of mechanical
      ventilation versus those given saline placebo (52 hrs vs. 82 hrs). HTS may be even more
      effective, as mechanically ventilated newborns with persistent atelectasis had more
      improvement in radiographic findings and oxygen saturation when randomized to receive
      hypertonic saline compared to those randomized to receive dornase. This may be because
      dornase may only be effective in patients with leukocytes or bacterial present in tracheal
      aspirates, while HTS may be effective in all ventilated patients. Further study of the impact
      of prophylactic mucolytic therapy on the duration of mechanical ventilation in children is
      warranted.
