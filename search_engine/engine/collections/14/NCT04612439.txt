      devices in the diagnosis of breast cancer puncture. The purpose of the secondary study was to
      analyze the difference between the underestimation rate, false negative rate, sensitivity,
      and negative predictive value of the two devices, the consistency of the immunohistochemistry
      between the puncture pathology and surgical pathology of the two groups of patients, the
      number and time-consuming of the puncture acquisition specimens, and the two biopsies
      Differences in the incidence of complications (safety).

      If the biopsy device is a vacuum-assisted Elite 10G needle, insert the needle groove into the
      mass and rotate to cut the biopsy tissue one circle; If the biopsy device is a BARD 14G
      hollow core needle, insert the needle to the edge of the mass and pull the trigger in
      different directions to eject the needle to retrieve the material.
