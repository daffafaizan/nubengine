      recurrent abortion ectopic pregnancy and preterm delivery . The experience gained from oocyte
      donation shows that these women are pregnant less, even with the transfer of good quality
      embryos. The hypothesis of this poor uterine receptivity is in the poor endometrial
      vascularization that can decrease embryo implantation. The reason for infertility in women
      with AM includes decreased muscle mass, decreased endometrial vascularization, decreased
      capacity of the endometrial cavity, less receptive areas (septum). The lower fertility
      observed in some women with MÃ¼llerian malformations has been partially explained by its tubal
      factor and its association with endometriosis, with a higher prevalence in them, compared to
      patients without malformations.

      Studies have confirmed an irregular differentiation and estrogenic maturation of the
      endometrium lining the uterine septum or its internal structure, which has less presence of
      connective tissue and more muscle mass. Given the confusion generated if the unfavorable
      reproductive result is due to oocyte quality or endometrial receptivity, it is necessary to
      use a model that guarantees oocyte / embryo quality and this is offered by oocyte donation.
      The aim is to evaluate the implantation rate in women with MA who receive donated oocytes
      compared to women without MA.
