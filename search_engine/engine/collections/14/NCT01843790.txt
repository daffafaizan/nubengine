      adverse outcomes (de Boer et. al., 2011, Dang et. al., 2012, Fernandes Bertocchi et. al.,
      2008, Henderson et. al., 2008). Animal models with genetic knockout of galectin-3 demonstrate
      a reduction in structural and functional deficits in the kidney (Dang et. al., 2012,
      Fernandes Bertocchi et. al., 2008, Henderson et. al., 2008). GCS-100 is a galectin- 3
      antagonist that has been shown to reduce fibrosis pre-clinically. Based on the role of
      galectin-3 and fibrosis in kidney disease, the Sponsor believes GCS-100 may be effective at
      treating patients with CKD.
