      proper interpulse interval in healthy individuals between the peripheral nerve stimulus and
      the cortical stimulus is known to be "latency-5ms." However, this may be different in
      individuals with stroke.

      Specific Aim: what is the optimal interpulse interval to achieve the maximum inhibitory
      effect in the nonstroke hemisphere?

      We will recruit three subjects with chronic stroke. Electroencephalography (EEG) will be used
      to determine the latency between the peripheral nerve stimulus and the sensory evoked
      potential in each subject. We will then assess the following IPIs on each subject in a random
      order: "latency" - 3ms, -5ms and -7ms. There will be a fourth condition of "latency" + 100ms
      (known to have no effect) to be used as a control. The washout period will be at least one
      week between each of these conditions.

      The optimal IPI will be determined from these tests by comparing single pulse transcranial
      magnetic stimulation (TMS) measures for cortical excitability. Prior to each treatment, each
      subject will receive 20 single pulse cortical stimuli to serve as pretest data. The post
      tests for each condition will consist of 20 single pulse cortical stimuli at 0, 5, 10, 15,
      30, 45 and 60 minutes after the PAS condition. Data analysis will consist of a single-subject
      analysis with the two standard deviation bandwidth method of each post-test compared to
      pre-test.

      We hypothesize that there will be no adverse advents and that this optimal IPI will be
      "latency"-5ms.
