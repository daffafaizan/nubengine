      future liver remnant (FLR). A non-reversible absorbable material is generally used for
      embolization, as it provides effective, permanent vascular occlusion. Our team has developed
      a minimally invasive technique of reversible PVE using gelfoam powder. The aim of this study
      is to assess the tolerance and efficiency of preoperative reversible selective PVE in
      patients requiring major hepatic resection. We hypothesize that preoperative reversible PVE
      allows to similarly increase FLR volume in comparison with classical non-reversible PVE in
      patients requiring major liver resection with limited FLR.

      The hypertrophy ratio after classical non-reversible PVE is evaluated in literature as 13%.
      We estimated the hypertrophy ratio after reversible PVE as 9% in a previous retrospective
      study.

      The aim of this pilot study is to prospectively evaluate the hypertrophy ratio after
      reversible PVE.

      Primary End Point: Hypertrophy ratio of FLR volume / total liver volume between the baseline
      and after PVE, assessed by computed tomography scan volumetry 4-6 weeks after PVE.
