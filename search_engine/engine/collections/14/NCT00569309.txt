    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Assess immune reconstitution as measured by response to pneumococcal polyvalent vaccine,
           NK-cell activity against autologous lymphoblastoid cell lines, and cytomegalovirus and
           Epstein-Barr virus tetramer responses in patients who have undergone autologous
           hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for high-risk lymphoma or multiple myeloma.

      Secondary

        -  Assess the absolute number of circulating regulatory T-cells and the function of these
           cells as measured by their expression of TGFÎ² and interleukin-10 (IL-10).

        -  Evaluate the effect of conditioning therapy on quality of life, including functional
           status, fatigue, and depression, in these patients.

        -  Correlate quality of life with inflammatory cytokine production of peripheral blood
           monocytes at specified time points.

        -  Provide baseline immune reconstitution and quality of life pilot data for comparison in
           future post-transplant immunotherapy trials.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive pneumococcal polyvalent vaccine intramuscularly once in weeks 9,
      17, and 25 after autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

      Blood samples are collected periodically for correlative and immunological studies.

      Quality of life (QOL) is assessed periodically using the QOL short form (SF-36, 4-week
      version), the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale (CES-D), and the
      Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory (MFSI-30).
