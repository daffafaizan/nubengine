    
      We propose a cross-sectional study among 150 women in the United States who have used
      Internet dating sites in the past year in order to examine risk factors for high-risk HPV
      infections in 18-24 year old online daters, and evaluate strategies for transporting and
      storing self-collected samples for HPV testing. We will ask participants to complete a
      written questionnaire on their health, sexual behavior, and attitudes toward self-collecting
      vaginal swabs, HPV vaccination, and cervical cancer screening. Also, we will ask the women to
      self-collect two sequential vaginal swab samples that will be transported and stored
      according to the two strategies described above. Each sample will be tested for type-specific
      HPV DNA using a PCR-based assay.
