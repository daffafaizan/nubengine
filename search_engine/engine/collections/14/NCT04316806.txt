    
      Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is a functional gastrointestinal disease in which recurrent
      abdominal pain is associated with defecation or a change in bowel habits. Disordered bowel
      habits are typically present (ie, constipation, diarrhea, or a mix of constipation and
      diarrhea), as are symptoms of abdominal bloating/distention.

      IBS pathophysiology is multifactorial and may include alterations of the gut microbiota, food
      intolerances and Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO). However, SIBO is a distinct
      entity than IBS, as patients can present SIBO without IBS. SIBO is diagnosed based on
      objective tests (breath test or microbial culture of duodenal aspirate) while IBS is a
      functional syndrome, diagnosed on symptoms (Rome-IV criteria).

      A probiotic formula composed of strains Pediococcus acidilactici CECT 7483 and Lactobacillus
      plantarum CECT 7484 and CECT 7485 was previously shown to improve quality of life in patients
      with IBS.

      Rifaximin is a a non-absorbable antibiotic commonly used for the treatment of SIBO.
