      reconstruction with or without tibial tubercle transfer. Follow-ups were performed at 12 and
      24 months postoperatively, and computed tomography (CT) was performed immediately after the
      operation and at follow-up. The knee function was evaluated preoperatively and at 2 years
      postoperatively using Lysholm,Tegner and Kujala scales. Redislocation or multiple episodes of
      patellar instability were considered failures.
