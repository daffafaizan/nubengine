      common mental disorders cause substantial disability and undermine individuals' ability to
      adhere to antiretroviral therapy, leading to poor antiretroviral therapy outcomes.

      A recent cluster-randomized controlled trial from Harare, Zimbabwe showed that the friendship
      bench intervention (i.e. six sessions of problem-solving therapy delivered by lay health
      workers followed by a peer support group) effectively reduced symptoms of common mental
      disorders, but the effect of the intervention on antiretroviral therapy outcomes and its
      effectiveness in the rural setting has not been studied.

      To examine the effect of the friendship bench intervention on antiretroviral therapy outcomes
      and symptoms of common mental disorders among adults living with HIV and common mental
      disorders in rural Zimbabwe, a cluster-randomized trial is conducted.
