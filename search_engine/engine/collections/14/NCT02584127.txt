      cognitive-behavioral smoking cessation program, was developed using community-based
      participatory research principles.

      A randomized controlled trial was used to evaluate whether participants were more likely to
      complete the program and quit smoking at 6-month follow-up with additional reinforcement
      including financial incentives for program completion and interim surveys.
