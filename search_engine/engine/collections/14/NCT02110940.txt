    
      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disorder characterized by generalized
      joints inflammation. With increasing investigation on the pathology, the treatment focus on
      the conditions shifted from a musculoskeletal point of view to a systemic approach. The
      awareness of holistic treatment was also increased.

      Latest studies have found out the neurogenic inflammatory mechanism played an important role
      in the inflammatory process of RA, the pathological changes of neural tissues in RA were also
      noted.

      This clinical trial is the first study to apply neurodynamic mobilization, a nervous system
      specific therapeutic exercise, on patients with RA. Objective of the study is to find out the
      effect of neurodynamic mobilization for joint inflammation in patients with RA.
