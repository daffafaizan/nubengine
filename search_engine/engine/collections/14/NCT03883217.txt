      in one day) plus an additional day for screening and another for follow-up (7 days total).
      All visits will occur at the Virginia Commonwealth University Parkinson's Movement and
      Disorders Center in Richmond, VA. Participants will be asked to walk for a brief period of
      time while wearing the PDVibe2. The PDVibe2 will provide vibration therapy and study staff
      will measure the number of "freezes" before, during and after therapy. Participants will be
      asked to provide feedback on the device, the therapy session and how they are feeling.
