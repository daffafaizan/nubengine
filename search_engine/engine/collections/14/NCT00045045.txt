        -  Assess the ability of fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission tomography to predict
           relapse requiring adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with high-risk stage I
           non-seminomatous or mixed seminoma/non-seminomatous germ cell tumor of the testis who
           are on current management protocols.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive fludeoxyglucose F 18 (FDG) IV followed 1 hour later by positron emission
      tomography (PET) imaging. Patients with metastatic disease identified by FDG PET imaging may
      receive adjuvant chemotherapy according to the standard clinical practice at each
      participating center. Patients with no metastatic disease identified by FDG PET imaging are
      considered for entry into the MRC-TE08 trial (randomized trial of 2 CT scan frequencies in
      the surveillance of stage I teratoma) or are followed according to the standard surveillance
      schedule.

      Patients with metastatic disease are followed every 6 months. Patients with no metastatic
      disease are followed monthly for 1 year, every 2 months for 1 year, every 3 months for 1
      year, and then every 4-6 months thereafter.
