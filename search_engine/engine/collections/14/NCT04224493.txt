    
      Stage 1 is a safety run-in phase, stage 2 is an efficacy and safety phase for an assessment
      of the EZH2 Mutant Type population and overall FL population regardless of EZH2 mutation
      status, and optional stage 3 with efficacy and safety phase for subjects with EZH2 mutation.
      Stage 3 with Mutant Type population alone will be executed in case the efficacy of the
      overall population in stage 2 fails whilst the efficacy of EZH2 Mutant Type is sufficiently
      promising. Stage 2 will include 2 futility interim analyses based on ORR for the first
      futility and PFS for the second one. In addition, there is a possible sample size
      re-estimation based on PFS. This is to ensure early detection of the presence/absence of
      clinical efficacy benefit as well as ensuring adequate powering based on the trial results to
      demonstrate a meaningful efficacy difference.
