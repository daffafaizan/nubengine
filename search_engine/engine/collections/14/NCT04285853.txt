      must revisit pain management protocols to reduce unnecessary opioid prescriptions. The
      long-term goal is to reduce opioid use and residual opioids in circulation. The purposes are
      to 1) conduct a double-blinded randomized controlled trial to determine the effectiveness of
      opioid versus non-opioid medications on post-surgical pain, and 2) examine predictors of
      opioid usage in individuals following Anterior Cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction.
      Patients will use an innovative Smartphone application to track pain and medication usage.
      Additionally, patients will complete quality of life and pain catastrophizing questionnaires,
      as well as undergo pain threshold testing, to be used in a model to determine predictors of
      greater post-surgical opioid use. This study will provide information on non-opioid
      alternatives and specific predictors of post-surgical opioid use that can be used to develop
      prescribing protocols. These findings will help orthopaedic surgeons make informed decisions
      when tailoring individualized prescriptions for patients following ACL reconstruction.
      Importantly, findings will be readily translatable into research to reduce opioid use in
      other orthopaedic surgical cohorts as well. Our ultimate goal is to lessen the burden of the
      opioid epidemic on not only our orthopaedic patients, but also society, by minimizing the
      number of opioids left in circulation.
