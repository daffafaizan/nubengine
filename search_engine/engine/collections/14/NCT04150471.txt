      and the 3 month molecular test date (2nd). The molecular samples will be analyzed in the
      central lab as part of the screening procedure.

      Subjects will be treated for a maximum of 60 months after allocation of the last subject on
      the assigned regimen (dasatinib 80mg QD), unless disease progression, treatment failure or
      unacceptable toxicity occurs, the subject withdraws consent, or the study is discontinued by
      the sponsor. Subjects who discontinue study therapy early due to disease progression or
      intolerance to study medication will continue to be followed yearly for survival for up to 5
      years after allocation of the last subject. All subjects will be followed yearly for
      progression-free survival and overall survival.

      For patients who continue their assigned treatment, safety assessments will be conducted
      every 6 months and cytogenetic assessment as investigator assessment.

      Follow up visits after the last dose of study drug will be required at least every 4 weeks
      until all study related toxicities resolve to baseline (or CTC Grade â‰¤ 1), stabilize or are
      deemed irreversible.
