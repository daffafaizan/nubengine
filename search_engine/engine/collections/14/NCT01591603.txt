      than or equal to 5 centimeters past the tip of the Tuohy needle. The major rational for this
      practice is to reduce dislodgement. However, the greater the distance that a catheter is
      advanced, the greater the risk of contacting undesired structures, kinking, looping and
      knotting. For the continuous popliteal nerve block, the catheter is threaded perpendicular to
      the course of the nerve. This could result in the tip of the catheter being a significant
      distance from the targeted nerve which may lead to a decrease in the success rate or efficacy
      of the block.

      Greater efficacy may be seen if the needle is closer to its target. This may be quantified by
      documenting a faster onset of motor and sensory changes and/or a lower catheter infusion rate
      required to maintain pain control. The study will investigate the difference in success rate
      between popliteal peripheral nerve catheters placed at 1 centimeter compared to 5 centimeters
      past the tip of a Tuohy needle.
