    
      This is a Multicentre, prospective, single (assessor) blind randomised study. The primary
      objective of the study is to assess volume reduction in the treatment of lymphoedematous legs
      with an advanced PCD compared to a simple PCD in patients with lower limb lymphoedema. The
      main outcome is the percentage volume reduction of the affected limb at end of treatment
      compared to baseline.

      Secondary objectives of the study are Assessment of safety Quality of life Health economic
      parameters

      In total 262 patients with leg lymphoedema will be enrolled into the study. Patients eligible
      for the study are those who suffer from late stage II and stage III according to the
      International Society of Lymphology lymphoedema staging. Lymphoedematous legs can be of
      primary or secondary origin and uni or bilaterally affected. Medical history will be taken at
      baseline.

      Patients will be taught how to use the device they have been randomised to. Visits will then
      take place at weeks 1,4,8,12 and 24 weeks. The device will be used for up to 60 minutes each
      day on the trial limb. At each visit sequential circumferences of the affected and unaffected
      limbs will be measured with a tape measure.

      All adverse events will be documented. At beginning and end of study quality of life
      questionnaires and health economic information will be completed by the patients.

      At the Derby site assessment of tissue quality will be made using ultrasound and moisture
      meter to assess tissue fluid.
