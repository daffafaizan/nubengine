      evaluating the antitumor efficacy and tolerability of exemestane in treating adult
      post-menopausal women with recurrent or refractory, stage II-IV, epithelial ovarian cancer.

      To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of exemestane in this population, patients will be
      enrolled at a single site, namely the Ottawa Regional Cancer Center. Patients selected
      according to the criteria outlined will receive exemestane (25 mg/day given orally once
      daily) until disease progression or until study withdrawal. These patients will be treated on
      an out-patient basis. There is no specific wash-out time required for patients who have
      previously received either cis or carboplatinum; however, this previous therapy must stop
      upon patient inclusion into this trial. In 1st stage if less than 2/15 patients achieve a
      response then study will be terminated. In 2nd stage if greater than 7/28 patients achieve a
      response then no further investigation of the drug is warranted.

      Treatment (including drug dosages) A commercial supply of exemestane (Aromasin) will be
      provided. The medication will be administered by the patient at home (25 mg taken orally once
      daily until disease progression) The medication should be taken each day after a meal at the
      same time of the day. There are no patient diaries and no need for the patient to record the
      time of administration.
