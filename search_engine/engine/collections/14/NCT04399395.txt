      patients with suboptimal weight loss or weight regain after bariatric surgery. The primary
      endpoint is body weight.

      Objective The study objective is to understand whether patients with suboptimal weight loss
      or weight regain 2 years or more following bariatric surgery achieve better weight loss with
      Mysimba and dietary counselling compared with a control group treated with dietary
      counselling alone.

      This is a phase IV, open label randomized controlled study conducted over 7 months with a
      3-month post-intervention follow-up. The study will be conducted in accordance with good
      clinical practice. Patients meeting eligibility criteria will be randomized into one of two
      groups: an intervention group treated with Mysimba and lifestyle and a control group treated
      with lifestyle. The intervention group will be prescribed Mysimba gradually titrated to the
      maximum tolerated dose (maximum dose is 32 mg/360 mg divided in 4 tablets) with 2 week
      intervals. Both groups will receive the same follow up including dietary counselling during
      the course of the study. Randomization will be done using a standard internet-based program
      where group assignment cannot be anticipated. The study is not blinded.
