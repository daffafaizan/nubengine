      however when given at higher than required doses, it may induce baroreceptor-mediated
      bradycardia with a consequent reduction in maternal cardiac output. Although α agonist drugs
      are the most appropriate agents to treat or prevent hypotension following spinal anaesthesia,
      those with a small amount of β agonist activity may have the best profile (noradrenaline
      (norepinephrine) and metaraminol. Phenylephrine is currently recommended due to the amount of
      supporting data.Noradrenaline is the primary catecholamine released by postganglionic
      adrenergic nerves. It is a potent α adrenergic agonist, with comparatively modest β agonist
      activity.
