      bone (from another site on your body) to replace missing bone in your jaw. INFUSE速 Bone Graft
      is commercially available and is made up of 2 parts - recombinant human Bone Morphogenetic
      Protein-2 (rhBMP 2) placed on an absorbable collagen sponge (ACS). The rhBMP-2 is a
      genetically altered protein which recruits bone-forming cells to the surgical area and
      changes local cells to bone. ACS is made from Type I collagen from bovine (cattle) tendon. It
      helps to hold the rhBMP-2 in place and acts as a support for the growing bone. The sponge
      itself will reabsorb in time as the new bone forms.

      The purpose of this research study is to determine whether this study treatment can improve
      the bone structure of the upper front part of the jaw so that a dental implant can later be
      inserted. This post-market study has been designed to further evaluate the effectiveness and
      safety of INFUSE速 Bone Graft, along with space holding devices, in a 2-part procedure. Your
      dental implants will be placed at approximately 6 months after the INFUSE速 Bone Graft
      implant.
