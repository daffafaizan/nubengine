      and the latter has seen its use grow in reproductive pathology.

      G -CSF, a true center pivot, would act concurrently on oocyte quality and endometrial
      receptivity, improving:

        -  Immune tolerance

        -  The self-healing of oocyte chromosome abnormalities

        -  The adherence of the embryo

      The injection of G-CSF molecule has been used in different circumstances. One of its uses,
      among others, is to help rebuild the immune system in patients undergoing chemotherapy. Some
      studies have been conducted in patients having embryo implantation problems; they have
      demonstrated improved rates of pregnancy and childbirth after treatment.
