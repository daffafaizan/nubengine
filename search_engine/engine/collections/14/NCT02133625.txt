           I, Cycle 1, days 1-28, pioglitazone will be administered once daily. On cycle 1, day 8,
           the first dose of carboplatin will be administered. On cycle 2, day 1, both carboplatin
           and pioglitazone will be administered. Cycles 2 and onward are 21-day cycles, with
           pioglitazone administered once daily and carboplatin administered once every 3 weeks.
           Part I of the study will end when the MTD has been determined in a minimum of 6
           patients.

        -  In Part II of the trial, an MTD Expansion Cohort may be utilized to further characterize
           the safety profile and pharmacodynamics of the drug. Patients in the MTD Expansion
           Cohort will receive carboplatin alone on cycle 1, day 1. Over days 15-21 of the cycle
           pioglitazone will be administered alone. On cycle 2, day 1, both carboplatin and
           pioglitazone will be administered.

      Cycle 2 and onward are 21-day cycles, with pioglitazone administered once daily and
      carboplatin administered once every 3 weeks.
