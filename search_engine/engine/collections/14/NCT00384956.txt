      hematopoiesis. The only known curative treatment for patients with MDS is allogeneic stem
      cell transplantation. However, only a minority of patients are candidates for this aggressive
      therapy. DNA hypomethylation agents have been shown to have activity in this disorder and are
      postulated to work by reversing this epigenetic mechanism of gene-silencing. Recently,
      5-azacitidine, administered subcutaneously for seven days, received approval by the FDA for
      the therapy of MDS based on a randomized trial which demonstrated a diminished risk of
      leukemic transformation and improved survival when compared to best supportive care.

      The subcutaneous route of administration can present challenges to implementing this therapy.
      In the CALGB studies 8921 and 9221, approximately 23% of patients had significant injection
      site pain. Moreover, 35 % of patients had injection site bruising which can be extensive in
      thrombocytopenic patients. Due to limitations on drug concentration and administration
      volumes for subcutaneous dosing, patients often need to have two or three injections at
      separate sites each day to meet target dosing. In addition, the schedule of administration is
      inconvenient in an outpatient setting secondary to the need to schedule administrations over
      weekends. Therefore, there is great interest in pursuing an abbreviated intravenous route for
      administration of the drug.
