      1) Epidemiological risk factors; 2) Natural history (including immunological mechanisms and
      long term effects) and 3) Support of infection prevention. Also, the study focuses solely on
      children.

      Children (0-18 years of age) admitted to hospital with suspected COVID-19 are eligible (Fig.
      1). Those with confirmed COVID-19 serve as cases, whereas those with non-COVID-19 serve as
      controls; both groups will be followed prospectively for 6 months. Three objectives/Work
      Packages (WPs) are defined:

        -  In WP1, the investigators will investigate risk factors for severe outcome of the acute
           infection; potential risk factors include sex, age, comorbidities, initial clinical
           findings, infectious load, and genetic markers.

        -  In WP2, the investigators will investigate the immunological response to acute
           infection, focusing on initial innate host response and its associations to inflammatory
           enhancement, genetic factors and clinical course.

        -  In WP3, the investigators will investigate the prevalence and risk factors of
           long-lasting complication, in particular the development of post-infectious chronic
           fatigue
