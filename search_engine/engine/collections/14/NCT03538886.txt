      involving a pLAD lesion should be treated to optimize long-term survival and quality of life.

      According to recent European guidelines, significant pLAD disease may be treated by PCI or by
      CABG. This recommendation is based on two meta-analyses including 1.210 and 1.952 randomized
      and non-randomized patients. Generally, the patients were followed for 4-5 years. The
      analyses reported similar rates of mortality, MI and stroke, but more repeat
      revascularizations after PCI. Only one study including129 patients provided more than 5-year
      follow-up. Thus, the there is limited documentation for long-term effect of PCI vs. surgical
      re-vascularization in pLAD disease.

      The American 2014 Guidelines on coronary revascularization recommends CABG for improved
      survival in patients with solitary proximal LAD stenosis. CABG

      The angiographic 90% LIMA patency rate after 1, 2 and 3 decades is well described and
      suggestive of a survival benefit of surgical revascularization.

      Therefore, there is scientific background for an CABG LIMA-to-LAD vs. PCI comparison in 1-VD
      patients with a pLAD lesion.

      Substantiated expectations:

        -  PCI is superior to bypass operation concerning short-term quality of life.

        -  Off-pump LIMA-to-LAD is superior to PCI concerning long-term all-cause mortality.

        -  Long-term (â‰¥10-year) follow-up is essential to evaluate coronary revascularization
           strategies.

        -  Outcome may be dependent on lesion complexity, diabetes and gender.
