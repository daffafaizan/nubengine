      intended to reduce waiting times for antenatal care. The study will include one intervention
      health clinic and one control clinic in Maputo, Mozambique. In the intervention facility
      women attending antenatal care will be informed that if they return at their scheduled date
      and time they will be seen within one hour by clinic staff rather than having to wait for an
      indefinite amount of time before being seen for care. Appointment cards will be clipped into
      ANC cards, which collect routine health data and are kept by women at the end of their ANC
      visit. Health facility staff will be trained to identify women who return at their scheduled
      time and to manage patient flow such that scheduled women are received quickly. After the
      start date of the intervention, all women attending ANC at the health facility will be
      provided a scheduled return date and time window. Baseline and endline exit interview surveys
      will be conducted in both intervention and control facilities to compare changes in waiting
      time, number of ANC visits, and provider satisfaction over the course the study period
      between clinics.
