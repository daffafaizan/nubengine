      volume interact in patients with heart failure and how measuring blood volume and vein
      capacity may help us develop better ways of treating and managing heart failure patients.
      This study will use two tests to measure blood volume and test the capacity of your veins and
      arteries in your limbs.

      The blood volume test (also called a plasma volume test or a red cell mass test) is a
      standard clinical nuclear lab procedure used to measure the volume (amount) of blood in the
      body. The test also measures the volume of plasma and of red cells in the blood.

      The other test is called a venous plethysmography, which is a non-invasive test to measure
      how well your veins and arteries in your forearm and calf work. Venous plethysmography
      measures the changes in the dimensions of your limbs by the use of strain gauges placed on
      the skin.
