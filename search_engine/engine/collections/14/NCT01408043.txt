      I. To determine whether the addition of plerixafor improves the proportion of patients with
      lymphoma who collect >= 8 x 10^6 cluster of differentiation (CD)34+ cells/kg within two days
      by 25% compared to the historical estimate of 42% with etoposide and G-CSF (filgrastim).

      II. To determine whether patients achieving collection of >= 8 x 10^6 CD34+ cells/kg have a
      15% one year survival advantage relative to the historical estimate of 68% among patients
      mobilizing >= 2 but < 8 x 10^6 CD34+ cells/kg with etoposide and G-CSF.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To demonstrate that patients receiving >= 8 x 10^6 CD34+ cells/kg have more rapid
      neutrophil and platelet recovery and earlier hospital discharge than those receiving < 8 x
      10^6 CD 34+ cells/kg.

      II. To compare overall survival and progression-free survival between patients receiving >= 8
      x 10^6 CD34+ cells/kg and those receiving < 8 x 10^6 CD34+ cells/kg.

      III. To compare number of days of apheresis required to achieve goal, transfusion
      requirements, hospitalization costs, need for remobilization between groups.

      IV. To evaluate whether peripheral CD34+ cell count correlates with graft content of CD34+
      cells.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive etoposide intravenously (IV) over 4 hours on day 0, filgrastim
      subcutaneously (SC) once daily (QD) beginning day 1, and plerixafor SC 15-18 hours prior to
      apheresis. Patients unable to achieve target collection of >= 8 x 10^6 CD34+ cells/kg receive
      another dose of plerixafor followed by apheresis. Following the second apheresis, patients
      achieving =< 2 x 10^6 CD34+ cells/kg may continue filgrastim with plerixafor and continue
      collection according to the attending physician.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 28 days and then for at
      least 1 year.
