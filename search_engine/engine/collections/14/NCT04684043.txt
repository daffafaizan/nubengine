      Investigators will incorporate all known registries to the POST-PCI FLOW registry by
      requesting data from principal investigator of each registry.

      Investigators will perform systemic review of the previous published data and an updated
      patient-level meta-analysis of studies, including the most recent publications. PubMed,
      EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, the United States National Institutes
      of Health registry of clinical trials, and relevant websites were searched for pertinent
      published studies. The electronic search strategy was complemented by manual examination of
      references cited by included articles, recent reviews, editorials, and meta-analyses. No
      restrictions were imposed on language, study period, or sample size. Searching key words
      included 'post', 'after', 'PCI', 'Percutaneous coronary intervention', 'coronary stenting',
      'stenting', 'stent', 'stent implantation', 'FFR', and 'fractional flow reserve'.
