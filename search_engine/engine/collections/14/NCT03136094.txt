      Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to treatment (SBIRT), carried out through the
      primary care setting, to detect and manage suicide risk. This approach is multilevel,
      targeting both the healthcare system and the individual, and links screening to existing
      mobile phone technologies shown to promote resilience and to tap the protective benefits of
      social connectedness. This Collaborative Hub will conduct a randomized control trial that
      compares the effectiveness of enhancing these SBIRT programs by sending caring text messages
      to reduce suicidal ideation, attempts, and hospitalizations, and to increase engagement,
      social connectedness, and resilience. The Investigators' long-term goal is to disseminate and
      translate the lessons learned into practical policy, organizational changes, and preventive
      innovations that optimize patient-centered health outcomes and ultimately reduce or eliminate
      the dramatic and tragic suicide-related health disparities among urban AI/AN youth and young
      adults.
