    
      This is a randomized, open-label study designed to assess the effects of sipuleucel-T when
      administered concurrently or sequentially with enzalutamide. This study consists of 3 phases.
      The screening phase will begin at the completion of the informed consent process and continue
      through registration. The active phase will begin at registration and continue through the
      post-treatment visit (30 to 37 days following the last study treatment). The long term
      follow-up (LTFU) phase will begin after the post-treatment visit and will continue until the
      subject's death or until Dendreon terminates the study.
