      open-label treatment extension phase if they: a) were originally randomized to the vorinostat
      arm and have not experienced disease progression; b) were randomized to the placebo arm and
      meet the "Extension Phase Inclusion Criteria for Participants in the Placebo Arm" below; or
      c) were originally randomized to the vorinostat arm and discontinued study therapy for
      reasons other than progression and the investigator believes that it is in the participant's
      best interest to resume vorinostat treatment.

      As specified by the protocol, based on planned extension phase inclusion criteria and
      pre-specified primary outcome analyses requirements, the extension phase of this study was
      not conducted.
