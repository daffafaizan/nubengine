      infection is caused by microorganisms that invade the pulp via dental caries or dental
      trauma. In these mixed population infections, anaerobic bacteria have been reported to be
      conspicuously dominant and the number of microorganisms per canal may vary. Traditionally,
      the endodontic microbiome has been identified by culture-based (phenotype-based) techniques.
      Inability to cultivate approximately 40-55% of bacteria in the endodontic microbiome, bias or
      inexperience of researchers may limit the results of cultural research. Microbiome-based new
      generation sequencing (NGS), which was initially used in ecological studies, has been widely
      used in recent years to identify bacterial diversity using the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene
      in endodontic infections microbiome, bias or inexperience of researchers may limit the
      results of cultural research. There are few studies investigating the endodontic microbiome
      in primary teeth. However, to the best of our knowledge, to date, there is no metagenomic
      study that investigates the endodontic microbiome of the primary and permanent teeth. It is a
      still question of whether there is a difference in the endodontic microbiomes during the
      mixed dentition period when both dentition types can be seen.
