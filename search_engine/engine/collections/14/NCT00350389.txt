      increased rates of falls in older people (Lord et al 2002).

      Study Aim: To determine whether the provision of supplementary plain distance glasses for
      outdoor use to older users multifocal glasses will reduce falls rates over a 12 month period.

      Study Design: A randomised controlled assessor-blinded trial with two parallel groups in 580
      participants. Study inclusion criteria are: outdoor use of multifocal glasses 3 or more times
      per week, community-dwelling persons aged 65+ years with a recent fall OR persons aged 80+
      years regardless of falls history, Folstein Mini Mental score of 24+, and adequate visual
      contrast sensitivity (Melbourne Edge Test score of 16+dB). All participants will receive an
      optometry assessment and updated multifocal glasses (if required) at baseline. Intervention
      group subjects will receive a pair of plain distance glasses and counselling for their use in
      predominantly outdoor situations. Control group participants will use their multifocal
      glasses in their usual manner. Falls rates and compliance with the intervention will be
      recorded on monthly falls diaries returned by the participants.
