      UVB-induced dry eye symptoms. This study further investigated its efficacy in human dry eye
      status by randomized, double-blinded tests, including dry eye questionnaires, blood tests,
      salivary tests, tear volume test, intra-ocular pressure assessments, ocular surface
      photography, corneal fluorescein stain, tear film breakup time test, fundus photography, and
      cornea impression cytology. All tests were performed again after 3 months of dietary
      supplement of either samples or placebo. A total of 97 participants completed the trial. The
      data were analyzed by paired-t test and compared between the placebo and the experimental
      groups.
