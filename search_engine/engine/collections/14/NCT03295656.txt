      for possible appendicitis frequently leads to imaging studies. Magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) are currently the gold-standard techniques for the
      diagnosis or exclusion of acute appendicitis. However, these methods not always immediately
      available; may require administration of intravenous contrast material with the potential for
      allergic reactions and nephrotoxicity; and, in the case of CT, requires the administration of
      ionizing radiation that is linked to the long-term development of radiation-induced cancers.
      The current study will evaluate a potentially safer, radiation-free diagnostic method for
      acute appendicitis, using contrast-enhanced ultrasound to provide a more accurate means of
      visualizing the appendix than conventional US imaging.
