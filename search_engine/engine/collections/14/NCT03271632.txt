    
      Multiple myeloma (MM) is a malignancy of plasma cells, which remains a clinical challenge
      despite advanced therapeutic interventions including novel molecular therapies and stem cell
      transplantation (SCT). This trial is to test the safety and efficacy of T cells genetically
      modified to specifically target several MM surface antigens, including BCMA, CD38, CD56,
      CD138 or alternative MM surface antigens, based on a multi-CAR T cell immunotherapy approach.
      Another goal of the study is to investigate the persistence and function of CAR T cells in
      the body after CAR T cell infusion.
