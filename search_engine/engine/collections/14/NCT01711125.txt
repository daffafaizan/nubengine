    
      This is a double-blind randomised placebo-controlled study investigating the efficacy of
      baclofen for the treatment of alcohol dependence in patients with alcoholic liver disease.
      Medications will be given for 12 weeks, with a further 6 months follow-up. Both male and
      female participants will be recruited to this study. Trial patients will be randomised to one
      of three treatment groups: (1) baclofen 30mg/day (10 mg t.i.d), (2) baclofen 75mg/day (25 mg
      t.i.d) or (3) Placebo (3 matched tabs/day).

      This study will also include a second, parallel group of patients with alcohol dependence
      (non alcoholic-liver disease patients) that will undergo the trial protocol as described
      above. These patients will be randomised according to a separate list into one of three
      treatment groups: (1) baclofen 30mg/day (10 mg t.i.d), (2) baclofen 75mg/day (25 mg t.i.d) or
      (3) Placebo (3 matched tabs/day).
