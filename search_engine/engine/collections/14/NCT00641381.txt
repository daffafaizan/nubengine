      Primary

        -  To evaluate the feasibility and toxicity of high-dose chemotherapy comprising
           carmustine, etoposide, and cyclophosphamide followed by autologous stem cell infusion in
           patients with HIV-associated lymphoma receiving combination anti-HIV therapy and to
           determine the efficiency of stem cell collection from these patients.

        -  To estimate the disease-free and overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  To evaluate HIV viral load, CD+4/CD+8 counts, and immune recovery after high-dose anti-
           lymphoma chemotherapy.

        -  To determine the pharmacokinetics of high-dose etoposide in patients receiving highly
           active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART).

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo leukapheresis to obtain peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) for
      transplantation. At least 5 days later, patients with an adequate number of collected cells
      proceed to high-dose chemotherapy.

        -  High-dose chemotherapy: Patients receive carmustine IV over 4 hours on days -7 to -5,
           etoposide IV over 4 hours on day -4, and cyclophosphamide IV on day -2.

        -  Autologous PBSC transplantation: Patients receive PBSC infusion on day 0. Patients
           undergo blood sample collection periodically for pharmacokinetic studies of etoposide.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at approximately 30 days and 100
      days, every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 1 year, and then annually thereafter.
