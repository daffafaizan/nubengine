      normal activities. Many options are available for postoperative pain relief following tooth
      extraction including systemic analgesic, intra-alveolar socket dressing medicaments, and
      follow the postoperative instructions; the choice of the medication determined by drug
      availability, chance of side effect of some drugs and financial considerations. The use of
      intra-alveolar dressing materials is widely suggested in the literature such as AlvogylÂ® that
      used as palliative treatment which includes eugenol (analgesic, anti-inflammatory), iodoform
      (antimicrobial), and butamen (anesthetic). Absorbable gelatin sponges contain haemostatic
      material and may be used for local application in surgical procedures where traditional
      haemostasis is difficult. In addition to its haemostatic effect, an absorbable gelatin sponge
      can be used as a drug reservoir to provide sustained release of drugs

      The aim of this study is to measure the pain intensity after using socket dressing materials
      following tooth extraction.
