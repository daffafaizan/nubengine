      isolation ("trigger") or ablation of high-frequency, fractionated electrograms during AF
      ("substrate"), or a hybrid approach combining trigger and substrate. Both techniques will be
      performed with NavX mapping system and a standardized ablation catheter. Endpoint of PVI will
      be isolation of all four PVs documented by circular catheter. Endpoint for substrate-based
      ablation will be termination and noninducibility of AF. Up to 2 procedures will be allowed
      within 6 months. A 2 month blanking period will be allowed after each procedure during which
      early recurrences will not be counted.

      Outcomes:

        -  Recurrence of atrial fibrillation or other atrial tachycardia at 3, 6, and 12 months
           post-initial procedure.

        -  Recurrence will be defined by symptoms and/or ECG/Holter data showing AF > 2 mins

        -  Occurrence of adverse events in each group post-procedure.

        -  Quality of life assessment at 6 and 12 months post-initial procedure.

      Followup:

        -  3, 6, and 12 months post-initial procedure.

        -  Clinical data, ECG, Holter, loop recorder at baseline and at each visit.

        -  QOL at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months post-initial procedure.
