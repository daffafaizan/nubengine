      STUDY POPULATION: Youth, ages 9-17, with DSM-IV bipolar disorder, who have failed to respond
      to two adequate trials of medication, one with an atypical antipsychotic medication, and the
      second with either a mood stabilizing medication or a second atypical antipsychotic
      medication.

      DESIGN: Medication withdrawal, followed by a 15-day dose stabilization phase and a 6-week
      double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment trial. The first two phases will be completed as
      inpatients or in day treatment, while the third phase can be completed either in those
      settings or as an outpatient. Individuals who received placebo will be offered an 8-week open
      trial of riluzole followed by an additional 4 weeks if they respond, while those who received
      riluzole in the placebo-controlled trial and wish to continue it will receive 4 weeks of open
      treatment. Thus, all patients will have the opportunity to receive a total of 12 weeks of
      riluzole treatment.

      OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical rating scales, including the Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale and
      the Clinical Global Improvement Scale
