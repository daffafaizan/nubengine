    
      Objective: To compare the combination of dopexamine and norepinephrine with epinephrine alone
      on gastric mucosal blood flow (GMBF), hepatic damage and oxidative stress in septic shock.

      Setting: Surgical intensive care unit in a university hospital.

      Design: Prospective, randomized, controlled study on 2 parallel groups.

      Patients: Adults fulfilling usual criteria for septic shock.

      Interventions: Systemic hemodynamics, GMBF (laser-Doppler), plasma α-glutathione
      S-transferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase and malondialdehyde were
      assessed just before catecholamine infusion (T0), as soon as mean arterial pressure (MAP)
      reached 70-80 mmHg (T1), and 2 (T2) and 6 (T3) hours after T1. Drugs were titrated from 0.2
      µg/kg/min with 0.2 µg/kg/min increments every 3 min for epinephrine and norepinephrine, and
      from 0.5 µg/kg/min with 0.5 µg/kg/min increments every 3 min for dopexamine.
