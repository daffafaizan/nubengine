      of chemotherapy: chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). There are no reliable
      methods for the prevention or the treatment of CIPN. On the basis of the dose-related
      pathophysiology of CIPN, the investigators hypothesize that reducing the delivery of the
      toxic chemotherapeutic agents to the peripheral nerves by reducing blood flow through
      hypothermia may reduce the occurrence of CIPN. The proposed potential treatment method would
      aim to reduce the development of CIPN. This project comprises of a healthy subject trial to
      investigate the best tolerated temperature which will be used in cancer subject trial to
      investigate the safety and tolerability of hypothermia or cryocompression (hypothermia with
      pressure) in the prevention of CIPN in cancer subjects undergoing taxane-based chemotherapy.
