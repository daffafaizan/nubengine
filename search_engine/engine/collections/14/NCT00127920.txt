      tube epithelial cancer, and peritoneal cancer is with maximal "upfront" therapy. This
      involves an optimal primary tumor debulking surgery. The most active chemotherapy agents
      should then be promptly administered. Taxol and Carboplatin or Cisplatin have become the
      standard" first line" therapy because of proven survival benefits with those regimens in
      treating advanced ovarian adenocarcinoma patients. New agents like bevacizumab (Avastin),
      which have demonstrated increased overall and progression free survival benefits in
      metastatic colorectal cancer patients, are being added to the optimal first line ovarian
      chemotherapy regimen in hopes of seeing improvement in progressive free interval and over-all
      survival. Since no triplet regimen has demonstrated compelling superiority, the combination
      of taxol, carboplatin, and bevacizumab (Avastin) is intriguing because of their potential
      synergy, distinct mechanisms of action, and non-overlapping toxicity.
