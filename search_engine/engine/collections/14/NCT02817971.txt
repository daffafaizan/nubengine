      revised recently and in Kenya the national guidelines changed in February 2016. We designed
      an enhanced feedback intervention aimed at improving uptake of the revised pneumonia
      treatment policy within a clinical network of 12 Kenyan county referral hospitals.

      Hospitals were randomized to receive either enhanced feedback (n = 6 hospitals) or standard
      feedback (n = 6 hospitals) delivered over a six-month period following nationwide pneumonia
      treatment policy change. The primary outcome is the proportion of all pneumonia admissions
      (fulfilling criteria for treatment with oral amoxicillin) who are correctly classified and
      treated using new guideline recommendations. The proportion of treatment change from oral
      amoxicillin to alternative antibiotics for pneumonia (considered a proxy measure of treatment
      failure) will be reported as a secondary outcome.
