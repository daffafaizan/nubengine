      to be the unique curative therapy for pancreatic cancer. The pancreaticoduodenectomy is
      widely performed for the patients with pancreatic head cancer in recent decades. The
      lymphadenectomy is an indispensible procedure. In 2014, the International Study Group for
      Pancreatic Surgery (ISGPS) recommended a standard lymphadenectomy should include lymph node
      stations 5, 6, 8a, 12b1, 12b2, 12c, 13a, 13b, 14a, 14b, 17a, and 17b. However, no consensus
      was reached on Lymph node 16 in particular 16b1. There was no stronge evidence available
      concerning the impact on survival.
