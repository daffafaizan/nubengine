      cause of disability and consultation after the cardiovascular diseases in France. For the
      moment, there is no curative treatment for osteoarthritis The main clinical sign of this
      disease is pain and care is based on the treatment of pain and on the improvement of
      functionnal disability. The proposed treatments are mainly based on the use of oral
      analgesics treatments .

      At present, patients report to be insufficiently relieved. New strategies need to be
      developed. The hypothesis is that the use of an innovative medical device, Remedee One, can
      reduce the pain felt by patients, improve their quality of life and reduce the analgesics
      consumption.

      The choice is oriented on the peripheral osteoarthritis and excludes spinal osteoarthritis
      because it's an osteoarthritis always asymptomatic and painless.
