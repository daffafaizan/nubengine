      restricted controlled carbohydrate programs with the American Diabetes Associations' diet on
      glycosylated hemoglobin and other diabetes risk factors in obese adolescents with metabolic
      syndrome, a constellation of symptoms associated with the development of type 2 diabetes and
      cardiovascular disease.

      We plan to address the following issues:

        1. To test the hypothesis that a controlled carbohydrate nutrition plan will be superior to
           the standard ADA diet in controlling blood sugar (as measured by glycosylated hemoglobin
           [HbA1C]), decreasing cardiovascular risk factors (Serum Lipid Levels, Blood Pressure)
           and decreasing weight in adolescents with metabolic syndrome

        2. To evaluate the tolerability of a non-energy restricted very-low carbohydrate diet in
           these patients as measured by the SF-10 for Children, the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI)
           and a scaled questionnaire regarding side effects.

        3. To compare two different maintenance programs in the group who receive the non- energy
           restricted very-low carbohydrate diet and compare each group to the group
