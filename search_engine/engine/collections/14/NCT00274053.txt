    
      This was a multicentre, randomised, double blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled, 9 month
      study. It was designed to determine the effect of inhaled tiotropium treatment on quality of
      life in patients with COPD.

      Following an initial 2-week screening period, patients were randomized to either tiotropium
      or placebo at Visit 2. Patients returned to the clinic at month 3 (Visit 3), 6 (Visit 4), and
      9 (Visit 5) for the conclusion of the trial. The patients received treatment daily for 9
      months.

      Quality of life was measured on each visit by using the Saint george's respiratory
      Questionnaire. Additionally a short form questionnaire was developped for that study (Visual
      Simplified Respiratory Questionnaire). Lung function was also measured at each visit by
      spirometry.

      Study Hypothesis:

      The primary objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of Tiotropium and placebo on
      improving HRQoL evaluated by the percentage of SGRQ responders. The null hypothesis is that
      there is no difference in the effect on HRQoL assessed by the percentage of SGRQ responders
      between the two treatment groups. The alternative hypothesis is that there is a difference in
      effect on HRQoL assessed by the percentage of SGRQ responders between tiotropium and placebo.
      The test will be performed at the alpha = 0.05 level of significance.

      Comparison(s):

      Tiotropium 18 mcg once daily vs Placebo
