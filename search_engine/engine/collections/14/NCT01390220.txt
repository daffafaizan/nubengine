      doses of USL261 (intranasal midazolam 5 mg), separated by 10 minutes, in the absence of
      seizures. Eligible participants were then randomized to USL261 versus Placebo in an
      outpatient Comparative Phase (CP). When the participant had a qualifying seizure cluster
      episode, as described in an individualized patient management plan, the participant's
      caregiver administered the double-blind dose. An open-label USL261 dose could be administered
      after 10 minutes and up to 6 hours after the double-blind dose, if the participant had
      persistent or recurrent seizures. Initial participants could not proceed to CP until an
      independent data safety monitoring board (DSMB) reviewed safety data from at least the first
      25 participants in TDP; the DSMB performed additional safety reviews at pre-set intervals
      based on enrollment.
