      neuropsychiatric disease, quality of life/happiness, stressors/trauma and other psychometric
      measurements using validated questionnaires; Urine drug testing during actual treatment that
      uses comprehensive analysis of reported drugs to determine compliance with prescription
      medications and non-abstinence to illicit drugs; and 4) adjunctive treatment with
      neuroadaptogen amino acid therapy (NAAT), a glutaminergic-dopaminergic optimization
