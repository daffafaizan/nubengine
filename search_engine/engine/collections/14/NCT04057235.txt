    
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical outcomes of patients who have undergone
      a Transforaminal Lumbar Interbody Fusion (TLIF) or Posterior Lumbar Interbody Fusion (PLIF)
      procedure with a FlareHawk expandable interbody fusion cage(s) to assess the device's
      performance and safety when used in accordance with its intended use. The primary hypothesis
      is that study subjects who received the FlareHawk expandable cage(s) through a TLIF or PLIF
      procedure experienced fusion by 12 months (+/- 3 mo) follow-up, with improvements in clinical
      outcomes related to pain and/or disability compared to pre-operative scores. Further, the
      subjects are hypothesized to have not experienced any unforeseen device- or procedure-related
      adverse events.
