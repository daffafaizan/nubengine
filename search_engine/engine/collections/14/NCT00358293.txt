    
      Sublingual tizanidine, a novel test formulation of the known effective antispasticity agent,
      has been shown to have a unique pharmacokinetic profile [(i.e., nearly twice the
      bioavailability/AUC), but with little or no increase in peak plasma levels (Cmax) as compared
      to oral tizanidine (Zanaflex)]. When administered nightly to 20 MS patients, at a dose of 8
      mg, it was shown to improve next-day spasticity (statistically significant improvement in
      Ashworth scores) about 12 hours post-dosing), improvement in nighttime (first quartile) sleep
      efficiency (as demonstrated by actigraphic measurement), and no increase in daytime
      somnolence.

      Current study is being undertaken to evaluate if increased dosing (12 mg once nightly) of
      sublingual tizanidine (vs. oral) will show a concomitant increase in clinical effect, i.e.,
      longer improvement, with next-day spasticity score improvement both in AM (as previously) as
      well as at PM (late afternoon) evaluation, with no increase in daytime somnolence.
