    
      Twenty-four individuals with lower extremity burn injury will be included in this study.
      Participants will be included if they are aged of 18-50, able to walk independently at least
      10 meters.

      Participants will be divided in two groups; Intervention and control groups. Intervention
      group: standart rehabilitation program and gait training on the overground will be applied.

      Conntrol Group:standart rehabilitation program and gait training on the treadmill will be
      applied.

      Rehabilitation program will applied by physiotherapist during the acute hospitalization.
      Standart rehabilitation will include active range of motion exercises, functional mobility,
      balance activities.

      Participants will evaluate with the following assessment tools: Demographic datas; age,
      gender, height, body mass index; burn caharacteristics; type of burn injury, degree of burn
      injury, localization of burn injury and total burn surface area will be recorded. GAITRite
      system for gait parameters (step length, stride length, base support, step time, cycle time,
      cadence, velocity, single support, double support, swing ( % of gait cycle) and stance (% of
      gait cycle), timed up and go test (TUG) for dynamic balance and six minute walk test (6MWT)
      for exercise capacity, will be used. These evaluations will be made twice; initial
      (admission) and final (discharge).
