    
      Study M02-433 was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of adalimumab in the
      maintenance of clinical remission in patients with Crohn's disease (CD). The study consisted
      of 2 phases: 1. a 1-year phase (Week 0 to Week 56) (NCT00055497) that consisted of a
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled portion with a concomitant open label (OL)
      portion, and 2. a long-term open-label extension (OLE) phase (NCT01070303) that lasted 264
      additional weeks (Week 56 to Week 320).

      Participants who completed the lead-in study NCT00055523, were eligible to participate in the
      rollover study, NCT00055497. 176 participants were documented as having completed Year 1
      (NCT00055497); however, 177 participants were still receiving study drug and were evaluated
      at Week 56 of NCT00055497; these participants are included in the OLE data (NCT01070303).

      At Week 4 of NCT00055497, participants who demonstrated clinical remission (defined as a
      Crohn's Disease Activity Index [CDAI] score <150 points) at Baseline of NCT00055497 and who
      remained in clinical remission at Week 4 ("Remitters") were randomized to receive 1 of 3
      blinded treatments: placebo, adalimumab 40 mg every other week (eow), or adalimumab 40 mg
      every week (ew). Participants who did not demonstrate clinical remission at Baseline of
      NCT00055497 or who were no longer in clinical remission at Week 4 of NCT00055497
      ("Non-remitters") were assigned to receive OL adalimumab 40 mg eow. All study drug (placebo
      and active) was administered by subcutaneous (SC) injection.

      At any time during Study NCT00055497, a participant receiving blinded study drug who
      developed a disease flare could be switched to OL adalimumab 40 mg eow. A participant
      receiving OL adalimumab 40 mg SC eow who developed a flare or was a non-responders could have
      had his/her dose increased to 40 mg SC ew.

      After 1 year (Week 56 of NCT00055497), patients who were still participating could continue
      in the OLE phase (NCT01070303). Participants who were receiving blinded study drug were
      switched to OL adalimumab 40 mg SC eow, and participants who were receiving OL study drug
      continued on their previous OL adalimumab dose (adalimumab 40 mg SC eow or ew).

      Data are summarized for Remitters and Non-remitters, with the exception of data for primary
      reason for noncompletion. Summaries of primary reason for noncompletion were available only
      for all participants, not for Remitters and Non-remitters. Data are reported for Weeks 104,
      152, 212, and 260 of Study M02-433, starting from Week 0 of NCT00055497; these weeks
      correspond to 1, 2, 3, and 4 years of participation in NCT01070303. Change from Baseline
      results (clinical response 70, clinical response 100, Inflammatory Bowel Disease
      Questionnaire, and fistula remission) are calculated from Baseline of the lead-in study
      (NCT00055523). Results on each assessment at each measurement time point are presented as
      individual outcome measures because different numbers of participants were evaluated at each
      time point (as observed analysis).
