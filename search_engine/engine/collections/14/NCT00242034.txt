      cervix. Prognostic factors such as T-stage (local extent), tumor size and lymphadenopathy are
      routinely obtained from MRI, however some prognostic parameters can only be obtained
      invasively. Tumor oxygenation correlates with prognosis and response to treatment in patients
      undergoing radiotherapy for carcinoma of the cervix. Interstitial fluid pressure (IFP) has
      been shown to correlate with tumor oxygenation as well. Currently the only way to measure
      these parameters is by using an invasive technique which involves the placement of probes
      into the tumor and obtaining multiple measurements.

      Recent studies have shown that a specific MRI pulse sequences may be able to measure the
      oxygenation in the microcirculation. A second way of assessing the tumor microvasculature and
      perfusion is based on the behavior of intravenous contrast agents routinely used in the MRI
      examination. Estimates of blood volume, and capillary permeability can be made by
      mathematically modeling the kinetics of an MRI contrast agent. Similar measurements can be
      performed with CT.

      A total of 60 patients will be investigated. Additional images will be obtained from these
      patients after their routine MRI examination. One set of images is designed to measure a
      parameter that correlates with tumor oxygen levels. The second set of images will be obtained
      after the injection of intravenous contrast agent. Using mathematical models a number of
      parameters will be extracted and correlated with IFP and tumor oxygen measurements.
