      organ, which form the first line of defense, are more active in childhood than adults,
      especially in the childhood age group, and since it has been scientifically shown that
      patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection in the pediatric age group overcome this disease
      lightly than adults, we aimed to reveal whether the defined tonsil and adenoid tissues are
      the main factors that protect the children's immune system against COVID-19 infection.
