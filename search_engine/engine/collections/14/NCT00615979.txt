      portable ultrasound for diagnosis of various medical and surgical emergencies, ie cardiac
      tamponade, intraabdominal hemorrhage, 2)Extension of our expertise in digital
      echocardiography and local telemedicine to support other centers in such procedures as TEE
      3)development of wireless telemedicine systems for rapid relay of ultrasonic images from
      portable ultrasound system to a remote review station. 4)development of a precision guide for
      diagnostic and therapeutic percutaneous procedures using ultrasound guidance 5)combining
      wireless telemetry with the guided percutaneous access tool to permit remotely guided
      emergency procedures 6)augmenting this work(2D/echo) with 3D/echo.
