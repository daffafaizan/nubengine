    
      A phase I/II multicenter trial will be conducted in patients with medically inoperable with
      peripheral non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) > 5 cm without lymph node involvement (group A)
      or medically with ≥ 2 or more lung metastases (group B). Radiation pneumonitis is expected to
      be dose-limiting in these patients and there is evidence that the incidence is predicted by
      the mean lung dose (MLD). The MLD escalation will be performed separately in both patient
      groups, using a time-to-event continual reassessment method (TITE-CRM). All patients will
      receive 3-5 fractions SBRT to the lung tumor(s), with a minimum mean PTV dose ≥ 42 Gy.
      Fraction size may be downscaled based on the MLD constraint.
