      post-transplant period. Rituximab or an FDA approved by biosimilar including Rituxan®,
      Truxima®, and Ruxience™ is given 48 to 72 hours prior to FT596. The goal of this study is to
      1) establish a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of FT596 when given 30 days after transplant and
      2) to confirm the MTD and safety of giving a single dose of FT596 at Day 7 post-transplant
      starting at one dose level below the MTD identified at Day 30.
