    
      The present observational study is being conducted to assess the safety information from a
      target of 100 Korean subjects with MS treated with Rebif. Various parameters like subjects'
      background (age, sex, BMI), MS history, MS status (MS type, Expanded Disability Status Score
      [EDSS] and others), MS Treatment Concern Questionnaire (MSTCQ), Rebif treatment status,
      concomitant disease modifying agents (DMA) therapy and Rebif related adverse events will be
      collected. Subjects will be followed for 12 months. Proportion of subjects with moderate to
      severe (Grade 3-5) injection site reactions after 3, 6, 12 months of Rebif treatment will be
      determined. Secondary outcomes like annual relapse rate, change in EDSS, changes in MSTCQ,
      time to first relapse and incidence of side effects associated with Rebif therapy will also
      be determined and presented descriptively.

      OBJECTIVES

           non-interventional setting Secondary Objectives

        -  To evaluate subject's satisfaction, clinical data and disease characteristics of the
           population of MS subjects undergoing Rebif treatment.
