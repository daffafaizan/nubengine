      an overall incidence of 30% and a 70% incidence in high-risk patients. PONV yields unplanned
      hospital admission, pulmonary aspiration, esophageal rupture, electrolyte abnormalities,
      dehydration, and delayed discharge from the postanesthesia care unit (PACU). Additional use
      of resources costs the health care industry hundreds of millions of dollars annually. Patient
      satisfaction is greatly improved when PONV is prevented.4 PONV etiology is multifactorial and
      the treatment is multimodal.
