      dexamethasone (VCD) combination is safe and highly effective even in those with renal
      insufficiency (RI) from myeloma. In this study, we seek to improve the efficacy of VCD by
      adding isatuximab in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients undergoing autologous stem
      cell transplant (ASCT) irrespective of renal function.

      The primary objective is to determine if the addition of isatuximab to VCD will increase the
      proportion of subjects achieving very good partial response (VGPR), as defined by the
      International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria and by the time of completion of
      post-ASCT consolidation treatment.
