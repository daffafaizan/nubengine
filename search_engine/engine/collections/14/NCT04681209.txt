    
      This study, conducted over the 2017-2018 and 2018-2019 school years examined whether a
      DRT-based intervention activity resulted in greater increases in defending behaviors in
      response to witnessed bullying than a more traditional, empathy-based activity. Thirteen
      schools were randomly assigned to receive either the DRT-based or empathy-based activity, and
      all fourth-grade and fifth-grade children were invited to participate. Defending behaviors
      were assessed approximately two weeks prior to participation in the activity and at
      three-month and six-month follow-ups. Data collected included peer-reports, teacher-reports,
      and self-reports. Also examined was whether popularity, peer acceptance, prosocial behavior,
      peer victimization, empathy, self-efficacy for defending, moral disengagement, or gender
      moderated intervention effects.
