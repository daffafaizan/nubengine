      disease prevention and treatment of breast cancer in China, the important scientific problems
      in basic research, through in-depth study of skin micro ecological changes in advanced breast
      cancer chemotherapy and its regulatory mechanism, clear skin flora occurred after application
      of capecitabine and the influence and mechanism of the immune response;Finding markers for
      the treatment and prognosis of related diseases;Identify and isolate key strains and/or
      metabolites, and conduct intervention studies to reveal new mechanisms of skin microflora
