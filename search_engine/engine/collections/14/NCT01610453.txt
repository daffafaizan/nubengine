      measured fetal head-perineum distance. Ultrasound measured angle of progression Ultrasound
      assessed position

      Possible confounders Ethnicity, maternal age, gestational age, BMI, induction of labour,
      augmentation, epidural analgesia, birth weight, head circumference

      A two-dimensional ultrasound measurement will be obtained with the ultrasound device
      available in the delivery department. Fetal head descent is measured as the shortest distance
      between the outer bony limit of the fetal skull and the perineum with a curved transabdominal
      transducer placed transperineally between the labia in a transverse view (1).

      The fetal descent will also be assessed measuring "angle of progression" as suggested by
      Barbera et al. The ultrasound transducer will be placed on the perineum in a mid-sagittal
      position between the labia below the pubic symphysis. The angle between a line through the
      symphysis and a line from the posterior part of the symphysis tangentially to the fetal skull
      contour will be measured (2)

      A transabdominal scan will also be performed determining the fetal position as described
      previously. Positions â‰¥ 02.30 and â‰¤ 03.30 hours should be recorded as left occiput transverse
      and positions â‰¥ 08.30 and â‰¤ 09.30 as right occiput transverse. Positions > 03.30 and <08.30
      should be recorded as occiput posterior and positions > 09.30 and < 02.30 as occiput
      anterior.(3).
