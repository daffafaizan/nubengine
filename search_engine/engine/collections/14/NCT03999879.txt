      neurofibrillary tangles) are known. The cause of these deposition of proteins is not. Some
      scientist argue that an increase in oxidative phosphorylation activity and a lack of ability
      to shift to aerobic glycolysis are the underlying source of these changes. The purpose of
      this study is to test whether there is a correlation between neuroenergetic levels of aerobic
      glycolysis/oxidative phosphorylation and risk for Alzheimer's disease. The study will examine
      these neuroenergetic adaptations in a group of 15 elderly participants (age range: 70-85 y/o)
      with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and 30 cognitively normal controls (NL).
      Multimodal (MR/PET) and multinuclear (31P/1H) neuroimaging will allow us to gain access to a
      uniquely comprehensive and highly consistent view of neuroenergetic adaptations in both the
      clinical and preclinical stages of Alzheimer's disease.
