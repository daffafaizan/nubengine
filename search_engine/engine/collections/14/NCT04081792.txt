    
      Trial 1: At enrollment (Day 1), the investigator will prescribe empiric antibiotic treatment
      based on instructions provided in the protocol and determine the most appropriate route of
      administration (oral or IV) according to the patient's condition. Patients will be randomized
      in the ratio 1:1 between 1 versus 4 days for post-amputation soft tissue infections; and
      between 1 versus 3 weeks if there is microbiologically proven residual bone
      infection/contamination in the proximal stump samples of the residual bone.

      Trial 2: At enrollment (Day 1), the investigator will prescribe empiric antibiotic treatment
      based on instructions provided in the protocol and determine the most appropriate route of
      administration (oral or IV) according to the patient's condition. Patients will be randomized
      in the ratio 1:1 between 10 versus 20 days for post-debridement soft tissue infections; and
      between 3 versus 6 weeks for diabetic foot osteomyelitis post.-debridement (without
      amputation).
