      Cocasian. Also, stroke recurrence rate is high in patients with such lesions, despite medical
      treatment. Accoding to the result of WASID (N Engl J Med 2005;352:1305-16), warfarin is not
      recommended because of the concern of safety (higher risk of intracranial hemorrhage and
      death when compared with aspirin), wheras the efficacy of aspirin is not enough in
      symptomatic IAS patients. Under these conditions, we planned to conduct a nationwide
      multi-center, open labelled, randomized controlled trial to compare the effect of aspirin
      plus cilostazol (phosphodiestrase type 3 inhibitor) and aspirin alone on the progression of
      IAS in 200 IAS patients with ischemic stroke after 2 weeks to 6 months of onset. Patients are
      randomly allocated to either of two groups. Aspirin 100mg/day plus cilostazol 200 mg/day is
      given to the 100 patients in one group, and aspirin 100 mg/day alone is given to 100 patients
      in another group.

      Follow-up period is at least two years. The primary endpoint is progression of IAS on MRA at
      two years after randomization. The secondary endpoints are cardiovascular events (ischemic
      stroke, myocardial infarct, and other vascular events), death, serious adverse events, new
      silent brain infarcts, and activity of daily life. The purpose of this study is to establish
      the best medical treatment in symptomatic IAS patients. This study will also provide
      important information for the future randomized controlled study to compare medical treatment
      alone and intravascular intervetnion (PTA and/or stenting) in these patients.
