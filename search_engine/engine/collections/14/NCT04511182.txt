      disability, although reperfusion therapies and pharmacological strategies have been developed
      dramatically. Percutaneous coronary intervention（PCI）can effectively improve the myocardial
      blood supply of patients, However, various degrees of reduced exercise tolerance, anxiety and
      depression symptoms, impaired social function may occur after PCI and then lead to the
      decline of their quality of life. Exercise-based cardiopulmonary rehabilitation, which has
      beneficial effects on physical fitness, quality of life, cardiovascular risk factors and
      clinical outcome, is an important part of secondary prevention for patients after an acute
      myocardial infarction. Despite the evidence of these beneficial effects, cardiac
      rehabilitation programs are still largely underutilized and the exact benefits are still less
      well known. In this study, a randomized, controlled and prospective clinical trial is
      designed for patients with AMI to improve exercise capacity, cardiometabolic parameters, as
      well as quality of life by an individualized, low-cost exercise intervention we developed
      after evaluation by Cardiopulmonary Exercise Tests (CPET) . Serial CPET are performed to
      prospectively measure changes in aerobic exercise capacity, and the MOS item short form
      health survey（SF-36）are constructed to survey life quality. What's more, echocardiography and
      NT-proBNP are also assessed.
