      Hagen Ambrock are asked to join the study. They will be randomly assigned to one of two arms
      [CPAP with Telemonitoring (MTM) or without Telemonitoring (OTM)] for 6 months of home
      treatment after hospital discharge. The MTM arm will receive supporting phone calls when the
      monitored usage time decreases.
