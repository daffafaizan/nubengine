      prospectively estimate the prevalence of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling alterations
      in patients with advanced non-squamous non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or advanced CRC who
      have progressed on anti-VEGF treatment. Additionally, the investigators will make exploratory
      initial observations of the relationship between FGF signaling alterations and the clinical
      activity of dovitinib. This trial is expected to provide key biologic information that will
      inform the clinical development of dovitinib and provide initial evaluation of the analytic
      characteristics of these potential predictive biomarkers of its efficacy.
