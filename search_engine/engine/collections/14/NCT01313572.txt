      However, it produces transient symptoms that are poorly tolerated by most subjects. This is a
      multi-center, randomized double-blind study to compare the tolerability and effectiveness of
      apadenoson to adenosine (AdenoscanÂ®) in SPECT-MPI. Subjects who are clinical candidates for
      SPECT-MPI will be enrolled to undergo two sequential SPECT-MPI studies. The first study will
      use adenosine as the stress agent in approximately 1250 subjects. Eligible subjects will then
      be randomized in a 1:1 assignment ratio to receive a second SPECT-MPI using either adenosine
      or apadenoson as the pharmacologic stress agent, with the goal of obtaining a total of 670
      subjects who complete both studies. The agreement of the results from the two
      adenosine:adenosine stress tests will be compared to that from the adenosine:apadenoson tests
      to assess efficacy. The incidence and intensity of commonly reported side effects will be
      compared to evaluate improved tolerability.
