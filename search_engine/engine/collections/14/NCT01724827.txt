      loss due to the decayed tissue is small, a filling is done by the dentist directly. When the
      substance loss is important, dentists often treat it with a crown, which presents the
      disadvantage of further mutilating the tooth. An intermediate technique consists in
      manufacturing an inlay or an onlay: these restorations become more and more common since they
      are a minimally invasive solution in such cases. Inlays and onlays can be made of metal,
      ceramic or composite. Patients tend to refuse metallic restorations, so that dentists
      generally have to choose between composite and ceramic. Composite wears whereas ceramics
      fracture. Published in vitro studies provide possible answers to which material is most
      effective but very few clinical studies have been conducted to confirm them. Material\'s
      choice for inlay manufacturing is thus more country-based than evidence-based (Most french
      dentists choose composite while US dentists prefer ceramics for example). The main objective
      of this trial is to compare the clinical performance of ceramic and composite inlays/onlays.
      Other objectives include looking for the prognostic factors of these restorations and
      validating the criteria proposed by the World Dental Federation (FDI) to evaluate dental
      restorations.
