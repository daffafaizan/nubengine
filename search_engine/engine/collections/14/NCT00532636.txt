      significantly. Unfortunately, this is in contrast to the willingness of potential rescuers to
      perform mouth-to-mouth ventilation. For example, although healthcare professionals would
      perform mouth-to-mouth ventilation on a 4-year old drowned child in >90% of cases, this
      likelihood would decrease to ~10% in the case of a young male unconscious patient in a San
      Francisco public bus. Possibly, lay rescuers would perform assisted ventilation more often if
      a simple ventilation device were available. However, both the willingness to perform assisted
      ventilation plus the ability to open and to maintain the airway patent are necessary to
      ensure efficient ventilation in an unconscious patient with an unprotected upper airway.

      Since retention of skills after basic life support classes are notoriously low, a
      resuscitation tool should incorporate self-explanatory features to improve applicability, and
      to provide built-in safety. Thus, an option could be to ensure an open airway by the use of a
      built-in indicator within a ventilating device to confirm correct head extension. One
      possible approach may be to determine head positions that make an open airway likely, and
      then extrapolate these angles to a scale that could be integrated into a ventilating device;
      however, safe head extension needs to be determined first to prevent harm. The purpose of
      this study is to determine head position angles reflecting neutral position and maximal
      extension in unconscious supine children in a first step to design a ventilating device to
      optimise ventilation of an unprotected upper airway.
