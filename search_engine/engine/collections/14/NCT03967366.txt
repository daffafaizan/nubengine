      extent of CAC predicts cardiovascular risk. The causes of CAC include dysregulated matrix
      metabolism, epitaxial mineral deposition, inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis.
      Melatonin is the main indoleamine produced by the pineal gland; it is known recently to have
      anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer and antioxidant activities. Several studies have shown that
      melatonin protects against inflammation and apoptosis in vascular calcification. Melatonin
      also inhibits oxidative stress-induced apoptosis and calcification in endplate chondrocytes.
      However, no study has evaluated whether melatonin is associated with CAC in patients with
      coronary atherosclerosis. The investigators planned to research the association between
      plasma melatonin and coronary artery calcification.
