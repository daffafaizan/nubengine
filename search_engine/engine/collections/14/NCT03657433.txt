    
      This is a randomized controlled trial aimed at assessing whether IV Iron administration
      (Ferumoxytol x 2 infusions) is superior to oral ferrous sulfate for the treatment of
      iron-deficiency anemia in pregnancy.

      140 patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio. Patients in the IV Iron group will receive
      two infusions of Ferumoxytol, one week apart. Patients in the oral Ferrous Sulfate group will
      receive medication to take at home during their pregnancy.

      Patients will have iron studies performed at study entry, and again at presentation for
      delivery. Cord blood will also be sampled for iron studies.
