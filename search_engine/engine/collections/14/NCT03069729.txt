      system, a computer-based system for screening thermal video images, designed to detect
      biomarkers of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN). Additionally, severity levels of diabetic
      retinopathy (DR) will be compared with those of DPN.

      All participants in this study will undergo foot exams, thermal imaging of the foot, and
      standard retinal imaging. These non-invasive assessments will be performed at an initial
      study visit. Some of the participants will be offered additional study visits. One of the
      additional visits involves a standard nerve conduction velocity assessment by a neurologist,
      the other involves a DPN exam by a podiatrist.

      Portions of the study take place at University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center (UNM
      HSC). The research utilizes services of the Clinical Translational Science Center (CTSC).

      The study is approved by University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center's Human Research
      Review Committee (HRRC), which coordinates and supports the activities of the three federally
      mandated Human Research Review Committees (HRRCs) responsible for reviewing and approving all
      human research.
