      retinal tissue and retinal pigment epithelium into the eyes of human patients with
      age-related macular degeneration. Vision in the eye to be operated on will be the poorer
      vision of both eyes and must be 20/200 or worse. "Retinal tissue", the layers in the back of
      the eye, consists of neural retina and retinal pigment epithelium. "Neural retina" is the
      nerve cell layer that processes light into vision. The "photoreceptor cells" in the neural
      retina detect the light and transform it into electrical signals, which are then transferred
      to the brain by other retinal cells. "Retinal pigment epithelium" (RPE) is the layer behind
      the neural retina which helps both to nourish the cells of the neural retina and also to get
      rid of waste products. The fetal tissues used in this study will be derived from dead fetuses
      in the first 9-16 weeks of pregnancy obtained from elective abortions.

      Fetal retinal transplantation is highly experimental. The research will be conducted in
      accordance with the prohibitions regarding the use of human fetal tissue described in Public
      Law 103-43, section 498B. There will be no compensation for the donor. The research will be
      conducted in accordance with any applicable Federal, State and local laws.

      First, the technical application of the implantation instrument and its safety in the
      transplantation will be demonstrated in patients with 20/200 vision in one eye or worse, with
      functional acuity in the contra lateral eye.

      Secondly, the human fetal retinal tissue will be placed in the areas beneath the retina where
      presently the patient has atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium and poor retinal
      function.
