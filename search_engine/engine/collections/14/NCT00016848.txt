      suppression of leptin, gonadotropins, sex steroids, thyroid hormones, insulin and insulin
      like growth factors (IGFs) and elevation of growth hormone (GH) and cortisol. Some of these
      effects may be disadvantageous in terms of achieving loss of adipose tissue. There is little
      information on the role of specific macronutrients in the regulation of these important
      endocrine responses to food restriction. The present study aims to determine if dietary
      carbohydrate and/or lipid composition has significant effects on these hormonal regulators of
      body composition and metabolism, independent of total calorie supply. This will be achieved
      by comparing the short-term effects of isocaloric, weight maintenance diets restricted in
      either fat or carbohydrate with a standard balanced diet. Protein contribution as well as
      calorie content will be held constant in the 3 diets. Study subjects will be obese women and
      men (BMI 30-34.9 kg/m2) aged 18-40 years. Major study outcome parameters include: leptin,
      gonadotropin, GH and cortisol secretory dynamics; sex steroid, IGF, fasting insulin and
      glucose levels.
