      individually escalated doses up to 750mg to achieve the skin toxicity grade greater than or
      equal to 2. Patients were started on gefitinib 250mg orally daily for 2 weeks. At 2 weeks,
      patients were reevaluated and given skin toxicity grade according to the National Cancer
      Institute Common Toxicity Criteria version 3.0 (CTC 3.0). Patients with grade 2 or greater
      skin toxicity remained on 250 mg daily; in patients with grade 0-1 skin toxicity the dose was
      escalated to 500 mg daily and again to 750 mg daily on next evaluation until grade 2 or
      greater skin toxicity was developed.

      The protocol was later amended because of the reported lower efficacy of the 250 mg dose and
      patients were then started at 500 mg per day. There was no further dose escalation beyond 750
      mg per day irrespective of the response or grade of skin toxicity. Therapy was discontinued
      upon disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, death or patient's withdrawal of consent.
      Dose interruptions were used as the first approach to managing the toxicity of the patients
      who experienced grade 3-4 non-hematological toxicities. Gefitinib was interrupted for up to a
      maximum of 14 days until the toxicities dropped to grade 1 or less. Adherence to therapy was
      monitored using drug diaries that were collected at each physician visit and assessed against
      pill counts.
