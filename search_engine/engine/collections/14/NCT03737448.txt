    
      The study will assess the PK, tolerability, and safety of oral trimetazidine administered to
      subjects with acute-on-chronic (ACLF) Grades 1 and 2 with liver failure and a range of renal
      function. Subjects will receive up to 60 mg/day for 28 days.

      Two groups of subjects will be enrolled:

      Group 1

        -  AD with serum creatinine ≥ 1 and < 2 mg/dL, OR

        -  ACLF 1 with

             -  liver failure and serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 and < 2 mg/dl, or

             -  liver failure and West Haven grade 1-2 hepatic encephalopathy, or

             -  coagulation failure and serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 and < 2 mg/dl, or

             -  coagulation failure and West Haven grade 1-2 hepatic encephalopathy, OR

        -  ACLF 2 with

             -  liver failure and coagulation failure, or

             -  liver failure and West Haven grade 3-4 hepatic encephalopathy.

      Group 2

        -  ACLF 1 with renal failure (serum creatinine ≥ 2.0 and < 3.5 mg/dL), OR

        -  ACLF 2 with

             -  liver failure and renal failure (serum creatinine ≥ 2.0 and < 3.5 mg/dL), or

             -  coagulation failure and renal failure (serum creatinine ≥ 2.0 and < 3.5 mg/dL).
