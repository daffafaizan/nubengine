      in patients. The secondary purpose was to examine parameters that might be risk factors for
      gummy smile.Age, gender, marital status, medical history, and medication status of the
      patients were recorded. All individuals were instructed to sit on a dental chair and the
      measurments were made by using a millimetric ruler.Next, the patients were grouped according
      to Liebart's classification by gingival display at maximum smile as follows: Class
      1.Excessive gingival display (Gummy smile): â‰¥ 3mm gingival display Class 2.High smile line:
      0-2 mm of gingival display Class 3. Average smile line: Dental papilla is visible. Class 4.
      Low smile line: Gingival margin, dental papilla is not visible at all. Presence of altered
