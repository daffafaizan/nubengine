      in 5 women and 1 in 6 men will have had a stroke; 26% of which will have occurred before the
      age of 65. Moreover, over half of all stroke survivors are left with a disability and 41% of
      these are discharged from hospital requiring help with daily activities. Without a reliable
      biomarker for stroke patients, the development of a therapeutic intervention at baseline
      which has the capability to reduce disability in stroke patients is not possible. There is a
      dire need for further research into stroke. In 2012, £56 million was spent on stroke-related
      care/research, compared to £544 million on cancer research and £166 million on heart disease.

      Studies involving heart attack patients suggest that succinate could be used as a biomarker
      for stroke patients. Furthermore, the current therapeutic option used to block the rise in
      succinate levels, malonate, has been shown to prevent ischaemic brain damage in animal
      studies. No work to date has explored this phenomenon in humans with stroke and therefore
      this study has huge potential to bridge the gap in helping to treat stroke patients in the
      future and thus reduce healthcare costs.

      The DETECT study is a pilot study and has been specifically designed to be as simple as
      possible. For stroke patients undergoing thrombolysis, they will already have a cannula
      inserted to aid with the procedure. We propose that research bloods could be taken from this
      same cannula to reduce the burden to the patient. Wherever possible we will conduct the
      safety follow-up with stroke patients whilst they are still an inpatient at the hospital, to
      again reduce the burden to the patient.
