    
      This study is aimed to characterize Russian population of Retinitis Pigmentosa.

      Tasks:

      Stage 1. Formation of the primary cohort of patients. Patients pre-recruiting will be
      performed based on Deaf-Blind Support Foundation "Con-nection" patient database analysis and
      from references. Patients with clinically confirmed Retinitis pigmentosa will be evaluated
      according to available data of the clinical examination.

      Stage 2. Genetic study of patients. All enrolled patients will undergo single 4 ml peripheral
      venous blood sampling. DNA will be extracted from leucocytes. DNA samples will be analyzed
      and placed for long-term storage in liquid nitrogen. Stage 3. Clinical examination of
      patients.

      Each patient will undergo the following diagnostic procedures according to the unified
      protocol:

        -  Visometry (with correction and without correction)

        -  Ophthalmoscopy

        -  Perimetry

        -  Optical coherence tomography

        -  Electroretinography

        -  Visually evoked potentials

        -  Refractometry

        -  Pneumotonometry

        -  Biomicroscopy

        -  Any additional examinations and consultations if necessary Medical record will be
           developed and maintained for each patient consisting results of extended clinical
           examination.

      Statistical and bioinformatic analysis of detected genetic mutations in the study cohort will
      be performed.
