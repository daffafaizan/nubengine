      an optimal dose level of docetaxel and oxaliplatin defined during a prior pilot (Part I)
      phase study. The estimated duration of treatment was to be 6 months. Treatment was to be
      administered up to progression, unacceptable toxicities, or withdrawal of consent. The reason
      and date of removal of all participants was documented on the case report form.

      Participants who ended treatment but had not yet progressed (e.g. unacceptable toxicities or
      withdrawal of consent) were be followed every 8 weeks with a complete tumor assessment until
      documented progression or further anti-tumor therapy. Then, they would be followed every 3
      months after progression for survival status; date of death or progression were reported.
      Participants who ended treatment for progression, were to be followed every 3 months until
      death. Date of death was reported. The planned duration of the study was 30 months.
