      least 30 days by hospital discharge. The treatment regimen of all patients will be optimized
      in accordance with European Society of Cardiology guidelines. Standardized pharmacological
      treatment during cardiac rehabilitation period will include administration of angiotensin
      converting enzyme inhibition (ACE), beta-blockers and antiplatelet blockers. Furthermore, in
      order to keep patients free from angina symptoms, in some cases calcium channel blockers
      and/or nitrates will be used. The investigators will randomize participants into two groups,
      one receiving treatment Creatine, D-Ribose, B1 Vitamin, and B6 vitamin, and one receiving
      placebo in a double blind study design, for 6 months.
