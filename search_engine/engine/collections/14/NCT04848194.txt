        -  4 skin biopsies

        -  A blood sample.

      Patients with psoriasis will be recruited from the dermatology department. There will be no
      further visits, so the duration of the study is 1 day.

      The samples taken will be used to determine the pleiotropic role of TRPV1 in Psoriasis
      Inflammation.
