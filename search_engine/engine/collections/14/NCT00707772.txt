      (Peginterferon alpha-2a(40 KD)) 180 microgram per week plus COPEGUS (Ribavirin) 800 microgram
      for Genotype 2 and 3 and 1000 milligram for weight less than 75 kg and 1200 milligram for
      more than 75 kg. The duration of protocol is depends on genotypes of virus. In genotype 1 and
      4, for 48 week and in genotypes 2 and 3 , for 24 weeks. The patients are visited every 4
      weeks with biochemistry lab tests. The patients are checked with quantitative HCV RNA on the
      third months after initiation of the treatment to assess early virologic response and at the
      end of the study for complete response rate and on the six month after treatment completion
      for sustained response rate. The patients with undetectable HCV RNA are considered as
      responders. We have omitted the liver biopsy in the patients.
