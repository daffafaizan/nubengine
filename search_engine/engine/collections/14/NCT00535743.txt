      the trade name for Esmeron® in the US) is 1.2 mg/kg whereas in Europe it is 1.0 mg/kg. For
      both doses, dose recommendations for reversal with sugammadex were to be found. Hence, the
      present trial was set up to explore the dose-response relation of sugammadex given as an NMB
      reversal agent at 3 and 15 minutes following administration of 1.0 and 1.2 mg/kg of Esmeron®
      in subjects of ASA 1 to 3. The sub-investigator who performed any subjective safety
      assessments after anesthesia was to be remained blinded.
