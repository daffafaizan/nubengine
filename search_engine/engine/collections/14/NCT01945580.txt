      Xenform against traditional native tissue repair in women surgically treated for anterior
      and/or apical pelvic organ prolapse. Secondary objectives are to evaluate Xenform-related
      complications and subject reported outcomes.

      The primary endpoint of the study is to achieve non-inferiority of transvaginal repair with
      Xenform over native tissue repair at 36 months as compared to baseline. Success will be based
      on a composite of objective and subjective measures.

      Additionally, a co-primary endpoint of the study is to achieve non-inferiority of
      transvaginal repair with Xenform to native tissue repair for safety by comparing rates of
      serious device or serious procedure related complications between baseline and the 36 month
      time point.

      The secondary endpoints of the study include assessments of complications and subject
      reported outcomes.
