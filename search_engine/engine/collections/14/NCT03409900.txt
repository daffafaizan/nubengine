      anterior approach (DAA) as opposed to the more traditional posterolateral approach (PLA) in
      regards to total hip arthroplasty (THA). The DAA technique involves dissection of muscular
      planes for insertion of components resulting in less tissue damage as compared to PLA.
      Traditionally the study team has performed Lumbar Plexus blocks (LPB) to provide
      post-operative analgesia for total hip arthroplasty. This technique works well for the
      traditionally performed PLA in that the hip joint and incision site are within the analgesic
      distribution of the LPB. Conversely, the DAA utilizes an anterior incision that overlies the
      L1 and L2 dermatomes as opposed to the lower lumbar dermatomes of the PLA incision. When
      performing LPB it has been the study team's clinical experience that it is rare to achieve
      analgesia in the proximal distribution of the lumbar plexus resulting in apparent sparing of
      the L1 and L2 nerve root distributions. The quadratus lumborum block (QLB) is a newer
      regional analgesic technique that may be as effective as LPB at providing pain control
      following DAA hip arthroplasty. The QLB is thought to provide analgesia by blocking both the
      lateral and anterior cutaneous branches of T7 through L4. This degree of dermatomal coverage
      suggests that QLB could be an efficacious alternative to LPB for DAA hip arthroplasty. It is
      hypothesized that the QLB will provide equivalent analgesia when compared to the LPB as
      determined by a comparison of verbal reported pain scores.
