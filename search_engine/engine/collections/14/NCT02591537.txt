      either side of the umbilicus) will be surgically created in the lower abdominal area. One
      side of the umbilicus will be randomized to Oxygenesys treatment arm and the other side will
      be receiving a standard Tegaderm treatment arm. Time to wound healing will be observed over
      14 days (follow up assessments include wound photography, pain scores, wound biopsies,
      exudate collection, gene expression and proteomic analysis, scar assessment and adverse event
      collections. Study visits will occur at:

      Prescreening Visit; Day of wounding; Day 2; Day 7; Day 8-14 (until all wounds have healed);
      Day 28; Day 42; Abdominoplasty Surgery. An abdominoplasty will occur after day 42.
