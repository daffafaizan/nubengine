      underwent randomization in 2 arms: patients in the first arm will undergo transbronchial
      needle aspiration with a conventional bronchoscope patients in the second arm will undergo
      transbronchial needle aspiration with a ultra-thin bronchoscope. Every bronchoscopy will be
      performed by the same operator and will contemplate 3 passes for each nodule, followed by
      Rapid On-Site Evaluation (ROSE) assessed by a dedicated cytologist. If the cytological
      on-site evaluation is negative in patients in the first arm, they will be shifted to the
      second arm. Histological and molecular diagnosis will be assessed by a dedicated pathologist.
      Data will be collected and analyzed.
