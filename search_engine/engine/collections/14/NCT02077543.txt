      access to pathological tissue.

      Conventional biopsy devices can cause severe side effects, thus limiting the amount of tissue
      that can be collected for molecular characterization. The Brain-Tissue-Imprint Devices
      evaluated in this trial offers a unique opportunity to perform multiple non-lesion sampling
      in both tumor tissue and peritumoral areas. The approach relies on the use of tailored
      silicon chips integrated in surgical devices enabling tissue sampling through a brief
      "silicon to tissue contact", thus limiting potential side effects, and opening a way to
      extensive molecular investigation of brain tumors and their microenvironment.
