      testing and are initiating PAP therapy for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), obesity
      hypoventilation syndrome (OHS), or central sleep apnea syndrome (CSA). Testing will be
      performed for clinical reasons on patients referred for evaluation for sleep disordered
      breathing. Testing is at the clinician's discretion and can be either polysomnography or home
      sleep apnea tests. Patients meeting inclusion and not meeting exclusion criteria will be
      offered the opportunity to participate in this study.
