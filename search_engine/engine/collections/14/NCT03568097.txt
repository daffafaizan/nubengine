      therapeutics are urgently needed. SCLC is notably chemosensitive and first-line chemotherapy
      with platinum analogs and etoposide is associated with high rates of initial objective
      responses that unfortunately do not last long.

      The primary endpoint for study design is 1-year PFS rate, where according to RECIST v1.1 PFS
      is determined as the time from the date of study entry to the date of progression, death from
      any cause or date of last contact.Secondary End Point is the evaluation of efficacy of the
      study treatment in terms of Overall Survival (OS), Best Overall Response (BOR), Objective
      Response Rate (ORR) and Duration of Response (DOR).

      Evaluation of the safety of the study treatment by assessing Treatment-Emergent Adverse
      Events (TEAEs).

      Evaluation of the Quality of Life of patients receiving the study the study treatment.
      Evaluation of potential biomarkers on fresh or archival sample,of formalin-fixed paraffin
      embedded tumor tissue block or a minimum of 10 unstained tumor tissue sections. Moreover 10
      ml of EDTA-stored blood sample will be collected as well.
