      for a lower-extremity articular injury including fractures of the tibial plateau, pilon,
      ankle, and calcaneus. All participating centers will undergo training to implement the
      Mobility Toolkit (MTK). Research Staff will facilitate a series of performance tests while
      participants wear the MTK device. MTK assessment will also be conducted on 150 non-injured
      adults matched to the injured cohort on age and gender. These individuals will be enrolled
      and assessed once at two participating centers. Study flow and data capture are summarized in
      the figure on the next page.
