    
      This is a "pilot" study. A total of 45 male subjects will be randomized to receive either
      Active product (in 2 doses) or placebo. This is a single-blind design (subjects are unaware
      of product type they are receiving). Randomization is in a 1:1:1 ratio for active test
      product (in different doses) versus placebo. Products will consume the beverages for a 10-day
      period. The subjects will be subjected to a defined strenuous exercise protocol on Days 1 and
      10 of the study. Blood will be collected on the exercise days (pre- and post-exercise) on
      Days 1 and 10.

      Blood will be analyzed for markers of Immunity and Inflammation, to assess the
      immuno-supportive and anti-inflammatory properties of the Active product. Product acceptance
      and tolerability will also be assessed using a VAS scale.

      Outcome analysis will be based upon changes over time (from time-point 0) for within group
      changes as well as between group differences. That is, study will examine differences in
      end-points from baseline to end-of-study; as well as differences among the three groups.
