    
      This multicenter, prospective, observational registry of CLL patients is designed to
      characterize and describe treatment patterns for those initiating treatment with approved
      oral kinase inhibitors and other approved anti-CLL therapies/ regimens. The registry will
      provide information on regimens used to treat first-line and later lines of CLL as well as
      the sequencing of treatment regimens. The registry will also evaluate the association of
      these treatment patterns with patient characteristics, healthcare resource utilization, and
      functional outcomes including patient-reported HRQoL. These data will provide information to
      physicians that may help guide clinical practice and appropriate use of therapies, and will
      also provide information on HRQoL and healthcare resource utilization that will be of
      interest to healthcare decision makers.
