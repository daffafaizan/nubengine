        -  Determine the recurrence rate of high-grade squamous intraepithelial neoplasia in the
           anal canal of HIV-positive patients treated with infrared coagulation.

        -  Determine the time to recurrence and time to progression in patients treated with this
           procedure.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this procedure in these patients.

        -  Correlate CD4/CD8 count and HIV viral load with outcome in patients treated with this
           procedure.

        -  Correlate outcome with human papilloma virus subtype in patients treated with this
           procedure.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, pilot, multicenter study.

      Patients undergo treatment with an infrared coagulator in direct contact with the lesion for
      1.5 seconds and necrotic tissue is then debrided. Treatment repeats to the level of the
      submucosal vessels under colposcopic guidance. A repeat biopsy is performed at 3 months to
      assess treatment success. Patients with incompletely treated lesions receive 1 more
      treatment. Up to 3 lesions are treated during each visit in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients complete questionnaires regarding anal pain and discomfort at baseline, at 4 weeks,
      and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18 patients will be accrued for this study within 6 months.
