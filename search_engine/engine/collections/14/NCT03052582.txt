      wash-out period, as the lipids in the blood are known to adjust after 2 weeks. The effects of
      a diet containing 0.5 L of whole milk (17.5 g of milk fat/day) will be compared with a diet
      containing 0.5 L of skimmed milk (1.5 g of milk fat/day). Blinding is not possible since the
      appearance of the test foods cannot be concealed. The study subjects will receive the two
      test foods in random order, decided by draw of lots. Blood samples will be drawn on the first
      day of the period and in the end of the period for each 3 week-periods.
