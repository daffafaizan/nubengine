      drawn and stored in PAXgene tubes. Blood will be drawn within 24 hours of ICU admission (ICU
      day 1), and then every three days subsequently (ICU days 4, 7, 10, 13) for two weeks. In
      addition, a tube of blood will be drawn at the time of clinical diagnosis of infection, if an
      infection is diagnosed (see below). Patients who are discharged from the ICU prior to two
      weeks will no longer be profiled. The hour and date of admission, and the hour and date of
      each subsequent blood draw, will be recorded.

      Rates of hospital-acquired infection after severe traumatic injury run around 30-50%. The
      investigators will enroll 50 patients, which should net around 20 patients with infections,
      and 30 time-matched non-infected controls. In total, an average of 4 samples/patient, or 200
      total blood samples, are expected.

      Diagnosis of Infection:

      The main purpose of the study is to examine gene expression response to infections. As a
      result, careful attention must be paid to how infections are classified. First, two systemic
      inflammatory reaction syndrome (SIRS) criteria are NOT necessary to be designated as
      infected. Second, the time of diagnosis of infection (and the time of extra blood sampling)
      will be the time of clinical diagnosis, not the later time that cultures turn positive. It
      will thus be based on clinical judgement. Finally, post-hoc criteria for infections are
      described elsewhere. Patients need to eventually meet these criteria to be counted as
      infected; this will be done in the analysis phase, not the clinical phase.
