      Managed care systems rely on primary care providers as gatekeepers to make sensible decisions
      regarding the use of expensive health care resources. While this model has some intuitive
      appeal in terms of its potential for decreasing health care costs, it may not be applicable
      in VA medical centers, where patients are often medically complex and socioeconomically
      vulnerable. Thus, other strategies to integrate generalist and specialist care are required.

      Objectives:

      Our objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of an integrated model of primary care for
      veterans with alcohol dependence and/or depression in which mental health clinical nurse
      specialists (CNS) are placed within the General Medicine Clinic (GMC). Our primary outcomes
      are patientsï¿½ disease-specific mental health symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory: BDI) and
      satisfaction with care (RAND). Secondary outcomes include quality of care, health services
      utilization, and health care costs.

      Methods:

      This is a randomized, controlled trial comparing patients in two GMC firms. After physicians
      in both firms were trained in the diagnosis and brief treatment of the two conditions, the
      two firms were randomized into one of two conditions. Patients in both firms are screened for
      depression. Patients who screen positive for depression and give written informed consent are
      enrolled. In the control firm, depression screening results are provided to the primary care
      physician. In the integrated primary care firm, results are shared with the primary care
      provider, along with having a mental health clinical nurse specialist in the GMC who is
      available to implement and support treatment decisions. Telephone interviews are conducted at
      three and 12 months after enrollment to collect outcome data by persons blinded to the study
      hypotheses. Data will also be collected using local VA databases. Data analysis will utilize
      generalized estimating equations to account for the repeated measures design, clustering of
      patients within physicians, and clustering of physicians within clinics.

      Status:

      Data collection was completed during August, 2000. Data analyses for the one-year follow-up
      results are in process.
