      subjects were randomized 1:1 in to the following groups:

        -  Group A: Clinician-directed pharmacotherapy + PEAR-004

        -  Group B: Clinician-directed pharmacotherapy + sham app An up to 28-day screening period
           included standard screening assessments as defined in the assessment schedule. Eligible
           subjects were randomized on Day 1 into one of the treatment groups.

      Subjects in both groups continued to receive their clinician-directed standard-of-care
      treatment for schizophrenia, including pharmacotherapy. Subjects in Group A used PEAR 004 and
      subjects in Group B used a sham for a period of 12 weeks. Subjects returned to the clinic for
      outpatient visits at Week 4 (day 29), Week 8 (day 57), and Week 12 (day 85). At each visit,
      standard assessments were performed according to the assessment schedule, including PANSS,
      ISST-Plus, CGI, BMQ, MAP-SR, WHOQOL-BREF, BDI-II, ISI, and adverse events (AEs). A final
      follow-up visit was performed at Week 16 (day 115),
