      nasogastric tube is tightly fixed with the mother magnet, which will be used for bile or
      pancreatic drainage before formation of anastomoses. The outside diameter (OD) of the magnets
      ranges from 5mm to 15mm. In fact, for biliojejunostomy, larger magnets are applied, whereas
      for pancreaticojejunostomy, smaller magnets are routinely used. This study is a
      single-center, parallel controlled trial to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of magnetic
      compression technique for biliojejunostomy and pancreaticojejunostomy, versus traditional
      hand-sewn techniques on the postoperative morbidity of the patients. And also how to avoid
      mutual attraction of the two pairs of magnets, formation of bilio-/pancreaticojejunostomy
      time, discharge rule of the magnets will be all evaluated in the current study.
