      bone outcomes after RYGB or SG surgery. The investigators have previously shown that RYGB and
      SG have negative effects on bone density, bone microarchitecture, and that bariatric
      procedures potentially increase the risk of fractures. The purpose of this study is to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of zoledronic acid to prevent the high-turnover bone loss
      that occurs in adults who have chosen to undergo RYGB or SG.
