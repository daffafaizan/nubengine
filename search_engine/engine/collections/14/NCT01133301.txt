      or with 3 weeks of placebo. In either case the active treatment phases (weeks 1-6) were
      followed by one week of placebo. The major purpose of weeks 1-2 and 4-5, respectively, was to
      achieve a steady state during the active treatment. The primary comparisons of
      psychopathology under naltrexone and placebo refer to the weeks following the intended
      achievement of a steady state (weeks 3 and 6, respectively).

      6 weeks of treatment were split into two phases: (A) 3 weeks of pharmacologically active
      treatment with naltrexone and (B) 3 weeks of pharmacologically inactive treatment with
      placebo (cross-over design). The sequence of the two treatment phases was randomized and
      concealed from both the patients and the health care professionals. In both cases, the last
      week ("Week 7") was without pharmacological intervention.

      The primary outcome was based on the DSS, a reliable and valid self-rating instrument to
      assess dissociative experiences and inner tension during the last 24 hours (Stiglmayr et al.
      2001) Mean scores for intensity (ranging from 0="no" to 9="very strong") and for duration
      (average time during which a particular symptom was present during the last 24 hours (in %))
      were calculated for (a) dissociation (calculated from 21 Likert type items) and of (b)
      aversive inner tension (one item).
