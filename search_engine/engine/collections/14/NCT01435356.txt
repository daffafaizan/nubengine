      Cancer in whom the urinary bladder had been surgically removed. The investigational treatment
      aimed to increase the body's immune response to a specific antigen expressed by the cancer.
      The tumour tissue was first tested whether it expressed the MAGE-A3 antigen.

      The MAGNOLIA study was open to male and female patients with pathologically confirmed muscle
      invasive transitional cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder with expression of the antigen
      MAGE-A3 with or without limited lymph node involvement who had no evidence of disease after
      surgery confirmed with imaging procedures (scans CT/MRI).
