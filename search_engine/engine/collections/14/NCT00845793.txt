      focused nutritional intervention using mainly the food tray during the hospitalization. The
      intervention will be administered by the hospital nutrition team.

      At baseline (upon admission) - medical data will be collected as well as nutritional and
      behavioral questionnaires will be administered. The intervention will take place during the
      hospitalization period. Follow up using the same tools will be performed at 3 and 12 month.

      We believe that the hospitalization period, even for reasons non related to diabetes, is a
      window of opportunity to implement lifestyle changes.
