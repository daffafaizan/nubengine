      with previously untreated extensive stage small cell lung cancer. II. Determine the overall
      and progression free survival of these patients in response to this treatment regimen. III.
      Determine the toxicity of this treatment regimen in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours weekly for
      6 consecutive weeks. Treatment continues every 8 weeks for 4 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 2 months for 1
      year, then every 3 months for 2 years, and then annually for 2 years.
