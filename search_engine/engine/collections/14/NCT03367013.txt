      Canada annually. About 1,200 either die or survive with severe brain or lung injury,
      retinopathy, late-onset sepsis or necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), each of which is
      associated with substantial risk of childhood disability.

      Lactoferrin is an antimicrobial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory iron-carrying, bifidogenic
      glycoprotein found in all vertebrates and in mammalian milk, leukocytes and exocrine
      secretions. However, most VLBW infants receive insufficient human lactoferrin (hLF) from
      human breast milk in the first months of life, resulting in suboptimal protection. Because
      hLF is expensive, bovine lactoferrin (bLF) has been considered as an alternate supplement to
      improve this suboptimal protection.

      LIFT is one of several ongoing trials using higher doses of bovine bLF in the VLBW population
      (120-200 mg/kg/d). If LIFT confirms a 19% reduction in the relative risk of its primary
      outcome, bLF will have a major impact, translating into thousands more intact survivors
      without major morbidity in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Europe and worldwide each year. As
      >90% of very preterm survivors at hospital discharge reach adulthood, this represents more
      than 19,000 life-years gained in Canada alone each year, one of the largest gains in intact
      survival in any specialty since neonatal surfactant and antenatal steroids
