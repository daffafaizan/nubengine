        -  to demonstrate that over 6-month follow-up, the proportion of the patients improved in
           the aCRT arm is at least as high as in the Echo arm

        -  to demonstrate that cardiac function is similar when using aCRT versus echo-optimized
           settings

        -  to demonstrate that aCRT does not result in inappropriate AV or VV delay settings
