    
      Background

      This is a training, natural history of disease, and screening protocol for the evaluation,
      treatment and follow-up of patients with dermatologic diseases and systemic diseases with
      cutaneous manifestations. This protocol was developed to allow subject enrollment for
      teaching purposes and to allow for second opinions regarding relatively complicated patients,
      and to allow for evaluation of non-invasive tools for the diagnosis and monitoring of
      cutaneous manifestations. This protocol promotes a critical link between the NCI, CCR
      Dermatology Branch and the local and national extramural medical communities.

      Objectives:

        -  To provide clinical material to fulfill the educational mission of the Dermatology
           Branch.

        -  To learn about the natural history of selected dermatologic diseases.

      Eligibility:

      All subjects regardless of age, gender, or racial/ethnic group with dermatologic disease or
      systemic disease with cutaneous manifestations.

      Design:

      Patients enrolled in this protocol will be evaluated and treated according to generally
      available, standard procedures and therapeutic modalities. Samples of blood and skin will be
      studied by routine and specialized investigative methods to establish these patients
      diagnosis, response to treatment, and/or disease progression. Non-invasive tools may be used
      as part of the examination and assessment of cutaneous manifestations of disease.
