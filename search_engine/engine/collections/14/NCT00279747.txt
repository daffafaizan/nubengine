    
      Objective: In an international, multicenter, double-blind, randomized clinical trial we
      evaluated the short-term (3 months) and long term (12 months) efficacy and safety of two
      doses of meloxicam oral suspension compared with naproxen in children with oligo and
      polyarticular course juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA).

      Methods: Children with active oligo or polyarticular course JIA, requiring therapy with an
      NSAID were eligible for this trial. Patients were randomly allocated to therapy with
      meloxicam oral suspension 0.125 mg/kg body weight in single daily dose, meloxicam 0.25 mg/kg
      body weight in single daily dose, or naproxen 10 mg/kg body weight in two daily doses. The
      trial drugs were administered in a double-blind, double-dummy design for up to 12 months.
      Response rates were determined according to the American College of Rheumatology Pediatric
      30% definition of improvement (ACR Ped 30). Safety parameters were assessed by evaluation of
      the adverse events in the 3 groups.

      Study Hypothesis:

      The null hypothesis of interest is that the magnitude of response with regard to the primary
      endpoint is equivalent between the treatment groups. The alternative is that there is any
      difference (two-sided) between any of the treatment groups.

      Comparison(s):

      Naproxen oral suspension 10 mg/kg body weight.
