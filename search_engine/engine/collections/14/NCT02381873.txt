      pain, perceived function and health-related quality of life (QoL) current research highlights
      the persistent deleterious effects of retained aberrant neuromuscular alterations on physical
      function, which may also directly impact falls risk. Importantly, observed increases in
      neuromuscular deficits that occur prior to surgery track through into the post-operative
      stage with functional limitations that are sustained and which can persist at least one year
      after surgery. Clearly, it is crucial to strive to identify modifiable factors that might
      successfully ameliorate this pathophysiological process prior to surgery, reduce post
      surgical impairments and which also accelerate recovery.

      Among other determinants that might contribute towards understanding of optimal functional
      recovery following reconstructive knee surgery is the influence of genes. The evaluation of
      specific genotypes and subsequent protein expression might provide further insight into the
      extent of genetic influence. For example, it is not yet known whether patients with specific
      genotypes experience an accelerated recovery. Currently, there is a paucity of research on
      the influence of gene-environment interactions on an individual's response to physical
      conditioning.

      The proposed research will be an exploratory study, involving four repeated-measures
      assessments from 10 weeks prior to surgery to 12 weeks after surgery. This study offers a
      novel evaluation of the overall patterning of changes and will quantify and describe
      patient-reported and objective measures of sensorimotor, neuromuscular, psychophysiological
      performance capabilities, genotypes and levels of habitual physical activity.
