      grip accountable to the loss of thumb and fingers extension and loss of active wrist
      extension respectively. There are three aims in the treatment of radial nerve palsy which
      comprise the restoration of thumb extension and abduction, finger extension and restoration
      of wrist extension. In this study we measured the functional outcome after tendon transfer
      for radial nerve palsy aimed to restore the wrist extension, finger extension and thumb
      extension/abduction. Investigators' objective was to assess the functional outcome after
      tendon transfer surgery for radial nerve palsy. So investigators conducted a retrospective
      study at Aga Khan University Hospital Karachi comprising records of patients operated for
      irreversible high radial nerve palsy. Investigators concluded that tendon transfer surgery
      for radial nerve palsy provides excellent results to restore the lost function and therefore
      must be considered for patients with no signs of recovery after the nerve repair.
