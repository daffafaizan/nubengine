      initiated by Investigators. The study population include patients without macroscopic
      vascular invasion and distant metastasis, undergoing R0 resection, postoperative pathology
      confirming hepatocellular carcinoma with microvascular invasion (MVI) (BCLC A or B stage; T2
      or part T3aN0M0). The primary end point of this study is recurrence free survival（RFS）at the
      2nd postoperative years, and the secondary end points include postoperative median time to
      recurrence (TTR), 1-year, 3-years, 5-years postoperative recurrence free survival (RFS),
      3-years, 5-years postoperative overall survival, and safety and tolerance of sorafenib as an
      adjuvant therapy for HCC. Patients in the treatment group will start Sorafenib within 4 weeks
      after hepatectomy at doze of 400mg per day, and last continuously for 2 years, or until
      disease progression. Patients in the control group will take regular treatment with no use of
      Sorafenib. Both groups are forbid receiving postoperative anti-cancer therapy such as
      adjuvant radiotherapy, chemotherapy and TACE. Patients of both groups should receive
      antiviral therapy according to guidelines. Chinese traditional medicine and nutritional
      support can be used without limitation, and the information of concomitant drug need to be
      recorded for further analysis. Treatment for relieve drug related AEs can be used as needed.
      Patients of both groups will be treated with best clinical practice as routine after
      confirmed recurrence/metastasis, and the information of further treatment need to be recorded
      and follow-up till death.
