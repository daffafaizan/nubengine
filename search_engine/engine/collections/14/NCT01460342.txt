    
      Tadalafil is being investigated as a treatment for men with signs and symptoms of benign
      prostatic hyperplasia [BPH; also referred to as urinary disturbance or BPH-LUTS (BPH-lower
      urinary tract symptoms)] in Japan and overseas. Overseas studies and the Japanese
      dose-finding study LVIA (NCT00783094) identified tadalafil 5 mg once-daily as the recommended
      dose. The long-term safety and maintenance of effect was confirmed in the open-label
      extension of study LVIA. The risk-benefit profile was further studied in the Asian study LVHB
      (NCT00861757).

      This study, LVJF, is to confirm the efficacy and safety of tadalafil 5 mg once-daily in Asian
      men with BPH-LUTS.
