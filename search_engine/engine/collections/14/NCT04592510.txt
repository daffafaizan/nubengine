      Health Organization. SARS-CoV-2 is an unpredictable virus that is rapidly transmitting from
      one country to another, and unfortunately as of today, there is no effective medication or
      vaccine for the disease control. This virus has gone on to cause one of the most rapidly
      expanding pandemics with over 9 million people being infected worldwide including the
      pediatric population.

      Due to the unique nature of dentistry, most dental procedures generate significant amounts of
      droplets and aerosols, posing potential risks of infection transmission. Recent studies have
      demonstrated the role of the oral mucosa in COVID-19 infection, in addition to expressing the
      ACE2 receptor in salivary glands in the asymptomatic process in infected saliva, thus being
      one of the main sources of viruses.

      Clinical features of COVID-19 in children include fever and cough, but a large proportion of
      infected children appears to be asymptomatic and may contribute significantly to
      transmission. Therefore, it can be assumed that, at this stage in the pandemic, all children
      and their parents/carers are potentially infective with the potential of cross-infection to
      dental stuff, parents and the public. This has, in theory, an impact on medical and dental
      procedures that are Aerosol Generating Procedures.
