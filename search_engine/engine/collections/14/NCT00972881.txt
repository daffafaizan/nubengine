        -  To assess the downstaging effectiveness and tolerability of neoadjuvant
           chemoradiotherapy comprising capecitabine, irinotecan hydrochloride, cetuximab, and
           radiotherapy in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive cetuximab IV over 1-2 hours once weekly in weeks 1-6 and irinotecan
      hydrochloride IV over 1 hour once weekly in weeks 2-5. Patients also undergo pelvic
      radiotherapy once daily and receive oral capecitabine twice daily on days 1-5 in weeks 2-6.

      Patients undergo surgery 8 weeks after completion of chemoradiotherapy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6, 12, 24, and 36 months.
