      of life over time, this study will prospectively follow a cohort of patients at specified
      intervals, evaluating their physical symptoms, physical and social functioning and overall
      quality of life. Medical and sociodemographic factors as well as health behaviors that might
      be predictive of adaptation will be tested. This is a preliminary investigation and it is
      hoped that we will be able to base future research questions on the results of this study.
