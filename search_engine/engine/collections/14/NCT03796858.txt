      skin, all of which not only results in functional disability and impaired quality of life,
      but participants with this disease also have increased mortality. Guselkumab is a monoclonal
      antibody that binds to human interleukin 23 (IL-23) and inhibits IL-23 specific intracellular
      signaling and subsequent activation and cytokine production. Investigation of guselkumab in
      this Phase 3b PsA clinical study is supported by the favorable efficacy and safety results
      from Phase 2 study of guselkumab in PsA and Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies in psoriasis
      including the subset of participants with PsA. The primary hypothesis is that guselkumab 100
      milligram (mg) at Weeks 0, 4, and every 8 weeks (q8w) thereafter is superior to placebo which
      will be assessed by the proportion of participants achieving an American College of
      Rheumatology (ACR 20) response at Week 24. The study includes 2 periods: A 24-week
      double-blind, placebo-controlled period for the primary analysis of the efficacy and safety
      of guselkumab, compared with placebo and a 32-week active-treatment and safety follow-up
      period for additional analysis of the efficacy and safety of guselkumab. Safety will be
      monitored throughout the study (Up to Week 56).
