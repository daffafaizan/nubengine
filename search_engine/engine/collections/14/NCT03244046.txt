      measured via the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire Scale (HTQ). It has been found that PTSD and
      pain may maintain each other.

      Methods: Thousand consecutive patients with Low Back Pain (LBP) referred to the Spine Center
      are screened for PTSD. It is expected that 140 patients will meet the inclusion criteria and
      be randomized to Guided Physiotherapy or to Guided Physiotherapy plus 12 psychotherapeutic
      sessions, that will include the shock-trauma method 'Somatic Experiencing'.

      Effect parameters are: Pain, daily function, EuroQOL and (HTQ), anxiety and depression, fear
      avoidance (Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia) and pain catastrophizing (PCS) on entry, and at
      6/12 months.
