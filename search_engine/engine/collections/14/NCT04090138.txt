    
      This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial in healthy men.
      Subjects will take either a placebo or setria performance blend (L-citrulline + glutathione)
      for 8 days. At the day 8, subjects run on the treadmill to measure the time to exhaustion at
      90%, 100%, and 110% of peak velocity. Arterial blood flow and blood vessel diameter (via
      ultrasound), blood analytes (plasma nitrate/nitrite, L-arginine, L-citrulline), subjective
      feelings of fatigue from a visual analog scale (VAS) and ratings of perceived exertion will
      be assessed. There is a minimum of a two week washout period in between trials/treatments.
      The same procedures are completed upon return visit.
