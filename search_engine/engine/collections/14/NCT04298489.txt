      specimens for research. A section of each sample was removed for the generation of PDX models
      as described early.The rest of the tumor cells were expanded using ex vivo drug sensitivity
      assay.

      The drugs used in the study were 5-fluorouracil, Oxaliplatin, and irinotecan at C0 = 10 mM,
      2.5 mM and 0.02 mM, respectively. They were applied either as single agents or in
      combinations of 5-fluorouracil and Oxaliplatin, 5-fluorouracil and irinotecan, or all three
      agents, or others. After 7 days of treatment, the tumor cells were stained with EdU, Hoechst
      and EpCAM with the Cell Quantitative Detection Kit. Images were acquired with an automated
      microscopic image-scanning system and analyzed with the built-in software.
