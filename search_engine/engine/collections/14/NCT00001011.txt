      life-threatening infections, improved in weight and performance, and lived longer than
      patients who received a placebo (inactive medication). Further studies are needed because
      toxic effects associated with the use of AZT were noted and the long-term effectiveness and
      toxicity of AZT are still unknown. It is also unknown if AZT will benefit patients with less
      severe HIV infections such as early ARC or PGL.

      Patients accepted into the study are randomly assigned to receive either AZT or placebo.
      Treatment continues for a minimum of 104 weeks beyond the time the last patient enters the
      study. If the study medication causes toxic effects, the dose is decreased or temporarily
      stopped, and if the toxic effects are severe, then the medication will be stopped
      permanently. Participants visit the clinic every 2 weeks during the first 16 weeks and once a
      month thereafter. Throughout the study frequent blood samples are taken to monitor the
      effectiveness and safety of the treatment. AMENDED: The placebo arm has been discontinued as
      of August 3, 1989 and the AZT dose has been reduced.
