      In the current medical literature, it is unclear how follow-up calls influence these outcomes
      in a general medical population. Some studies have attempted to address this question, but
      are limited in that they target very specific patient populations, are of insufficient
      quality, or evaluated follow-up calls as part of a larger care bundle. We will conduct a high
      quality, real-time clinical care study to determine the efficacy of a follow-up phone call
      program.

      STUDY DESIGN

      This is a single center, pragmatic, randomized, controlled clinical trial to investigate
      whether a structured post-hospital discharge follow-up phone call can improve patients'
      transition from in-hospital to outpatient care and improve satisfaction with their care. We
      will also identify the discharge implementation assistance given to those in the intervention
      (Phone Call) group.

      Outcome Measures Primary outcome for this study is readmission event rate within 30 days.
      Secondary outcomes include patient satisfaction which will be measured as mean Hospital
      Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) patient satisfaction scores,
      all cause VUMC emergency department (ED) visits, the need for assistance with discharge plan
      implementation, and 30 day mortality.
