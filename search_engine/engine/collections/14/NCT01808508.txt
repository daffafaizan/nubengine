      syndrome (OSAS) with a baseline sleep study. Based on the results of the sleep
      study,individuals with OSAS will be randomly assigned into two groups. One group will receive
      continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and the other intervention group will receive sham
      CPAP(placebo) for four months. CPAP is a machine with a mask that fits over the nose, is worn
      during sleep and helps keep the airway open. Sham CPAP (placebo) is a machine that looks and
      sounds like a CPAP machine but does not give pressure so it does not treat OSAS. Individuals
      with normal breathing during the sleep study will not receive a machine, and will serve as
      controls.

      Individuals will also have baseline tests including blood tests, an echocardiogram (pictures
      of the heart), a walking test and learning tests. After 4 months, the baseline tests will be
      repeated in all participants. At the end of the study, all individuals with OSAS will get
      treatment.
