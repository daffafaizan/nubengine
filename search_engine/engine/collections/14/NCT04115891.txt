      dental care, especially for children ranges from 3% to 43% in different populations. To the
      best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the use of lavender oil
      inhalation and to assess the correlation of anxiety and vital signs among children during a
      stressful surgical dental intervention. This study design was constructed according to the
      vital sign evaluations, anxiety and pain scores. Primary hypothesis was that of lavender oil
      inhalation prior to surgical dental interventions would affect vital signs and consequently
      reduce anxiety and perception of pain in children.
