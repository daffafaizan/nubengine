      It's a very common benign condition that manifests as small, rough folliculocentric keratotic
      papules, often described as chicken bumps, chicken skin or goose-bumps, in characteristic
      areas of body, particularly the outer upper arms and thighs.

      Trichloreacetic acid (TCA) is a type of chemical peels that is derived from acetic acid by
      the chlorination of 3 hydrogen ions. It can induce coagulative necrosis of proteins and
      cells. The depth of action depends on various factors e.g the number of layers applied and
      its combination with substances that potentiate its action.

      Nd: YAG laser is a type of hair removing devices that operates at wave length of 1064nm. This
      wave length allows for less absorption at the epidermis. It is less absorbed by melanin,
      which leads to lower side effect and better tolerance but less efficacy in dark skinned
      patients.
