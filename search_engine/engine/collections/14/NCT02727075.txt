    
      Immunological testing will be performed systematically for each patient.

      Research of blood in fecal sample will be based on 2 methods: one based on a qualitative
      immunochromatographic method (such as HemSign4 technique, Servibio, France; or all other
      techniques used at AP-HP) and another quantitative immunoturbidimetric method (OC-Sensor,
      Eiken, Japan). They will be performed systematically with two fresh fecal samples for each
      patient, before coloscopy examination.

      Treating physicians will not be provided with the testing result. The diagnosis of reference
      will be established by experts based on the result of explorations (colonoscopy, coloscanner)
      and the patient's progression, blinded to the result of immunoassay.

      The intrinsic characteristics of the immunoassay (sensitivity, specificity...) will be
      determined with reference to this reference diagnosis, using a positivity threshold defined
      using expert consensus on the weights to be allocated to potential errors.

      2 modeling scenarios (without vs with immunological testing) using decision trees based on
      prevalence and diagnostic performance observed and stochastic simulations.
