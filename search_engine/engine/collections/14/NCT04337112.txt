    
      This expanded access program is designed to provide access to viltolarsen in patients with
      DMD with confirmed mutation(s) in the dystrophin gene amenable to skipping of exon 53, who in
      the opinion and clinical judgement of the treating physician, would benefit from treatment
      with viltolarsen.
