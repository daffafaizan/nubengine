      females undergoing IVF. Each study center will follow their study center standard practice
      for IVF unless otherwise noted in this protocol. The study centers will be provided with the
      medications for down regulation, stimulation and ovulation induction. The subjects will be
      randomized to study medication on the day of oocyte retrieval or the day following and will
      continue treatment for up to 10 weeks. The subjects with a confirmed pregnancy will be
      required to return to the clinic several times during the course of the 10 week treatment
      period for serum pregnancy tests and transvaginal ultrasounds to monitor the pregnancy.
