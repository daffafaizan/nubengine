      the chewing side on various aspects of masticatory function, including masticatory
      performance and rhythm. Twenty-eight volunteers will take part, recruited for convenience,
      among friends and relatives of the teachers and students of the Degree of Dentistry of the
      Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences of the University of Barcelona. These individuals
      will perform masticatory tests and, after a period of two weeks, will repeat them as a
      re-test. Each participant will perform 6 tests, each consisting of 5 assays, chewing a small
      latex bag containing a few silicone tablets (2 g) during 20 masticatory cycles. One test
      involves freestyle mastication in which the participant will be asked to chew the latex bag
      naturally. Two tests involve chewing the bag unilaterally (i.e., right-hand side in one and
      left-hand side in the other) and the order of their assays will be varied. For the last three
      tests, the participant will change the chewing side 1 (A1), 3 (A3), or 5 (A5) times
      respectively; the sequence of the assays will be randomized. The masticatory performance will
      be determined by the "median particle size" (MPS), and the masticatory rhythm will be
      assessed through the masticatory frequency as the ratio of masticatory cycle number to
      masticatory time. The control variables will include age and sex.
