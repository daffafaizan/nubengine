      transplant. The classical physiologic response to vitamin D deficiency is the development of
      secondary hyperparathyroidism. However, several previous studies have found a high incidence
      of inappropriate functional hypoparathyroidism in patients with chronic liver disease and
      hypovitaminosis D. The mechanism underlying this functional hypoparathyroidism is not
      understood but previous investigators have postulated that it is related to intracellular
      magnesium (Mg) deficiency. Our short term goals of this pilot project are two fold: (a) We
      will estimate the prevalence of magnesium deficiency in chronic liver disease patients by
      performing standard Mg loading testing (b) We will examine the effects of acute intravenous
      Mg infusion on the calcium-PTH axis. The vitamin D-PTH endocrine system is one of the
      principal regulators of calcium homeostasis and bone metabolism. Metabolic bone disease is a
      quite pervasive problem in chronic liver disease patients. Insight into this important
      endocrine system will aid us in our long term goals of addressing metabolic bone disease
      issues in this patient population.
