      used in medicine for decades. Several characteristics contribute to its widespread use,
      including its noninvasive nature, reliability and safety. The Somanetics' INVOSÂ® System
      harnesses this power to safely and reliably "see inside" the brain and body. NIRS devices
      measure the venous weighted oxy-hemoglobin saturation (color of blue blood) in a field of
      tissue, rather than in arteries, and thus the rSO2 parameter provides a window into regional
      oxygen supply-demand relationships. Monitoring rSO2 at two distinct sites (cerebral and
      somatic) has become common practice at our institution for all infants and children in the
      intensive care unit and provides valuable feedback about potentially deleterious trends in
      regional tissue oxygenation that cannot easily be obtained by other modalities in such
      patients.
