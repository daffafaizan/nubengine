      during the Six Minute Walk Test (6MWT). However, this recommendation raises safety concerns
      for individuals at increased risk of falls. Given the recommendations and concerns, the
      effects of guarding during the 6MWT has not been investigated. Purpose: The purpose of this
      study was to determine if guarding during the 6MWT affected gait speed and distance walked.
      Methods: Participants were randomized into a 'guarded first' vs 'guarded second' condition.
      Data were analyzed using a one-sample t-test, Pearson Correlation Coefficients, Intraclass
      Correlation Coefficients (ICC), and Bland Altman plots to assess differences and
      relationships for gait speed and distance walked between the guarded and unguarded trials.
