      adverse effects related to worsening social determinants and health disparities. Utilizing a
      community-driven approach, the overall objective of this proposed study is to increase
      COVID-19 vaccine uptake and completion the impact of COVID-19 among African American and
      Latinx public housing residents. Guided by the Community Based Participatory Model, the
      Information, Motivation, and Behavioral Skills (IMB) and the Transtheoretical Model will be
      utilized to carry out this intervention. Through this innovative program, we will establish
      Academic-Community Team for Improving Vaccine Acceptability and Targeted Engagement
      (ACTIVATE) program, which will develop leadership triads of public housing resident leaders,
      nurse practitioner students, and public health students to carry out this multilevel
      intervention.
