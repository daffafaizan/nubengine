      treatment algorithm for patients with multifocal or large intrahepatic lesions not eligible
      for surgical resection, transplantation, or local ablative therapy. In Hong Kong, the TACE
      regimen currently being utilized in the great majority of hospitals is based on an aqueous
      form of cisplatin (1mg per mL) mixed in a one-to-one ratio by volume with Lipiodol to form a
      relatively large volume of 40mL emulsion at 20mg cisplatin as the maximum dose. Although TACE
      with this regimen has been shown to be effective in prolonging overall survival, there is
      probably room for further improvement because the objective tumor response rate is limited to
      39%. One of the approaches to improve the treatment effectiveness of TACE could be to
      increase the dose of chemotherapeutic agent. In the United States, the most common regimen of
      chemotherapeutic agent in TACE is the mixture of cisplatin 100mg, doxorubicin 50mg, and
      mitomycin C 10mg, dissolved in 10ml of water-soluble contrast medium, then emulsified in an
      equivalent volume of lipiodol to form a 20mL emulsion. A relatively new regimen was
      introduced, in which a relatively high dose of cisplatin up to 100mg in particle form was
      given as a suspension in 20mL of Lipiodol, this regimen has been used and found to achieve an
      improved objective tumor response rate of 51%.
