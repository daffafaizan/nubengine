      in GD1 patients after receiving oral N-acetylcysteine ("NAC"), which is available both as a
      prescription medication and as a dietary-supplement product, that has antioxidant and
      anti-inflammatory effects. Any changes the investigators may find in chemical levels may
      improve our understanding of the disease and could eventually lead to better treatment
      options. This is a multi-center study of approximately 50 people with Type 1 Gaucher disease
      (GD1) and healthy volunteers. Healthy volunteers will have 3 study visits over the course of
      3 months. Procedures will include review of medical history, blood draws at each visit, and
      an MRI scan at the third visit. GD1 patients will have 7 study visits over the course of 9
      months. Procedures include review of medical history, blood draws at each visit (multiple
      draws from an IV catheter at Visit 6), neurological exams, pain and fatigue questionnaires,
      and MRI scans (at Visits 3 and 6). In addition, GD1 patients will be given oral NAC at Visit
      3, to begin taking twice a day for 90 days. All MRI scans will be done at the University of
      Minnesota in Minneapolis.
