      season (November to January) as a randomized, double blind and placebo-controlled study.
      During a screening visit, 15 individuals will be recruited according to eligibility criteria.
      They will be randomized into 3 groups (i.n. administration of anti-IgE antibodies, Bet v 1 or
      placebo). Intranasal administration will take place on three consecutive days and serum
      samples will be taken 3, 5, and 8 weeks (+/- 4 days) after the treatment for analysis of
      total and specific IgE levels
