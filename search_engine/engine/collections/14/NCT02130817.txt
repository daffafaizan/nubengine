      kidney transplants candidates, moderately sensitized against their deceased donor and at-risk
      for delayed graft function (DGF), to receive Belatacept (days 0,5, weeks 2,4,8 and 12 (10
      mg/kg), and every 4 weeks thereafter (5 mg/kg)), plasma exchange (once before and twice after
      transplant) and Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG) (100 mg/kg after each plasma exchange),
      along with Thymoglobulin (ATG) induction and Dexamethasone tapered dosing starting on the day
      of transplant at 100mg IV, tapered through Day 4, followed by prednisone at 30 mg on Day 5
      with tapered dosing to prednisone 10 mg/d by one month, with a total observation period of 1
      year. Patients will be tapered off tacrolimus by week 8 and will remain on mycophenolic acid
      and prednisone for the total length of the study. Subjects will be followed until 1 year post
      transplant.
