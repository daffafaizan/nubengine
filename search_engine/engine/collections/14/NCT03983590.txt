      painkillers are the usual tools but sometimes the symptoms and so the drugs to deliver are
      difficult to distinguish. For patients with maintained communication abilities, pain
      self-assessment using Visual Analogic Scores are the gold standard. Could pain assessment be
      optimised thanks to ANI? ANI is used in anaesthesiology and intensive care. The ANI system is
      based on the analysis of intra-cardiac variability. Based as an electrocardiograph with two
      electrodes on the patient's chest, it measures the balance between
      sympathetic/parasympathetic tones leading to a pain score. This score is predictive of pain
      occurrence, leading to an early analgesic treatment and a better control of pain with less
      quantity of drugs. However, some studies reported that anxiety and emotions could influence
      ANI pain score.

      To test this hypothesis in palliative care field, this study compares pain and anxiety VAS to
      ANI scores before, during and after the bed bath.
