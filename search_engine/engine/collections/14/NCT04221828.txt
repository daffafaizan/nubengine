      administered intravenously in a number of types of cancer. These submicron particles are
      injected directly into solid tumors to target cancer at the site of disease with less
      systemic exposure than intravenously administered chemotherapy. In this study, this submicron
      particle paclitaxel will be injected directly into the prostate lesion in men with prostate
      cancer scheduled for prostatectomy on up to three different occasions. All subjects in the
      study will receive NanoPac and will be evaluated to see if NanoPac is safe, well-tolerated,
      and has an impact on prostate cancer.
