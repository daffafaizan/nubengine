      evaluated. then patient were treated using large dose of prednisone 60mg daily plus
      intra-lesional injection of Triamcinolone Acetonide every week until no further improvement
      of the lesion occurred (stage I) at this stage the patients pain would be evaluated and
      lesion size would be measured .
