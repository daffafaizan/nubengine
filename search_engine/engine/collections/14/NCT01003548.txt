      cultured in microdrops of culture media in incubators with controlled temperature, humidity
      and atmosphere. However, these culture systems are static, while in vivo the initial growth
      of the embryo takes place in the uterine tube and they are submitted to a dynamic
      environment. The aim of this study is to compare the embryo development on days 2 and 3 of
      culture morphological features of embryos under static and dynamic(microfluidics) systems of
      culture.
