      placebo-meditation and a slow-breathing exercise in response to double-blind intravenous
      administration (IV) of naloxone/placebo-saline and noxious heat stimulation. The aim of this
      study is to determine if slow-breathing induced analgesia is associated with the release of
      endogenous opioids. The proposed study will disentangle the specific stage of cognitive
      and/or respiration-based involvement (if any) of opioidergically mediated pain relief, a
      critical step in identifying the specific analgesic mechanisms corresponding to mindfulness
      based cognitive techniques.
