      15-35) with ACL reconstruction (ACLR), it will be investigated if poor sensorimotor function
      at baseline (1 year post ACLR), such as hop performance, muscle strength and postural
      orientation can predict 1) graft rupture 2) the risk of contra-lateral ACL injury and 3)
      failure to return to sport/previous activity level within 3 years following ACLR.

      Statistics Separate logistic regression models will be used to elucidate the influence of
      each muscle sensorimotor function variable on the outcomes (graft rupture, contra-lateral
      injury, return to sport/activity level failure), adjusted for potential confounders. With the
      LSI for the single-leg hop test as main outcome, power calculations show that with a
      re-injury rate of 7%, an estimated odds ratio of 0.95, power=80% and alpha=5 %, at least 174
      individuals are needed. Based on this calculation, 200 individuals will be included for the
      prospective analysis, allowing for an approximate drop-out of 10%.
