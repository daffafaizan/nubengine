      treat people with MDS or CMML, or low-blast AML as a combination treatment with azacitidine.
      This study will look at the overall survival, event free survival and response to treatment
      in people who take pevonedistat and azacitidine when compared to people who take single-agent
      azacitidine.

      The study will enroll 120 participants. Once enrolled, participants will be randomly assigned
      (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groups in 28-day treatment
      cycles:

        -  Pevonedistat 20 mg/m^2 and azacitidine 75 mg/m^2 combination

        -  Single-agent azacitidine 75 mg/m^2

      All participants will receive azacitidine via intravenous or subcutaneous route. Participants
      randomized to the combination arm will also receive pevonedistat intravenous infusion.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this
      study is approximately 44 months. Participants will attend the end-of-treatment visit 30 days
      after the last dose of study drug or before the start of subsequent anti-neoplastic therapy
      if that occurs sooner. Participants will enter event-free survival follow-up or response
      follow-up (study visits every 3 months) if their disease has not transformed to AML (for
      participants with HR MDS or CMML) or progressed (for participants with low-blast AML), and
      they have not started subsequent therapy. Participants will also enter overall survival
      follow-up (contacted every 3 months to document subsequent therapies and survival status).
