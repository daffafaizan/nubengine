      postoperative pain and muscle spasms in breast reconstruction patients. Additional high-level
      evidence is necessary to justify the use of Botox in breast cancer patients, which
      potentially will improve the reconstructive process for these patients and improve quality of
      life. Additionally, there have been no studies to date that have evaluated patient
      satisfaction and QOL in this setting. The investigators will evaluate patient satisfaction
      and QOL using the Breast-QÂ© during different time periods after two-stage tissue
      expander/implant reconstruction. Previous studies have demonstrated a reduction in pain when
      Botox was used during tissue expander/implant breast reconstruction, however, these studies
      were not blinded which may introduce bias. Additionally, a timely reconstruction is important
      to the patient, and a decrease in pain may result in a shorter fill interval and an increased
      total amount of volume in the tissue expander. The investigators will therefore document both
      the amount of expansion that a patient can tolerate at each follow-up visit and the total
      volume expanded, and compare the data between the Botox group to the group assigned to
      placebo.
