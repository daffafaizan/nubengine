      to understand moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) are the gap between intention and
      behaviour and the lack of consideration of implicit processes in behavioural enactment. Thus,
      new models are now being examined that attempt to consider these potential limitations.
      Multi-Process Action Control (M-PAC) is one such attempt to build a more comprehensive
      schematic, whereby intention is established via the means of constructs from traditional
      social cognitive theories (i.e., outcome expectations, perceived capability), but the success
      of translating this intention to behaviour depends on behavioural-regulation (self-regulatory
      tactics) (BR), affective judgments (expected pleasure) (AJ) and opportunity (time, access).
      Over time, M-PAC proposes that habit (stimulus -behaviour bonds) and identity (role-behaviour
      bonds) develop from performing the behaviour and largely contribute to the maintenance of PA.

      Aim: The purpose of this study was to conduct at two-arm parallel design, RCT to determine if
      the M-PAC experimental group would demonstrate greater change in PA and post-intention
      constructs across time.

      Methods: Participants (n=94) were inactive new gym members and were randomized into a control
      or M-PAC experimental group. The experimental group attended a workshop and received a
      booster phone call follow-up at week four. Measures for both groups included accelerometry
      and M-PAC at baseline and at week eight.
