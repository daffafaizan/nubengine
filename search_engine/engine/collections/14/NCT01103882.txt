      who undergo large diameter 4th generation ceramic bearing total hip Arthroplasty ("THA") in
      comparison to historical data on 3rd generation CoC THA (28mm) patients. Specifically the
      study intends to address the following research topics:

        1. The incidence of dislocation after THA with use of the 4th generation Ceramic Bearing in
           comparison to 3rd generation Ceramic Bearing.

        2. The incidence of ceramic fracture after THA with use of the 4th generation Ceramic
           Bearing in comparison to 3rd generation Ceramic Bearing

        3. The survival rate, wear rate, and incidence of osteolysis of THA with use of the 4th
           generation Ceramic Bearing

        4. Range of motion improvement from preoperative to postoperative to support Korean sitting
           style after THA with use of the 4th generation Ceramic Bearing.

        5. Clinical outcomes, activity level and QoL of patients with use of the 4th generation
           Ceramic Bearing.

        6. The performance of THA with use of the new ceramic bearing mostly in patients younger
           than 50 years.
