      imaging probe, which selectively binds collagen type I. Collagen deposition is a pivotal
      event in several human conditions including pulmonary fibrosis. The investigator's studies in
      mice showed that [68Ga]CBP8 binds collagen with high affinity and has excellent
      pharmacological and pharmacokinetic profiles with high target uptake and low retention in
      background tissues and organs. [68Ga]CBP8 was shown in a mouse model to be effective for
      detecting lung fibrosis. [68Ga]CBP8 showed high specificity for pulmonary fibrosis and high
      target:background ratios in diseased animals. In addition, [68Ga]CBP8 could be used to
      monitor response to treatment. Ex vivo analysis of lung tissue from patients with IPF
      supported the animal findings.

      The investigators thus aim to perform the first in human studies of [68Ga]CBP8:

        1. To evaluate the safety of [68Ga]CBP8 and its whole body distribution, metabolism,
           pharmacokinetics, and radiation burden in healthy volunteers.

        2. To establish the accuracy of [68Ga]CBP8-PET to detect radiation-induced fibrosis in lung
           cancer patients and correlate collagen-targeted [68Ga]CBP8-PET imaging with HRCT and
           histology in lung cancer patients.

        3. To determine whether collagen deposition as assessed by [68Ga]CBP8-PET molecular imaging
           can predict disease progression in IPF patients and patients with other types of ILD
           with a fibrotic component.
