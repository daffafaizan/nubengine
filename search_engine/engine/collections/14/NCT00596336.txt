      68 patients with stage A CLL who have not been treated, and 34 healthy age and sex matched
      volunteers who fulfil the entry requirements will be identified and invited to take part in
      this study.

      Blood samples will be taken for baseline studies [FBC, U&E, LFT, Immunoglobulins (Igs),
      haemagglutinin titres] (20 mls) and T cells studies (50 mls to be frozen).If CLL prognostic
      factors have not already been determined a further 20ml will be taken for these.

      Patients will be randomized to either:

      Group A Vaccination with current trispecific influenza vaccine Day 1

      or

      Group B Vaccination with current trispecific influenza vaccine Day 1, together with the
      application of Imiquimod cream to the vaccination site on day 2 to 6.

      Blood samples will be taken on day 0 for haemagglutinin studies (20 ml) and T cells (50ml to
      be frozen), then on day 7, 14 for T-cell studies (50 ml) and day 28 for haemagglutinin
      studies (20 ml). During the 28 days that subjects participate in the trial approximately 190
      ml will be taken in total.

      Antibody and T-cell responses to influenza virus will be assessed and compared between the
      two patient arms of the study and the control group.
