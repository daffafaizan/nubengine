      receive the video education via an application (app) on a tablet computer, or usual care
      (which consists of information in the form of a handout but no further education prior to
      seeing the Primary Care Provider - PCP). To control for exposure to the tablet computer,
      subjects in both groups will use the tablet computer to fill out the self-reported outcome
      measures.

      This will all take place while the patient is waiting to see their PCP, who will be blinded
      to the educational intervention that the patient received. After enrollment and completion of
      baseline outcome measures and surveys, the subject will be randomized to one of the 2 arms,
      receive the intervention, and then proceed to have their appointment with their PCP. The
      appointment with the PCP will proceed per usual care standards, with no additional research
      interventions. The subjects will be contacted for a follow-up at 1 and 6 months for
      assessment of self-reported outcomes measuring pain, function, and disability. The
      investigators will also abstract healthcare utilization from claims data and compare
      variables of healthcare use between both groups over the 6-month period following enrollment
      (radiographs, MRIs, prescription opioids, and specialty referrals).
