      (SPSS) version 22 (IBM SPSS Statistics; IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY). One sample
      Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test was used evaluate the distribution of variables prior to test
      selection. Group characteristics and outcome measures are described using mean and standard
      deviations for continuous variables and frequencies and proportions for categorical
      variables. Descriptive statistics were presented as median for the non-normally distributed
      quantitative and ordinal data and number (percentage) for the categorical variables.
      Differences in continuous variables (age, education, BMI, duration of diagnosis,) among
      groups were analyzed with the Mann Whitney U. Statistical differences in COPM and PEDI scores
      between baseline and post-treatment was analyzed with "Wilcoxon's signed-rank test" within
      groups. The z-score obtained from the Wilcoxon signed-rank test was reported to present a
      standardized measure of the difference between the mean ranks of the negative and positive
      groups. Comparison of changes between groups were analyzed with "Mann-Whitney U" test for
      COPM and PEDI scores. Statistical significance level was assumed at p<0.05.

      Clinical significance was calculated by using the Cohen d effect size index in independent
      groups. Clinical significance was determined according to Cohen's recommended limit values
      (0,2 small; 0,5 moderate and 0,8 large effect).
