      cause of death in the U.S.

      In this study we propose to test the following in patients with CAD:

        -  Determine whether experiences assessed randomly throughout the day are associated with
           changes in the blood supply to your heart muscle as measured by electrical recordings
           from your chest.

        -  Determine whether typical daily experiences are associated with changes in the recovery
           time portion of your heart beat cycle as measured by electrical recordings from your
           chest.

        -  Determine whether changes in the recovery time portion of your heart beat cycle
           associated with typical daily experiences occur exclusively with changes in the blood
           supply to your heart muscle.

        -  Determine whether typical daily experiences influences blood supply and recovery time
           based on the severity and presence of CAD (when comparing CAD patients to healthy
           subjects).
