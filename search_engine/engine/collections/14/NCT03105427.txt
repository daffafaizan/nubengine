      patients undergoing a non-cardiac surgery suffer perioperative myocardial infarcts going
      along with a perioperative mortality rate of about 11,6%. Possibilities to preoperatively
      identify patients at risk are limited and prophylactic interventions are not yet established
      or controversial.

      Selected leukocyte subpopulations have been demonstrated to be associated with higher risk
      for cardiovascular events.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the potential use of regulatory T cells as preoperative
      risk stratification tool in order to improve clinical risk stratification and reduce
      perioperative morbidity and mortality. Therefore, high-risk cardiovascular patients scheduled
      for major non-cardiac surgery will be recruited. Blood will be drawn at predefined time
      points before surgery and up to three days postoperatively. Leukocytes will be analyzed by
      flow cytometry. During 30 day follow up adverse cardiovascular events will be recorded. ECGs
      will be recorded preoperatively and on post-OP day 3. High-sensitive cardiac Troponin T will
      be measured prior to the operation and on post-OP day one to three. The patient chart will be
      screened for cardiovascular events up to day 30. A telephone interview will be performed to
      detect cardiovascular events after discharge until post-OP day 30.
