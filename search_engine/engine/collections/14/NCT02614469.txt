      subjects per group to receive a single oral dose of 1000 mg inosine with or without food on
      day 1 after an overnight fast. Subjects who receive inosine with food on day 1 will receive a
      second dose of inosine without food on day 8 after an overnight fast. Subjects who receive
      inosine without food on day 1 after an overnight fast will receive a second dose of inosine
      with food on day 8 after an overnight fast.

      Subjects will be admitted to the clinic before dinner on days 0 and 7, the days before
      dosing, and will stay in the clinic for 48-h post-dose. During the clinic stay, blood samples
      will be taken for urate measurements.
