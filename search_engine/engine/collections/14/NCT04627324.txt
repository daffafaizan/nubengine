      3D motion-capture device inside of a modified toothbrush holder. The computer program
      displays a toothbrushing animation in the mirror. Toothbrush motions detected by sensors
      embedded inside the holder are captured and sent to the server for analysis.

      The investigators evaluated the efficacy of TBI with a STM system by analyzing the reductions
      of the modified Quigley-Hein plaque index in

        1. st study - 60 volunteers (adults) - The data for which have been published (reference)

        2. nd study - 42 volunteers (schoolchildren) - manuscript prepared

        3. rd study - 60 volunteers (adults and children)

      These participants were separated randomly into two groups: conventional TBI (control group)
      and STM system TBI (experimental group).

      The changes in the plaque indexes were recorded immediately, 1 week, 1 month, and 10 months
      (1st study only) after TBI.
