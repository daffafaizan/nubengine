      failure or intolerance to doxorubicin, there is no standard of care. In Europe, two are
      currently approved for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma after failure/intolerance to
      doxorubicin: trabectedin (Yondelis®) for all histological subtype and pazopanib (Votrient ®)
      for all subtypes excluding liposarcomas. Nevertheless, none of these drugs improve the
      overall survival over placebo.

      The study is composed of 3 periods:

        1. A Screening Period,

        2. A Treatment Period,

        3. And a Survival Follow-up Period. Patients randomized to be treated with regorafenib will
           receive the treatment orally for 3 weeks of every 4 week (28 days) cycle (ie, 3 weeks
           on/1 week off).

      Patients randomized to the placebo arm will be treated for 3 weeks of every 4 weeks cycle
      (ie, 3 weeks on/1 week off).

      In addition to the regorafenib and placebo treatments, patients will receive best supportive
      care. Best supportive care includes any method to preserve the comfort and dignity of the
      patients and excludes any disease-specific anti-neoplastic therapy such as any kinase
      inhibitor,chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or surgical intervention.

      Patients receiving placebo, who experience disease progression may be offered open-label
      regorafenib(cross-over option).
