      strategic extensions toward discovery for treatments of challenging behavior. AIM 1: In the
      service of this goal, the investigators aim to evaluate the accuracy of an efficient
      alternative to demand-curve analysis (i.e., progressive ratio reinforcer analysis) in
      quantifying reinforcer value (i.e., Pmax). AIM 2: Investigators also aim to evaluate the
      utility of manipulating baseline reinforcement parameters for controlling bursts when those
      manipulations are informed by the results of demand-curve analysis.
