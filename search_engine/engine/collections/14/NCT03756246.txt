      and depressed people. Specifically subjects are provided a mild immune stimulus, an influenza
      vaccine, and their responses are monitored. The goals are to determine whether patients with
      depression experience a temporary worsening of mood in response to the stimulus and whether
      this is associated with measurable differences in the cytokine response to the vaccine.
      Additionally, patients with depression may be less likely to mount a successful antibody
      response to vaccination as healthy people based on circumstantial evidence, and this study
      will assess whether this the case.

      This study aims to recruit a sample of 15 healthy and 60 depressed participants. The 15
      healthy participants will be age and gender matched to the first 15 depressed participants
      recruited. Three more sets of age and gender matched depressed subjects will be recruited.
      This will result in 15 sets of "quintuplets" (4 depressed and one healthy), that are matched
      by age and gender. The study consists of four visits. The first visit is the baseline
      assessment where participants will receive the influenza vaccine. Participants will then
      return 1, 3 and 28 days after receiving the vaccine to assess their responses.
