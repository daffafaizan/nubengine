    
      The study is a global, multicentre prospective, randomised, single blind, blinded endpoint
      study comparing rates of early recanalisation (defined by mAOL) in Acute Ischaemic Stroke
      (AIS) subjects with visible occlusion who are treated with either IV tPA plus sham device or
      IV tPA in combination with the MED System procedure.

      The study population will be randomised 1:1 into two arms:

        -  A Sham Control Group (SCG) and an

        -  Experimental Treatment Group (ETG).

      The ETG will receive IV tPA and the complete MED System procedure consisting of MED
      MicroBeads and the MED Workstation magnet procedure. The SCG will not receive MED MicroBeads
      while the MED Workstation will be activated as a Sham control. Subjects will be blinded to
      treatment arm. Stratification will be performed based upon baseline age and location of the
      occlusion (Middle Cerebral Artery segments M1, M2, or Carotid Terminus).
