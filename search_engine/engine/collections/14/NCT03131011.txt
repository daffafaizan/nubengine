      inclusion/exclusion criteria will be offered voluntary participation in this trial.
      Recruitment will be open for approximately 18 months; it is anticipated that 1-2 patients
      will be recruited per week until the planned sample size is met. Participants will be
      stratified into three groups depending on their self-reported baseline Body-image
      satisfaction (BIS) score and will then be randomly allocated to receive conventional dark ink
      or UV fluorescent tattoos using permutated block randomization (4 patients per block) to
      ensure balance of BIS baseline average between study arms.

      The investigators focus is to improve the current tattooing technique for breast cancer
      patients by introducing an alternate method that takes the patient's psychological
      perceptions of tattooing into account while first and foremost, continuing to guarantee that
      the current standard of accuracy in treatment delivery is maintained or improved. The
      investigators goal of decreasing the psychological effect of permanent radiotherapy tattoos
      aligns with CancerCare Manitoba's mission to improve the outcomes and quality of life for
      Manitobans with cancer.
