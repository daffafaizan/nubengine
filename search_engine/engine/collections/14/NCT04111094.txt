      identifying which patients will experience estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) loss
      are needed. Recently, urinary dickkopf-3 (DKK3) has been identified as a stress-induced,
      renal tubular epithelia-derived, secreted glycoprotein that induces tubulointerstitial
      fibrosis. Urinary DKK3 has been found to predict eGFR loss in patients with CKD, independent
      of presence of albuminuria. The investigators sought to examine the association between DKK3
      and loss of eGFR in patients with heart failure (HF). Also, the investigators hypothesized
      that changes in DKK3 under treatment may be helpful to monitor individual kidney disease
      course.
