      treated by dual antiplatelet therapy, which standard part represents clopidogrel. The
      response to clopidogrel in population exhibits wide interindividual variability. According to
      some recent works, patients with clopidogrel resistance are in higher risk for recurrence of
      myocardial infarction in comparison with the patients with sufficient clopidogrel
      effectiveness. The treatment of clopidogrel resistance is still unknown. Our project should
      contribute to the better understanding of the clinical impact of clopidogrel resistance and
      its genetical determination. We will test the hypothesis, whether the clopidogrel resistance
      could be influenced by higher dose of this drug or by replacement to ticlopidine (ADP
      antagonist with different biotransformation in the liver). Therefore, 500 pts. will be tested
      to clopidogrel resistance. We expect 5-10% of resistent pts. This pts. will be treated by
      higher dose (150mg or 225mg/day) with repeated tests of clopidogrel effectiveness after each
      dose enhancement. If 225mg/day will be insufficient, clopidogrel will be replaced by
      ticlopidine with repeated test. We expect, that better definition of clinical and and genetic
      correlate of clopidogrel resistance will improve our knowledge of this disorder.
      Nevertheless, the achievement of sufficient effect of clopidogrel in some still resistant
      patients will lead to the improvement of the treatment
