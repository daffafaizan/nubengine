           alterations present in hemiparesis. Three modes were created for each exercise: assisted
           active, active and resisted active executions. Besides explanatory text, there were
           illustrative photos for all exercises and their modes.

        2. Program Execution: All groups were submitted to a motor evaluation utilizing the
           Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) and functional evaluation utilizing the Functional
           independence measure (FIM). After assessment, for the patients of the home-based
           exercise group (HBG) a group of home exercises was selected for each patient; these
           exercises were explained and performed one by one. The home-exercises were re-executed
           at each fortnightly visit, when any necessary correction was made. The next steps
           stipulated by the manual were taken, providing the patients with more complex exercises
           according to their progress. The patients in the supervised exercise training group
           (SEG) participated in supervised individual exercise sessions two times per week. A
           physical therapist supervised these sessions. Exercise sessions included: 30 minutes of
           global exercises that involved stretching, range of motion, muscle strengthen and
           another 30 minutes of functional training (gait, balance and use of the arm in daily
           activities).The control group (CG) was assessed but reluctant or unable to regularly
           attend a supervised exercise program. The groups were reassessed after six months.

        3. Program assessment: The Fugl-Meyer Assessment score and the Functional independence
           measure score, measured at baseline and after six months, were compared between the
           groups.
