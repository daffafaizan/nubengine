      neurodevelopment and learning disorders in children born to HIV-infected mothers, exposed to
      the virus and to antiretrovirals (ARVs).

      The evaluation of the executive functioning will be done by the score obtained at the
      preschool BRIEF for patients and control group issued from questionnaires filled by the
      mothers of the cases and the mothers of the controls, with matching on age, sex, level of
      parental education and socio-economic and cultural environment.

      Within the group of exposed children, factors associated with executive dysfunction including
      HIV infection, antiretroviral exposure, maternal socio-demographic data, sociocultural and
      environmental level will be investigated.

      Evolution of the scores between J0, M12 and M24 will be compared within the group of exposed
      children.

      Compared with a control group, the child's intelligence quotient, overall development,
      behavior and language will be compared at each follow-up time (D0, M12 and M24).
