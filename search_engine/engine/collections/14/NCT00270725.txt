      infected patients in sub-Saharan Africa and other resource-limited areas. In South Africa, an
      increasing number of private sector firms are providing access to ART for their employees.
      One of the barriers to such action, however, is the lack of available information on the
      success of ART in restoring workers to full productivity, retaining skilled employees in the
      workforce, and reducing the costs of medical care and death and disability benefits. HIV
      infected employees on ART may be absent from work less often than untreated HIV infected
      employees, but more often than HIV uninfected employees. This study will collect data from an
      independent HIV/AIDS disease treatment program and a large private sector employer in
      Johannesburg, South Africa to estimate the benefits and costs for businesses to provide ART
      to eligible employees.

      The study will combine individual-level medical outcome and treatment cost data from the
      treatment program with data on employee work attendance and retention in the workforce from
      the participating employer. The work attendance of HIV infected employees enrolled in the
      HIV/AIDS treatment program (index participants) who are either taking ART or receiving
      pre-ART care will be compared with each other and with that of HIV uninfected employees.
      There are no study visits associated with this study; all data will be collected from medical
      records maintained by the HIV/AIDS treatment program and the participants' employer. The
      financial costs and benefits of the treatment program for the participating company will also
      be estimated.
