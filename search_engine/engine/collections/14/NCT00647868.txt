    
      This pharmacokinetic trial is performed with the aim to determine the pharmacokinetic
      behavior of testosterone after repeated nasal administration of NASOBOL® in patients with
      hypogonadism and to compare the levels of the major analytes to levels seen in normal healthy
      men. For this purpose, four different treatment schedules of administration of NASOBOL® will
      be tested and compared to 24-h levels in normal healthy men.

      This is a Phase I, pharmacokinetic trial with different administration schemes of NASOBOL® in
      patients with moderate hypogonadism (Groups 1, 2 and 3). For reference purposes frequent
      blood samples will be taken in a group of healthy men (Group 4). Subjects will be screened
      for eligibility not more than 4 weeks before the 1st dose of NASOBOL®. Total study duration
      for hypogonadal patients is maximally 38 days (including a 3 days placebo run-in phase).
      Healthy men will be screened for eligibility and will be in the clinic for only 1 day (with
      overnight stay) during the study.

      For hypogonadal patients 7 visits to the clinic are planned, amongst which 2 visits for 24-h
      PK sampling each with an overnight stay. Seven days after the last dose of NASOBOL®
      hypogonadal patients will be asked to come to the clinic for a final follow-up visit.

      Telephone follow-ups will be done on Days 7, 13, 21 and 27 to check whether subjects have
      taken their medication.
