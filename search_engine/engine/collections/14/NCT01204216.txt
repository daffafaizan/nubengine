      diabetes and in subjects with diabetes at stable glycemic control. The second Specific Aim
      tests the hypothesis that mean RBC age will not change in subjects with diabetes studied
      initially in poor glycemic control, and again after being treated to stable, improved
      glycemic control for >8 months. To accomplish the two aims, RBC survival and mean blood
      glucose will be determined at two times separated by at least eight months in 10 subjects
      without diabetes, 10 subjects with diabetes and stable glycemic control, and up to 15
      subjects with diabetes in initial poor glycemic control in order to re-study 10 subjects
      subsequently in improved glycemic control. The RBC survival will be measured using the same
      novel biotin RBC label in conjunction with mean glucose determination by continuous glucose
      monitoring. Mean blood glucose will be assessed using blood glucose testing meter ,
      continuous glucose monitoring equipment, HbA1c, fructosamine and glycated albumin
      determinations HbA1c is the most highly valued clinical test for long term monitoring of
      glycemic control and the prediction of diabetes complications risk is relied upon for
      hundreds of thousands of clinical decisions made every year in veterans with diabetes. The
      proposed studies, by further defining RBC survival stability necessary to develop a new
      approach to HbA1c interpretation, therefore has the potential to dramatically support the
      Department of Veterans Affairs in its mission to reduce the burden of diabetes and its
      complications
