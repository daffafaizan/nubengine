      and Niger demonstrated that biannual oral azithromycin distributions to children aged 1-59
      months significantly reduced child mortality. The investigators hypothesize that biannual
      administration of azithromycin to children aged 1-11 months will reduce mortality in this age
      group. The aim of the project is to demonstrate that this intervention can be scaled up and
      produce the same benefits on mortality as those documented in smaller, more controlled
      studies. Since 1986, to reduce child mortality, Burkina Faso has been administering high-dose
      vitamin A supplementation to children aged 6-59 months on a biannual basis through the "Child
      Health Days" platform. The "Child Health days" are a door-to-door distribution of vitamin A
      coupled with screening for acute malnutrition in children aged 6-59 months and deworming of
      children aged 12-59 months. This approach has been successful but expensive. A new strategy
      implemented since September 2017 relies on community-based health workers (CBHWs) to
      distribute Vitamin A in rural areas, and on community-based distributors (CDs) in urban
      areas. Based on expert opinion and the preliminary findings of formative research conducted
      by the Ministry of Health and Helen Keller International, it was agreed that the Child Health
      Days platform was the most appropriate platform to implement the biannual administration of
      azithromycin to children aged 1 to 11 months.
