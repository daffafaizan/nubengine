      I. Determine the feasibility of adding hunger training to the Diabetes Prevention Program
      (DPP) using the following criteria: accrual rates > 50%, attrition rates < 20% and, in the
      DPP-plus-hunger training (HT) group, training protocol adherence rates > 75%.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Estimate the magnitude of effect sizes and variation in outcome variables for the DPP-only
      and DPP-plus-HT interventions on changes in weight; in metabolic and breast cancer risk
      biomarkers (e.g., fasting insulin and blood glucose [BG] levels, levels of glycosylated
      hemoglobin, insulin resistance, adiponectin, interleukin-6, and C-reactive protein); and in
      proposed behavioral mediators (e.g., reduction in total energy intake, overall eating
      frequency, percent of eating events occurring at or below the average fasting blood BG
      level).

      II. Examine the mediation effects of proposed mechanisms of the interventions related to
      individual-level behavioral measures of eating self-regulation on the proposed outcomes using
      a multimodal approach of validated questionnaires and reliable ecological momentary
      assessment method.

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP A: Participants take part in DPP once a week over 1 hour for 16 weeks.

      GROUP B: Participants take part in DPP once a week over 1 hour for 16 weeks and hunger
      training once a week during weeks 2-6.
