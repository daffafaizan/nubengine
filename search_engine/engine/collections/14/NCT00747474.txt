      cytotoxic activities against a variety of human tumor cell lines in vitro and anti-tumor
      activities in several xenograft models with human tumor cell lines. Structurally, TLC388 HCl
      is related to other camptothecins, but it has been chemically modified to improve stability
      and potency, and to minimize toxicities.
