    
      Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide-38 (PACAP38) plays a role in migraine
      pathophysiology. Infusions of PACAP38 can trigger migraine-like attacks in some migraine
      patients and will induce flushing in all patients. We are investigating whether treatment
      with sumatriptan has an effect on the PACAP38-induced flushing and on whether headache and
      migraine is induced.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate PACAP38-induced headache and migraine in patients
      with migraine who have been treated with either sumatriptan or placebo using
      purpose-developed standardized interview. The study will be conducted with a double-blind,
      placebo-controlled crossover study design.
