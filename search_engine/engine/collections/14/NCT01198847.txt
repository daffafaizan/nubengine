      good habits for the whole family. Our aim is to see if we can prevent overweight and obesity
      in children in families where parents are overweight or obese. Normal weight parents will
      also be needed in this study.

      Background Life is in constant change and affects our habits. In many ways this is positive
      but it also contributes to less favorable health factors. For example, take the car instead
      of cycling, take the lift instead of the stairs. This makes us less active in everyday life.
      Individuals also eat more unhealthy foods in larger portions. In combination with genetics,
      social in heritage and surrounding factors this contributes to increase overweight and
      obesity among children not only in adults but also in children.

      Good treatment methods for childhood obesity are lacking, making prevention very important.
      The earlier good habits are introduced to a child the better it is.

      In Early STOPP project we study food, physical activity and sleep habits in the families with
      a little child. The height, weight, waist circumference and blood pressure will be recorded
      in both child and parents. The parents will answer questionnaires about food, physical
      activity and sleeping habits for both the child and themselves. During the study, the child's
      physical activity will be measured.
