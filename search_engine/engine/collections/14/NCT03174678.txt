      rehabilitation were enrolled in the study. Group Dex (n=50) received 1Âµg/kg dexmedetomidine
      in apple juice and Group control (n=50) received apple juice only. Patients' Ramsey Sedation
      Scale (RSS), The Parental Seperation Anxiety Scale (PSAS), Mask Acceptance Scale (MAS) and
      Post anesthesia emergence delirium scale (PAEDS) and hemodynamic parameters were noted from
      their patient file. Premedication period was 45 minutes and measurements of RSS and
      hemodynamic parameters were recorded in baseline and every 15 minutes until the patients were
      transferred to the operating room. The data were analysed using the Kruskal-Wallis test, two
