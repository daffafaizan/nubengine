      patients with recurrent or refractory, platinum resistant ovarian epithelial or primary
      peritoneal carcinoma who have failed on higher priority treatment protocols. II. Determine
      the nature and degree of toxicity of this drug in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours. Treatment continues every 21 days for
      a maximum of 9 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.
      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 22-60 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-14
      months.
