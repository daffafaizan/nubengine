      role in regulating the T-cell anti tumor response. Blocking this interaction with the anti
      PD-L1 monoclonal antibody durvalumab has proven to be effective resulting in durable disease
      control rates. Currently, PD-L1 expression as determined by immune histochemistry (IH) is the
      best available biomarker for treatment response, but standardized scoring criteria are
      lacking and the risk for sampling errors exists. Molecular imaging using 89Zr-labeled
      antibodies may overcome these limitations, enabling the visualization of PD-L1 expression in
      primary and metastatic tumor lesions and providing information on the in vivo accessibility
      of the PD-L1 target following intravenous administration. Besides, a baseline FDG-PET scan
      will be performed.
