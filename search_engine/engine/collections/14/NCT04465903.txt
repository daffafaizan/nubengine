      network. The function can be evaluated using instrumental, such as fibreoptic endoscopic
      evaluation of swallowing (FEES), videofluoroscopy, or well structured questionnaires. There
      are many questionnaire and scales for assessment of swallow but very few have been validated.
      The study will assess the construct validity and reliability of the Turkish version of
      Self-report Symptom Inventory as known as Sydney Swallow Questionnaire. The investigators
      developed the Turkish version of this questionnaire (SSQ-T), according to the cross-cultural
      adaptation guidelines. Two translators translated the SSQ into Turkish and a native English
      language speaker reverse-translated it into English. The back translation was sent to the
      original author for proofreading. The SSQ questionnaire consisted of 17 basic questions
      related with dysphagia symptoms.
