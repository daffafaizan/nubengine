      Primary

        -  Estimate the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose of vinblastine when
           given in combination with carboplatin in pediatric patients with newly diagnosed or
           recurrent low-grade gliomas.

        -  Define and describe the acute and dose-limiting toxicities of this regimen.

        -  Describe the toxicities associated with repeated courses of the combination chemotherapy
           regimen and the number of treatment modifications required over the course of treatment.

      Secondary

        -  Describe the radiographic responses in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Describe changes in diffusion/perfusion imaging during study therapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of vinblastine. Patients are stratified
      according to amount of prior therapy (heavily pretreated vs less heavily pretreated).

      Patients receive carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1 and vinblastine IV on days 1, 8, 15.
      Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of vinblastine until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 30 days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18 patients will be accrued for this study.
