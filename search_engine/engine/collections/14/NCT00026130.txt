        -  Determine the overall survival of patients with locally advanced non-metastatic
           pancreatic adenocarcinoma treated with gemcitabine, fluorouracil, and radiotherapy.

        -  Determine the time to progression in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the overall clinical response in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes once weekly and fluorouracil IV continuously
      on days 1-5 weekly for 6 weeks. Patients concurrently undergo radiotherapy 5 days a week for
      6 weeks.

      Three weeks after the completion of chemoradiotherapy, patients receive gemcitabine IV over
      30 minutes once weekly on weeks 1-3. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for a total of 4 courses
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 2 months for 1 year and then every 3 months for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 78 patients will be accrued for this study within 24 months.
