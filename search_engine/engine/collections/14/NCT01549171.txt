      cyclooxygenase. These enzyme systems synthesize abundant prostacyclin (PGI2). In the
      fallopian tube PGI2 causes smooth muscle relaxation, possibly facilitating tubal transport of
      gametes and embryos. Huang et al reported that addition of the PGI2 analogue Iloprost to
      embryo culture media significantly enhanced mouse embryo development to the blastocyst and
      complete hatched stages. The implantation and live birth rates of Iloprost cultured embryos
      were significantly better than non-Iloprost embryos in the mouse model. The mean weights of
      fetal mice were not significant different from control group. There was no teratogenic effect
      observed.

      In a previously presented study, the investigators cultured donated frozen human zygotes in
      culture media with and without the addition of Iloprost. The Iloprost treated embryos showed
      significantly better growth rate and morphology, as determined by the size, and grading of
      the trophectoderm and inner cell mass.

      Iloprost is FDA approved for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension. It has a significantly
      longer half-life than native PGI2. Iloprost is a class C pregnancy drug and has not been
      associated with teratogenic effects. This study intends to expand the usage of Iloprost to
      culture embryos.
