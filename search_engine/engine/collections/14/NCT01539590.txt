      elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Whereas early recanalization undoubtedly salvages
      myocardial tissue, reperfusion following prolonged ischemia can also exacerbate injury.
      Infarct size needs to be limited, and the conditions favoring adaptive ventricular healing
      and remodeling optimized because in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) who do
      not die of out-of-hospital arrhythmias, long-term prognosis is dependent on the amount of
      myocardium that is lost, and the outcome of ventricular remodeling. Angion Biomedical Corp.
      has identified BB3, a small molecule mimetic of hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor
      (HGF/SF) whose activity is expected to preserve tissue viability and attenuate dysfunction in
      the setting of organ injury while obviating the logistical difficulties associated with gene
      or protein therapy. HGF/SF is a naturally occurring cell survival factor that holds
      significant therapeutic potential. BB3 has been shown to possess HGF/SF activities, including
      protection against heart injury following myocardial infarction. This study is designed to
      evaluate clinical efficacy of BB3 in patients presenting with acute ST segment elevation
      myocardial infarction (A-STEMI) who undergo PCI.
