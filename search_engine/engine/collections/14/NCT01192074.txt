    
      All patients presenting in labor or are having a cesarean delivery are eligible except:
      patients who are under age 18, have contraindications to regional anesthesia, in advanced
      labor, having emergency conditions and/or unable to understand the consent process.

        -  Data collected include:

        -  Ultrasound depth in transverse and oblique sagittal views

        -  Actual needle depth

        -  Level of placement

        -  Number of separate needle placements

        -  Number of needle redirects

        -  Angle of probe

        -  Angle of needle

        -  Total number of attempts

        -  Pt height

        -  Pt weight

        -  Pt BMI

        -  Pt age

        -  Pt gravity/parity

        -  Pt co-morbidities, e.g. pre-eclampsia

        -  Procedure performed

        -  Operator (Attending, CA-1, CA-2, CA-3, CRNA)

      What is currently being examined is the correlation between ultrasound depth of the target
      area vs actual needle depth
