      postoperative vomiting in paediatric patients in the first 6 hours after volatile
      anaesthetic-based general anaesthesia for tonsillectomies +/- adenoidectomies.

      Secondary Hypotheses:

        1. Jelly snakes will reduce the incidence of nausea in the first 6 hours after
           tonsillectomy +/- adenoidectomy surgery

        2. Jelly snakes will reduce rescue treatments for PONV in the first 6 hours

        3. Jelly snakes will reduce the incidence of PONV in the first 24 hours or up until
           discharge in case of tonsillectomies (whatever occurs first)

        4. Jelly snakes will reduce rescue treatments for PONV in the first 24 hours or up until
           discharge in case of tonsillectomies (whatever occurs first)

      Safety Hypotheses:

      Children will be able to chew and swallow jelly snakes post-surgery. No jelly snake or parts
      thereof will be inhaled in those receiving treatment.

      Aims This pilot study aims to investigate if chewing jelly confectionary snakes after
      tonsillectomies +/- adenoidectomies will significantly reduce the incidence of postoperative
      nausea/vomiting (PONV) in children.

      Study Design One site pilot trial of the effectiveness of chewy jelly snakes in the
      prevention of POV involving the Royal Aberdeen Children Hospital, UK.
