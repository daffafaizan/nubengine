      reluctant to apply compressive stockings to patients with diabetes and swollen legs due to
      fear of exacerbating the symptoms of PAD. The study sock is a newly formulated sock that
      offers mild compression (18-25mmHg). The sock is made especially for the diabetic patient who
      suffers from concomitant lower extremity edema.

      Eighty patients with diabetes and lower extremity edema will be recruited. Upon ensuring
      enrollment criteria are met, baseline edema (as measured by circumference of foot, ankle and
      calf), ankle brachial index (ABI), skin perfusion pressure, and cutaneous fluid level (as
      measured by MoistureMeter) will be assessed. Subjects will then be provided four pairs of
      socks. Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 distribution to receive either the mild
      compression diabetic socks or a standard diabetic sock. They will return for four weekly
      follow up visits.

      Additionally a sub-set of 30 subjects will be monitored for changes in physical activity pre
      and post sock usage. Physical activity monitors will be used to assess daily physical
      activity for 48hrs prior to receiving the socks and after wearing the socks for four weeks an
      additional 48hrs will be monitored.
