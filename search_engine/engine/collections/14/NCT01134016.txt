           Antrodia camphorata.

        2. The pharmacological effects of antroquinonol were postulated to exert its
           antitumorigenesis effects through interactions to primary targets of epidermal growth
           factor receptor (EGFR)/Akt/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK).

        3. In vivo study in NOD/SCID mice with A549 subcutaneous xenografts consistently showed
           tumor growth suppression after 2 weeks of oral 30 and 60 mg/kg antroquinonol treatment.
