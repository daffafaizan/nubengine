    
      Aim 1: To determine the impact of media "frames," "labeling," and "information inclusion" on
      "implicit collusion" with a DV perpetrator.

      Hypotheses: Consumers exposed to media reports using "thematic frames" will be less likely to
      implicitly collude with perpetrators than those exposed to "episodic frames." Consumers
      exposed to DVH news stories labeled as "domestic violence" will be less likely to implicitly
      collude with perpetrators than consumers exposed to news stories labeled as "assault."
      Implicit collusion will correlate positively with the addition of non-relevant perpetrator
      "humanizing" characteristics. Consumers given negative information about the victim of DVH
      will be more likely to implicitly collude with the perpetrator than consumers given negative
      information about the perpetrator.

      Aim 2: To determine how media portrayals of domestic violence impact descriptive and
      injunctive norms about domestic violence and, ultimately, drive implicit collusion with
      perpetrators.

      Hypotheses: Controlling for individual pre-existing attitudes and social norms, consumers
      exposed to thematic frames or the label of DV will be less likely to shift their norms in a
      way that supports DV than those exposed to episodic frames or the label of assault. Consumers
      provided negative victim information or non-relevant characteristics that humanize the
      perpetrator will be more likely to shift their norms to accept DV.

      Exploratory Aim: To identify racial/ethnic, gender, age, and regional differences in DV
      social norms.

      Hypothesis: The media will differentially impact subpopulation DV attitudes, social norms and
      implicit collusion.
