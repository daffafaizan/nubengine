      conventional treatments such as medication, physical therapy, and surgery frequently do not
      provide lasting relief. We will use a standardized yoga protocol, developed specifically for
      this trial by a consensus panel of yoga experts, in a pilot randomized controlled trial for
      subjects with chronic low back pain. We will recruit 30 predominantly English-speaking
      minority adults from Boston Medical Center (BMC) and its affiliated clinics with low back
      pain lasting >12 weeks and an average pain level in the previous week of 4 or more on a scale
      of 0 to 10 (0 = no pain, 10 = worst possible pain). Subjects will be randomized to a yoga
      class once per week for 12 weeks (Group 1) or a wait-list control group (Group 2). All
      subjects will receive their usual medical care and an educational booklet designed for low
      back pain patients. Primary outcomes are 12 week pain intensity and functional status
      measured by the Roland Morris Disability scale. Secondary outcomes include analgesic use,
      health-related quality of life (SF-36), global improvement, subject satisfaction, adverse
      events, compliance, work status, and health expenditures. Group 2 will be offered yoga
      classes at 26 weeks. To refine estimates of effect size and further confirm safety of the
      protocol, we will also collect data from Group 2 during their yoga classes. This pilot will
      provide preliminary feasibility and efficacy data to plan a future adequately powered
      randomized controlled trial of yoga for chronic low back pain in predominantly minority
      subjects.
