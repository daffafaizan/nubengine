      antibodies and cellular immune responses induced by immunization to a polyvalent melanoma
      vaccine and interleukin-2 in patients with stage III malignant melanoma. II. Determine the
      optimal dose of interferon that will maximally stimulate these responses in these patients.
      III. Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are randomized into a vaccine treated control
      arm or to receive one of two doses of interferon alfa-2b plus vaccine. All patients receive
      polyvalent melanoma vaccine incorporated into interleukin-2 liposomes. The vaccine is
      administered intradermally every 2 weeks for 8 weeks, monthly for 3 months, and then every 3
      months for a total of 2 years or until disease progression. Patients assigned to arms II or
      III also receive interferon alfa-2b subcutaneously, at one of two doses, three times a week
      for 2 years. Patients are followed for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 32 patients will be accrued for this study within 18 months.
