    
      This is an observational study whereby samples will be tested to determine the presence or
      absence of fetal Y chromosome genes to test for the fetal sex of the baby. The blood draw and
      urine collection will occur between 36-42, 43-49, and 50-56 days gestation. The fetal gender
      will be requested at or soon after delivery. The accuracy of the test and the optimal time to
      perform the test during pregnancy will be assessed by comparing the test results from
      maternal blood and/or urine samples obtained between days 36 and 56 of gestation to the fetal
      sex results obtained at birth.
