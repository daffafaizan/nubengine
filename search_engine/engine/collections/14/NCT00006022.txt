        -  Determine the dose of bryostatin 1 that, when administered in conjunction with low-dose
           interleukin-2, maximizes in vitro interleukin-2- stimulated peripheral blood stem cell
           proliferation in patients with melanoma or renal cell carcinoma.

        -  Assess other intermediate markers of immune response in patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine tumor responses, response durations, progression-free intervals, and survival
           of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind study. Patients are randomized to one of three
      bryostatin 1 dose levels.

      Patients receive interleukin-2 subcutaneously daily on days 1-5 and bryostatin 1 IV over 1
      hour on day 1 weekly for 3 weeks. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 21 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
