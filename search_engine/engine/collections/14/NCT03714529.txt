    
      10 patients with BCC will be vaccinated with a peptide derived from the immune checkpoint
      molecule PD-L1. Patients will be vaccinated once every 2 weeks (Q2W) for 10 weeks and then
      evaluated for a clinical response.

      Patients with clinical response to vaccination will continue with one vaccination once every
      4 weeks (Q4W) for 12 weeks and thus receive 9 vaccinations in total over the course of 22
      weeks.

      Patients with no effect of treatment after 6 vaccinations will be treated with standard of
      care (SOC).
