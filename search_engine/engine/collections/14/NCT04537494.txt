      and fussing with no obvious cause in healthy infants less than 5 months of age. There is
      evidence to support the role of the probiotic L. reuteri for treatment of colic in breastfed
      babies and for prevention of colic. However, these two options (prevention vs
      treatment-as-needed) have not been previously compared head-to-head. The study aims determine
      if oral supplementation with the probiotic L. reuteri administered to every newborn within
      the first week of life for 12 weeks (prevention) is superior to treatment-as-needed, as
      measured by daily cry/fuss duration at 6 and 12 weeks of age.
