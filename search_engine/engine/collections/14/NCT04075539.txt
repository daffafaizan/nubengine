      spinal stenosis results in back and leg pain when standing and walking (radicular
      claudication), while symptoms regress in sitting position. The inability to stand or walk
      significantly impairs functioning and health-related quality of life of elders, and has an
      important healthcare cost.

      The 2 main treatment options for lumbar spinal stenosis are conservative or surgical
      treatments. Previous data suggested that laminectomy may be more effective on pain and
      function than conservative therapy. However, the benefit-risk balance of surgery should be
      carefully considered in this population with numerous co-morbidities, and evidence is
      inconsistent. Therefore, conservative therapy is usually the first line option. Data
      regarding exercise therapy are scarce. Flexion-based exercises are usually recommended. A
      pilot study suggested that flexion-based endurance training program, namely cycling, could be
      an effective and safe method to improve pain, function and health-related quality of life in
      elderly people with chronic lumbar pain. However, barriers to adhering to the program were
      detected and might have influenced clinical endpoints. Non-pharmacological interventions in
      spinal conditions are not 'one-size-fits-all' and measures to enhance adherence have to be
      applied.

      The hypothesis is that home-based cycling using connected ergometric bicycles associated with
      usual care could be more effective than usual care in reducing back-specific activity
      limitations at 4 months in people with lumbar spinal stenosis.
