      on March 2013 in China. The data from the phase III study suggested that the inactivated EV71
      vaccine had protection effects on healthy Chinese infants against Hand, Foot and Mouth
      disease caused by EV71 within one-year surveillance period, and had clinically acceptable
      safety and good one-year immune persistence.

      This study is the phase III, open-labelled, follow-up research, in order to evaluate the
      two-year efficacy, safety and immune persistence.
