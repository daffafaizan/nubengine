      patients with good performance status. The estimated benefit from the combination is greater
      than the possible risk, especially for the patients who will become resectable after
      treatment. It will be extremely interesting to evaluate the resectability rate of this
      specific group of patient with good performance status and unresectable disease when they are
      treated with all active chemotherapeutic agents and cetuximab
