      characterized by hypoxemic respiratory failure (the lungs are unable to absorb oxygen to the
      arterial blood) and non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema (accumulation of fluid in the lungs). The
      syndrome may be caused by direct or indirect injury to the lungs. It is associated with a
      mortality rate of up to 40-50%. There are no marketed pharmacologic therapies for this
      devastating syndrome.

      This study aims to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacodynamics of GSK2586881, a
      recombinant human angiotensin converting enzyme type 2 (rhACE2).

      ACE2 is involved in the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS), which controls blood pressure,
      electrolytes and intravascular fluid volume. A key function of rhACE2 is believed to be the
      cleavage of Angiotensin II (Ang II) to Ang (1-7), which have opposing physiological roles.
      Elevated levels of Ang II are associated with vasoconstriction, inflammation, fibrosis,
      vascular leak, and sodium absorption. Ang (1-7) appears to be a counterregulatory protein in
      the RAS; associated with vasodilation, anti-proliferation, antiinflammation, and reduced
      vascular leak. It has been observed that levels of Ang II are increased in humans with ALI/
      ARDS. It is expected that the reduction of Ang II should have a positive impact on ALI and
      ARDS.
