    
      This is a phase I/II trial designed to assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of
      neoadjuvant oral hydroxychloroquine (PlaquenilÂ®) in combination with FDR gemcitabine in
      subjects with high risk IIb or III adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. Eligible subjects will be
      administered hydroxychloroquine orally once or twice daily (depending on dose) in combination
      with FDR gemcitabine (on days 1 and 15) for 31 days prior to surgical resection. Dose
      escalations of hydroxychloroquine will proceed using Storer's Up-and-Down algorithm D.
      Subjects will be monitored for side effects and tolerability of the drug. Pre- and
      post-treatment PET scans will be the primary means to assess response to therapy. Resected
      tumors will also be assessed for evidence of inhibition of autophagy as well as
      histopathologic response and margin negative resection and number of positive lymph nodes.
