      aged 65 years and over with intermediate- or high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma randomized to
      CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisolone) vs. MCOP (mitoxantrone,
      cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisolone). II. Compare the survival rate in these
      patients.

      OUTLINE: Randomized study. The following acronyms are used: CHOP CTX/DOX/VCR/PRDL CTX
      Cyclophosphamide, NSC-26271 DHAD Mitoxantrone, NSC-301739 DOX Doxorubicin, NSC-123127 MCOP
      DHAD/CTX/VCR/PRDL PRDL Prednisolone, NSC-9900 VCR Vincristine, NSC-67574 Arm I: 4-Drug
      Combination Chemotherapy. CHOP. Arm II: 4-Drug Combination Chemotherapy. MCOP.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 200 patients will be entered over approximately 5 years.
