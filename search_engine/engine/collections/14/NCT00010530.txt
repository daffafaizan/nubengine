      Americans, and accounts for 40% of the disproportionate risk for mortality observed in
      African Americans compared to white Americans. The majority of CVD patients experience acute
      cardiac events, many sudden and unexpected, despite conventional treatment of their disease
      and associated traditional risk factors. The pathophysiologic basis of these cardiac events
      is not fully established, but substantial evidence indicates that psychosocial stress and the
      sympathetic nervous system have adverse effects on both vasomotor function and long-term
      autonomic balance. Recent advances in the understanding of the pathophysiology of acute
      cardiac events-specifically, the roles that arterial vasomotor dysfunction and sympathetic
      nervous system imbalance play in the pathophysiology of such acute events-provide a platform
      for a new mechanistic investigation of the interplay of psychosocial and environmental stress
      and CVD. Preliminary evidence demonstrating elevated peripheral vasoconstriction due to
      stress-mediated sympathetic nervous system response in African Americans further suggests
      that these mechanisms are particularly relevant in this group.
