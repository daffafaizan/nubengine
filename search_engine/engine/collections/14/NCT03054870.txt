    
      This is a Phase 3 within-subject non-inferiority trial of Technegas ventilation imaging
      compared to Xenon-133 (Xe-133) ventilation imaging to demonstrate the non-inferiority of
      Technegas compared to Xe-133 ventilation studies with respect to subject pulmonary
      ventilatory distribution. Subjects will undergo site-specific standard of care (SOC) Xe-133
      imaging per medical needs followed by Technegas ventilation imaging per study protocol.
      Primary assessments of efficacy will be based on three blinded readers' assessments of the
      Technegas and Xe-133 ventilation images in independent reading sessions.
