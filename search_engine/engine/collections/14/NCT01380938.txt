      Peginterferon alpha-2a, with standard fixed dosages of 800 mg. Patients will be evaluated at
      week 4 with an assay of sensitivity of 15 IU/ml. Patients with week 4 response will
      discontinue treatment at week 12 in both arms. Patients with HCV RNA still detectable at week
      4 and receiving 1000-1200 mg of ribavirin in arm A will discontinue treatment at week 24,
      whereas patients with HCV RNA still detectable at week 4 and receiving 800 mg of ribavirin in
      arm B will be treated till week 48.

      A standard treatment arm (C) including patients treated for 24 weeks with Peginterferon
      alpha-2a and fixed 800 mg ribavirin dosage will be used as control arm.
