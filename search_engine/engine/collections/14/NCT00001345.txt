      benign) hypercalcemia (FHH), hyperparathyroidism - jaw tumor syndrome (HPT-JT), other causes
      of familial isolated hyperparathyroidism (FIH), and pseudohypoparathyroidism (PHP) are
      disorders of metabolism that are generally inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. MEN1
      is characterized by overgrowth and hyperfunction of the parathyroids, anterior pituitary and
      gastrointestinal endocrine tissue. MEN1, p15, p18, p21, and p27 are identified genes for MEN
      1- like states. FHH is characterized by a usually benign syndrome sometimes mistaken for
      typical primary hyperparathyroidism, which may result in unnecessary and unsuccessful
      parathyroid surgery. The CASR gene for the calcium-sensing receptor of the parathyroid cell
      is mutated in of most FHH kindreds;a minority of kindreds with FHH have mutation of the GA11
      or AP2S gene. HPT-JT is a distinctive subtype of familial isolated hyperparathyroidism that
      has combinations of parathyroid adenoma, parathyroid cancer, jaw tumor, uterus tumor, kidney
      tumor and kidney cysts. It is caused by mutation of the CDC73/HRPT2 gene. PHP is
      characterized by parathyroid hormone resistance, and one form is associated with mutations in
      the gene encoding the stimulatory G protein. We are continuing to collect blood and tissue
      samples from affected and unaffected members of kindreds with known or suspected MEN1, FHH,
      HPT-JT, FIH, PHP, and related disorders for the purpose of genetic analysis and gene
      identification. In most cases, the procurement of specimens will be at an off-site location.
      Samples will be processed for extraction of DNA and RNA.
