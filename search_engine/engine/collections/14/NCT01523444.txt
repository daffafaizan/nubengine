      computer-facilitated Screening and Brief Advice (cSBA) to reduce initiation and substance
      abuse among adolescents in a novel setting; (2) To examine the comparative effectiveness of
      adding a Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment component to the cSBA intervention
      among adolescents in these centers; (3) To examine factors facilitating and inhibiting the
      implementation of SBIRT-type procedures with adolescents in FQHCs.
