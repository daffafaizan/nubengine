      the effects of maternal smoking during pregnancy go beyond the perinatal period due to the
      effect of nicotine on increasing fetal testosterone levels. This is of great concern as an
      increase fetal testosterone has been linked to impaired reproductive development and
      infertility in both male and female offspring, early onset of menarche in females, shorter
      body height, increased BMI, shortened anogenital distance and low second digit to fourth
      digit finger length ratio. Additionally elevated fetal testosterone levels have been
      associated with development of psychosocial disorders such as Autism, ADHD, antisocial
      behavior, conduct disorder, adult criminal behavior, and sensation seeking behavior.

      Although there have been a few animal studies that have investigated the effects of maternal
      nicotine exposure on fetal testosterone levels with review of the epidemiologic literature on
      subsequent adverse implications, no known human studies have been performed to further
      investigate the relationship between maternal smoking during pregnancy and female fetal
      testosterone levels.
