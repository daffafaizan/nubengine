      Evidence suggest that the application of manual therapy could be effective in multiple
      pathologies, but there are few studies which have investigated the effectiveness of manual
      therapy in to balance, functionality and mood states.

      Objective To compare the effectiveness of a protocol of manual therapy on the static balance,
      dynamic balance, functionality and mood states in health participants.

      Metods

      This is a randomized controlled trial which will be carried out with young adults. The sample
      will be divided into 2 groups: a) experimental group that will receive a manual therapy
      session; b) a control group without treatment. All subjects signed the informed consent and
      confidentiality of the data was reserved according to the Helsinki declaration. The
      treatments were carried out in the laboratories of the University of Valencia and the project
      was approved by the institution's ethics committee.

      The experimental group to receive manual therapy (Bilateral manipulation lumbosacral, hip
      joint gapping, stretching the hip rotators with hip and knee flexion, femorotibial gapping,
      decompression of connective tissue of the patellofemoral region, internal and external joint
      line opening in laterality, mobilization of the base of the fibula, tibiofibular-talus
      gapping, and muscle strengthening). The control group will not receive treatment and only
      evaluations will be performed.

      Outcomes

      The evaluations will consist of the following variables: Star Excursion Balance Test (SEBT),
      Unipedal Stance Test (UPST), Time Up and Go (TUG), Sit To Stand (STS), Patient Global
      Impression of Change (PGIC) and POMS (Profile Of Mood States). Evaluations will be carried
      out at three times: at the beginning of the study, after treatment and one week later.
