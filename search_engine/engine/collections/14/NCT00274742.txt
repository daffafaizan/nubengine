      new cases are diagnosed each year, with approximately 90,000 deaths per year. The vast
      majority of NHLs are B-cell derived (90%) and express common B-cell antigens such as CD19,
      CD20 and CD22. NHL can be divided into indolent (low-grade) and aggressive (high-grade)
      lymphomas. Still almost all patients with advanced stage indolent disease will die from their
      disease. Therefore, a high medical need exists to develop novel agents that further improve
      the survival of NHL patients.

      Blinatumomab (MT103) is a bispecific antibody derivative, anti-CD19 x anti-CD3, designed to
      link B-cells and T-cells resulting in T-cell activation and a cytotoxic T-cell response
      against CD19+ cells. Data of prior phase I studies show evidence of biological activity in
      humans. In vitro and ex-vivo data suggest that a longterm presence of the drug in target
      tissues may provide antitumour activity.

      The study investigates the safety and tolerability of different doses of Blinatumomab
      administration in a continuous infusion regimen. Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will be defined
      in a classical 3+3 dose escalation regimen.
