      world population. Hallucinations and delusions are the most striking characteristic positive
      symptoms of schizophrenia; however, more subtle negative symptoms (eg, social withdrawal and
      lack of emotion, energy, and motivation) may also be present. The first antipsychotics
      developed for the treatment of schizophrenia were effective against positive symptoms, but
      showed little efficacy for negative symptoms and were also associated with a high incidence
      of side effects. Second generation antipsychotics, represent a significant advancement in the
      treatment of psychotic disorders because they are effective and at the same time exhibit
      fewer side effects than first generation antipsychotics. Although generally safer than first
      generation antipsychotics, the second-generation antipsychotics are not devoid of undesirable
      side effects such as Hyperprolactinemia and weight gain. In addition, the safety of these
      drugs vary considerably.
