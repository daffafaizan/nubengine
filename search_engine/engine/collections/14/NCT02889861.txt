    
      IMCgp100-401 is a rollover study that is designed to provide continued access to IMCgp100 for
      eligible participants with advanced melanoma who have previously participated in an IMCgp100
      study (parent study). Parent studies that are eligible for participants to continue to
      receive IMCgp100 in this rollover study must have completed and satisfied its primary
      endpoints or have been terminated by the Sponsor for reasons other than safety.

      Eligible participants will have tolerated IMCgp100 for a minimum of 4 weeks of dosing without
      significant toxicities that would preclude further dosing in the opinion of the principal
      investigator or Sponsor.
