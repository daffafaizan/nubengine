    
      This is a non-interventional, multi-center study that follows general principles of periodic
      assessment of X-ALD patients in routine practice. No study drug treatment will be given and
      no changes to the patient treatment are necessary.

      Patients with X-ALD will be recruited and invited to attend a baseline visit. After eligible
      patients are enrolled, retrospective and baseline data will be collected. After enrollment,
      patients will be seen approximately every 6 months until they meet withdrawal criteria or the
      Sponsor terminates the study.
