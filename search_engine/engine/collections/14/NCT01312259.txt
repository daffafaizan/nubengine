        1. Primary: to demonstrate better symptoms control (pain, urinary urgency and frequency)
           with sacral neuromodulation (SNM) in patients with interstitial cystitis /painful
           bladder syndrome (IC/PBS) using a stimulation frequency of 40 hertz (experimental)
           compared to a frequency of 14 hertz (standard).

        2. Secondary: The evaluate the efficacy of the two frequency settings on the other
           associated conditions that often coexist in patients with IC/PBS, such as female sexual
           dysfunction (FSD), bowel dysfunction, high tone pelvic floor dysfunction (HTPFD, painful
           spasm of the pelvic floor muscles), Vulvodynia (pain at the opening of the vagina).
