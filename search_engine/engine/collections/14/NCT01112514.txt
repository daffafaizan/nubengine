           procedure, participants will come to the endoscopy unit at Massachusetts General
           Hospital. After arriving, participants will receive an intravenous line and meet with
           the research doctor to go over the procedure. The participant will then be transferred
           to the endoscopy procedure room and be administered sedatives until they are comfortable
           to proceed with the procedure.

        -  The research doctor will pass the flexible study sigmoidoscope into the lower part of
           the rectum. At this time, a dose of the ICG contrast agent will be administered through
           the intravenous line. Any areas that are suspicious will be photographed using the
           camera in the scope. We will also biopsy/remove any suspicious areas and send it to the
           pathologist as we normally do during endoscopy.

        -  Over the course of the study procedure, small doses of ICG will be administered to help
           find any precancerous areas. Altogether, the study exam should not take more than 10 to
           15 minutes.
