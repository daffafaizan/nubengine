      therapy comprises NA-831 with an anti-viral drug Atazanavir, NA-831 with an anti-inflammatory
      drug, Dexamethasone and a potential synergy between Atazanavir and Dexamethasone. NA-831 is
      also known as Traneurocin is a neuroprotective drug that is in clinical study for the
      treatment of Alzheimer's Disease. Participants will receive NA-831 or Atazanavir with or
      without Dexamethasone. Investigators are primarily interested in the time to recovery. In
      addition to study medications there will be daily symptom surveys for 14 days, then weekly
      thereafter for 3 weeks resulting in a total duration of follow up of 36 days. During
      hospitalization, daily symptom surveys will be carried out in conjunction with the study
      coordinators. Upon discharge participants will have the option to complete electronic symptom
      surveys or complete symptom surveys via telephone with the study coordinator. If electronic
      symptom surveys are selected on discharge participants will also receive a follow-up call
      from a study coordination every 7 days during the initial 14 day period. In addition, failure
      to submit a symptom survey will prompt a study follow up call. Data from
