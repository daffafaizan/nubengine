      fibrinogen on clot kinetics (degradation time, structure, strength and polymerization) in
      post-CPB coagulopathy in neonates undergoing cardiac surgery. The two sources of fibrinogen
      include the blood product, cryoprecipitate, and a blood product alternative, fibrinogen
      concentrate. Cryoprecipitate is an allogenic blood product that requires cross-matching and
      thawing prior to administration and is associated with immunologic reactions and possible
      pathogen transmission. Fibrinogen concentrate, a blood product alternative, is a purified
      form of fibrinogen, which undergoes a pasteurization process to minimize the risk of
      immunologic and allergic reactions. The primary aim of this study is compare the in vivo
      effect of post-CPB administration of FC, a blood product alternative, to cryoprecipitate on
      neonatal clot properties and clinical outcomes.
