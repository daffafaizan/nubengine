      pregnancy and are motivated to maintain abstinence after delivery. At the time of delivery,
      women will be randomly assigned to receive 4 weeks of active or placebo exogenous
      progesterone starting on the 4th day postpartum. Participants will be in contact with study
      staff either by phone or clinic visits until 12 weeks postpartum to collect data on smoking
      status and protocol compliance, measure serum progesterone levels and receive behavioral
      counseling.
