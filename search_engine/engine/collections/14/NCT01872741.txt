      aesthetic results of two surgical techniques for microsurgical clipping of anterior
      circulation aneurysms. Overall, 60 eligible patients admitted with ruptured and unruptured
      anterior circulation aneurysms will enrolled in the study.

      The aesthetic results will be analyzed with 2 methods. In the first, the patients will be
      showed to a rule, with a scale from 0 to 100, in which 0 mean the best result and 100 the
      worst result. Photos will be taken and showed to two independent observers, the results will
      be classified as excellent, good, regular or poor. The degree of atrophy will be measured
      with three methods. In the first one, the authors wiil observes the percentage of thick
      reduction in the temporal muscle, subcutaneous tissue and skin. In the second method the
      percentage thick reduction of the isolated temporal muscle will be measured and the third the
      volumetric analysis of the temporal muscle, subcutaneous tissue and skin will be calculated
      from the superior edge of zygomatic arch to superior temporal line. The functional results
      wiil be compared using the Modified Rankin Score. Others variables such frontal facial palsy,
      post-operative hemorrhage, cerebrospinal fistulas, hydrocephalus and mortality will be also
      analyzed
