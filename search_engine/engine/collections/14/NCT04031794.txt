      ECMO, according to 2013 Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO) guideline criteria.
      The definition of refractory hypoxemia was partial pressure of oxygen:fraction of inspire
      oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) <100 with fraction of inspire oxygen (FiO2) >90% despite optimal
      mechanical ventilator support for at least 2 hours.

      The ECMO team was alerted for patient evaluation. The patients, who did not consider as ECMO
      candidate, due to their underlying condition of terminally illness, were excluded.

      The decision to initiate ECMO, or not, is dependent on the conference included the patient or
      the patient first relative, the attending physician and the ECMO team physicians.

      Patients who ECMO is initiated will be classified into ECMO group. Patients who they or their
      1st degree relative do not agree for ECMO initiation will be treated according to standard
      treatment for ARDS, and classified in non-ECMO group.

      The patients in both groups will be follow up until they are discharged from the hospital.
