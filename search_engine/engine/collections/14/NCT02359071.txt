      duration in Emergency Department. Our secondary aim was to identify the factors affecting the
      Emergency Department handover rates. To better analyze independent variables, we dichotomized
      the data. First, we dichotomized handover duration into two groups according to the median
      handoff time of 20 minutes. Second, we divided handover rates into two groups using the
      median rate of handovers per shift, which was 3.87%.
