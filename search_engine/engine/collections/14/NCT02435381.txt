      carisbamate (600mg qd) on the positive subjective effects of alcohol in non-treatment-seeking
      alcohol-dependent volunteers. Participants will receive study drug (carisbamate or placebo)
      from days 2- 4. On day 4, study drug will be followed by alcohol (0.8g/kg; 16% by volume) and
      a placebo beverage (1% by volume as a mask), both separated by 2 hours. Physiologic,
      subjective effects and BAL will be obtained after the alcohol challenges. Participants will
      be discharged on day 4 and asked to return a week later to repeat the study under the
      alternate study drug condition (active carisbamate vs. placebo).
