    
      In this present study (COMP 004), the aim is to follow up participants from COMP 001 and COMP
      003 in a long-term follow up study, with both remote and digital assessments, to explore the
      long term efficacy and safety of the three different doses of psilocybin (1 mg, 10 mg, and 25
      mg) administered to patients with TRD as a monotherapy in COMP 001 and 25 mg psilocybin
      administered as an adjunct to an SSRI in COMP 003. Patients previously treated in COMP001
      will be followed for approximately 40 weeks and patients previosuly treated in COMP003 will
      be followed for approximately 49 weeks giving a total follow up period of 52 weeks from
      psilocybin dosing.
