      peripheral neurotoxicity by traditional clinical scales, neurological examinations, and
      semi-quantitative assessments. Moreover, all the genetic changes will be analyzed by next
      generation sequencing and we will try to identify relevant variants in individuals who suffer
      from chemotherapy-induced neurotoxicity.
