      their content in growth factors (Growth factors, GF), which play an important role in
      regulation of many processes involved in normal healing of damaged corneal epithelium . The
      most used product so far is the eye drop prepared from serum (Autologous Serum, AS) or from
      platelet-rich plasma (Plasma Rich Platelet, PRP) of peripheral blood taken from the patients
      themselves. More recently, treatments were introduced by homologous sources that undoubtedly
      offer advantages as compared to autologous sources. In particular the homologous sources
      show:

        -  not invasiveness to the patient, who could in time not like the repeated withdrawals

        -  applicability even in patients with underlying systemic conditions. They may contain in
           their blood, among others, higher levels of pro-inflammatory factors, with the
           consequence of poor and inappropriate final product to be prepared and delivered to the
           eye

             -  reliability, since the homologous products can be prepared, controlled, also
                validated under the microbiological profile and standardized advance, then kept
                frozen until the dispensation

             -  conceptually unlimited availability of the product to be dispensed

             -  versatility of therapeutic indications, based on different GF levels which are
                estimated in advance

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of two products derived from two
      different blood sources (cord blood collected at birth from placenta umbilical veins and
      adult subject donor peripheral blood) in the treatment of severe keratopathies.
