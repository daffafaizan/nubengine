      Primary

        -  Determine the time to progression in patients with unresectable or metastatic colorectal
           cancer treated with cetuximab and celecoxib.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the response rate, median survival, and 1-year survival rate of patients
           treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxicity profile of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the feasibility of testing urinary PGE-M in patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine the feasibility of testing serum transforming growth factor-α and amphiregulin
           in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the effects of this regimen on the EGFR pathway in tumor cells (i.e.,
           phosphorylated EGFr, phosphorylated AKT, activated mitogen-activated protein kinase).

        -  Determine the effects of this regimen on the cyclooxygenase-2 pathway in tumor cells by
           measuring PGE-2 levels.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive cetuximab IV over 1-2 hours once weekly and oral celecoxib twice
      daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Serum and urine samples are collected at baseline, after week 1, and every other course
      thereafter for evaluation of PGE-2 by mass spectrometry, cyclooxygenase-2 activity, and
      phospho-EGFR levels by western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry. Samples are also
      analyzed for TGF-α and amphiregulin proteomics.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 54 patients will be accrued for this study.
