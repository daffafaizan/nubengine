      switch to EPAG or vice versa will be enrolled. The reason for switch will be recorded.
      Patients in the rh-TPO group were given rh-TPO 300 U/kg once daily for 21 days, and those in
      the eltrombopag group were given eltrombopag 50mg once daily for 6 weeks. Rh-TPO and
      eltrombopag were terminated any time the platelet counts increased above 100 × 10^9/L in the
      rh-TPO group and 300 × 10^9/L in the eltrombopag group. The efficacy, safety, and
      patient/physician preference will be assessed and compared between the two agents.
