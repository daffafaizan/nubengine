      gestation) whose mothers received or not full scheduled prenatal glucocorticosteroids.
      Healthy term newly born infants acted as controls.

      At birth cord blood were drawn for the following analytical determinations: reduced and
      oxidized glutathione; malondialdehyde; superoxide dismutase; catalase; glutathione
      peroxidase; glutathione reductase; glutathione s-transferase. In addition, first urine voided
      was collected for ortho-tyrosine/phenylalanine and
      8-hydroxy-2-oxo-deoxyguanosine/2-deoxyguanosine determination. Analytical data and clinical
      outcomes are compared.
