      several clinical trials. Even so, a substantial proportion of patients do not manage to
      maintain correct viral suppression in daily clinical practice.

      Adherence to HAART treatment is critical to obtain lasting viral suppression. Thus, factors
      that are related to adherence such as high pill load or takes, the complexity of the
      antiretroviral system, tolerability and food restrictions may have an effect on viral
      replication.

      It has been demonstrated that simpler regimens with a scant number of tablets, without food
      restrictions and with a single take a day are safe, efficacious and that adherence improves.

      The combination of abacavir 600 mg + lamivudine 300 mg QD in a single tablet is a novel
      dosage that may help increase treatment adherence.
