      called PrEPme along with a peer change agent (PCA) to record and review sexual risk behaviors
      among 80 HIV-negative BSMM. PrEPme is an existing HIPAA compliant mobile app that is
      currently available in the mobile application "store" and offers PrEP navigation services in
      Baltimore and throughout the State of Maryland. Currently, the app contains a diary that
      allows users to record and review their sexual risk behaviors using a weekly "timeline"
      including number and gender of partners along with substance use. At the end of each week,
      the dashboard provides a weekly review of sexual history for four weeks until the history is
      displayed as a monthly overview. The app also allows users to chat with our case management
      team to learn more about PrEP, obtain adequate insurance coverage, and get help scheduling
      appointments at any time. The proposed intervention leverages the current features of the app
      as part of the multi-component strategy. In the intervention, pre-post assessments will
      include demographic information, sexual behavior, substance use, mental health (e.g.,
      depression, gay community affiliation), and PrEP use history. HIV risk perception will be
      measured using an 8-item scale. The PCA will be trained to review sexual histories, highlight
      HIV and sexually transmitted infection risks, provide HIV prevalence information, deliver
      PrEP information, and encourage PrEP uptake. This intervention phase will use a single-group
      pretest post-test design to explore feasibility and findings will be used as the foundation
      for an efficacy trial among a larger sample of BSMM in different locales.
