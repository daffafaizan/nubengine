      (ACSS) with an estimated risk of 30 - 50% that patients will experience some degree of
      post-operative swallowing dysfunction. While symptoms often subside within 6 months the
      impact of swallowing difficulties may be far reaching within the health-care system. Patients
      may be at risk of aspiration pneumonia and require swallowing assessments and modified diets.
      These measures necessitate a prolonged hospital stay. Patients may be prescribed
      anti-inflammatory medications and steroids which can inhibit bony fusion, which is an
      essential component of healing and ensuring spinal stability following ACSS.

      The ultimate goal of this project is to determine the effect of minimizing ETT cuff pressure
      on the frequency of post-operative dysphagia following ACD. We believe that maintaining the
      ETT cuff pressure at 15mmHg will decrease the incidence of post-operative dysphagia - a
      direct benefit to the patients in the treatment group. Maintaining the ETT cuff pressure at
      15mmHg would require no additional intra-operative equipment or modification to existing
      equipment. This intervention would not modify standard operative practice or pose additional
      risks to patients. As a result the cost-to-benefit ratio of this intervention may be
      substantially favourable to patients and the health care system.
