      surgical procedures. The true incidence of both dysphagia and VFMI in this patient population
      is unclear due to a lack of rigorous study using instrumental assessment techniques and
      validated outcomes in all patents undergoing thoracic surgery. The study is therefore aimed
      to determine the incidence of dysphagia and VFMI in this patient population and to
      characterize impairment profiles related to swallowing safety and efficiency. In addition,
      the study is also aimed to assess the relative impact of VFMI and dysphagia on health-related
      outcomes such as length of hospital stay, pneumonia, sepsis, reintubation, and discharge
      status
