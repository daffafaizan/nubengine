      them face rapid deterioration of health, referral to residential aged care facilities and
      loss of independence. This substantively impairs their quality of life and has societal
      ramifications, including very high costs of care. Patients and carers are often overwhelmed
      by the multitude of decisions they have to make and may follow a care path that is in
      contrast to their goals.

      The GOAL trial addresses patient-prioritised research topics and outcomes and will be
      conducted, disseminated and implemented in partnership with patients and their caregivers.

      The primary objective is to test the hypothesis that in frail older people with stages 3-5
      CKD, Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (compared with usual care) will increase attainment
      of patient-identified goals at 3 months follow up. The secondary objectives are to test the
      hypotheses that the Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment will increase attainment of
      patient-identified goals at 6 and 12 months follow up, improve their quality of life and
      reduce frailty, hospital and residential aged care facility admissions while being safe and
      cost-effective.

      In this multicentre cluster randomised controlled trial, a total of 500 adult CKD stage 3-5
      patients will be recruited. Sites will be randomly allocated to either provide a
      Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment to participants or usual care. The primary outcome measure
      is goal attainment scaling at 3 months follow up. The secondary outcome measures will be goal
      attainment scaling at 6 and 12 months, quality of life EQ-5D-5L, frailty index, mortality,
      hospital and residential aged care facility admissions and cost-utiltity analysis.
