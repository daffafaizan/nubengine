      circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA)in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. However, no
      prospective has been conducted for usage of ctDNA in postoperative surveillance of NSCLC
      patients.

      We plan to compare tumor makers and radiographic approaches with blood and urine ctDNA in
      surveillance to assess the lead time of postoperative tumor relapse in stage â…¢A NSCLC
      patients. And evaluate the correlation between ctDNA level with tumor relapse or metastasis.
