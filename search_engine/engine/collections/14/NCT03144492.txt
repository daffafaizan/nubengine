      published data whereby the investigator evaluate the effect of microgravity on the
      differentiation and functional potential of circulating stem cells. The goal of this work is
      to leverage the powerful genetic analyses done in the SPHINX study and look at the
      consequences these changes have on cell-cell communications essential for vascular
      homeostasis, for a possible correlation to cardiovascular deconditioning. The application of
      this work is targeted at possible "cell based" countermeasures to address the negative
      effects of microgravity on the vasculature.
