      Primary

        -  Determine the overall response rate in patients with anthracycline- and taxane-resistant
           locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer treated with dose-dense carboplatin and
           gemcitabine hydrochloride.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the overall toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the time to disease progression in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the duration of response in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the time to treatment failure in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, open-label study.

      Patients receive carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1 and gemcitabine hydrochloride IV
      over 150 minutes on day 2. Treatment repeats every 14 days for up to 9 courses in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 35 patients will be accrued for this study.
