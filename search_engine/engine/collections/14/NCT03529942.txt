    
      This is an open-label study assessing the effect of the administration of a single
      intra-articular (IA) injection of FX006 32 mg on synovial volume in patients with
      osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee. The study will be conducted in male and female patients who
      are â‰¥ 40 years of age.

      Eligible patients who provide written consent and meet all entry criteria will undergo
      initial ultrasound examination and MRI with contrast of the index knee, and then receive a
      single IA injection of FX006 administered to the index knee at Baseline/Day 1. Patients will
      return to the clinic at Weeks 6 and 24 for an MRI with contrast of the index knee and other
      assessments. Patients must also have a blood sample drawn for Estimated Glomerular Filtration
      Rate (eGFR) testing within 30 days prior to the scheduled MRIs. In addition, a patient
      questionnaire will be administered and adverse events (AEs) and concomitant medication
      updates will be collected via telephone at Weeks 12 and 18.
