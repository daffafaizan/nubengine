    
      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), non-randomized (the
      study drug is not assigned by chance), single arm, multicenter (when more than one hospital
      or medical school team work on a medical research study), 24-week study. Participants can be
      transitioned to an effective dose of paliperidone ER from any oral antipsychotic medication
      without the need for titration due to lack of efficacy, lack of tolerability or safety, lack
      of compliance or other reason. A transition period of maximum 4 weeks will be allowed.
      Throughout the study, participants will receive flexible dose of 3 to 12 milligram (mg) of
      paliperidone once daily orally for 24 weeks. Dose adjustment will be done as per
      Investigator's discretion based upon participant's clinical response to and tolerability of
      the study drug. Assessments of efficacy will be performed at screening and after 2, 4, 12 and
      24 weeks. Efficacy will primarily be evaluated by means of Positive and Negative Syndrome
      Scale (PANSS). Participants' safety will also be monitored throughout the study.
