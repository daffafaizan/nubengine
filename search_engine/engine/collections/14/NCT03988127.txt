      Electrocardiogram, pulse oximetry, and automated noninvasive blood pressure (NIBP).
      Day-to-day investigations will be carried out to monitor and individualize treatment. Medical
      (and/or) surgical treatment will be performed, supervised by the attending intensivist and
      surgeon.

      Sedation and analgesia protocol will be prescribed by the patient's primary intensivist.
      Another pulse oximeter probe (Masimo Radical 7; Masimo Corp., Irvine, CA, USA) will be
      attached to the patient's index finger during changing the patient's position (head of bed
      elevation) after abdominal surgery. This pulse oximeter will be connected to the Masimo
      monitor and shielded to prevent outside light from interfering with the signal.

      Sedation will be assessed by using the Richmond Agitation- Sedation scale (RASS). Pain
      assessment will be achieved by using the behavioural pain scale intubated (BPS-IN).

      Sedation and analgesia will be guided by the BPS and RASS. For analgesia the patients will
      receive a loading dose (0.05-0.2 mg/kg) morphine sulphate I.V., followed by (2-10 mg/h)
      infusion to keep the BPS between 3 and 6. If the pain score is more than 6, a rescue dose of
      3 mg will be given, and then the pain will be reassessed after 5 min. If the patient received
      more than 2 boluses/h, the infusion dose will be increased by 2 mg/h.

      For sedation, the patients will receive a loading dose of propofol 0.005 mg/kg/min IV for at
      least 5 min., followed by (0.005-0.05 mg/kg/min) IV infusion to achieve a RASS score of 0 to
      -1. A rescue dose of 5-10 mcg/kg/min over 5-10 min intervals if the RASS score is more than
      0; allow a minimum of 5 min between adjustments for onset of peak effect.
