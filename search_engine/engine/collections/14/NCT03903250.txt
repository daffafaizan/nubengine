      Performance Lab (HPL) to determine whether they qualify to participate in the study. Upon
      qualification, participants will be scheduled a familiarization session in which participants
      will be taught how to use the Makoto Arena, a reaction time machine. Participants will then
      schedule their first testing session which will include: questionnaires, hemodynamic
      measures, reaction time testing, cognitive function testing via ImPACT, an acute exercise
      bout, reaction time testing, and cognitive function testing via ImPACT. Participants will
      then be randomized into one of two treatments.

      Supplementation protocol: Participants will be randomly assigned into one of two treatments
      and will be given 4oz of either a placebo or active treatment mixed in orange flavored
      Gatorade everyday for 5 days. On Monday, participants will consume the beverage after testing
      is complete. Tuesday through Friday the beverage will be consumed as the participants arrive
      in the HPL.

      On Mondays and Fridays, testing will be as follows: questionnaires, hemodynamic measures,
      reaction time testing, cognitive function testing via ImPACT, an acute exercise bout,
      reaction time testing, and cognitive function testing via ImPACT. On Tuesdays and Thursdays,
      participants will come check into the HPL for 30 minutes. On Wednesday, participants will
      come into the HPL to complete the acute exercise bout. To control their sleep to the best of
      our ability, participants are required to send emails every 30 minutes beginning at 10pm
      until their designated sleep time so the investigators know the participants are not asleep
      and gaining more than 5 hours of sleep.
