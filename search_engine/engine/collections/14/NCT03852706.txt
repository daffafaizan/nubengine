      schizophrenia, where they can cause significant occupational and social impairment. Current
      treatments are incompletely effective. Around 25-30% of AVH are refractory to antipsychotic
      drugs, and cognitive behavioural therapy only shows a small-medium effect size. Initially
      promising studies of neurostimulation have shown smaller effect sizes as better controlled
      trials have been conducted. There is hence the need for innovative new treatments. One
      potential option is neurofeedback training. The primary objective of study is to perform a
      randomized, controlled, rater-blinded pilot trial (n=40) of EEG neurofeedback for AVH in
      patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia, to assess trial process, which will then
      inform a future definitive trial. The secondary objective is to calculate a 95% confidence
      interval that will allow interpretation of statistical difference between neurofeedback and
      treatment-as-usual groups to assess neurofeedback for reducing auditory verbal
      hallucinations. Participants will be randomly allocated to either a neurofeedback (plus
      treatment-as-usual) or treatment-as-usual alone condition. Neurofeedback will employ Z-score
      based LORETA (Low Resolution Brain Electromagnetic Tomography). After a baseline assessment,
      twenty sessions of personalized neurofeedback training will be delivered over a period of
      approximately four months. This is the first registered trial of EEG neurofeedback for
      hallucinations. The primary focus of the pilot trial is on feasibility. However, a 95%
      confidence interval will be determined for the difference on PSYRATS-AH and AHRS scores
      between neurofeedback and treatment-as-usual to help inform a future definitive trial.
