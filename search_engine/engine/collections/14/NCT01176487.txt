    
      The primary purpose of this study is to demonstrate that using technically sophisticated
      3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy for the palliative treatment of lung cancer
      patients will result in equivalent degrees of symptom relief and a reduction in the primary
      endpoint of oesophagitis.

      Single arm therapeutic clinical study.

      RT Treatment Regimens:

      17 Gy/2 fractions or 20Gy/5 fractions or 39Gy/13 fractions

      Primary Endpoint:

      -The occurrence of Grade 3 or higher oesophagitis in the interval between start and 1-month
      post completion of treatment as determined by CTCAE Version 4.02

      Patients will be assessed pre treatment, during treatment, 2 weeks post completion of
      treatment, one month post completion of treatment, three months post completion of treatment,
      and three monthly thereafter

      -All patients who complete treatment (and whose on-treatment toxicity is documented) will be
      evaluable.

      Secondary Endpoint:

        -  Quality of Life Assessment. All patients will be required to complete the EORTC
           QLQ-C15-PAL (Version 1) and the Lung Specific Module (LC 13)

        -  The occurrence of other AEs

      Safety Endpoint:

      -Radio-induced oesophagitis, acute and long term, using the CTCAE Version 4.02.
