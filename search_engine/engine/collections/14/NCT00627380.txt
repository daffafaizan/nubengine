      HIV-infected people exist. These metabolic syndromes may increase cardiovascular disease risk
      in HIV-infected people and may reduce their quantity and quality of life. Practicing a yoga
      lifestyle intervention may provide a safe, effective and novel therapy for HIV metabolic
      syndromes, but this alternative form of therapy has not been tested in HIV-infected people
      with metabolic syndromes. In men and women with HIV-related metabolic syndromes, we will
      determine:

        1. The safety of practicing a yoga lifestyle in HIV-infected people treated with HAART who
           are experiencing metabolic and anthropometric syndromes.

        2. To quantify the effects of practicing a yoga lifestyle on metabolic and anthropomorphic
           syndromes in HIV-infected people treated with HAART who are experiencing these
           syndromes.

        3. To quantify the effects of practicing a yoga lifestyle on cardiovascular disease (CVD)
           risk in HIV-infected people treated with HAART who are at increased CVD risk because of
           existing metabolic and anthropomorphic syndromes.
