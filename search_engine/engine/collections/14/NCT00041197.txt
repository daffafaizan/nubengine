      I. To determine whether patients with resected primary gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST)
      who are randomized to the STI571 (imatinib mesylate) Arm have longer recurrence-free survival
      as compared to the patients randomized to the placebo Arm.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To ascertain whether patients with resected primary GIST who are randomized to the STI571
      Arm have longer survival as compared to the patients randomized to the placebo Arm.

      II. To obtain from patients with GIST: tumor tissue (before therapy with STI571 and if the
      patient develops recurrence), blood specimens (before therapy with STI571), and serum
      specimens (before therapy with STI571, after completing therapy with STI571, and if the
      patient develops recurrence) for scientific correlative analyses.

      III. To assess the safety/efficacy of oral STI571 therapy in the adjuvant setting.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate (Gleevec; STI571) once daily. Treatment
      continues for 1 year in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Patients who develop a
      recurrence during the year of initial treatment receive imatinib mesylate (Gleevec; STI571)
      at an increased dose. Patients who develop a recurrence after the year of initial treatment
      restart imatinib mesylate (Gleevec; STI571) and continue taking the drug at the discretion of
      the principal investigator.

      ARM II: Patients receive oral placebo once daily. Treatment continues for 1 year in the
      absence of unacceptable toxicity. Patients who develop a recurrence at any time discontinue
      placebo and crossover to arm I. Treatment on arm I continues at the discretion of the
      principal investigator.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, then every 6 months for 10 years.
