      offered to women with previous Caesarean delivery who require induction of labour. However,
      castor oil may not exert its labour induction effect immediately and the delivery may be
      delayed by up to 8 days. This may render a proportion of women to resort to repeated
      Caesarean section for failed induction.Castor oil is traditionally given by midwives in order
      to induce labor.

      The investigators intent to recruit 80 healthy pregnant women with a hsitory of previous one
      cesarean section and with no contraindication to trial of labor after cesarean . Women will
      be randomly and blindly divided into equal sized intervention group and control group.
      Intervention group will be given a single dose 60 mL of castor oil in 140 mL of orange juice,
      while control group will be given a placebo with similar texture. Primary outcomes to be
      tested are the percentage of women entering active labor within 24 hours of castor oil or
      placebo administration and the number of successful vaginal delivaries after cesarean.
