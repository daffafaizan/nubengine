      were seen between TVT (tension-free vaginal tape) and TVT-O for female SUI in a randomized
      trial. In two studies the patients were followed-up for ten years after the TVT-O procedure.
      The first randomized study reporting long term outcomes of TVT-O and outside-in TOT
      (transobturator tape) in women with urodynamic mixed urinary incontinence (MUI) showed that
      transobturator tension-free vaginal tapes are associated with a good and sustained
      patient-reported success rate.

      The success of the incontinence procedures should be assessed not only with objective
      measures but also with methods evaluating subjective satisfaction. The aim of this study was
      to evaluate the efficacy, safety and overall patient satisfaction of the TVT-O technique in a
      long-term follow-up of patients suffering from primary or recurrent SUI or MUI.
