      of coercive measures that took place in the psychiatric inpatient setting in reducing the use
      of coercive measures and the subjective perception of coercion. It is well known that
      coercive measures have a major negative impact on the health, well-being and the course of
      treatment of patients suffering from mental health issues. Many interventions have been
      implemented in the last years to reduce the use of coercion and limit its consequences.

      The investigators developed a standardized post-coercion review intervention. This session
      takes place as soon as possible after the concerned coercive measure and is moderated by a
      member of staff who has not been involved in the use of coercion. Other persons involved are
      the patient, a staff member who took the decision leading to the use of the coercive measure,
      and a one of the patient's relatives. The guidelines define important themes and questions
      that should be addressed during the review session. These guidelines have been developed with
      the help of psychiatrists, nurses and a peer worker.

      Hypothesis is that the use of this standardized intervention can reduce the use of subsequent
      coercive measures and level of perceived coercion, prevent the development of post-traumatic
      symptoms, help preserving a trustful therapeutic relationship and positively change the
      attitude of staff regarding the use of coercion. This intervention has been proven to be well
      accepted by patients and staff members in a previous pilot study. The methods combine
      quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

      The present study is designed as a randomised-controlled study investigating the effect of
      post-coercion review.
