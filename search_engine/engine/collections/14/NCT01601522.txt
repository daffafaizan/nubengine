      food allergic reactions, and the only treatment is complete avoidance of peanut. Despite
      avoidance, the majority of peanut allergic people will accidently ingest peanut. OIT has been
      shown to desensitize peanut allergic subjects (Hofmann et al. 2009). This would protect
      patients who have no other treatment, and may even form the basis for true tolerance to
      peanut in the future.

      To determine the dose and kinetics of peanut desensitization (clinically and immunologically)
      in peanut allergic individuals who undergo low and high dose OIT.

      To examine whether the severity of peanut allergy as determined by measurements of PAF and
      PAF AH (possible markers of reaction severity) correlate with the ability of patients
      undergoing OIT to achieve desensitization To assess quality of life in peanut allergic
      subjects before and after OIT
