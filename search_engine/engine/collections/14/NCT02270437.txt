      reduce postoperative parenteral narcotics use and improve patient satisfaction following
      total knee arthroplasty.

      A prospective, randomized trial is conducted to testify the hypothesis above by recruiting
      patients who go through simultaneous bilateral TKA and observing their postoperative
      analgesic consumption, visual analog scores and functional recovery. Potential side-effects
      of the multimodal drugs is also under observation.
