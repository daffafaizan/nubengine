      feedback system that provides clinicians with parent-proxy reported outcomes measure data
      during routine outpatient encounters for burn treatment.

      The secondary objective of this first phase of the study is to determine clinicians' and
      parents perception of the experience of completing the BOQ+P and/or the usefulness of the
      information that was provided to the clinician and parent/guardians(s). For this reason we
      will collect a brief debriefing questionnaire from physicians and another from parents.
