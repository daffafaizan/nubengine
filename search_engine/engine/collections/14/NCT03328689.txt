    
      Secondary objectives are to:

      â€¢ To compare the effectiveness of the two interventions in preventing an activity-limiting
      LBP flare up at 12 and 24 months.

      Secondary objectives are to:

        -  To compare the effectiveness of the interventions in mitigating the negative
           consequences of LBP.

        -  To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the interventions in preventing activity-limiting
           LBP flare-up.

        -  To identify subgroups of individuals that may best respond to each one of the two
           interventions.

      Exploratory objectives include:

        -  evaluate the fluctuating nature of back pain using a smart phone application to collect
           pain measures once a week for 1 year (trajectories will also be evaluated to compare
           between group effects)

        -  assess adherence to physical activity using activity monitors.

        -  evaluate the relationship between activity levels and flare-ups as a method for
           understanding pain triggers and impact of activity pacing.
