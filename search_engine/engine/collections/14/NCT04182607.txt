      electronic medical records (EMRs) on donors and recipients who underwent a minimally invasive
      kidney transplantation procedure. Data from all patients who had a hand-assisted or robotic
      minimally invasive kidney transplantation procedure at Methodist Dallas Medical Center (MDMC)
      between January 2006 and November 2019 will be included in the study.
