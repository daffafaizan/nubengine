      commonly used drugs for the treatment of Human Immune Deficiency Virus (HIV) infection and
      malaria respectively in Nigeria. However, both drugs interact with Cytochrome P 3A4 (CYP 3A4)
      isoenzymes which may spawn clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions.

      The study was aimed at evaluating the effects of atazanavir-ritonavir on the pharmacokinetics
      and toxicity of lumefantrine.

      In a case control pharmacokinetic study, twenty participants who tested positive for
      Plasmodium falciparum malaria were recruited and divided into two groups (ATVr-arm, n=10; and
      Control-arm, n= 10). All the participants were administered with 6 doses of AL 80-480 mg
      (Coartem). Thereafter, blood samples were collected from them at different time intervals
      over seven days. The lumefantrine concentration in each sample was determined with
      high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and entered into WinNonlinÂ® software to
      determine the pharmacokinetic parameters of lumefantrine which were compared between the test
      and control groups. Toxicity was evaluated with adverse events monitoring,
      electrocardiography, haematological and blood chemistry tests at pre and post doses of
      artemether-lumefantrine.
