    
      Phase 2 open-label, multi-center, randomized, controlled, dose-finding study of safety and
      efficacy of NLA101 to reduce the rate of infections associated with chemotherapy induced
      neutropenia (CIN) in adult subjects with AML.

      Eligible subjects with untreated de novo or secondary AML and per local institutional
      standards planned to receive at least two cycles of chemotherapy with curative intent will be
      enrolled into the study and randomized 1:1:1:1 to 1 of 3 Investigational Arms (Standard of
      Care [SOC] chemotherapy + low, medium, or high dose NLA101) or a Control Arm (SOC
      chemotherapy).

      Subjects randomized to an Investigational Arm will be eligible to receive a single fixed
      assigned dose of NLA101 after the first cycle of chemotherapy, and up to 2 additional
      identical cell doses after subsequent chemotherapy cycles (one NLA101 infusion per cycle).
      Subjects randomized to the Control Arm will be followed for up to 3 cycles of chemotherapy.

      All subjects will be followed for 84 days following randomization, or 30 days post final
      infusion of NLA101, or 30 days post the day after the last chemotherapy infusion for Control
      Arm, whichever is longer.
