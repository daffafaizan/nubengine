      axis, SO2 on the y axis. For the determination of this function, a pairwise measurement of
      pO2 and the corresponding SO2 is to be performed. Using nonlinear regression analysis, the
      ODC can be fitted to the measured points that describe the relation of pO2 and SO2 and
      characteristic parameters like p50 value and inflection points can be calculated.

      To measure the ODC under the conditions of the Triple H Syndrome (Hypoxie, Hypercapnia,
      Hypothermia), the temperature and the pCO2 have to be changed and controlled during the
      measurement. No commercially available instrument is able to obtain this. Therefore, we
      envisaged the development of an entirely new approach.

      In the 3H ODC trial venous blood will be drawn from 18 - 40 years old female and male
      volunteers by a unique venipuncture. The participants have to be in a fasted situation, ASA I
      and nonsmokers. The blood sample will be immediately pseudonymized and stored on ice and a
      venous blood gas analysis will be carried out (pH, Hb, COHb, MetHb, FHb). Simultaneous to the
      main measurement, 2,3 BPG will be quantified by an ELISA test and any unknown
      hemoglobinopathy will be excluded by Hemoglobin Electrophoresis. In the 3H ODC trial 4
      different pCO2 levels and 4 different temperatures will be analyzed in the resulting 16
      combinations. In each round a lot of ODCs will be measured, the measurement chamber will be
      filled with participants blood samples in a randomized manner. After the measurements, the
      blood samples will be discarded.
