      and stimulate underlying myofascial trigger points, muscular, and connective tissues for the
      management of neuromusculoskeletal pain and movement impairments. Dry needling (DN) is a
      technique used to treat dysfunctions in skeletal muscle, fascia, and connective tissue, and,
      diminish persistent peripheral nociceptive input, and reduce or restore impairments of body
      structure and function leading to improved activity and participation.
