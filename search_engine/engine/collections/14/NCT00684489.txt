      is greater among the elderly, obese, and ethnic minorities. Unfortunately, hypertension
      control rates remain in the 25% range and are often significantly lower for the high-risk
      groups noted.1 Since the high-risk groups are growing more rapidly than the general
      population, the prevalence of hypertension and associated morbidity and mortality will
      probably increase sharply in the years ahead unless successful strategies are implemented for
      dramatically improving blood pressure control.

      Direct measurements of plasma renin reflect the relative balance between volume (V) and
      vasoconstrictor (renin [R]) factors underlying the elevated blood pressure in patients with
      essential hypertension.2 While many antihypertensive medications have effects on both the
      volume (V) and vasoconstrictor (renin [R]) components of elevated blood pressure, one or the
      other usually predominates
