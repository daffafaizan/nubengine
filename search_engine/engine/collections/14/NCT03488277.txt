    
      Prospective trial including full term parturients scheduled for a cesarean section under
      spinal anesthesia. patients are being randomly assigned into 2 groups:

      LE group: will be positioned in 15° left tilt with leg elevation with a 30cm height pillow
      under the heels, this position will be hold after spinal anesthesia until fetal extraction.

      Control group: will be positioned in supine with 15° left tilt. the 2 groups will receive a
      10ml/kg of crystalloid co-load intravenously, and the spinal anesthesia will be performed in
      sitting position with the same dose of Bupivacain, morphine and sufentanil. we will record
      the demographic data, pre and intraoperative hemodynamic parameters, the dose of ephedrine
      required to treat post spinal hypotension and fetal parameters: pH and blood lactates
