    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety of GRm13Z40-2 CTL CNS loco-regional cellular immunotherapy in
      research participants with recurrent or refractory/ progressive malignant glioma (WHO Grades
      3 or 4).

      II. To assess the safety of convection enhanced delivery (CED) of recombinant human
      Interleukin-2 (rhuIL-2) used in conjunction with GRm13Z40-2 CTL adoptive transfer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To investigate the ability of 9-(4-fluoro-3-hydroxy-methyl-butyl) guanine (18FHBG)
      positron emission tomography PET to image GRm13Z40-2 CTL's in research participants.

      II. To study the impact of concurrent dexamethasone administration on the tempo and magnitude
      of T cell allograft rejection responses in treated research participants by tracking the
      frequency of anti-GRm13Z40-2 immune responses in serially acquired peripheral blood samples.

      III. To evaluate ganciclovir administration for ablating transferred GRm13Z40-2 in vivo
      should significant graft-mediated toxicities be encountered.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive GRm13Z40-2 therapeutic allogeneic lymphocytes intratumorally (IT)
      over 10 minutes on days 1 and 3 and aldesleukin IT over 3 hours on days 2-5 (days 1-5 in week
      2). Treatment repeats every week for 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed annually for at least 15 years.
