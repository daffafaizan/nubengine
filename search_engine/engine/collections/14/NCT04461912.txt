      at the Coimbra Surgical Center of Portugal. The study will be conducted on subjects with
      age-related cataract, and on healthy subjects as control group. Since this is a pilot study,
      no sample size estimation has been implemented. The statistical power will be determined at
      the end of the study. Only per-protocol participants will be considered on statistical
      analysis.

      Procedures involved. The ultrasonic system (Experimental Medical Device - ESUS) works in
      A-scan mode, with an acoustic working frequency of 20 MHz. From the ultrasonic signals
      backscattered from the lenses, acoustic parameters will be extracted, and used for automatic
      algorithms implementation. This study will be implemented once.

      Slit lamp with LOCS III classification will be used as comparator. Contrast sensitivity test
      results will be used for incipient cataract detection, where slit lamp may present some
      limitations. Optical coherence tomography and specular microscopy will help on detecting
      postoperative complications; other complications identified by the physician will be also
      considered. Surgical parameters as phacoemulsification energy and surgical time will help on
      phacoemulsification energy evaluation.

      Safety assessment. The system uses an ophthalmic probe. There are not anticipated adverse
      events related to the procedures involved in the use of the ultrasonic system, or any other
      procedure in the protocol. The safety conditions will be monitored through the occurrence of
      unanticipated adverse events or serious adverse events. If these situations occur, the event
      will be reported to the competent authorities (in agreement with the current regulation) and
      the corrective actions will be implemented.
