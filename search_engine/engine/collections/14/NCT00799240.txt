      cell growth, proliferation and apoptosis.(4) Increased IGF1 signaling results in upregulation
      of proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis through RAF and PI3K pathways.(5) Several types
      of cancer, including non-small cell lung cancer, express IGF-1R and its ligand. The
      sequestration of IGF by IGF binding protein was associated with improved survival in patients
      with resected stage I lung cancer.(6) High expression of IGF-1R is associated with poor
      survival in surgically resected stage I lung cancer, specifically adenocarcinoma subtype.
      Patients with adenocarcinoma and never smoker had higher expression of IGF-1R vs. squamous
      cell carcinoma and smokers.(7). Low IGF-1R expression was associated with significant
      improvement in survival in the adenocarcinoma lung cancer but there was a lack of correlation
      between expression of IGF1R and survival in patients with squamous cell histology.

      Monoclonal antibodies target the extracellular domain of IGF-IR and small molecules inhibit
      IGF-1R kinase. This is a potential new strategy in the treatment of lung cancer.
