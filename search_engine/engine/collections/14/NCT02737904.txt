      for those with moderate to high levels of disability are limited. Cycling, delivered with an
      Active Passive Trainer (APT) is one exercise option often offered within
      rehabilitation/exercise settings and many pwMS buy APTs for home use. Anecdotally, pwMS
      report they feel better and their spasticity reduces after APT cycling, however there is a
      lack of evidence to support this.

      30 pwMS will be recruited from the Physical Disability Rehabilitation Unit at the Queen
      Elizabeth University Hospital, Glasgow, and randomised to APT + usual care or usual care
      only. Those in the APT group will receive 30 minutes of APT (2 mins passive warm up, 26 mins
      active cycling and 2 mins passive cool down), five days per week for 4 weeks. Outcome
      measures will be cardiovascular fitness measured using the oxygen uptake efficiency slope
      (OUES), spasticity assessed by Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) and the Multiple Sclerosis
      Spasticity Scale (MSSS-88), function assessed by the Functional Independence Measure (FIM)
      and the Timed 25 foot walk test (T25FW), Quality of Life measured by MSQOL-54. Outcome
      measures will be assessed in both groups before and after the 4 week intervention period.
      Symmetry, distance cycled and power will be recorded following each cycling session in the
      intervention group.
