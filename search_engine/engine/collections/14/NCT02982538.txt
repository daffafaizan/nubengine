      for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can be successfully disseminated and implemented in
      the Army by comparing two PE training models: Standard PE training (workshop only) and
      Extended PE training (workshop plus consultation). Up to 180 mental health providers at three
      medium-to large Army installations will be randomly assigned to either Standard PE training
      or Extended PE training. All providers will complete a 4-day PE workshop, along with the
      distribution of training materials and treatment manuals, conducted at the military site by
      the Overall Study PI, Dr. Edna Foa, and her team. Following the 4-day workshop, participants
      randomized to the Extended PE training will receive weekly phone consultation with a PE
      expert on two PE therapy cases. Participants randomized to the Standard PE training group
      will not receive any additional consultation following the workshop. Providers will not be
      required to use PE therapy with their patients with PTS symptoms; using PE will be optional.
      A major outcome of this study is the proportion of the providers PTSD patients that are
      offered PE or PE components. The mental health outcomes of providers' PTS patients will also
      be monitored as a second major outcome. Patients seeking treatment from participating
      providers will be recruited, consented, and assessed by independent evaluators at two time
      points to prospectively assess their response to treatment.
