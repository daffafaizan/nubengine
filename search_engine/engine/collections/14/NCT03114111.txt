        1. To determine the efficacy of photodynamic therapy (PDT) in the treatment of seborrheic
           dermatitis.

        2. To determine how PDT alters the skin microbiome in subjects with seborrheic dermatitis
           before and after treatment.

        3. To determine how PDT alters sebum secretion rates in subjects with seborrheic dermatitis
           before and after treatment.

      The researchers hypothesize that PDT will be efficacious in the treatment of seborrheic
      dermatitis.
