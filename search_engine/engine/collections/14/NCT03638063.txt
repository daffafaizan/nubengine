    
      This is a randomized, cross-over, single-blind trial. After verification of the entry
      criteria, eligible patients will be, based on the randomization codes, randomly assigned to
      undergo either capsaicin or ATP cough provocation test (the participants will inhale
      capasaicin or ATP incremental concentration to induce cough, meanwhile the number of coughs
      and adverse events will be recorded in each concentration during the first 30 seconds),
      followed by a washout period of 2 to 14 days (no major changes in the use of concomitant
      medications are allowed,especially the medcines which are not allowed before test ).
      Participants will be crossed-over to undergo another cough provocation test. Patient would be
      under observation in the out-patient clinics for ~2 hours following the cough provocation
      tests in case of severe adverse events. Twenty four hours after each test, a follow-up
      telephone visit will be scheduled for all patients to record any response which may be
      related to the test.
