    
      Patients with clinically-diagnosed cirrhosis without HCC (Group 1) and patients with
      early-stage HCC (Group 2) will be invited to participate in this study consisting of one
      visit for all subjects. At Visit 1, Day 0, after subjects have provided informed consent and
      HIPAA consent, demographics (age, gender, ethnicity), etiology of liver disease and medical
      history as well as a list of current medications will be obtained; inclusion and exclusion
      criteria will be reviewed; and subjects will be registered into the study and will undergo a
      venipuncture to obtain four (4) lavender top K2 ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) 10
      millilitre (mL) tubes of blood.

      The HCCBloodTest will be performed on the blood samples collected from study subjects by the
      Sponsor at its laboratory in Berlin, Germany, to determine the performance characteristics of
      the HCCBloodTest in the study population.

      The HCCBloodTest is an in-vitro polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for the qualitative
      detection of Septin 9 gene methylation (SEPT9) in DNA isolated from 3.5 mL of patient plasma.
      The SEPT9 gene is a key regulator of cell division and tumor suppressor and the
      hypermethylation of the assessed marker site is associated with liver carcinogenesis.

      Results from the HCCBloodTest will be not be provided to the investigators or study subjects
      and, therefore, will be not be used in clinical decision-making or impact clinical care of
      the study participants in any manner.
