      especially children between the ages of 5 and 15 years. These headaches can be disabling and
      tend to interfere with a child's daily activities, such as going to school or playing with
      friends. Because pediatric migraine children tend to be misdiagnosed, they are often not
      treated effectively. Topiramate, an anti-seizure medication, has been shown to prevent
      migraines in adults, and it has been approved to treat seizures in children as young as 2
      years of age as add-on treatment (used with another drug) and also can be used alone
      (monotherapy) in children as young as 10 years old. Since topiramate has already been studied
      in children, information about its safety in children is available. In this study, children
      with migraine headaches will be identified. It is not necessary for the child to have the
      migraine aura (having blurry vision; seeing flashing lights) to be included in this study.
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of Topiramate (or placebo) given
      for 4 to 5 months. An optional 3-month open-label extension (topiramate only; no placebo)
      will follow. The objective of the study is to demonstrate that topiramate is effective and
      safe when used to prevent migraine headaches (with or without aura) in children. Safety will
      be assessed throughout the study.

      Topiramate sprinkle capsules (or placebo), starting at 15 milligrams per day for 1st week;
      increased to 30 milligrams per day for week 2; increased to 50 milligrams (in tablets) per
      day in week 3, then adjusted as needed to 2 to 3 milligrams/kilogram/day for the rest of
      study (140 days total).
