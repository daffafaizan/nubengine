      femoral triangle block (FTB). However, it is the investigators' observation that 10-20 % of
      the patients still complain of intense pain localized in the center of the knee.

      Cadaver dissection studies have shown that an injection into the distal part of the adductor
      canal will spread to the popliteal fossa, and one dissection study showed consistent spread
      to the popliteal plexus.

      The study team hypothesized that a PPB will reduce the postoperative pain, when it is used as
      a supplement to the FTB in patients undergoing ACL reconstruction.
