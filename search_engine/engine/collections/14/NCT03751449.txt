      I. To assess the effect of a home-based aerobic and resistance exercise and nutrition
      education intervention in overweight or obese, sedentary, older (65 years and above) breast
      cancer survivors on physical function (6-minute walk test) and quality of life compared to
      standard of care.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the effect of a home-based aerobic and resistance exercise and nutrition
      education intervention on diet quality, sleep, anxiety, depression, source of motivation for
      exercise, and immune function in overweight or obese, sedentary, older (65 years and above)
      breast cancer survivors compared to standard of care.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine how body composition (dual X-ray absorptiometry [DEXA]) and weight
      maintenance are affected by a 12-week aerobic and resistance exercise training program among
      older (65 years and above), sedentary, overweight and obese breast cancer survivors.

      II. To compare differences in the above outcomes among older (65 years and above), sedentary,
      overweight and obese breast cancer survivors who completed a home-based aerobic and
      resistance exercise training program versus those who did not receive the intervention,
      standard of care.

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I (ACTIVE TREATMENT): Participants complete a home-based aerobic and resistance
      exercise program and receive nutrition education for 12 weeks.

      GROUP II (WAITLIST): Participants are placed on a waitlist for 12 weeks and then complete a
      home-based aerobic and resistance exercise program and receive nutrition education for 12
      weeks.
