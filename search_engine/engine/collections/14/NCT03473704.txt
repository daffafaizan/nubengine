      will be weekly. Each week, the patient will find a brief summary of the previous session and
      an introduction to the topic, where the new session will be explained. Then, the patient will
      be provided with the new information (the topic treated) and different examples will be added
      to facilitate understanding. Once the information is presented, a summary of the key ideas of
      the session and a small evaluation to assess the understanding on the part of the patient
      will be presented. At the end of the session, the patient will have the key ideas and a
      self-evaluation of the session. Finally, the patient will be explained the task to be
      performed and sent to the therapist with an example of how to perform it. In addition, the
      patient will have a bibliography of each of the topics discussed. Each session will last
      20-30 minutes.
