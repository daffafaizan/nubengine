        -  Determine the toxicity of hepatic arterial infusion with floxuridine and systemic
           irinotecan adjuvant to liver metastases resection or ablation with or without resection
           in patients with hepatic metastases secondary to colorectal cancer.

        -  Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the time to any hepatic recurrence or progression in patients treated with
           this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to prior therapy
      (liver metastases resection only vs ablation with or without resection).

      Within 4-8 weeks after prior resection or ablation, patients receive hepatic arterial
      infusion of floxuridine continuously on days 1-14 and irinotecan IV over 30 minutes on days 1
      and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6 courses in the absence of unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years.
