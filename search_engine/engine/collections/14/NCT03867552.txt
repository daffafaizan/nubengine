      endometriosis or other gynaecologic laparoscopic surgery. Several trials have demonstrated
      that the use of an altered insufflation gas (10 % nitrous oxide + 4% oxygen + 86% carbon
      dioxide) reduces pain. It also decreases inflammation and adhesion formation as a surplus.

      With this mono-center, investigator initiated, double-blinded, randomized controlled
      superiority trial, the investigators want to demonstrate a reduced postoperative pain and
      peritoneal inflammatory reaction following peritoneal conditioning with an altered
      insufflation gas compared to the standard carbon dioxide (100% CO2) insufflation gas.
      Therefore, women undergoing laparoscopic (gynaecological) surgery with an estimated surgical
      time of >60 minutes will be asked to participate in this trial. Baseline characteristics will
      be assessed, including the patients' age, body mass index, medial history, American Society
      of Anesthesiologist Classification (ASA classification), work status, highest level of
      education, fear for the surgical procedure (using an 8-item surgical fear questionnaire),
      pre-operative pain (using a Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) were 0= no pain and 10= worst pain
      imaginable) both in resting position and in an active position), expected pain (NRS),
      baseline quality of recovery (QOR) (using the 1-item Global Surgical Recovery (GSR) index (3)
      and the Functional Recovery Index (FRI) (4)) as well as baseline quality of Life (QOL), using
      the 5-dimensional European Quality of Life (EQ-5D) questionnaire.
