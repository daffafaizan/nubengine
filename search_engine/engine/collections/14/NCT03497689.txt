      to a dose that improves the symptoms of PAH while minimizing excessive pharmacologic effects.
      After achieving a minimum SC/IV treprostinil dose of 20 ng/kg/min, subjects may begin a
      transition to oral treprostinil at the Transition Visit, which can occur at the Week 2, 4, or
      8 study visit. After the Transition Visit, oral treprostinil titration will continue through
      Week 16 to reach the maximum tolerated dose.
