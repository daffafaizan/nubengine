      treatment (CBT) from the specialist NHS Tayside Eating Disorders Service and accessing the
      online self-help "Smart Eating" programme have improved treatment outcomes compared to those
      receiving usual treatment only. All participants would be involved in the trial for 6 months,
      capturing their motivation for change, eating disorder psychopathology and quality of life at
      four time-points (pre-treatment, mid-treatment, end of treatment, 3-month follow-up). Some
      participants may continue to receive usual treatment after study end, which will be detailed
      in the study analysis. Following trial completion, all participants will be able to access
      the "Smart Eating" programme. The study will also explore acceptability of the "Smart Eating"
      self-help programme via a feedback questionnaire to inform programme adaptations and a
      possible pragmatic randomised controlled trial planned for the future. Currently, no other UK
      study is piloting the use of the "Smart Eating" programme as an adjunct to specialist NHS
      eating disorder treatment.
