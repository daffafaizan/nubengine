      randomly to 3 study groups: 20 patients will be part of the vertical whole body vibration
      experimental group in the EG1, that will perform a neuromuscular treatment using the vertical
      whole body vibration platform, another 20 will constitute the rotational whole body vibration
      experimental group in the EG2, that will perform a neuromuscular treatment using the
      rotational whole body vibration platform, and another 20 will constitute the control group
      (CG). All these subjects will sign the corresponding informed consent for their participation
      in the study, according to the ethical criteria established in the Helsinki Declaration. The
      study will take place between January and December 2016. Three groups of variables were
      analyzed in the present study three times: before, after and follow-up after three months of
      the intervention.
