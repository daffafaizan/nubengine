      (Dimethyl Fumarate, Peginterferon Beta-1a, and placebo). Participants experiencing a
      confirmed relapse or disability progression or high lesion burden on MRI will have the option
      to discontinue the blinded study treatment and switch to an alternative therapy or open-label
      BG00012.
