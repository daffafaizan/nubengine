    
      This is a multi-center, randomized, double blinded, active controlled, parallel-group study
      to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of three different potencies of NBP608(low, middle,
      high potency) and Varivax which are indicated for active immunization for the prevention of
      varicella. Total of 152 subjects (38 subjects per each treatment arm) of 12 months to 12
      years of age are enrolled, and each subject is administered with single dose of vaccine which
      is randomly assigned in 1:1:1:1 ratio. Stratified randomization for age group is used to
      achieve the balance of treatment assignment within age strata.

      Total of four visits are scheduled including two visits via telephone contact. Blood sampling
      is conducted for immunogenicity assessment before and 6 weeks after vaccination at Visit 1
      and Visit 3 respectively. Safety is monitored 1 week, 6 weeks and 26 weeks after vaccination
      through Visit 2*, Visit 3 and Visit 4* (*telephone contact)
