      chronic (> 2 years) traumatic brain injury (TBI) when compared to a non-brain injured cohort
      population.

      Preliminary data from an assay of amino acids in individuals with chronic TBI compared to an
      assay of individuals without a TBI revealed significantly lower concentrations of amino acids
      within the TBI group.

      The composition and structure of the oral and fecal microbiome will be determined by 16S rDNA
      sequencing. Taxonomic and community structure profiles will be treated as outcome variables
      and modeled together with the participant's plasma amino acid concentration, years
      post-injury, age, sex and other variables to determine correlations. These correlations may
      improve our understanding of the diminished amino acid metabolism within the chronic TBI
      population.

      The endpoint will identify the microbiome structure and composition by 16S rRNA gene
      sequencing within the TBI and healthy participants and to assess the participant's amino acid
      concentrations and other participant demographics and phenotypic characteristics (years
      post-injury, age, sex). This comparison may improve our understanding of the diminished amino
      acid metabolism within the chronic TBI population.
