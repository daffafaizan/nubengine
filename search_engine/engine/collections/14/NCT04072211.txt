      350 million go on to be chronic carriers. In adults, infection with HBV can be self-limiting
      in up to 95% of those infected and the most common route of infection is sexual transmission.
      HBV can also be transmitted perinatally, horizontally, through direct contact with infectious
      body fluids or blood, being pricked with an infected needle and injury from instruments
      contaminated with infectious body fluid or blood.

      Certain population groups are at higher risk of infection with HBV. Among these populations
      is that of health care workers (HCW). In this population, HBV infection can occur through
      occupational exposure. It is therefore imperative that HCWs are highly knowledgeable about
      HBV and how they can prevent transmission.Protection from HBV infection can be achieved by
      means of vaccination after which the HBV vaccine has been shown to be 90-100% effective.

      Despite availability of these vaccines, studies have shown low rates of vaccination against
      HBV amongst HCW in different countries. However, in countries where there is a deliberate
      policy to vaccinate HCW, the rates of HBV vaccination are over 90%. In Zambia, this rate has
      been reported to be as low as 19.3%.

      This project will demonstrate an approach to reduce HCW risk of HBV through increasing
      knowledge and awareness of HBV among HCWs, providing vaccination to HCWs and linking those
      already carrying HBV infection to care and treatment. The study will also investigate the
      cost of vaccinating HCWs against HBV and evaluate feasibility, acceptability and
      implementation factors to inform possible scale-up of this approach throughout Zambia.
