      neo-adjuvant chemotherapy has been completed, participants will be assessed by imaging scans
      to see whether they have a response to the treatment.

      If participants are responding to treatment, they will then have a trachelectomy. After
      surgery, participants will be assessed and the study doctor will determine whether adjuvant
      treatment is needed. Adjuvant treatment may include chemotherapy and radiotherapy, or have a
      hysterectomy done.

      If participants do not respond to or their disease worsens after neo-adjuvant treatment,
      participants will receive adjuvant treatment with chemotherapy and radiotherapy or have a
      hysterectomy done.
