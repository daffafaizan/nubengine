      viral burden of at least 500 copies/mL despite 20 weeks of treatment with a protease
      inhibitor receive combination therapy with three antiretroviral agents that were
      investigational at the start of study but have since been approved: abacavir, amprenavir, and
      efavirenz. At the end of 16 weeks, the addition of other antiretroviral agents to the study
      regimen was permitted. This was originally a multi-center study, but it has been closed at
      all other sites. It remains open at the NIH to continue to provide therapy to subjects who
      have received benefit as determined by a decline in viral load from baseline. Safety and
      viral load data continue to be collected.
