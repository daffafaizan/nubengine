      (daily and after training sessions) during 6 weeks of resistance training on skeletal muscle
      regulatory markers, hormonal responses and body composition in resistance-trained men.
      Specific aims of the study are to:

      To investigate the extent to which high protein milk supplementation will improve anabolic
      factors, lean body mass, fat mass and decrease catabolic markers after 6 weeks of resistance
      training in resistance-trained men.
