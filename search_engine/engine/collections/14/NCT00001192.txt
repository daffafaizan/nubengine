      with idiopathic generalized epileptic (IGE) disorders and their first-degree relatives. The
      battery comprises tests designed to tap attention, memory, selected sensory and perceptual
      functions, vigilance, and visual-spatial functions. Modified batteries have been developed
      for the assessment of children ages 5-8, and children ages 8-16. The data provided by these
      batteries are compared with genetic profiles of the same participants that have been
      ascertained from blood samples analyzed by colleagues at the Mount Sinai School of
      Medicine/Columbia University in New York City.
