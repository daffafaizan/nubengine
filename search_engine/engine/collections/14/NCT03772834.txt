    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine if the combination of exercise (EX) plus methylphenidate (MP) is superior to
      exercise plus placebo in the treatment of cancer-related fatigue (CRF) in patients with
      prostate cancer scheduled to receive radiotherapy with androgen deprivation therapy for 12
      weeks.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the effects of combined exercise plus methylphenidate on quality-of-life,
      mood, physical, and cognitive measures.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To identify potential synergistic effects of exercise and methylphenidate in improvement
      of CRF.

      II. To explore changes in brain activity by electroencephalography (EEG) in responders (with
      4 point or greater change in Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue
      [FACIT-F] scores) versus (vs) non-responders to the intervention.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 groups.

      GROUP I: Patients receive methylphenidate orally (PO) twice daily (BID) and undergo exercise
      program consisting of resistance training twice weekly (BIW) and walking 15- 40 minutes a day
      4 days a week for 12 weeks.

      GROUP II: Patients receive a placebo PO BID and undergo exercise program consisting of
      resistance training BIW and walking 15-40 minutes a day for 4 days a week for 12 weeks.

      GROUP III: Patients receive methylphenidate PO BID and undergo stretching for 4 days a week
      for 12 weeks.

      GROUP IV: Patients receive a placebo PO BID and undergo stretching for 4 days a week for 12
      weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3 months.
