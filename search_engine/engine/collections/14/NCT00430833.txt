      daily) or matching placebo. The initial dose of the study drug will be 8 mg once daily. Study
      drug dose will be then doubled as tolerated every 2 weeks while aiming for a target dose of
      32 mg once daily. Monitoring of blood pressure, serum creatinine, serum potassium and
      pressure gradient in LV outflow tract will be performed during dose increase. Patients will
      be observed clinically at 3, 6, and 12 months after the maintenance dose was reached.
      Exercise tolerance will be assessed by bicycle ergometry, presence of malignant arrhythmias
      by Holter monitoring, extent of LV hypertrophy by 2-dimensional echocardiography, and LV
      outflow tract pressure gradient by Doppler echocardiography at baseline and 12-month
      follow-up.
