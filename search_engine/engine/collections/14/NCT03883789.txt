    
      Approximately 500 pregnant participants above the age of 16 years will be enrolled into this
      study, which will occur over an 18-month period (February 2019 to August 2020).

      In this prospective cohort study, pregnant participants with or without liver disease will be
      identified through clinics at King's College Hospital. Participants attending the antenatal,
      specialist liver-pregnancy clinic and general liver clinics will be given an information
      leaflet detailing the study. Participants can be interviewed in a clinic room to answer any
      queries. The participant is then given the option of consenting and participating in the
      study during that clinic consultation or to contact us at a future date should they need
      further time for consideration.

      Baseline participant details will be collected as well as any preceding liver diagnosis and
      other comorbidities.

      Once consented, the assessment visits will be as follows.

        1. Trimester 1 visit (at week 12 booking ultrasound scan):

           - Additional FibroScan after booking scan (ideally 3 hours *fasting will be required
           before this scan)

        2. Trimester 2 visit (at week 20 routine ultrasound scan):

             -  Additional FibroScan after ultrasound scan (ideally 3 hours *fasting will be
                required before this scan)

             -  Blood tests to be taken at this point

        3. Trimester 3 visit (if occurs, e.g. in participants with diabetes):

             -  FibroScan (ideally 3 hours *fasting will be required before this scan)

             -  Blood tests (liver function tests)

        4. Post-partum visit (if occurs):

             -  FibroScan (ideally 3 hours *fasting will be required before this scan)

             -  Blood tests (liver function tests)

                  -  Fasting = nothing to eat or drink (except water)

      The participants will be followed up during pregnancy and, if required, for 3 months after
      pregnancy, as per routine Obstetric care. Delivery, maternal and foetal outcomes will also be
      documented. This information will come from the participant online medical records.
