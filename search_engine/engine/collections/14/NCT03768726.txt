    
      Study A1281201 is a 6 month, open label extension study of the ongoing double blind,
      randomized, placebo controlled study of ziprasidone in pediatric Bipolar Disorder (Study
      A1281198). Study A1281201 will enroll adolescents aged 10 to 17 years with Bipolar I Disorder
      who have participated in double blind Study A1281198. In order to be enrolled in this open
      label extension trial, subjects must have met the enrollment criteria for Study A1281198, and
      must meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria for Study A1281201 at the extension study
      Baseline visit (last visit in the double blind study).

      The purpose of adding this extension study to the ongoing Geodon pediatric bipolar program is
      to obtain additional longer term safety data in children and adolescents with Bipolar I
      disorder treated with ziprasidone.
