      scored by the Numeric Rating Score (NRS) system. Intraoperative and postoperative narcotic
      usage, nausea scores and patients' perception of their quality of recovery via the QoR-40
      survey will also be assessed.

      The use of intraoperative Ketamine and Magnesium is predicted to decrease postoperative pain
      in patients on chronic opioid therapy for management of chronic pelvic pain and will overall
      improve patients' postoperative experience.
