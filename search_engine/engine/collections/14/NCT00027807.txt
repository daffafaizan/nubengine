        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of armed activated T cells given in combination
           with interleukin-2 and sargramostim (GM-CSF) in women with stage IV breast cancer.

        -  Determine the toxicity profile of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the clinical response and overall and progression-free survival of patients
           treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of armed activated T cells.

      Patients undergo peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) collection. The PBMCs are treated
      ex vivo with monoclonal antibody OKT3 to form armed activated T cells (ATC). The armed ATC
      are expanded for 14 days in interleukin-2 (IL-2).

      Patients receive armed ATC IV over 30 minutes twice weekly for 4 weeks. Patients also receive
      IL-2 subcutaneously (SC) once daily and sargramostim (GM-CSF) SC twice weekly beginning 3
      days before the first infusion of armed ATC and continuing until 7 days after the last
      infusion of armed ATC.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of armed ATC until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, additional
      patients are treated at that dose.

      Patients are followed at 1, 2, and 5 months and then every 6 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-30 patients will be accrued for the phase I portion of this
      study and a total of 18-33 patients will be accrued for the phase II portion of this study
      within 4-6 years.

      PLEASE NOTE: THIS STUDY WAS INTENDED TO BE A PHASE I/II STUDY, BUT NEVER MOVED FORWARD TO
      PHASE II. (4-22-09)
