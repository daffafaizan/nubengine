      care. Specifically, the investigators evaluated the effectiveness of this intervention as
      compared to 'care as usual'. The investigators studied the effect of the intervention on
      clinical outcomes such as depressive symptoms, functional status, health related quality of
      life. They also determined the cost-effectiveness of the intervention compared to care as
      usual.
