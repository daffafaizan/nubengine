      I. Assessment of cell yield and percentage of viable cells upon tissue receipt at the cell
      processing facility.

      II. Obtain discarded tumor tissue from surgical resections for further studies to aid in
      development of future therapies for glioblastoma (GBM) and other solid tumors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Assessment of cell yield and percentage of viable cells from other solid tumor cells
      shipped to the cell processing facility.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. An additional line of inquiry will be devoted to scientific exploration of the product's
      immunogenicity looking at important variables in the course of manufacture.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo collection of tissue sample during surgery. Patients also undergo collection
      of blood sample.
