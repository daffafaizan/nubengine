    
      This is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, safety and efficacy study of
      pirfenidone in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Approximately 320 patients
      at approximately 50 centers will be randomly assigned (1:1) to receive pirfenidone 2403
      milligrams or placebo equivalent administered in divided doses three times per day (TID) with
      food. The primary outcome variable will be the absolute change in percent predicted Forced
      Vital Capacity from Baseline to Week 72. Patients will be randomized by geographic region.

      Patients will receive blinded study treatment from the time of randomization until the last
      patient randomized has been treated for 72 weeks. A Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will
      periodically review safety and efficacy data to ensure patient safety.

      After week 72, patients who meet the Progression of Disease (POD) definition, which is a ≥
      10% absolute decrease in percent predicted Forced Vital Capacity or a ≥ 15% absolute decrease
      in percent predicted carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (DLco), will be eligible to receive
      permitted idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis therapies in addition to their blinded study drug.
      Permitted idiopathic pulmonary therapies include corticosteroids, azathioprine,
      cyclophosphamide and N-acetyl-cysteine (with restrictions).
