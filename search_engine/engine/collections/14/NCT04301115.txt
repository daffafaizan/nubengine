      evaluation of abutment teeth of tooth implant supported bridge, unilateral attachment and
      conventional partial denture in mandibular distal extension cases.

      Materials and methods: Twenty four patients were selected according to the following
      criteria: Patients with unilateral mandibular distal extension with last standing second
      premolar abutment, abutments showed sufficient occluso-gingival height and good periodontal
      condition. Patients were divided into three equal groups, each of eight patients: patients of
      group I Patients received a fixed tooth implant supported bridge, patients of group II
      Patients received a removable unilateral attachment partial denture and group III Patients
      received a conventional removable partial denture.Evaluation included patient satisfaction
      using "OHIP14" questionnaires and biting force measurement radiographic evaluation of
      terminal abutments.
