      adults is also useful in children. This will help paediatricians and other doctors to
      recognise neuropathic pain and start appropriate treatment or know when to refer children to
      a chronic pain clinic.The Investigators will also measure the effects of neuropathic pain on
      mood, sleep, and quality of life (using questionnaires); identify changes in the sensitivity
      of the skin to touch and other sensations (using specialised sensory tests); and determine
      the feasibility of brain imaging for assessing changes in the brain (using magnetic resonance
      imaging or MRI), in children with neuropathic pain. This information will allow the
      investigators to measure how effective different types of treatment are, and help ensure
      children get the most appropriate treatment or interventions to reduce pain and effects on
      quality of life.

      This pilot study of 10-18 year olds diagnosed with neuropathic pain will involve completion
      of questionnaires by the child and parent, and sensory testing in the child, after their
      clinic appointment. For some families, there will be an additional visit for MRI. Children
      will be recruited from the Chronic Pain Outpatients service at Great Ormond Street Hospital
      NHS Trust. This research is funded by Great Ormond Street Hospital Children's Charity.
