      population consists of NSTEACS patients who undergo FFR in lesions with intermediate to
      severe angiographic stenosis. Then, FFR-guided PCI is performed, followed by morphological
      assessment based on IVUS in all FFR-negative lesions (FNLs). After discharge all patients
      receive optimal medication treatment and are followed up clinically. On the basis of
      follow-up angiography, MACEs are further adjudicated as occurring at FNLs or not.
