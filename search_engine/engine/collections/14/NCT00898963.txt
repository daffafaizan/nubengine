        -  Correlate gene expression profiles with progression-free survival (PFS) of patients with
           stage III or IV follicular lymphoma treated with cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and
           prednisone with or without rituximab on clinical trial E-1496.

        -  Determine if immunoglobulin Fc-gamma receptor polymorphisms are predictive of PFS in
           these patients.

        -  Assess the significance of the microenvironment by constructing tissue microarrays of
           follicular lymphoma and immunostaining with relevant biomarkers.

        -  Correlate relevant biomarkers with clinical features, response, and PFS.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Tissue samples are analyzed by gene expression profiling, microarrays to predict gene
      expression, immunohistochemistry, and immunoglobulin Fc-gamma receptor polymorphism analysis
      for biological markers.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 175 samples will be accrued for this study.
