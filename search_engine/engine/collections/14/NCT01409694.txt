      can only temporarily slow down ADRD. Future possibilities of care could rely on multi-target
      drugs therapies that address simultaneously several pathophysiological processes leading to
      neurodegeneration. We hypothesized that the combination of memantine with vitamin D could be
      neuroprotective in ADRD, thereby limiting neuronal loss and cognitive decline.

      The primary objective of this trial is to compare the effect after 24 weeks of the oral
      intake of vitamin D3 with the effect of a placebo on the evolution of cognitive performance
      in patients suffering from moderate ADRD and receiving memantine.

      The secondary objectives of the study are as follows:

        -  To compare the effect after 12 weeks of the oral intake of vitamin D3 with the effect of
           a placebo on the evolution of cognitive performance in patients suffering from moderate
           ADRD and receiving memantine.

        -  To compare the effect after 12 and 24 weeks of the oral intake of vitamin D3 with the
           effect of a placebo on the evolution of functional abilities in patients suffering from
           moderate ADRD and receiving memantine.

        -  To compare the effect after 12 and 24 weeks of the oral intake of vitamin D3 with the
           effect of a placebo on the evolution of postural and gait performance in patients
           suffering from moderate ADRD and receiving memantine.

        -  To determine the compliance to treatment and tolerance of the oral intake of vitamin D3
           in patients suffering from moderate ADRD and receiving memantine.
