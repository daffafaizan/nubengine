      I. Assess the efficacy of sunitinib malate, in terms of response rate (complete and partial),
      in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma.

      II. Assess the toxicity, safety, and tolerability of this drug in these patients.

      III. Assess the duration of response or stable disease, stable disease rate, progression-free
      survival, and median and overall survival rates.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, nonrandomized, open-label study. Patients are stratified
      according to prior cytotoxic chemotherapy (yes vs no).

      Patients receive oral sunitinib malate once daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 6
      weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 4 weeks and then every 3 months
      thereafter.
