      (traditional rehabilitation), the low-intensity exercise group (traditional rehabilitation
      plus low-intensity exercise training), or the moderate-intensity exercise group (traditional
      rehabilitation plus the moderate-intensity exercise training). Frequency of the exercise
      training is 2-6 times/week, totally 20 times. In the symptom-limit exercise tolerance tests,
      subjects wear a gas-collecting mask and electrocardiogram, and pre-set graduated loading was
      offered by the bike. One therapists and one doctor would monitor the test. For resistance and
      time setting within each exercise training, it is customized by results of exercise tolerance
      tests in baseline and the allocation. Moreover, a therapist would stay with subject ,monitor
      the training, and measure the blood pressure before and after the training.
