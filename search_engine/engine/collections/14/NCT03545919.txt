      Longitudinal Analysis of the Lung Microbiome in Lung Transplantation.

      Background:Infection affects the short-term prognosis of patients with lung transplantation
      and chronic lung allograft dysfunction(CLAD) limits their long-term survival.It is important
      to provide more theoretical support for early diagnosis and treatment of acute respiratory
      tract infection and CLAD in patients with lung transplantation.

      Study Objectives:Evaluate the clinical significance of community-acquired respiratory virus
      (CARV) infection in patients with lung transplantation;Explore the lung microbiome dynamics
      within one year after lung transplantation;Find the relationship between lung microbiome and
      CLAD.

      Study Design:A prospective and longitudinal study,following up the patients for 3 years.

      Sample Size:100 cases. Study methods:CARV detection for respiratory specimens are performed
      during acute infection and routine re-testing in patients after lung
      transplantation,following up the patients who have positive findings to analyze the
      progression rates to lower respiratory tract infection,mortality rate within 90 days and risk
      factors associated with progression and death.For HRV/CoVs/HBoV detecting positive patients,
      consecutively collect respiratory specimens to quantitate viral load and combine virus
      serology to further confirm their pathogenicity on host.Complete a longitudinal 16S ribosomal
      RNA and metagenomics survey of the lung microbiome on respiratory samples collected from
      routine testing or re-testing（pre-operation,24 hours after the operation，day 3, day 7, week
      2, week 3, month 1, month 3, month 6, month 9, month 12 , month 18, month 24, month 30, month
      36) to explore the lung microbiome dynamics within one year after lung transplantation and
      find the relationship between lung microbiome and CLAD after 3 years
      follow-up.Besides,collect the peripheral blood of some patients for transcriptome and/or
      whole genome sequencing to screen for the host susceptibility genes.
