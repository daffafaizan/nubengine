    
      REE and DIT are measured by indirect calorimetry . The device used is a using an open-circuit
      ventilated hood system (QUARK RMRÂ®, Cosmed, Pavona; Italy). The respiration quo- tient (RQ)
      and flow settings are calibrated by reference to alcohol combustion every six months. Before
      each test, the calorimeter is calibrated with a reference gas mixture (5% CO2, 95% O2 v/v).
      Expired carbon di- oxide (VCO2) and inspired oxygen (VO2) -flows are recorded, as well as the
      RQ. EE is calculated every minute from oxygen consumption (VO2 in ml/min) and carbon dioxide
      production (VCO2 in ml/min) using the Weir formula without protein correction. DIT is
      measured during 6 hours after a calibrated breakfast (normal fat diet or high fat diet
      according to the cross-over design) as 30% of theoric energy intake.
