      diabetes patients are recruited with clinical evidence of lypo-hypertrophy in insulin
      injected areas. Patients attend to the Diabetes Unit of Niguarda Ca' Granda Hospital. Obese
      patients with a thickening fat subcutaneous tissue that could have interfered with the
      interpreting and analyzing of the data are left out of this first study. In the control group
      the investigators manage to define the lypo-hypertrophic area by tapping and body inspection.
      In the study group the investigators can define and mark out the area/areas with
      lipo-hypertrophy by ultrasound scan test. All the tested patients both the control group and
      the study group, are discouraged from use insulin in areas where lypo-hypertrophy is present.
      Patients are reassessed after 3 months with a clinical assessment of glucose control by
      HbA1c. After 12 months subcutaneous tissue scan is repeated in 10 patients within the
      experimental group and a new assessment of HbA1c is performed. Ultrasound assessment. The
      scan used is Esaote My Lab70 linear probe multi-frequency [6-18 Mhz)
