      stress myocardial (heart) imaging can define the pediatric Kawasaki disease (KD) population
      into high and low risk categories of developing cardiac (heart) events (complications) from 1
      year through 3 years after image completion. The safety of CARDIOLITE® rest and stress heart
      imaging will also be studied.
