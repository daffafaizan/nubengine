      Interventions that slow the advance of HIV infection and delay the introduction of
      antiretroviral therapy (ART) could make an important contribution to HIV management in both
      the developed and developing world. We are conducting a 330 person randomized, controlled
      clinical trial of MBSR for persons with HIV-1 infection and CD4 T-lymphocyte counts > 250
      cells/Âµm who are not on antiretroviral therapy. Participants are randomized in a 1:1
      distribution to either the MBSR intervention or to an education group that will control for
      the attention and social interaction aspects of MBSR. Participants are evaluated at 0, 3, 6
      and 12 months. Key outcome measures at 12 months include differences in CD4 T cell counts,
      HIV viral load, perceived stress, depression, and positive affect. We are also examining
      whether MBSR is associated with changes in neuroendocrine function (autonomic nervous system
      activity, cortisol secretion) and alterations in immune function that may serve as
      intermediate steps between the neuroendocrine effects of MBSR and CD4 T cell counts, such as
      changes in T cell activation. A subset of 90 participants will be studied in additional
      detail using a structured laboratory stress challenge.
