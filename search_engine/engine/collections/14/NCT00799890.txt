      Sunphenon EGCg has an antiinflammatoric effect due to its impact on the T-cell-proliferation
      and the inhibition of the activity of NF-Kb.

      Sunphenon EGCg has a neuroprotective effect due to its antioxidative potence as a radical
      scavenger.

      A 30 month treatment with Sunphenon EGCg is safe and well-tolerated.
