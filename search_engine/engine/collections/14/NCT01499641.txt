      apparent side effect.

      Convalescence after discectomy for herniated disc disease is dependent on pain and the
      inflammatory response. In arthroscopic and abdominal surgery steroids reduce the inflammatory
      response and enhance recovery.

      200 patients with herniated disc disease are randomly allocated to receive epidural
      methylprednisolone 40 mg or none.
