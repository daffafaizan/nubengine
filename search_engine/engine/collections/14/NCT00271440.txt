      solutions may reduce the risk of infection and mortality. Cleansing with 0.25% chlorhexidine
      in Nepal resulted in a 28% reduction in mortality among low birth weight infants, while there
      was no impact on infants of normal weight. The mechanism of action for this observed benefit
      is not clear. Chlorhexidine may remove pathogens from the skin of the newborn and/or prevent
      exposure to pathogens that may otherwise cause infection and lead to sepsis. The benefit of
      chlorhexidine cleansing may be extended with higher concentrations of chlorhexidine.

      Infants born at the Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital in Katmandu, Nepal will be
      randomized to skin cleansing with chlorhexidine at one of three concentrations (0.25%, 0.50%,
      1.00%). Skin swabs will be collected before wiping, and two and twenty-four hours after
      wiping in order to compare levels of bacteria on the skin across the treatment groups. A
      small quantity of blood will be collected at 24 hours after wiping to determine the potential
      for absorption of chlorhexidine
