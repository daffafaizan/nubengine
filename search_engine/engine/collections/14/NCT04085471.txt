    
      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, progressive, autoimmune disease of synovial joints.
      Characterized by periods of flares with high disease activity involving both a systemic
      immune response and tissue-specific inflammatory events that can lead to erosive joint and
      bone destruction and subsequent disability . Currently, diagnosis of RA is based mainly on
      the extent of tenderness and swelling of the joints , levels of acute-phase reactants such as
      C-reactive protein (CRP) ,erythrocyte sedimentation rate(ESR) , high titers of rheumatoid
      factor (RF) and high titers of antibodies against cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) in
      the plasma .Of interest, CTHRC1 is a secreted modulator of Wnt signaling, which is a key
      regulator of joint remodeling, and promotes cell proliferation and migration. Therefore,
      CTHRC1 may contribute to multiple aspects of the pathogenic FLS behavior in RA and modulate
      processes that promote synovial hyperplasia and invasion.The expression pattern of CTHRC1 in
      pannus, its role in the function of FLS relevant to cartilage damage in RA, and CTHRC1's
      association with disease severity in murine arthritis raised the question of whether CTHRC1
      could be used as a marker for RA diagnosis and monitoring of disease activity in patients
