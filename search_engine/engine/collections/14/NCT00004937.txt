      rate and response duration in patients with glioblastoma multiforme. II. Determine the
      toxicities of this treatment regimen in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive acridine carboxamide IV continuously
      over days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for at least 2 courses and up to a maximum of
      6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are
      followed every 6 weeks until disease progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-25 patients will be accrued for this study.
