      cell transplantation through one of the below mentioned techniques: 1. Directly into the
      injured spinal cord site with a syringe after exposing the spinal cord. 2. By Intrathecal
      injection. Number of cells Injected: 200 million cells in 1.8 ml of autologous plasma. In
      case of Direct delivery, the cells were delivered in one sitting at six sites ( 2 above the
      lesion, 2 at the lesion and 2 below the lesion) as 0.3 ml aliquots each. In case of
      Intrathecal injection, the cells were delivered as a single injection of 1.8ml via lumbar
      puncture. Frequency of Injection: Single Total duration of Therapy: The procedure of Bone
      marrow harvesting, enrichment and transplantation was completed in a single setting of
      approximately 2-3 hours. The transplantation procedure in case of Direct delivery took 2 mins
      per injection site that is approximately 12 mins and in case of lumbar puncture the
      transplantation procedure took approximately 2 mins.

      Comparator Agent:Control: control subjects with acute complete spinal cord injury who would
      not receive any bone marrow transplantation.
