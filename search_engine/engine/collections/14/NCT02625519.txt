    
      The aim of this study is to determine whether the number of oocytes obtained in women oocyte
      donors may be different with the use of rFSH or uFSH based on receptor N680S FSHR gene
      polymorphism.

      This is an exploratory, prospective, randomized, comparative, open trial with control group
      treated according to the usual therapeutic approach in our institution for ovarian
      stimulation for oocyte donors prospective exploratory study control group .

      Three groups will be set based on follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR) genotype for
      the polymorphism N680: Group SS (Ser/Ser), group SN (Ser/Asn) and group NN (Asn/Asn). Donor
      members of each group will be randomly assigned to receive daily 225 IU of recombinant or
      urinary FSH for controlled ovarian stimulation protocol with antagonists. To avoid
      unintentional bias, allocation to treatment group will take place at the time in which
      ovarian stimulation according begins with a list of random allocation of treatments for each
      of the groups (SS , SN and NN) that will be associated the code of the patient and are
      prepared and will be available before the start of the study. The code assignment and
      treatment of the patient will consecutively in the order of the list and must be recorded in
      the medical history of the patient. The next scheduled patient will be assigned to the code
      and the next immediate treatment in this list.

      The protocol for controlled ovarian stimulation in oocyte donors, will be performed always
      according to the usual protocol in the Instituto Bernabeu.
