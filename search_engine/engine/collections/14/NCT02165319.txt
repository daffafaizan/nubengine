      tube's position is known to influence the pressure of tube's cuff. The shape of the cuff
      (barrel-shaped versus tapered-shaped) may affect the tube's migration degree because of the
      difference of the frictional force.

      The investigator try to compare the the cuff pressure after supine-to-lateral position change
      between barrel-shaped cuff and taper-shaped cuff.
