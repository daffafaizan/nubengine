      testosterone, is an anabolic steroid shown to promote gain in body weight and muscle mass
      after trauma, severe illness, surgery, burns, and stress. To date there are no studies that
      have evaluated the effect of oxandrolone in persons with chronic spinal cord injury. This
      study will assess the effect of oxandrolone on strength, metabolic rate, lean body mass,
      pulmonary function, and ambulation in persons with chronic SCI. This study has the potential
      to yield valuable information concerning the use of oxandrolone after SCI.
