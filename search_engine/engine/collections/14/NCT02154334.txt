    
      This is a Phase 1, single-center, open -label (all people know the identity of the
      intervention) study of intranasal esketamine in two cohorts: Cohort 1 will be healthy
      participants assigned to a fixed treatment sequence and Cohort 2 will be participants with
      nasal rhinitis randomized to 1 of 2 treatment sequences. For all participants, the study
      comprises 3 phases: a Screening phase (up to 21 days), an Open Label Treatment phase
      (includes 2 treatment periods; Period 1 and Period 2) and Follow-up phase (10 +/-2 days after
      last dose of esketamine).

      Total study duration for participants in Cohort 1 is up to 52 days which includes Screening
      phase, Period 1 (3 days) where participants will self-administer a 56 milligram (mg)
      intranasal dose of esketamine solution on Day 1 and Period 2 (16 days) where participants
      will self-administer 200 microgram (mcg) of intranasal mometasone suspension on Day 1 (which
      will begin immediately following the 30 hour pharmacokinetic sample of Period 1) to Day 15,
      and then 200 mcg of intranasal mometasone suspension prior to a 56 mg dose of intranasal
      esketamine solution on Day 16 and the follow-up phase. Total study duration for participants
      in Cohort 2 is up to 44 days which includes Screening phase, Period 1 and Period 2 each of 3
      days with a washout period of 5 to 10 days in-between esketamine dosing, and the follow-up
      phase. Cohort 2 participants will be randomly assigned to either treatment Sequence 1 or 2,
      wherein Sequence 1 comprises a 56 mg intranasal dose of esketamine solution alone in period 1
      followed by period 2 which comprises a pretreatment with oxymetazoline 0.05 percent (%)
      weight by volume (w/v) solution 1 hour before administration of a 56 mg intranasal dose of
      esketamine solution. Sequence 2 comprises of a pretreatment with oxymetazoline 0.05 % w/v
      solution 1 hour before administration of a 56 mg intranasal dose of esketamine solution in
      Period 1 followed by period 2 which comprises a 56 mg intranasal dose of esketamine solution
      alone. Blood samples will be collected for evaluation of pharmacokinetic parameters of
      intranasal esketamine in healthy participants and participants with allergic rhinitis.
      Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
