    
      Participation includes 16 weeks of daily headache diary recording and taking the study pill
      every night, 1-2 hours before bed. Aside from the initial 1 hour enrollment visit, all
      remaining study procedures will be completed from home.

      During the enrollment visit, history of migraine, questionnaires, a neurologic and physical
      exam (including weight, blood pressure, pulse, and respiratory rate) will be performed. Girls
      who have had their first period will undergo a urine pregnancy test and will be instructed to
      use birth control if they are sexually active.

      For the first 8 week phase, participants will be instructed to take one study pill every
      night, 1-2 hours before bedtime and complete a daily headache diary from a smartphone. Phone
      call check-ins will occur at week 4 and week 8.

      After the first 8 weeks of the study, participants who are eligible for the second phase of
      the study will be notified by study staff and will be sent the next set of study pills.
      Again, participants will be instructed to take the study pill every night, 1-2 hours before
      bedtime and complete a diary entry every evening.

      Phone call check-ins will occur at week 12 and week 16. At the final 16 week phone call,
      additional questionnaires and study completion feedback will be collected.
