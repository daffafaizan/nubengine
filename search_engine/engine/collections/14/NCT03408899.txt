      active against HIV, HPV, and HSV-2. This study will evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics
      of PC-1005 gel when administered rectally.

      The study will enroll HIV-uninfected men and women (cis or transgender) with a history of
      consensual receptive anal intercourse. All participants will receive 3 single escalating
      doses of rectally administered PC-1005: 4 mL, 16 mL and 32 mL.

      The study includes a total of 9 clinic visits and 1 follow-up contact by phone or in person.
      Participants will receive doses of PC-1005 at Visits 3, 5, and 7. A 2-to-6 week washout
      period will follow each dosing visit. If no adverse events that preclude continuation to the
      next dose are identified during this period, participants will receive the next scheduled
      dose of PC-1005. Participation in this study will last approximately 3 to 5 months.

      Study visits will include physical examinations, throat swabs, behavioral assessments and
      interviews, and collection of blood, urine, rectal tissue, and cervical, vaginal, and rectal
      fluid.
