      This is a double-arm prospective observational study.

      Patient population:

      To be included in the study, DM1 patients had to have at least 18 years old, LVEF >35% on
      two-dimensional echocardiography, permanent pacing indication after non-invasive
      electrocardiographic evaluation or invasive EPS evaluation, according to the current
      guidelines. The following exclusion criteria were applied: electrolyte imbalance, thyroid
      disorders, prior cardiac surgery, prior cardiac arrest, prior spontaneous sustained
      ventricular arrhythmias, absuntion of antiarrhythmic drugs or medication known to affect
      cardiac conduction. All eligible DM1 patients underwent EPS for programmed ventricular
      stimulation; those in whom a sustained ventricula arrhythmia was inducible underwent
      subsequently ICD implantation. Non-inducible DM1 patients did not receive an ICD and
      underwent pacemaker implantation.

      Endpoints:

      The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality. Secondary end-points were sudden death (SD),
      death due to cardiac arrhythmias, ICD interventions and arrhythmic events in implanted
      patients.
