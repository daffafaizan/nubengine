    
      9-ING-41 is a first-in-class, intravenously administered, maleimide-based, small molecule,
      potent selective GSK-3Î² inhibitor with significant pre-clinical and clinical anticancer
      activity. In the ongoing Actuate 1801 study in a cohort of over 90 patients with advanced
      refractory malignancies, 9-ING-41 has exhibited no significant toxicity, including no
      myelosuppression, and significant anti-tumor activity. 9-ING-41 also has significant
      pre-clinical ability to reverse pathologic fibrosis in multiple models of pulmonary and
      pleural fibrosis. 9-ING-41 is very highly active against neuroblastoma in diverse
      pre-clinical models. This Phase 1 study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      9-ING-41, as a single agent or in combination with irinitecan, in paediatric patients with
      advanced malignancies and thus to establish the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for further
      paediatric patient studies.
