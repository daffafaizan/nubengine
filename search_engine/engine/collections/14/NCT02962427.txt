      ganglion block to an epidural blood patch for post-dural puncture headache relief in
      randomized postpartum parturients over a 48 hour period. A known dural puncture is defined as
      free flow of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) during neuraxial placement. An unknown dural
      puncture is defined as neuraxial placement where free flow of CSF is not appreciated, however
      the patient is diagnosed with a post-dural puncture headache as defined by the International
      Classification of Headache Disorders.
