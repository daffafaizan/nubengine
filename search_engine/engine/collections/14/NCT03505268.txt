      is a relatively common chronic disease of childhood (1). Managing type 1 diabetes in young
      children presents unique challenges to the patient, parents, and to the pediatric health care
      provider. The diabetes regimen includes intensive blood glucose monitoring, multiple daily
      injections of insulin ,and frequent insulin dose adjustments according to the amount of
      carbohydrate eaten, blood sugar, and physical activity. The Diabetes Control and
      Complications Trail (DCCT) showed a significant link between blood glucose control and a
      slower onset and progression of diabetes complications, with improved glycemic control
      decreasing the risk of micro- and macro- vascular complication (2,3,4).

      Glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) measures the

      In the past decade a significant progress took place in therapy and treatment of diabetes.
      However poor glycemic control is recorded in a significant proportion of adolescents.
