      from hospital and for facilitating the mother-infant bond. Preterm infants were evaluated
      weekly for sucking and swallowing performance (i.e., feeding performance) from the time they
      began oral feeding (frequency 1-2 oral feedings/day) until they reached independent oral
      feeding (frequency 8 oral feedings/day) at postmenstrual 38-40 weeks. For the term infants,
      we evaluated a single oral feeding during the first week of life.

      The exclusion criteria were major congenital abnormalities, craniofacial malformation,
      intracranial hemorrhage, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, culture-positive sepsis, and necrotizing
      enterocolitis. Each swallowing-sound recording was 2 minutes long and was captured in a quiet
      environment by the same investigator. The feeding parameters generated from the recordings
      were as follows: total number of swallows (S), total number of rhythmic swallows (RS), total
      number of resting intervals (RI), average time between resting intervals (ATRI), average time
      between swallows (ATS), average time between rhythmic swallows (ATRS), maximum number of
      rythymic swallows (MRS), and volume of milk ingested (VM) during the 2-minute evaluation.
