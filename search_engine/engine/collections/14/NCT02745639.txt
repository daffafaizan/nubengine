    
      This was a prospective phase II study on patients with LARC or local recurrence, to evaluate
      the pathological response and resectability of a neoadjuvant treatment based on the use of a
      combined treatment with VMAT-SIB and two drugs chemotherapy ( XELOX).

      The primary aim was to asses the pathological response rate. Key secondary aim was the acute
      toxicity. Secondary aims were local control, disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival
      (OS).

      The follow-up period of each subjects started at the end of combined treatment and concluded
      after a period of maximum 60 months or until death.
