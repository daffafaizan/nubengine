      children and their treatment usually requires immediate closed reduction and percutaneous
      pinning (CRPP). The presence of neurovascular complications associated with this fracture is
      considered an orthopedic emergency. For this reason, depending on the patient's operation
      time, the procedure should be performed at night under emergency conditions. Sleep
      deprivation, which is common in healthcare professionals, may affect patient safety due to
      disruptions in treatments and surgical procedures by reducing physician performance.
