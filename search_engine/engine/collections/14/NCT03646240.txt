      morbidity and mortality in children with epilepsy. At this point in time, options for these
      children are sparse and suboptimal. This hypothesis-driven phase 1 study aims to evaluate the
      use of a mammalian target of rapamycin [mTOR] inhibitor, ABI-009, in this subset of
      challenging participants. The underlying hypotheses being tested in trial are: (1) ABI-009 is
      a safe and well-tolerated medication in children who have medically-refractory epilepsy and
      have failed epilepsy surgery, and (2) The addition of ABI-009 therapy to the current clinical
      standard of continued antiepileptic medications results in improved epilepsy control. This is
      unique among trials of anti-epileptic medications in that it also studies mTOR inhibition in
      a non-Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) specific population for whom few additional effective
      therapies exist.

      Upon enrollment, participants will be continued and observed on their pre-existing,
      clinically prescribed antiepileptic drug (AED) regimen for 1 month. At the 1-month mark,
      participants will receive weekly ABI-009 intravenously at different dose levels in cohorts of
      3 participants each using the standard 3+3 dose-finding design. ABI-009 will be continued for
      a total of 3 weeks. ABI-009 will then be discontinued and the participants will be observed
      for an additional 3 months. The investigators intend an expansion of the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) cohort to an estimated additional 6 participants for a maximum possible enrollment
      of 18 participants.
