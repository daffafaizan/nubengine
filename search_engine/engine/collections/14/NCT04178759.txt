      body, which are detoxification of various toxins, drugs, synthesis of proteins and enzymes,
      coagulation factors. Liver is special organ, which can regenerate. If 75% of liver is removed
      it can regenerate to its normal size. Liver volume is very important to liver function, if
      there is volume insufficiency it could lead to liver failure in addition to other factors
      that impair liver regeneration. On that regenerative ability there are many treatment
      modalities, when liver resection is performed, especially in cancer patients with liver
      metastases. Modern treatment modalities are based on combination of different treatments,
      surgical and chemotherapeutic. On the other hand, side effects of chemotherapy should not be
      discarded, which can increase patient morbidity and mortality. Thus, liver regeneration
      provides an opportunity for these patients to undergo multiple treatment regimes and liver
      resections to achieve curability. Literature data on impact of chemotherapy to liver
      regeneration is ambiguous. Therefore we aim to research impact of chemotherapy to liver
      regeneration.
