    
      This trial tries to assess response rate (ORR) of plitidepsin in patients with:

      primary myelofibrosis (PMF), post-polycythemia vera myelofibrosis (post-PV MF), or
      post-essential thrombocythemia myelofibrosis (post-ET MF). Besides, the study results will
      allow to evaluate the effect of plitidepsin on bone marrow (BM) or peripheral blood histology
      and to determine the quality of life (QoL) and symptoms or participant patients.
