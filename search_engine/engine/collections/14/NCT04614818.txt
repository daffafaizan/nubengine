      to that of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. In 2004, the WHO classified LELC into one subtype of
      large cell carcinoma, and the 2015 WHO classified it as other and unclassified cancers. LELC
      can originate in many organs, including parotid glands, throat, lungs, digestive tract,
      genitourinary system, etc. Driver gene mutations are rarely seen, and most of them are PD-L1
      positive. In terms of treatment, there is no standard first-line treatment for
      lymphoepithelioma-like cancer. Patients with early-stage lymphoepithelioma-like cancer can
      receive surgery or radiotherapy, while palliative radiotherapy or chemotherapy is the main
      treatment for patients in advanced stage. The survival time is about 107 months, the 5-year
      OS is 59.5%, which is better than the prognosis of lung squamous cell carcinoma in the same
      period. A retrospective study of Sun yat-sen University Cancer Hospital included 127 patients
      with advanced lung LELC who received first-line chemotherapy between 2007 and 2018.
      Gemcitabine and platinum based chemotherapy and paclitaxel and platinum based regimens are
      significantly better than pemetrexed and platinum, but most of the current studies on
      lymphoepithelioma-like cancer focus on LELC that originates in the lung. But for other sites,
      such as parotid glands, liver, digestive tract, are mostly based on case reports, and there
      are few retrospective studies with large samples to explore their clinical features and
      treatment outcome. Therefore, investigators designed this retrospective clinical study to
      analyze the clinical characteristics, treatment, survival, and prognostic risk factors of
      patients with lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma in order to summary the clinical character and
      guide treatment.
