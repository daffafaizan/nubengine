      will be included in the study. The balance, mobility, upper extremity performance, the
      cognitive function will be evaluated twice.

      The study was designed as a prospective, randomized controlled study. The patients will be
      randomly assigned to three groups, the "multi-task training (MT)" group, the "single task
      training (ST)" group, and "control" group. The training will be twice a week for 6 weeks.

      Statistical analyses will be performed using the SPSS software version 15 (SPSS Inc. Chicago,
      IL, USA). The pre-training and post-training measurements of groups will be compared with the
      Wilcoxon Test. The significance level was set at p< 0.05
