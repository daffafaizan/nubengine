      checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) pembrolizumab in patients with superficial advanced solid tumors.

      LTX-315 has been administered with pembrolizumab in a previous Phase 1/2 study (Study
      C12-315-03), and there were clear indications that LTX-315 + pembrolizumab was a clinically
      active combination. Furthermore, the addition of LTX-315 to pembrolizumab dosing did not
      appear to increase the overall incidence or severity profile of toxicities.

      The present study will document the preliminary efficacy, clinical safety, and tolerability
      of LTX-315 in combination with pembrolizumab, in a dose and regimen that is considered to be
      safe, in 2 cohorts of patients:

      Cohort 1 will consist of patients with selected tumors that have an FDA-approved ICI
      treatment and have progressed after prior anti-programmed death-1 (PD-1) or anti-programmed
      death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) therapy, alone or in combination with systemic therapy.

      Cohort 2 will consist of patients with tumors that do not have any FDA-approved ICI
      treatment, and may or may not have received prior anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapy. The
      rationale for including this cohort is to test the ability of intratumoral injection of
      LTX-315 to convert an immunologically "cold" tumor to "hot" by causing cytolysis within the
      tumor.
