      community and owning a smartphone or tablet, will be recruited all over Canada. Rapid
      recruitment will be achieved using social media and professional networks. All data will be
      collected online to allow a broad reach even in remote regions. Self-reported eating habits,
      physical activity, sleep, alcohol consumption, anxiety and depression data will be collected
      using validated questionnaires on an online survey platform, and dietary intake data using
      the mobile application Keenoa. With the application, participants take pictures of their
      meals, which are analyzed and accessible to researchers in real-time, providing comprehensive
      data on nutrient and food intake, and hence patterns and diet quality. Diet will be tracked
      for a full week at study entrance and repeated 6 times during a year, and once one year
      later, along with follow-up questionnaires on lifestyle behaviours.

      The main study objectives are 1) to evaluate how eating habits, diet quality and related
      lifestyle behaviours of Canadian adults are impacted by confinement phases of the pandemic
      over one year; and 2) determine the association between eating behaviours and diet quality
      with contextual socio-demographic, education, emotional and health factors, and identify
      emerging explanatory factors as clusters.
