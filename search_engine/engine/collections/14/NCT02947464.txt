      adenotonsillectomy is 50-80%. Treatment alternatives are scarce, poorly effective and based
      upon low scientific evidence. This means one out of five patients will remain exposed to the
      well-known neurocognitive, behavioral and quality of life adverse effects of disease.

      Rapid Maxillary Expansion, an orthopaedic-orthodontic treatment of pediatric malocclusion,
      has recently shown promising results in the treatment of pediatric OSAS based upon its effect
      on craniofacial and upper airway growth, usually limited in these patients.

      The investigators propose a randomized, prospective, controlled trial in patients with
      Pediatric OSAS non-responding to adenotonsillectomy. The aim of the study is to enhance the
      treatment success rate avoiding morbimortality associated to disease persistence during
      childhood and development during adult life.
