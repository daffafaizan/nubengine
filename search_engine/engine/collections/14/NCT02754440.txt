      software meets the FDA acceptance criteria for leukoreduction and platelet yield. The
      operating range for the system flow rates, anticoagulant ratios, storage conditions, and
      centrifugal forces are the same as the currently cleared Trima Accel system. There are no
      changes to the environment or storage conditions for platelets, therefore, no in vitro or in
      vivo platelet quality data will be collected.

      This is a prospective, open-label, multi-center controlled study to evaluate the
      leukoreduction of platelets stored in platelet additive solution (PAS) collected on the Trima
      Accel system Version 7.0 software enhancement. Up to 450 healthy adult subjects will be
      enrolled in this study to ensure 93 single, 93 double and 93 triple platelet product
      evaluable data points. Evaluable is defined as a completed platelet product that does not
      meet any of the protocol analysis exclusion criteria.

      Plateletpheresis will be per site standard practice and per applicable FDA guidelines such as
      the FDA Collection of Platelets by Automated Methods, December 2007 Guidance for Industry and
      Pre-storage Leukocyte Reduction of Whole Blood and Blood Components Intended for Transfusion,
      September 2012.

      Study participation will be up to 30 days and will consist of 1 to 2 visits. Screening may be
      done within 30 days before the apheresis procedure or combined as a single visit, which
      includes screening and the apheresis procedure all in 1 day.

      The entire study should be completed in approximately 16 months.
