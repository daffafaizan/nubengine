      to help the oncologist in his decision making. However, the implementation of the CGA in
      oncologic setting presents major limitations; The CGA is time consuming, costly in terms of
      resources and is not standardized. Moreover, recent studies show that the CGA, used as the
      gold standard, may have a ceiling effect in detecting vulnerability in older cancer patients.
      Several authors suggest that a more sensitive approach, using frailty markers may be a better
      way to detect potential vulnerability in older cancer patients. In this study, for each
      patient, a brief screening assessment, a full CGA and the assessment of frailty markers will
      be completed at inclusion. The brief screening assessment will be based on self report
      questionnaire (4 items of instrumental Activities of Daily Living + 2 items of nutritional
      assessment) and one physical measure (one-leg standing balance test). The CGA will be based
      on seven domains (and their assessment tools): functional status, comorbidities, objective
      physical performance, nutrition, cognition, depression, and social support. Five frailty
      markers (as described by Fried and al) will be evaluated: nutrition, mobility, energy,
      physical activity and grip strength. CGA and frailty markers will be completed at 3, 6, 12
      and 18 months after the beginning of chemotherapy as well as oncologic criteria (treatment
      toxicities, treatment modification such as decrease or change or end of chemotherapy,
      percentage of chemotherapy dose received, cancer related death) and geriatric criteria for
      adverse outcomes (functional, nutritional or cognition decline, hospitalization or
      consultation with their general practitioner, death for other causes).
