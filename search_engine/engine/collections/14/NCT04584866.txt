      the patient in supine position (SP). The semi-sitting position (SSP) is routinely used for
      the traditional microscopic transsphenoidal approach and also for posterior fossa surgery.
      The SSP results in lower intracranial pressure when compared to the supine position due to
      decreased venous congestion. As a result, intraoperative bleeding may be reduced, potentially
      leading to decreased surgical morbidity and improved surgical workflow. Studies during
      endoscopic sinus surgery have shown a significant reduction of blood loss when the patient is
      placed in a reverse Trendelenburg position with a head elevation of 30°. This study is to
      prospectively compare the standard supine (control group) and the semi-sitting position (head
      elevation of 30°; intervention group) in endoscopic endonasal pituitary surgery.
