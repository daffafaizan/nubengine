      Worst , proposed that a membrane covered the anterior chamber angle and blocked aqueous
      outflow , but the presence of that membrane has not been established histopathologically to
      date . Now most authors believe that the site of obstruction is the trabecular meshwork
      rather than an overlying membrane . Maldevelopment of the anterior segment is present in all
      forms of congenital glaucoma . this maldevelopment may involve the trabecular meshwork alone
      or the trabecular meshwork in combination with the iris or cornea or both. In approcimately
      50% of patients , isolated trabeculodysgensis is the only developmental ocular anomaly found
      .This is the classic defect found in primary congenital glaucoma .These eyes have no
      developmental anomalies of iris or cornea present except abnormal insertion of the iris into
      the angle
