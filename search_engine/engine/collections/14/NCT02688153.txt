    
      This is a randomized study comparing the cross-clamp time (XCT) and cardiopulmonary bypass
      time (CPBT) of the EDWARDS INTUITY valve system with any commercially available stented
      aortic bioprosthesis, in patients with logistic EuroSCORE 1 â‰¥ 6 undergoing elective surgical
      aortic valve replacement surgery with concomitant coronary bypass grafts.

      Additionally, the aim is to gather sufficient data to quantify the effect size of short term
      patient benefit outcomes previously identified from literature and finally to explore
      additional healthcare resource utilization or health economic endpoints.
