      neuropathy have been attempted. Both amitriptyline and mexiletine have been useful in the
      management of painful neuropathies; however, both are associated with certain toxicities. In
      this comparative study of amitriptyline and mexiletine, benztropine mesylate also will be
      included as an active placebo to mimic the side effects of the study drugs.

      Patients are randomized to receive amitriptyline, mexiletine, or benztropine mesylate as an
      active placebo to mimic the mild side effects associated with both amitriptyline and
      mexiletine. Doses are gradually increased over 4 weeks until a minimum effective dose or MTD
      is reached, then patients are treated for at least 4 additional weeks at the final dose
      before gradually tapering off. Neurologic exams are performed at screening and at the end of
      treatment. Intensity of pain is rated twice daily by the patient. Patients are followed at
      Weeks 2, 4, and 8, and at 10 days after completely tapering off of drug.

      PER 3/16/95 AMENDMENT: Patients with no pain relief 14 days after initiation of study therapy
      may have dose doubled or increased to maximum allowable dose, whichever is lower. Then if no
      improvement occurs within 14 days after dose increase, patients have the option of
      discontinuing study medication.
