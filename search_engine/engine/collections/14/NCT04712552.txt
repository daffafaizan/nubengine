      advantages, including increased precision.

      Accuracy is a key point for stereotactic neurosurgical procedures, particularly for deep
      brain stimulation electrode implantations.

      The accuracy of the Neuromate robot was measured in stereotactic framed and frameless mode in
      vitro and in vivo during stereo-electroencephalography procedures. Investigators also
      evaluated the actual accuracy of its application in routine deep brain stimulation procedures
      using a measurement system independent of the robot itself and the manufacturer. We showed
      that the average in vivo accuracy was 0.86 mm and the maximum error was 1.55 mm. This
      accuracy is at least similar to the accuracy of stereotactic frame arms and is compatible
      with the accuracy required in deep brain stimulation procedures.

      The Neurolocate device is a new non-invasive, frameless patient matching module designed for
      use with the Neuromate stereotactic robot.

      The main advantages of the Neurolocate system are that it is less invasive than screw-on
      markers, simplifies the surgical procedure and reduces the duration of the surgery The
      accuracy of the Neurolocate frameless recording system was evaluated in vitro and in vivo for
      robotic stereo-electroencephalography trajectories in epileptic patients and compared to the
      accuracy of conventional recording using a stereotactic frame.

      However, the accuracy of the Neurolocate recording system has never been measured in vivo
      during deep brain stimulation procedures.
