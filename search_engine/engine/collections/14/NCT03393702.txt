      preoperative gabapentin (15 mg/kg, treatment) or placebo, respectively and after surgery
      either gabapentin (7,5 mg/kg, treatment) or placebo 2 times per day for 3 days, respectively.

      Patients are subjected to the same anaesthesia protocol. Postoperative analgesia are achieved
      with either continuous ropivacaine 0.2%/fentanyl 5.0 Î¼g/ml infusion through a thoracic
      epidural catheter (N=40; Gabapentin n=20, Placebo n=20), or intravenous infusion of morphine
      (N=40; Gabapentin n=20, Placebo n=20). All patients receive acetaminophen and non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs, and metamizol as a "rescue drug"
