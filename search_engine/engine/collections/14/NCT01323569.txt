      they received the positive control drug (Marinol 30 mg) and matching placebo 48 hours apart
      in a randomized fashion. To qualify, subjects must have discriminated between Marinol and
      placebo.

      Eligible subjects then went on to the main study divided into six treatment sessions each
      separated by 7-21 days.

      Serial pharmacodynamic evaluations were taken at each treatment session as well as occasional
      pharmacokinetic blood samples to verify proof of exposure. In addition, safety monitoring
      included regular assessments of vital signs, telemetry, 12-lead ECG, clinical laboratory
      tests and adverse events (AEs).
