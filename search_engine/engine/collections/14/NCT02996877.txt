      high-risk percutaneous coronary revascularization with predicted Society of Thoracic Surgeons
      (STS) survival and morbidity in patients with severe multivessel or left main coronary artery
      disease (CAD).

      2. Compare the 12-month health status and clinical outcomes of surgically ineligible
      multivessel or left main CAD patients treated with PCI compared to those treated with a
      medical therapy alone.

      3. Understand the association between completeness of revascularization and long-term health
      status and clinical outcomes among patients with multivessel or left main CAD treated with
      PCI deemed ineligible for surgery.

      4. Compare 6-month and 1-year survival among surgically ineligible high-risk PCI patients
      with predicted STS survival (ASCERT risk model)

      5. Determine the justification for surgical ineligibility by cardiologists and cardiac
      surgeons among patients with severe multivessel or left main coronary artery disease (CAD).

      6. Describe the frequency and predictors of PCI versus medical management among surgically
      ineligible patients with severe multivessel or left main CAD.

      7. Describe the frequency and predictors of complete revascularization in this population.

      8. Describe the costs and costs per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained of the strategy
      of management of multivessel or left main CAD with PCI versus medical therapy among
      surgically ineligible patients.
