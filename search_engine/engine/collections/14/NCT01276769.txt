      negative breast cancer in both pathological features and clinical prognosis,and there is no
      standard chemotherapy regimens especially for TNBC. NCCN guidelines recommends Paclitaxel or
      Epirubicin based regimens as the preferred regimens both for the adjuvant chemotherapy and
      the treatment of Recurrence and Metastatic breast cancer.The combination of these two drugs
      is considered as a strong arrangement and therefore,is common used in Triple negative breast
      cancer patients because of its poor prognosis.

      According to the results of some retrospective studies, platinum-based chemotherapy regimens
      showed a promising sensitive to Triple negative breast cancer patients compared with regimens
      without platinum.

      This study is to compare the effective of Paclitaxel combined with Epirubicin and Paclitaxel
      plus Carboplatin in the neoadjuvant treatment for TNBC. And the investigators hypothesized
      that paclitaxel combined with carboplatin is more sensitive to TNBC compared with Paclitaxel
      plus Epirubicin,this study will also have a look into the relation of BRCA1 mutation and
      sensitive to carboplatin.
