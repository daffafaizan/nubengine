      clinics or cardiac medical centers. All patients will perform an ECG stress test with
      high-frequency ECG recording from conventional 12 leads using BSP's HyperQ™ System. The
      recording will be done without affecting or interfering with any aspect of the normal due
      course of the test. Standard Bruce protocol or modified Bruce protocol will be used, with
      standard test termination indications. Two minutes of rest ECG will be recorded prior to
      stating the protocol.

      Following the test, the physician will interpret the test's results in the conventional
      manner (e.g. ST changes, chest pain, etc) and decide whether the subject should be referred
      to additional tests.

      HyperQ™ data will be analyzed in two phases: (i) Interpretation by the physician in a
      non-blinded manner one day following the stress test and (ii) after performing all the
      exercise tests of the study group, blindly to the conventional diagnosis and the HyperQ™
      analysis done previously, as well as to other outcomes of imaging procedures. The first
      HyperQ™ reading will be used to detect the subjects who were positive according to the
      HyperQ™ system but negative according to the conventional stress testing. These subjects will
      be referred by the physician to further clinical investigation. The first reading will also
      be used to assess the physician's interpretation in a scenario that represents a realistic
      clinical setting, while the second reading will be used to examine the unbiased clinical
      benefit of HyperQ™ data.
