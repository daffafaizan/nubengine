      rotavirus diarrhea) together with the greater understanding of the role of inflammation and
      intestinal microflora in the pathophysiology of functional bowel disorders has led to
      increased interest in use of probiotics in patients with these symptoms. The data on the use
      of probiotic in certain functional GI disorders (e.g., IBS, bloating, diarrhea) is limited
      but several reported studies show encouraging results and suggest some symptomatic response
      and parallel improvement in quality of life. Functional Bowel Disorders (FBD) - According to
      the Rome II criteria FBD refer to symptoms attributed to the mid or lower GI tract. FBD
      include several clinical subgroups including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), functional
      diarrhea, functional constipation, functional abdominal bloating, and an unspecified group.
      This study will examine 'Non-Patients IBS,' these are people who have functional
      gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms but do not sought out medical care for their GI symptoms and
      therefore they are referred to as 'Non-patients'. This study will investigate the overall
      effect of probiotic bacteria (BB12) on GI symptoms in non-patients subjects with functional
      bowel symptoms (FBS).
