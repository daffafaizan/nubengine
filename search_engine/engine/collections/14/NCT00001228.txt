      disease. The advent of specific drugs to cure ulcer disease now extends life until metastases
      from the non-B-islet cell tumor or other events cause death. Patients with metastatic
      gastrinoma that is not surgically resectable and that has increased in size over a 4-6 month
      period prior to the study will be treated with interferon-alpha, 5 million international
      units/day. The drug will be administered subcutaneously by the patient. Tumor response and
      side effects will be monitored. Patients will receive 6 months of therapy and if there is
      reduction or stabilization of tumor masses, therapy will continue as long as response is
      maintained.
