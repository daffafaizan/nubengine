    
      This clinical trial is a prospective, randomized, controlled, multicenter, study. After
      informed consent is obtained, patients will be evaluated for eligibility based on glaucoma
      severity, eye health, and visual acuity.

      Clinical follow up will be scheduled over the course of the 24 month study, and examinations
      will be repeated to monitor eye health. At the 1 and 2 year follow up, diurnal (IOP taken in
      the morning, mid-day, and afternoon in the same day) IOP evaluation will be done. Annual
      follow up will occur up to 2 years. The primary effectiveness endpoint is 20% or greater
      reduction in IOP from pre-op medicated IOP at 12 months.
