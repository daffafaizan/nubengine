        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of yttrium Y 90 labeled, humanized monoclonal
           antibody BrE-3 when given in combination with indium In 111 labeled, humanized
           monoclonal antibody BrE-3 followed by autologous bone marrow or peripheral blood stem
           cell transplantation in patients with metastatic breast cancer.

        -  Determine hematopoietic engraftment in these patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the ability of indium In 111 labeled, humanized monoclonal antibody BrE-3 to
           image metastatic disease in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the preliminary antitumor response in these patients treated with this
           regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of yttrium Y 90 labeled, humanized monoclonal
      antibody BrE-3 (Y90 huMOAB BrE-3).

      Patients receive Y90 huMOAB BrE-3 and indium In 111 labeled, humanized monoclonal antibody
      BrE-3 IV over 1-2 hours on day -14. Patients undergo autologous bone marrow or peripheral
      blood stem cell transplantation on day 0. Patients also receive filgrastim (G-CSF) IV
      beginning on day 0 and continuing until blood counts recover.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of Y90 huMOAB BrE-3 until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2
      of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicities.

      Patients are followed every 3-4 months for 1 year and then at least annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 3-30 patients will be accrued for this study.
