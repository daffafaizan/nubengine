      under the age of 15 years. One of the most common side effects of ALL chemotherapy is
      transient hyperglycemia. Patients that develop this complication require treatment with
      insulin via injections to prevent severe medical complications such as dehydration, weight
      loss, ketoacidosis and life-threatening infections. Although insulin therapy is effective, it
      adds a lot of physical and psychological burden to patients because multiple daily insulin
      injections are required to achieve adequate blood glucose control.

      In this pilot study, investigators aim to examine the effectiveness of metformin as an
      adjunctive treatment for transient hyperglycemia. Investigators will be comparing two groups
      of subjects (up to 40 subjects per group). Patients in the treatment group will be
      prospectively recruited, and they will be treated with metformin in addition to insulin
      therapy. Investigators will compare the treatment group to a historical control group
      acquired via chart review. These patients will have been treated with insulin alone.

      Statistical comparison will be made between the two groups in terms of the length of insulin
      treatment, the total daily dose of insulin required, number of insulin injections, hemoglobin
      A1c level (measure of glycemic control over preceding 8- 12 weeks), and fructosamine level
      (measure of glycemic control over preceding 2-3 weeks).

      Investigators hypothesize that the use of metformin will result in fewer numbers of insulin
      injections and fewer days of insulin therapy.
