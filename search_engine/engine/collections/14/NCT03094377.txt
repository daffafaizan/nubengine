      recruited and randomly assigned to a multisensory therapy group or a conventional training
      group. The Multisensory therapy group received 12 weeks (two sessions/ week; 90
      minutes/session) training. Each session began with 15 minutes of sensory stimulation (cold
      and vibration), 45 minutes of motor training and 30 minutes of self-care training. The
      conventional training group included 12 weeks (two sessions/ week; 90 minutes/session)
      training. Each session included 60 minutes of upper extremity motor practice and 30 minutes
      of self-care training.

      Outcome measures included: Brunnstrom's stage, Fugl-Meyer Assessment Scale and Functional
      Test for the Hemiplegic Upper Extremity were used for upper limb motor control and function;
      and Manual muscle testing was used for muscle strength. The modified Barthel Index was used
