      cultural, educational, and professional. As a consequence, breast cancer in young women often
      occurs before the completion of reproductive plans. Infertility has a significant impact on
      quality of life, resulting in substantial distress in younger women with breast cancer and
      influencing treatment decisions in a consistent proportion of patients.The best available
      evidence suggests that pregnancy after breast cancer does not increase a woman's risk of
      developing a recurrence.For women desiring pregnancy after a breast cancer, 5-10 years of
      endocrine therapy may substantially reduce the chance of conception; however, a shorter
      duration of endocrine therapy in this population has not been studied in a prospective
      manner.

      Birth outcome after breast cancer has not been shown to be different from that of the normal
      population, but increased risks of delivery complications, cesarean section, preterm birth
      and low birth weight have been reported.

      Endocrine agents are potentially teratogenic: taking into account their median half-life,
      waiting 3 months after their interruption before attempting conception is considered safe.

      The limited evidence available on breastfeeding after breast cancer reports successful
      lactation from the treated breast in approximately 30% of women without detrimental effect on
      survival. No prospective definitive data are available.
