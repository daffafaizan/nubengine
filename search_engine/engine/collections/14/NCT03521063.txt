    
      A randomized double bind controlled trial, designed to evaluate the addition of budesonide to
      poractant alfa to prevent bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in preterm infants with
      respiratory distress syndrome (RDS).

      The usual treatment of RDS includes ventilatory support and exogenous surfactant, however, a
      cronic lung disease known as BPD, is a complication found in many of these patients.

      BPD is a complex disease occurring in preterm infants recovering from RDS and inflammation
      plays a key role in its physiopathology.

      Animal derived surfactants have demonstrated to decrease the incidence of BPD, and porcine
      surfactant (poractant alfa) has and increased effect compared with bovine surfactant
      (beractant).

      Budesonide is an inhaled anti-inflammatory steroid that has shown to reduce BPD when combined
      with beractant by decreasing lung inflammation, without secondary systemic effects, when
      combined with poractant alfa it could enhance even more this anti-inflammatory effect.
