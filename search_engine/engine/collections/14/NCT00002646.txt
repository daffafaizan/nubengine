      with stage II or IIIA breast cancer treated with tamoxifen (TMX) and fenretinide (HPR) vs TMX
      and placebo. II. Gain wider experience in the use and toxicity of combined TMX/HPR in these
      patients. III. Obtain tumor tissue samples, as feasible, from these patients for future
      biologic studies.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, multicenter study. Patients
      are stratified by participating institution, age (under 70 vs 70 and over), node dissection
      (yes vs no), number of involved nodes (0 vs 1-3 vs 4 or more), and number of removed nodes
      (1-5 vs 6 or more). All patients receive oral tamoxifen daily for at least 5 years, beginning
      immediately after randomization. Patients also receive either oral fenretinide or oral
      placebo daily for 5 years, beginning within 2 weeks after completion of any radiotherapy, or
      within 2 weeks of randomization, if no radiation. Patients are followed during and after
      treatment every 4 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1,500 patients will be accrued for this study over
      approximately 3 years.
