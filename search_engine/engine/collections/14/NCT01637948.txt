      mouthrinse on gingival health and microbial profiles in orthodontic patients. This six-month
      randomized, single-blinded, parallel controlled clinical trial consists of 90 patients with
      fixed appliance treatment. The subjects were allocated to (1) negative-control group: oral
      hygiene instruction (OHI) alone; (2) positive-control group: OHI plus an EO mouthrinse
      (ListerineÂ®)(3) test group: OHI plus the TCM mouthrinse (5% Fructus mume extract). Clinical
      examinations included Plaque Index (PI), Bleeding Index (BI) and Modified Gingival Index
      (MGI). Salivary microbial quantifications included total aerobic and anaerobic bacteria,
      Streptococci and Lactobacilli counts. Clinical and microbiological examinations were
      conducted at baseline, 3 and 6 months (T1, T2 and T3).
