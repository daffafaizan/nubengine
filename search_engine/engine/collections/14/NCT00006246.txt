        -  Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxicities of intrathecally administered
           busulfan in children and adolescents with refractory CNS malignancies.

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of this treatment regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the cerebrospinal fluid and serum pharmacokinetics of this treatment regimen
           in these patients.

        -  Determine the efficacy of this treatment regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive intrathecal busulfan twice a week, at least 3 days apart, for 2 weeks.
      Patients with complete or partial response or stable disease may continue therapy once a week
      for 2 weeks, once a week every other week for 2 treatments, and then once a month thereafter
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of busulfan until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients
      experience dose limiting toxicities.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for the first year, every 6 months for 4 years, and then
      annually for 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 18-24 patients will be accrued for this study over 18-38
      months.
