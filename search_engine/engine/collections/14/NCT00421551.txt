      events associated with standard combined antiretroviral therapy, emphasize the need for
      simpler, alternative treatment strategies for HIV infection. The goal of antiretroviral
      therapy in 2006 is the durability of treatment with less toxicity and reduced exposure to
      drugs. Previous studies have shown that single boosted PI maintenance therapy such as
      lopinavir (LPV/r), were effective in maintaining virological efficacy. Furthermore, in case
      of virological failure, limited resistance has been described. darunavir/r, a new PI, has
      been shown to be highly potent, exhibits a high genetic barrier to resistance and appears to
      be well tolerated. This study aimed to evaluate whether darunavir/r can represent a potential
      strategy therapeutic as single therapy in patients who have full virologic suppression At
      entry, subjects with HIV RNA below 50 cp/ml switch from their current therapy which can be 2
      NRTI and IP, 2 NRTI and NNRTI, 3 NRTI to darunavir/r with their 2 NRTIs for 8 weeks (Phase
      I). If patients remain below 50 cp/ml and has no intolerance to darunavir at week -4, they
      are included in the phase II and will be randomized either to receive darunavir/r alone or to
      continue 2 NRTI and darunavir/r for until W48 (Phase II). Patients will be monitored at W4,
      W8 and then every 8 weeks until W48 for the primary endpoint. To evaluate the durability and
      safety of this strategy, patients will be followed up to W96
