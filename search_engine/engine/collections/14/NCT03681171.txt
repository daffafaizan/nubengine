      program. Participants had body composition (DXA), muscle strength (hand-grip dynamometer),
      habitual physical activity, gait and selective motor control functions, and executive
      function tasks before and after the intervention. Follow-up assessments of habitual physical
      activity, gait and executive functions were completed four to five week post-intervention.
