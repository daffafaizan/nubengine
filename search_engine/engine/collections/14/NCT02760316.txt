    
      This is a phase 1, randomised, single-blind, multiple ascending dose, double-dummy sequential
      group study in healthy subjects .

      The study is planned to have 6 cohorts with the option to include up to two additional
      cohorts if deemed necessary. Nine subjects participated in the first cohort (7 subjects
      randomised to receive AZD9567 and 2 subjects randomised to receive prednisolone 20 mg)and
      eleven subjects will participate in subsequent 3 cohorts (7 subjects will be randomised to
      receive AZD9567 and 4 subjects randomised to receive prednisolone 20 mg). A cohort 5 was
      included in the study in version 4.0 of the CSP. In this cohort two doses of prednisolone was
      tested, 5 mg and 20 mg. Up to six dose levels of AZD9567 are planned to be tested in the
      study and an additional cohort will be used in case any previous dose needs to be repeated or
      a new lower dose explored (ref CSP 5.0).

      Therefore a maximum of 95 individuals could be included in the study (as stated in version
      5.0 of this protocol). Subjects will be dosed for 5 consecutive days and a follow-up visit
      will occur 10-14 days after the last dose.
