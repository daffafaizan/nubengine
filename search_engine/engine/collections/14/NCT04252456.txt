      wild type metastatic colorectal cancer patients progressing after first-line treatment with
      oxaliplatin, fluoropyrimidines and an anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody. Eligible patients will
      be prospectively allocated to either of two groups according to VEGFR2 levels (ELISA-based
      technique, pg/ml) at study entry.

      Others angiogenetic factors levels concentration before and during treatment. VEGF, PlGF,
      HGF, VEGFR1, IL8, IL1a, T-cad, VEGFR3, SAP, VDBP, neuropilin1, CRP, endoglin plasma
      concentrations will be evaluated before each cycle according to an ELISA-based technique All
      patients will undergo a blood test for retrieving circulating tumor DNA (Liquid Biopsy) at
      selected time-points before and during treatment for determining whether the status of
      selected tumor biomarkers evolve during tumor progression by comparing different ctDNA
      samples.

      All patients will receive aflibercept in combination with FOLFIRI according to the Italian
      label.
