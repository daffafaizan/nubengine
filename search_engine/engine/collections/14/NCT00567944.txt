      clinic training with the BrainPort balance device with a Physical Therapist. Assessments are
      repeated at the end of clinic training. Following clinic training, subjects take the device
      home to use for two (2) 20 minute training sessions each day. Subjects return to the clinic
      for one (1) day of testing after using the device at home for 7 weeks.
