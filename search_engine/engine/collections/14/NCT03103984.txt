      weight loss during 6 months. The control group (overweight and obese subjects) will be
      submitted to the same protocol:

      The participants will be interviewed at baseline and after 30, 60, 90 and 180 days from
      baseline. The following measures will be assessed: body composition (fat body% and free fat
      body%), anthropometric measures (height, weight, body mass index, waist circumference and
      abdominal circumference), blood pressure, basal metabolic rate, behavioral symptoms and
      peripheral biomarkers in the serum. Behavioral symptoms will be assessed using the following
      self-reported questionnaires: Beck Depression Inventory (depression symptoms), Beck Anxiety
      Inventory (anxiety symptoms), Medical Outcomes Study 36 - Item Short - Form Health Survey
      (quality of life) and Perceived Stress Scale (stress).

      Enrolled participants will receive a restrictive diet calculated based on individual
      requirements aiming the loss of around 5%-10% of weight/ 6 months of intervention.
