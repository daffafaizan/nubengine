      study to assess a range of doses of OnabotulinumtoxinA for the treatment of male participants
      with PE. Participants will attend a minimum of 6 or 7 clinic visits and also have 1 or 2
      telephone visits. Partners will need to attend a clinic visit during the screening period to
      provide informed consent and to receive training on measurement and recording of the
      intravaginal ejaculatory latency time (IELT). Participants will be enrolled in cohorts.
      Within the first 5 cohorts, 8 participants are to receive OnabotulinumtoxinA and 2
      participants to receive placebo. For cohort 6, 12 participants will receive
      OnabotulinumtoxinA and 12 participants will receive placebo. Participants will receive a
      single treatment of study medication delivered bilaterally to the bulbospongiosus muscle. The
      initial OnabotulinumtoxinA total dose in this dose escalation study will be 5 U and the
      maximum OnabotulinumtoxinA total dose will be 100 U. Upon request and if eligible,
      participants in cohort 6, will have the option to receive a second injection of
      OnabotulinumtoxinA (Open-label).
