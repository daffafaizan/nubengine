      intelligence to infer blood glucose levels from a variety of data sources. In this study
      patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus will be wearing a continuous glucose meter
      (CGM) and a smartwatch for a maximum duration of 3 months in an outpatient setting. The
      gathered data will be used to develop a non-invasive and wearable based dysglycemia detection
      and warning system using artificial intelligence.
