      patients with LARS and to see if the treatment is acceptable to patients.

      Methods: This is a mixed methods evaluation study on functional outcomes in patients who have
      undergone anterior resection for rectal neoplasia and who have had bowel continuity restored
      between Jan 2009 and Jan 2014. Those patients deemed to have LARS who consent to
      participation in the study will be offered rectal irrigation.
