      clinicians in everyday situations to estimate arterial oxygen saturation. A pulse oximeter is
      a device that measures the oxygen saturation of arterial blood non-invasively.

      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the SpO2 accuracy performance of the Owlet BabySat
      v1.0 and Smart SockTM 2 pulse oximetry OSS v1.1 sensors during non-motion conditions over the
      range of 70-100% SaO2 to arterial blood samples assessed by CO-Oximetry for a SpO2
      validation.

      The goal, in its entirety, was to show the SpO2 accuracy performance for the investigational
      device Owlet Baby Care, Inc. Smart SockTM V. 2.

      It was expected that the Accuracy Root Mean Square (ARMS) performance would meet the required
      specification of ARMS 3% or lower in non-motion conditions for the range of 70 - 100% SaO2
      thereby demonstrating an acceptable SpO2 accuracy performance specification.

      No risks or adverse device effects were expected. There were no contraindications for use in
      the proposed study population.

      The study was conducted in accordance to the code of federal regulations for non-significant
      risk medical device studies and applicable ISO 14155 (2nd edition 2011-02-01), applicable
      sections of ISO80601-2-61 (1st edition 2011-04- 01), and Pulse Oximeters - Premarket
