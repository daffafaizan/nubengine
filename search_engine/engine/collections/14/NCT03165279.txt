    
      The ZEPHYR registry has two major objectives:

        1. to prospectively collect 'real world' safety, durability and clinical performance data
           on the Zenith AlphaTM Abdominal Endovascular Graft in subjects with infrarenal abdominal
           aortic or aorto-iliac aneurysms.

        2. To increase the clinical evidence about the safety and effectiveness of the Zenith
           AlphaTM Abdominal Endovascular Graft by creating a database that can be pooled and/or
           compared with databases available on this and other stent graft systems.

      The ZEPHYR registry is a multi-center, post-market, non-randomized, single-arm prospective
      study. The study has no controls, as it is descriptive in nature. It will recruit
      approximately 450 subjects from high-volume sites across Germany and the BeNeLux. Study is
      open to consecutively enrolled subjects (20-50 per site) whou in the opinion of the
      investigator are candidates for endovascular AAA repair. The sites are recommended to
      schedule the subject's post-operative follow-up visits based on the current standard care in
      endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) therapy, which is generally at 1 month, 1 year and
      annually thereafter.
