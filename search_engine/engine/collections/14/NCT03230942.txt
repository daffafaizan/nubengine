      Center for Health Sciences and Sports of UDESC. In the preoperative period the subjects will
      be informed about their physical conditions as well as signs and symptoms of the
      postoperative period. One group (GI) will receive this information verbally and one leaflet
      while the other group (GC) will receive only verbal information. The allocation in these
      groups will be through a lottery, carried out by a member of the team who will not
      participate in the evaluation stages.

      This staff member will read the booklet individually for each GI participant, in a reserved
      room, before handing out the leaflet to take home. GI participants will be encouraged to
      reread the information in the home environment and will be asked about the completion of this
      in the following steps by the staff member responsible for the blinding.

      All participants included in the study will perform the kinematic, kinetic and
      electromyographic gait analysis as well as evaluation of fear of movement, functional
      mobility and self-perceived functionality in the pre (baseline)-and postoperative period (6
      weeks and after 6 months).

      The total duration of each evaluation will be approximately 2 (two) hours and 30 (thirty)
      minutes and all collections will be carried out by the same team. The participant will be
      allowed to stop the test if they feel pain or become fatigued.
