      reducing pregnant women's perceived stress, anxiety, depression, mindfulness, salivary
      alpha-amylase compared to a control group. The investigators hypothesize that use of the
      mindfulness prenatal education program by study group will lead to improved related mood
      symptoms compared with control group.

      Randomized Controlled Trial comparing two education programs with health and singleton
      pregnant women is run by the Random Allocation Software (Saghaei, 2004). Use the G-Power
      3.1.9 windows: repeated measures and between factors among two groups to calculate the number
      of samples, and setting the power = .8, Î± = .05, effect size = .25. The estimated number of
      samples may be lost 20%, total 76 samples.
