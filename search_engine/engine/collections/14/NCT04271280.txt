      treatment lowers low density lipoprotein cholesterol and reduces the incidence of clinical
      cardiovascular events. Despite from the multiple available treatments, many patients remain
      inadequately treated or even untreated and some lipid-lowering drugs may be associated with
      an increase in unexpected events like side effects or increase in diabetes. No study
      intervention will be provided for administration for this study.
