      St. Michael's Hospital Academic Family Health Team to examine whether the quality of HIV care
      provided to patients can be improved through an audit and feedback (A&F) intervention. Our
      objective is to examine whether A&F targeting family physicians caring for people living with
      HIV/AIDS (PHLA) using EMR data can improve laboratory monitoring, engagement in primary care
      and the uptake of preventive interventions.
