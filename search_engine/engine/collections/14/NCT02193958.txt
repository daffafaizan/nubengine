      repeated every 28 days (=1 cycle). Disease assessments, including analysis of blood and bone
      marrow aspirates, will be performed at the end of Cycle 1 and every 2 cycles thereafter.
      Subjects who demonstrate objective response or stable disease will be allowed to continue
      therapy with FF-10501-01 until progression of disease, observation of unacceptable adverse
      events, intercurrent illness or changes in condition that prevent further study
      participation.
