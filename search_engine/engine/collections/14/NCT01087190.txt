      transplant recipients than TST (Kim SH, et al. Transplant Infect Dis 2010 Jan 25 [Epub ahead
      of print]). However, further studies are eagerly awaited to determine the efficacy of
      isoniazid (INH) prophylaxis based on ELISPOT assay for LTBI in renal transplant recipients.
      All adult patients admitted for renal transplantation between May 2010 and April 2013 at the
      Asan Medical Center, Seoul, South Korea, will be prospectively enrolled. INH (300 mg/day for
      9 months) prophylaxis group and no prophylaxis group (control group) will be randomly
      assigned to all patients with a baseline positive ELISPOT assay regardless of the results of
      TST. The investigators will compare cumulative probability of developing active TB after
      transplantation between INH prophylaxis group and control group as primary outcome. Secondary
      outcomes will be adverse drug reactions, rejection episodes, graft survival, and mortality.
