    
      The Specific Aims are:

        1. To develop the CC-DDR treatment protocol. This will involve:

             1. Creating an initial version of the CC-DDR treatment protocol.

             2. Refining the protocol based on input from an expert panel with expertise in DR,
                depression, and culturally relevant interventions for diabetes in older African
                Americans.

             3. Developing a tool to assess interventionist treatment adherence and competence.

        2. To conduct an open trial of CC-DDR with 40 participants who have poorly controlled
           diabetes, depression, and mild or moderate DR. During this open trial we will:

             1. Evaluate the feasibility of CC-DDR.

             2. Refine the CC-DDR treatment protocol by incorporating feedback from participants,
                community health care workers (CHWs), ophthalmologists, and the expert panel.

             3. Refine procedures for recruitment and retention, outcome assessment, monitoring
                treatment fidelity, CHW training and supervision, quality assurance, and study
                administration, based on input from investigators, CHWs, participants, and the
                expert panel.

             4. Examine CC-DDR's impact on depression severity; diabetes self-management practices;
                HbA1C level; blood pressure; adherence to the ophthalmologist treatment plan;
                vision function; quality of life; and satisfaction with CC-DDR.

        3. To complete a Manual of Procedures that characterizes all aspects of the planned
           efficacy trial of CC-DDR.
