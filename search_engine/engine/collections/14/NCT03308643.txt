      of the abdominal myomectomy cases might require blood transfusion because of the nature of
      the surgery. Oxytocin infusion is one of the intervention to decrease blood loss during
      myomectomy. To evaluate the effects and benefits of oxytocin infusion during abdominal
      myomectomy we decide to conduct this randomized study.
