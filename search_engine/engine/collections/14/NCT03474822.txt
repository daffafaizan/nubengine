      with P.vivax-infected red blood cells containing approximately 0.1-1.0 Ã— 10^7 Plasmodium
      parasites and be observed for the exact infection time, parasitemia condition and infection
      course; principal clinical symptoms such as fever; gastrointestinal reaction; peripheral
      blood parameters; the changes in heart, lung, liver and kidney function. Preliminarily
      observe the changes in the primary and metastatic lesions of the cancer, the tolerance of
      patients to Plasmodium infection, changes in tumor-related parameters and immunological
      related parameters.The rate of the erythrocytes infected by plasmodium is controlled below
      0.01% by using Artemisinin during the course, and clinical treatment is conduced according to
      the microscopic examination to ensure that no serious complications occurs.The duration of
      the planned treatment of each subject is 4-6 weeks. The time of the treatment course is based
      on vaccination with P.vivax-infected red blood cells. After 4-6 weeks, parasitemia will be
      terminated by antimalarial drugs for terminating the treatment of Plasmodium immunotherapy
      (the immunological treatment effect may persist after the termination of Plasmodium
      infection), and then the patients are followed up for 2 years.
