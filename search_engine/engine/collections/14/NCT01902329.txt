    
      This study will explore SGN-CD33A as a monotherapy and in combination with a hypomethylating
      agent (HMA; i.e., azacitidine or decitabine). Initial study treatment with SGN-CD33A includes
      a maximum of 2 cycles of treatment for monotherapy and 4 cycles for combination cohorts.
      Patients who achieve documented CR or CRi (Monotherapy) or clinical benefit (Combination)
      during the first part of the study are eligible to continue treatment.

      Additional monotherapy cohorts may include patients with relapsed acute promyelocytic
      leukemia, relapsed patients with nucleophosmin-1 gene mutation (absence of fms-like tyrosine
      kinase 3 mutation) (NPM1-mutated, FLT-3 wild type), alternate dosing schedules (fractionated
      dosing on Days 1 and 4), treatment naive patients with AML who declined intensive therapy,
      and patients who have relapsed after post-allogeneic stem cell transplant.

      Patients in the combination cohort will be treated with azacitidine or decitabine per
      institutional practice prior to SGN-CD33A dosing. Expansion cohorts may be added for further
      evaluation of safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and antitumor activity.
