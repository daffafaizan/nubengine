        -  Determine the incidence and severity of adverse events during and after MRI-guided
           focused ultrasound ablation in women with stage I-IIIA breast cancer.

        -  Determine the ability to accurately and thoroughly coagulate a target volume of breast
           carcinoma, in terms of real-time target volume temperature profile, follow-up MRI, and
           histology, using this procedure.

        -  Compare the appearance of gross and microscopic histopathologic tissue post coagulation
           with the pre- and post-coagulation magnetic resonance appearance of the targeted volume
           and measure any residual cancer cells in patients after this procedure.

        -  Determine patient acceptance of this procedure, in terms of positioning, pain, safety,
           and follow-up cosmesis.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.

      Patients undergo MRI-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) ablation of the breast lesion using a
      series of pulses. Within 72 hours after MRgFUS procedure, patients undergo
      gadolinium-enhanced MRI to evaluate ablation borders. Within 7-10 days after MRgFUS
      procedure, patients undergo an ultrasound exam. Guide wires may be placed to assist in
      pre-surgical lesion localization. Within 10-21 days after MRgFUS procedure, patients undergo
      segmental resection or mastectomy.

      Patients are followed at 5-10 days post-surgery.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 45 patients will be accrued for this study.
