      conventional measures will be screened for inclusion into the study. The treatment will
      consist of administration of formulated topical eye drops containing cadaveric epithelial
      stem cell-derived product. These eye drops will be transplanted by topical
      self-administration by the patient four times daily in both eyes for a three month interval.
