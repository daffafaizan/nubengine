      to a relapsing hypnozoite liver stage that is clinically silent until emergence and
      replication in the blood weeks to months later. Curative treatment with primaquine is often
      not achieved due to potential toxicity in those with G6PD deficiency, poor adherence to the
      two-week course, and ineffective metabolism of primaquine in those with polymorphisms in
      cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 2D6 (CYP2D6). Identifying those who harbor hypnozoites will allow
      for judicious use of primaquine in returning travelers/active duty personnel as well as
      targeted administration to those living in endemic areas to interrupt parasite transmission
      in the community. The trial will be conducted in patients presenting with uncomplicated P.
      vivax malaria at clinical trial sites run by Armed Forces Research Institute of Medical
      Sciences (AFRIMS) in Southeast Asia. It is designed to capture vivax patients who still
      harbor the dormant liver stage hypnozoites after treatment with a short acting oral blood
      schizonticide, and subsequently relapse during the follow-up period while staying in in
      study-provided housing to reduce risk of reinfection and surveilled daily for parasites or
      clinical signs of relapse. Longitudinal blood and urine sampling will be done to allow for
      retrospective analysis to identify biomarkers of hypnozoite infection and subsequent relapse
      using a systems biology approach. A smaller arm will be enrolled and will receive the
      short-activing schizonticide with primaquine radical cure at time of admission and followed
      similarly for relapse. All subjects will be followed for a total of 6 months in order to
      assess effectiveness of primaquine radical cure for P. vivax infections.
