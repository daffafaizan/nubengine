      instrument, to determine cerebrovascular reactivity during surgery procedure. Specifically,
      the cerebral tissue O2 saturation can measure by Diffuse Optical Spectroscopy Imaging can use
      for cerebral blood flow in the evaluation of cerebrovascular reactivity.

      Adequate brain perfusion is critical not only to supply oxygen and nutrients but also to wash
      out metabolic end products including CO2. Blood flow depends on perfusion pressure and
      vascular bed resistance. It is well known that multiple physiological and pathological
      factors affect cerebral vasculature, and the resistance to blood flow. The cerebrovascular
      responsiveness to those factors determines how well the brain can maintain and adjust its
      perfusion.
