      to the WHO, COPD would be the third leading cause of death by 2030. This disease is
      characterized by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible. The airflow limitation is
      usually progressive and associated with an abnormal inflammatory response of the lung to
      noxious particles or gases. However, emerging data showed that COPD patients demonstrate
      important deficits in balance and control which associated to a high risk of fall.

      Individuals with COPD, especially those with inspiratory muscle weakness, increased their
      reliance on ankle muscle proprioceptive signals and decreased their reliance on back muscle
      proprioceptive signals during balance control, resulting in a decreased postural stability
      compared to healthy controls. These proprioceptive changes may be due to an impaired postural
      contribution of the inspiratory muscles to trunk stability.

      Inspiratory muscle training (IMT) has been shown to be an effective modality for COPD
      patients for improving the maximal inspiratory muscle strength, the dyspnea and
      health-related quality of life. However, the effect of inspiratory muscle training on
      postural control is not studying. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of the
      inspiratory muscles training on posture in COPD patients.
