      short operations on arm and forearm were included. Systolic, diastolic and mean blood
      pressures, heart rate, SpO2, ECG, adverse effects during the operation were recorded. Double
      cuffed tourniquet were placed on the extremity to be operated to hinder nerve injuries.
      Venous blood in the extremity was purged with Esmarch bandage. Proximal cuff was inflated
      with a pressure 50-100 mmHg higher than systolic blood pressure and the bandage was
      displaced. Randomly patients were divided into 2 groups. Group 1: %0.5 Lidocaine+Ketamine 0.8
      mg/kg; 40 ml. Group 2: %0.5 Lidocaine 40 ml. Anesthetic agent was injected with a rate of 20
      ml/min. 20 minutes after injection the distal cuff was inflated and the proximal cuff
      deflated with a rate of 50 mmHg in every 3 minutes. 0,5,10,15,30,45,60 minutes after the
      beginning of deflation and 10 minutes after the deflation was completed ECG were recorded.
      PR,QT,QTc, RR were recorded.
