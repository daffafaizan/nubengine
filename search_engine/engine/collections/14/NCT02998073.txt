      dysfunctional social behavior. CD is associated with increased risks of mortality, lower
      educational and occupational achievement, criminal behavior and other psychosocial
      difficulties, and hence presents a significant burden to society. Impulsivity is a prominent
      predictor of violence in CD. Treatment programs targeting impulsivity in CD have been shown
      to be effective at increasing pro-social functioning in CD, but the biological mechanisms
      that underpin these therapeutic gains are not well understood. Past research suggests that
      the ACC play a role in CD and impulsivity. This study explores biological and behavioral
      changes in response to Stop, Now and Plan (SNAP), a validated 13-week psychosocial
      intervention addressing impulsivity and self-control in youth.

      The main hypotheses are:

      (1) CD youth who respond to SNAP treatment will exhibit greater post-treatment ACC activation
      during an fMRI imaging task compared with their baseline, pre-treatment ACC activation.

      The secondary hypotheses are:

      (1) CD youth will exhibit lower ACC activation at baseline during an fMRI imaging task
      compared with the baseline ACC activation exhibited by typically developing youth.
