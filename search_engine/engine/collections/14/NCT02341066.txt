      RA patients free of previous cardiovascular events. Incident CHD events during the 3-year
      planned follow-up will be registered. A measure of the incremental yield of ED will be
      obtained comparing 2-year Framingham risk score for CHD (FRS) and FRS plus ED differential
      prognostic performances by C-statics and risk reclassification analysis.
