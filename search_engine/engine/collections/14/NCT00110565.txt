      symptoms often persist despite the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and
      disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Many women for whom these drugs do not work
      turn to complementary and alternative therapies, including the use of magnetic devices.
      Although few studies have investigated the effects of low strength PMF pads in persons with
      RA, evidence suggests that PMF may help relieve pain, inflammation, and fatigue. This study
      will determine the effects of a PMF device on RA symptoms in postmenopausal women.

      This study will last 12 weeks. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three groups:
      active PMF pad treatment, sham PMF pad treatment, or standard of care, which may include drug
      therapy or physical therapy. Participants in the active and sham PMF pad groups will be
      treated with their assigned pad for approximately 8 minutes, twice a day for the duration of
      the study. Questionnaires and self-report scales will be used to assess pain, fatigue, sleep
      quality, mood, and inflammation episodes. Blood and urine collection will occur to assess
      levels of stress hormones and certain proteins.
