      were recruited. Participants must have been diagnosed with bilateral knee OA and be able to
      perform all study procedures. All participants reported in comfortable clothing and sneakers.
      After explanation of the study and consent, participants completed the demographics
      questionnaire, Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS), Western Ontario and McMaster Universities
      Arthritis Index (WOMAC), and knee function survey. Participants then completed a 3mph
      3-minute walking baseline assessment. Following the assessment, participants rated their pain
      and were randomly assigned to receive a blinded topical of either BiofreezeÂ® or a Placebo.
      The dose of both gels was 5 mL per knee. The participant then waited 15 minutes, rated their
      pain, and repeated the 3-minute walking assessment and rated their pain once more. There was
      a minimum of a 24-72-hour washout period after which time the participants repeated the same
      protocol using the other topical.
