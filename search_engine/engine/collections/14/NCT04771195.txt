      from the class of 2023 in each of their remaining years at college, producing (i)
      longitudinal data that will allow them to probe the long-term mental health effects of
      connections made during the transition to college, as well as mental health issues and
      resilience in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic as a function of social connectedness. The
      investigators will leverage this rich dataset to build (ii) prospective quantitative models
      to predict mental health outcomes later in college based on a range of social factors
      measured early in college. They will further collect (iii) a longitudinal replication cohort,
      the class of 2024, allowing to establish the robustness of their initial findings across
      samples. Finally, the investigators will add (iv) a neuroimaging component to this dataset in
      a subset of the class of 2024. This will allow them to examine brain "markers" of
      connectedness, and add them to a prospective model, providing a novel integration across
      brain, behavior, and community levels of analysis, and a synthetic assessment of social
      factors in long-term mental health.
