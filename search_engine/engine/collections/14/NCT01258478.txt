      treatment option which increases survival. However, surgery can not be offered to those with
      significant heart disease, limited lung function or lacking physical fitness. These are all
      major risk factors for operative outcome. Cardio-pulmonary exercise testing (CPET) allows
      direct measurement of aerobic physical fitness through maximal oxygen consumption (VO2 max).
      A recent update of professional guidelines (ERS/ESTS) has emphasized the importance of CPET
      in preoperative risk stratification of patients with NSCLC. Interestingly, intensive physical
      training has been shown to increase aerobic fitness in animals and healthy subjects whereas
      improvement of VO2 max has been observed in preliminary pilot studies conducted in patients
      undergoing surgery for NSCLC. However, the net effect of short-term, intensive, outpatient
      rehabilitation on clinically relevant outcomes, such as major post-operative cardio-pulmonary
      complications, as well as physiological outcomes is unknown.

      Objectives:

        1. To assess the physiological effect of 3 weeks of intensive physical training in patients
           eligible for NSCLC surgery.

        2. To assess the effect of physical training on post-operative outcomes.

        3. To identify the clinical variables, laboratory tests and specific gene polymorphisms
           (SNPs) associated with these outcomes.
