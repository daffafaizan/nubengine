      and post- intervention in Internal Medicine physician and medical student inpatient teaching
      teams. Half of the teaching teams received the intervention of mindfulness education. Blinded
      observers collected data on hand hygiene compliance and mindfulness behaviors for both teams

      intervention group participated in focus group/interview discussions.
