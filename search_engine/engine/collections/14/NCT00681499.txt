    
      Background: Due to advances in operative methods and perioperative care, mortality and
      morbidity following major hepatic resection have decreased substantially, making long-term
      quality of life (QoL) an increasingly prominent issue.

      Objectives: We plan on evaluating whether postoperative diagnosis is associated with
      long-term QoL and health in patients who require hepatic surgery for benign or malignant
      diseases and how QoL evolves with time.

      Method: QoL will be evaluated using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of
      Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core-30 and the liver-specific QLQ-LMC21 module. All
      patients requiring hepatic surgery aged >18 years will be included in the study. QoL
      evaluation is carried out preoperatively and at set intervals postoperatively.
