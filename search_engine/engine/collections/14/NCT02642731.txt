      based diagnostics of acute kidney injury may delay diagnosis and produce false negative
      results since serum creatinine is affected by diet, muscle mass, used hydration therapy. In
      recent times new markers have been developed and tested in order to find sensitive, fast and
      reliable marker of renal deterioration.
