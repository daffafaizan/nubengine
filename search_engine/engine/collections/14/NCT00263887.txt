    
      This is a one to one randomized, placebo-controlled, clinical, exploratory study with the aim
      of collecting information on possible clinical endpoints i.e., the progression of emphysema
      by lung density measurements with CT scan and frequency of exacerbations that could be used
      for a subsequent placebo controlled clinical trial. Progression of disease will be
      investigated in 80 patients with alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, who will be treated with
      human alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT; Prolastin®) or placebo weekly for two years to analyze the
      effect of treatment on lung density and exacerbations. Targeted augmentation therapy with
      weekly infusions of Prolastin® will be a dose of 60 mg/kg body weight (range of 51.72 to
      71.43 mg per kg body weight).

      Therefore, this study focuses on several questions:

        -  Is the 15th percentile point calculated by analysis of CT lung histograms a useful
           endpoint for clinical trials in AAT deficiency?

        -  Is quantitation of exacerbations in AAT-deficient patients a useful endpoint for
           clinical trials in AAT deficiency?

        -  Are there significant differences between the treatments in favor of Prolastin®?
