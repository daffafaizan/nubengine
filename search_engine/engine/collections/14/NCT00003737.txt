        -  Determine the response rate to rebeccamycin analogue in children with relapsed or
           refractory neuroblastoma.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

        -  Identify and establish in vitro biologic correlates of clinical responses and toxicity
           of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive rebeccamycin analogue IV over 1 hour once on days 1-5. Treatment
      repeats every 3 weeks for at least 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: This study will accrue up to 30 patients within 1.5 years.
