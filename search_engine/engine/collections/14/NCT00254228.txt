      greatly affecting their quality of life and ability to work. Current vestibular treatment
      does not always allow these patients to fully recover. Many patients either do not improve or
      reach a plateau with conventional vestibular rehabilitation, and still have difficulty with
      daily function. The BrainPort™ balance device is intended to provide information about head
      position to the brain through electrotactile stimulation of the tongue to improve balance in
      subjects with vestibular disorders.

      This study is a prospective, multi-center, randomized double-blinded study comparing the
      postural stability of BVD subjects using the BrainPort™ balance device to postural stability
      of control subjects using a sham device and respective baseline measures for each group. The
      primary objective of this study is to determine whether electrotactile stimulation of the
      tongue, using the BrainPort™ balance device, can improve postural stability, as measured by
      improvement in performance of the composite Computerized Dynamic Posturography using the
      NeuroCom® Sensory Organization Test in subjects with chronic bilateral vestibular dysfunction
      (BVD). The secondary objectives are to evaluate improvement in quality of life, as measured
      by the Activities Specific Balance Confidence (ABC) Scale, Dizziness Handicap Inventory
      (DHI), and the Dynamic Gait Index (DGI), and to demonstrate a decreased number of falls on
      the NeuroCom® Sensory Organization Test. In addition, we will monitor the number of falls
      that occur during subjects' normal activities of daily living. The long-term objective is to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy when the device is used over a one-year period.
