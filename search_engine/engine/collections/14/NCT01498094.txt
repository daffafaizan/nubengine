      oxygen therapy (HFNOT) with standard oxygen therapy for infants hospitalised with
      bronchiolitis. This study will be the first of its kind, as currently there is no evidence in
      the published literature.

      All children will be cared for by the same medical team on two wards. All aspects of care
      other than oxygen delivery will not be specified, and be at the discretion of the physicians.
      HFNOT will not be used as an escalation of care on the wards.

      Randomisation will be performed by REDcap, in blocks of 6 patients. Patients will be
      identified in Emergency, informed consent obtained, and treatment started prior to transfer
      to the ward.

      For patients randomised to HFNOT, the flow rate will be fixed at 8 liters/minute, and the
      inspired oxygen concentration titrated to maintain saturations above 92%.

      Interim statistical analysis will be conducted to determine any positive or negative effect
      of HFNOT therapy. The first interval analysis will be performed after 50 subjects, the second
      after 100 subjects. If an effect is found, the study will be terminated following discussion
      with the hospital statistician and ethics board. Whichever treatment arm is found to be
      beneficial will be instituted as standard care for children with bronchiolitis.
