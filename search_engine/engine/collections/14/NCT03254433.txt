      the Prevention of Post-Cessation Weight Gain) randomized clinical trial participants
      (balanced sample between BAS+ and SC). Participants who meet MRI eligibility and elect to
      participate in the sub-study will complete two, 1-hour functional magnetic resonance imaging
      (fMRI) scans while completing computer tasks inside an MRI scanner. fMRI can identify
      mechanisms underlying behavior change beyond self-report and behavioral measures. The
      investigators will examine neural responses in three parallel pathways including: cognitive
      control, food cue reactivity, and food reinforcement. The project's three aims address: 1)
      identifying putative brain mechanisms underlying BAS+ (vs. SC) treatment for smoking
      cessation and PCWG; 2) evaluating the relative contribution of treatment-induced changes in
      task related brain signal (Food Cue Response, Food Reinforcement/Choice) in prediction of
      post treatment food intake; and 3) testing whether BAS+ (vs. SC) induced change in neural
      responses to food cues and food reinforcement is a stronger predictor of food intake among
      smokers with greater cognitive control. The findings will address why BAS+ may be effective
      in managing PCWG and provide insight into which patients are best supported by this
      treatment. The investigators will also test whether cognitive control processes moderate the
      influence of BAS+ treatment on food intake.
