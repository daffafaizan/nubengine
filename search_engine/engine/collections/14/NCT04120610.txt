      with the FlowMet-R, a noninvasive blood flow monitor, and compared to gold standard
      diagnostics - ABI, TBI, and Doppler Ultrasound. Sensitivity and specificity of the FlowMet-R
      device output in diagnosing PAD and CLI will be assessed on initial visit, 3-month followup,
      and 6-month followup.
