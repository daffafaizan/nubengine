      older Filipino Americans, specifically the use of fecal occult blood tests (FOBTs). We will
      design a culturally specific intervention, an educational small group discussion with a
      Filipino health professional. The effect of the intervention will be tested with 620 Filipino
      Americans. Subjects will be recruited at community-based organizations and churches and
      invited to join a 1 1/2 hour discussion of health issues with their partner and some of their
      friends. A third of the subjects will discuss exercise (control group), another third will
      discuss CRC and receive an FOBT kit, and the remaining third will discuss CRC and will not
      receive an FOBT kit. Three months after the group session, subjects in the CRC (intervention)
      groups will receive a letter reminding them to get screened. All subjects will be interviewed
      before and 6 months after the group sessions to assess CRC screening levels in the three
      groups. Self-reported CRC screening will be verified by a review of their medical records.
