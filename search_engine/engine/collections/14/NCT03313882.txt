      Nevertheless, recent large-scale analyses have revealed that as many as half of all changes
      in the amounts of mRNA in responses to cellular signals can be attributed to altered rates of
      mRNA decay. In preliminary data, we show that HuR, a member of a class of RNA stabilizing
      proteins that bind to AU-rich elements (ARE), is expressed in the heart and contributes to
      Na+ channel mRNA stability by binding to SCN5A transcript. Furthermore, HuR appears to be
      downregulated in human HF, perhaps contributing to the downregulation of ion channels and
      increased arrhythmic risk seen in HF. We propose that HuR is downregulated in HF, that this
      downregulation contributes to reduced Na+ and other currents and increased arrhythmic risk,
      and that upregulation of HuR will reduce ion channel downregulations and arrhythmic risk in
      HF. The investigators specific aims are:

      Aim 1: Determine the extent to which HuR can regulate ion currents in cardiomyocytes.

      Aim 2: Determine the relative contributions of known ion channel posttranscriptional control
      mechanisms.

      Aim 3: Determine the mechanism and extent to which HuR activity is downregulated in ischemic
      and nonischemic cardiomyopathy and the correlation with ion channel mRNA, protein, and
      current.

      Aim 4: Determine the extent to which overexpression of HuR can raise ion channel mRNA, raise
      ion channel current, and reduce arrhythmic risk in ischemic and nonischemic cardiomyopathy.

      Please be notified that only Aim 2 involves the usage of de-identified human heart samples.
