      walk test (6MWT). The study consists of the following portions: screening (4 weeks); phase 2
      dose selection portion with 2 doses of ASP0367 versus matching placebo (2 weeks); phase 3
      portion with selected, single dose treatment versus placebo (up to 52 weeks); open-label
      extension (OLE) (24 weeks); and follow-up (4 weeks).

      During the phase 2 portion of the study, participants will be randomly placed into 1 of 3
      arms (low dose ASP0367, high dose ASP0367 or placebo). Based on the PK and PD data, the
      relevant dose level will be selected for the phase 3 portion of the study. Participants will
      maintain their original dose level unless emerging safety, tolerability and/or PK data
      necessitates dose modification, and no new participants will be enrolled in the study until
      the phase 3 dose is determined.

      After the phase 3 dose is selected, all participants except placebo group will switch to the
      selected dose level of ASP0367 for the remainder of the phase 3 portion of the study (up to a
      total 52 weeks including the phase 2 portion). Participants who were originally assigned to
      placebo will remain on placebo for up to 52 weeks. The remaining enrollment of participants
      will be randomized to either ASP0367 or matching placebo at a ratio of 1:1.

      All participants who have completed the phase 3 portion of the study and are eligible for the
      OLE will be offered the opportunity to take ASP0367 for an additional 24 weeks.
