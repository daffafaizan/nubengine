    
      About 60 patients with locally advanced rectal carcinoma (cT3, Nx, M0) of the lower and
      middle rectum will be recruited.

      The radiotherapy is an essential part of therapy of the advanced rectal carcinoma and the
      additional administration of a chemotherapy will positively influence the effect of the
      therapy (downstaging-rate, rate of distant metastases, survival-rate). Probably a downsizing
      and downstaging (as per literature and by own experience) can be reached with an preoperative
      combined radiochemotherapy.
