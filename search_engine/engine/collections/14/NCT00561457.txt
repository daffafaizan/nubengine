      a broad patient population having indications for iliac stenting. Effectiveness in this study
      will be demonstrated by the prevention of Major Adverse Clinical Events (MACE). The composite
      primary endpoint of this clinical trial is freedom from peri-procedural death and freedom
      from stented segment revascularization or restenosis (>50%) at nine months.
