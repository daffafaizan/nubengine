    
      This protocol has the overall objective to evaluate the acute (short-term, 1 day) and
      repeated (medium-term, 2 week) effects of combinations of sweeteners and sweetness enhancers
      (S&SEs) on metabolic, sensory and neuro-behavioural processes involved in satiety, consumer
      preference and health, and to explore mechanistic processes, genetic background, safety
      issues and consumer perspectives.

      There are 4 products being tested in 4 different formulations (sucrose-sweetened beverage
      control vs. 3 reformulated beverages with S&SE). Each product will be tested at 3
      intervention sites in double-blind cross-over trials with 40 subjects per site, tested per
      product. Therefore a total of 120 subjects will take part across the 3 intervention sites
      (UNAV, ULIV, UCPH).

      Using identical procedures each trial will consist of 4 Clinical Investigation Days (CIDs)
      scheduled 7-11 days apart for each of the 3 product formulations.

      The total duration of WP2 Phase 2 per site is 6 months, including a minimum of 22 days and a
      maximum of 34 days for each participant.
