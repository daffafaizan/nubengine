      result in harmful events such as spinal cord injury. Thus, it is important to minimize
      cervical spine motion in these patients. In this randomized crossover study, investigators
      are going to compare cervical spine motion during tracheal intubation using video
      laryngoscope or rigid video stylet in patients with simulated cervical immobilization.
