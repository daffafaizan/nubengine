      to hemoglobin, hematocrit, and the number of red blood cells (per cubic centimeter or millet
      of blood). Also, the status of iron stores in the body can be measured by measuring ferritin.
      With these blood tests it can be determined Per os treatment: The dosage of elemental iron
      required to treat anemia due to iron deficiency in adults is 120 mg per day for three months.
      An increase in hemoglobin by 1g / dl after one month of treatment shows an adequate response
      to treatment and confirms the diagnosis. In adults, treatment should be continued for three
      months after correction of anemia to allow replenishment of iron stores.

      Patient noncompliance may be an obstacle to oral therapy due to the occurrence of
      gastrointestinal side effects such as epigastric discomfort, nausea, diarrhea and
      constipation. These effects can be reduced when iron is taken with meals but its absorption
      can be reduced by 40%.

      In addition, taking medications such as proton pump inhibitors and agents that reduce gastric
      acid hypersecretion (eg chronic atrophic gastritis, recent gastrectomy or abdominal incision)
      reduce iron absorption.
