      of liver cancer and is responsible for 80 percent of the primary malignant liver tumors in
      adults. It is the fifth most common cancer in the world. HCC disproportionately affects men,
      with four times as many men developing the disease as women. In 2002, approximately 626,000
      cases of HCC were reported worldwide (15,000 in the United States and 53,600 in Europe), and
      more than 600,000 deaths (about 13,000 Americans and 57,000 Europeans) due to HCC were
      reported. The five-year relative survival rate is about seven percent.

      The Gem-Ox regimen has been used in the treatment of pancreatic cancer with encouraging
      results. Preliminary results of the Gem-Ox combination have been encouraging as well.Based on
      these observations the possibility of adding bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody against VEGF,
      is being studied by other investigators. However, the combination of GEM-OX with bevacizumab
      is unlikely to be tolerated by HCC patients with Child-Pugh class B and C liver cirrhosis
      especially those with significant thrombocytopenia.It would seem therefore that the agents
      that could be tolerated by cirrhotic patients with advanced HCC would include capecitabine,
      erlotinib and sorafenib. We propose this phase II trial of sorafenib + capecitabine
      combination in patients with HCC and advanced liver cirrhosis who have a platelet count of ≥
      40,000 and a Child-Pugh (C-P) class A-and B liver cirrhosis with a life expectancy of ≥16
      weeks.
