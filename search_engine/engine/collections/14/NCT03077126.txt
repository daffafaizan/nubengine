      binominal method. Identification of suspicious cancer tissue in a 12 prostate zone schema:
      Participants will undergo USE: Aixplorer® ShearWave Elastography (SWE™), (SuperSonic
      Imagine). Areas of the prostate with high suspicion for harboring cancer will be recorded in
      a 12 zone prostate schema. For study purposes the prostate will be divided into Zone 1(Left
      Lateral Base), Zone 2 (Left Base), Zone 3 (Right Base), Zone 4 (Right Lateral Base), Zone 5
      (Left Lateral Mid), Zone 6 (Left Mid), Zone 7 (Right Mide), Zone 8 (Right Lateral Mid), Zone
      9 (Left Lateral Apex), Zone 10 (Left Apex), Zone 11 (Right Apex), Zone 12 (Right Lateral
      Apex).
