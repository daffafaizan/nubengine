      high-dose-rate brachytherapy for the treatment of recalcitrant keloids in a large mixed
      Fitzpatrick skin type patient population. After intralesional excision, a unique low dose
      radiation scheme of 2x6Gray (Gy) was administered in 2 fractions: the first within 4 hours,
      the second within 24 hours. Keloids were evaluated pre- and postoperative (1 week, 3, 6, 12
      months, 5years). Scars were measured and recurrence was judged. An evaluation of the outcome
      of the scars was obtained using the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale. Statistical
      analyses were conducted using SPSS version 20.0 (SPSS, Inc, Chicago, III)
