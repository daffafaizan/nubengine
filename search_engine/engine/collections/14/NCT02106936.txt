      Primary objectives:

      To explore the proper parameters creating a long-term depression (LTD)-like effect and
      depotentiation (DePo) by using rapid paired associative stimulation (rPAS) in focal hand
      dystonia (FHD) patients

      Sample Size and Population:

      We plan to recruit 28 healthy volunteers (HVs) and 28 FHD patients from the Movement
      Disorders and Botulinum Toxin (BoNT) clinics of HMCS.

      Design:

      Phase 1 deals with HVs while phase 2 deals with FHD patients. We will complete phase 1 before
      starting phase 2. Each phase is composed of 2 experiments. In phase 1, experiments 1 and 2
      will create the LTD-like effect and DePo in HVs and in phase 2, experiments 3 and 4 will
      elicit the LTD-like effect and DePo in FHD patients. We will use regression analysis to show
      that the motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitude declines after eliciting the LTD-like effect
      and DePo.

      Outcome measurements:

      Primary outcome:

      Determining the parameters for creating the LTD-like effect and DePo in HVs and FHD using
      rPAS

      Secondary outcome:

      Measuring the percent change of the MEP amplitude after applying the proper stimulus
      parameters causing an LTD-like effect and DePo in both HVs and FHD.
