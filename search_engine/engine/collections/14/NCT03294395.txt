      gonorrhoeae (Ng) is a major public health concern. With no alternative antimicrobial
      treatment options for gonorrhoea and only a few new drugs in the development pipeline, it is
      important to test existing antibiotics for their efficacy in gonorrhoea treatment. This
      project aims to identify new treatment modalities for uncomplicated gonorrhoea using the
      registered drugs ertapenem, fosfomycin and gentamicin. This trial is a double blind
      randomized clinical non-inferiority trial with four treatment arms. 108 participants are
      randomly assigned to each study arm . Participants will receive either ceftriaxone 500mg
      intramuscularly (IM) or ertapenem 1000mg IM or gentamicin 5mg/kg IM with a maximum of 400mg
      (in two doses) supplemented with an oral placebo, or receive fosfomycin 6g oral suspension
      supplemented with an intramuscular placebo. The bacterial eradication capacity of the study
      antimicrobials at the included infection site is measured 7-14 days after treatment, using an
      RNA-based Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (NAAT).

      *Following the advise of the DSMB based on a planned interim analysis, in October 2018 one
      study arm (fosfomycin 6g PO) was dropped and the randomized clinical trial was continued with
      three treatment arms (ceftriaxone 500mg IM, ertapenem 1000mg IM and gentamicin 5mg/kg IM) and
      without the oral placebo.
