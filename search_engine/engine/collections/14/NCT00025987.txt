      cooling system designed to cool the head and neck. Temperature will be monitored at various
      locations including the scalp, face, mouth, ears (tympanic), arms, legs, and rectum. Previous
      studies indicate that cooling of the brain can be achieved with the head-neck cooling method.
      We hope to derive cooling parameters that will be used in a future study involving patients
      with epilepsy.
