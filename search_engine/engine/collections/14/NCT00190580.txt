      progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and that CKD is an important risk factor for
      development of cardiovascular disease. However, it has not been fully clarified if
      amelioration of CKD leads to the lower incidence of cardiovascular disease. The purpose of
      this study is to determine whether the angiotensin II receptor antagonist valsartan, in
      combination with conventional antihypertensive therapy, will ameliorate progression of both
      CKD and cardiovascular disease. The primary outcome is courses of renal and cardiac function.
      The secondary outcome is a composite of a doubling of serum creatinine concentration,
      end-stage renal disease, myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, stroke,
      hospitalization for unstable angina, hospitalization for heart failure or death from
      cardiovascular causes.
