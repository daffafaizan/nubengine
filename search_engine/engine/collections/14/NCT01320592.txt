      paclitaxel in patients with Rb-expressing metastatic breast cancer. Patients will be treated
      as shown in the schema below. Up to 20 patients are anticipated to be enrolled to reach the
      MTD of PD0332991 in combination with Paclitaxel. Once the MTD is established, an additional
      expanded cohort of 10 patients will be enrolled at that dose to establish the RP2D, obtain
      additional safety data and perform exploratory biomarker studies. The primary endpoint will
      be assessed after one cycle of therapy. Patients will remain on study until dose limiting
      toxicity, disease progression or physician/patient discretion. Safety assessment will
      continue for the duration of patient participation.
