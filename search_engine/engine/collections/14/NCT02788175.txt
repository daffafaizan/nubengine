      HIV-infected individuals, persistence of viral reservoirs in the peripheral blood and
      lymphoid tissues remains a hurdle to complete eradication of virus and cure of the infection.
      The concept that HIV preferentially infects discrete subsets of CD4+ T cells underscores the
      need to develop therapeutics that exploit specific cell-virus interactions. T cells
      expressing integrin alpha4beta7 not only regulate migration into the gut associated lymphoid
      tissue (GALT), but also concomitantly bind HIV, placing them in a prime position to
      disseminate HIV throughout the tissue. Previously, it has been shown that the HIV envelope
      protein gp120 binds to alpha4beta7 on CD4+ T cells in vitro, alpha4beta7high CD4+ T cells are
      highly susceptible to productive HIV infection in vitro, and the administration of
      anti-alpha4beta7 monoclonal antibody (mAb) prevents and/or delays transmission of SIV upon
      repeated challenges and preserves CD4+ T cells in rhesus macaques. Furthermore, it has been
      demonstrated that administration of anti-alpha4beta7 mAb in SIV-infected rhesus macaques
      receiving cART suppresses plasma viremia for extended periods following discontinuation of
      cART, collectively suggesting that sustained virologic remission in the absence of cART may
      be achieved via direct targeting of alpha4beta7 integrin. It is well established that the
      vast majority of HIV-infected individuals treated with cART experience plasma viral rebound
      within weeks of cessation of therapy. Considering that current research on the treatment of
      HIV-infected individuals has been heavily focused on developing strategies aimed at achieving
      sustained virologic remission in the absence of cART, it is of great interest to investigate
      whether administration of anti-alpha4beta7 mAb can prevent plasma viral rebound and allow
      durable suppression of viral replication in HIV infected individuals after discontinuation of
      cART. We propose to examine the effect of vedolizumab, an FDA approved anti-alpha4beta7 mAb
      for the treatment of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, on plasma viral rebound in
      HIV-infected individuals following analytical treatment interruption (ATI).
