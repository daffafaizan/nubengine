      fatty liver in ultrasonography. After excluding other causes, participants with persistent
      elevated serum aminotransferase levels were presumed to have NAFLD. Those with NAFLD liver
      fat score greater than (-0.64) were enrolled. They were randomly assigned to lifestyle
      modification alone or lifestyle modification plus Pentoxifylline groups. Fasting serum
      glucose, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase,
      triglyceride, cholesterol, high and low-density lipoprotein,homeostasis model
      assessment-insulin resistance(HOMA-IR), and anthropometric measurements (body mass index and
      waist circumference) were checked at baseline and six months later.
