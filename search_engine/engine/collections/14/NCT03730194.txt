      (SMART) pilot feasibility study to inform implementation of a future full-scale SMART design
      that will be used to construct adaptive biobehavioral sleep intervention strategies involving
      melatonin, a behavioral sleep intervention (The Bedtime Bank), and their combination for the
      management of sleep disturbance in adolescents with NDDs. SMARTs allow for a 3-arm trial
      offering a significant advantage in comparing interventions and combinations of interventions
      within a single study design. First, participants are randomly assigned to either melatonin
      or The Bedtime Bank. Response (>/= 18 minute nightly increase in total sleep time [TST]) will
      be measured at Week 4 and 8. Participants who respond remain on the assigned treatment.
      Participants who are non-responsive are re-randomized to a different treatment option. To the
      knowledge of the investigators, a clinically meaningful increase in TST has not been reported
      in children. However, a nightly increase of 18 minutes in TST has been reported to improve
      school-performance. After a careful review of the literature, investigators chose to aim for
      a nightly increase of 18 minutes as a meaningful increase in TST.
