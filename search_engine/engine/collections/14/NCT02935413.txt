      restoration training (VRT), but when combined with transcranial direct current stimulation
      (tDCS) which alters brain excitability, vision restoration can be potentiated in the chronic
      stage. Because it is possible that such therapy may be more effective during the early
      recovery phase after the stroke and can reach patients during the rehabilitation phase,
      investigators wished to explore the applicability, efficacy and safety of early intervention
      with a combined tDCS/VRT treatment.

      Seven post-acute stroke homonymous hemianopia patients were assigned to 10 sessions of
      combined tDCS (2mA, 10 daily sessions of 15-20 min) and VRT. The primary outcome criterion
      was the pre-post change in perimetric detection thresholds in percent. The results were
      compared to 7 age and stroke lesion matched controls of our patient data pool who received
      standard rehabilitation.
