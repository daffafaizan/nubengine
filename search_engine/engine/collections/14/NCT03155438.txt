      problem in some of couple receiving treatment for infertility. Studies showed that success
      rate in treatment for these patients is lower than normal response group. Among many factors
      contributing low response, oxidative stress is suspected to be involved in malfunction of
      follicular environment and oocyte maturation. However, direct relationship between oxidative
      and oocyte function cannot be studied due to ethical concern, so many studies had studied
      oocyte's surrounding environment such as cumulus cell and follicular fluid instead.

      In our study , we aim to study the difference in level of oxidative stress-related gene
      expression and oocyte competence biomarkers among low responders and normal responders. For
      oxidative stress-related gene expression of cumulus cell , we will measure mRNA expression by
      quantitative PCR for Superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) , SOD2 , Glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and
      Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) . For oocyte competent biomarkers, we will use ELISA
      technique to measure the level of GDF(, BMP15, Amphiregulin and CoQ10 in follicular fluid.

      Sample size calculation was done with data from study performed by Donnabela et al , which
      found that Mean SOD gene expression in control group was 2.06 2-Δ ΔCT (SD = 0.53) . The
      formula for comparing two different mean was used with expectation that low responders group
      would have lower SOD gene expression by 20%.:

      n/group = 2(Z α/2 + Z β)2 σ2 / (X̅ 1- X̅ 2)2

      α = 0.05 , β = 0.2 Z α/2 = Z0.05/2 = 1.96 (two tail) Z β = Z0.8 = 0.84

      Mean in group1 (X̅ 1) = 2.06, SD. in group1 (σ₁) = 0.53 Mean in group2 (X̅ 2) = 1.64, SD. in
      group2 (σ₂)= 0.53 Sample size: Group1 (n₁) = 25, Group2 (n₂) = 25 Total number is 56 patients
      (added 10% for possible data loss)

      Statistical analysis

        1. Mean and Standard deviation will be used for descriptive data.

        2. Mann-Whitney U test , unpaired t-test and chi square will be used as appropriate

        3. p value less than 0.05 is considered statistical significant.
