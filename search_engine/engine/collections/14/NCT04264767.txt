      from normal samples and will be able to recognize the origin of the cancer by collecting
      cfDNA (circulating free DNA) from blood samples collected from patients with a new diagnosis
      of cancer and from healthy volunteers who do not have diagnosis or history of cancer.
      Identifying those methylation patterns may assist in the development of blood test that will
      be able to detect the presence and the origin of wide range of human cancers
