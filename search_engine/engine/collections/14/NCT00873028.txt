      or to usual care (Control; n = 10). The randomization was done by the Graphpad StatMate
      computerized program. Those patients assigned to Control were followed by their own
      physicians, received routine nursing assistance, were visited daily by the one of the
      investigators (CPM), but were not exposed to any specific respiratory or motor physical
      intervention. Those randomized to Rehab received the same medical and nursing care, but
      followed a structured physical therapy program twice a day.
