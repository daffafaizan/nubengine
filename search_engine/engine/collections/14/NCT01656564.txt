    
      Background:

        -  Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has altered the natural history of HIV disease in children.

        -  Long-term survivors of pediatric HIV infection offer a tremendous opportunity to
           understand the effects of HIV and ART health outcomes.

        -  A thorough understanding of the impact of HIV and ART on these long-term processes is
           extremely relevant as ART programs for HIV-infected children expand globally.

      Objective:

      - To explore the clinical outcomes and the impact of HIV infection and ART on a cohort with
      HIV infection acquired in early life

      Eligibility:

        -  Individuals at least 18 years of age who acquired HIV infection in early life

        -  Healthy volunteers without HIV (greater than or equal to 18 years of age) will serve as
           controls

      Design:

      - Annual evaluations of health status, immune function and other health parameters related to
      HIV infection will be conducted.
