      Pluvialis microalga) and marine animals. AX is a stronger antioxidant than vitamin E and
      β-carotene but has very low oral bioavailability. The purpose of this study was to develop a
      potato protein (PP)-based delivery system for increasing oral bioavailability of lipophilic
      bioactives (nutraceuticals and drugs), using AX as a model, and to evaluate the system in
      vitro and in vivo in a crossover clinical study in human volunteers. Three different
      formulations were prepared, encapsulating AX oleoresin (AXO) with (1) PP only, (2)
      PP+lecithin (LEC), and (3) PP+olive oil (OO). The average particle diameters after
      preparation were 0.29, 0.29, and 1.76 μm, and after freeze-drying and reconstitution 0.17,
      0.07, and 6.93 μm, respectively. In vitro bioaccessibility was 33, 47, and 69%, respectively,
      versus 16% only for the raw AXO. In a randomized, double-blind, crossover study in human
      subjects, the PP-OO-AX formulation had a 4.8-fold higher median plasma AX area under the
      concentration-over time curve (AUC; P<0.001) compared to the raw AXO formulation. In
      conclusion, a non-allergenic, vegan, PP based delivery system made of "all-natural
      ingredients" offers a great promise for increasing oral bioavailability of lipophilic
      bioactives such as AX, for the enrichment of food and for dietary supplements, or oral
      delivery of lipophilic drugs.
