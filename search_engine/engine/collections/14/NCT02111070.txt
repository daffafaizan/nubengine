      protocol-specific assessments and tests within 4 weeks prior to administration of the study
      vaccine, and those who met all of the inclusion/exclusion criteria and were considered
      eligible were sequentially enrolled in the study.

      Subjects enrolled in the study received 0.5ml of the study vaccine as an intramuscular
      injection in the deltoid muscle, and returned to the clinic every day for the first 3 days.
      On Day 14 post-vaccination, subjects underwent the safety assessments. On Day 28
      post-vaccination, subjects returned for safety and immunogenicity assessments.
