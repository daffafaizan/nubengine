    
      This is a translational pilot study, involving two patient cohorts, designed to identify
      predictive biomarkers for HER2 targeted therapy, which will be validated in a larger future
      study.

      Cohort 1: 300 newly diagnosed (including metastatic) HER2 positive breast cancer patients.
      Cohort 2: 30 newly diagnosed HER2 negative breast cancer patients.

      Blood specimens will be taken:

        -  before starting treatment (cohort 1 and 2)

        -  after receiving chemotherapy and before starting HER2 targeted treatment (if applicable)
           (cohort 1)

        -  within one month following 1st treatment of HER2 targeted treatment (cohort 1)

        -  approximately every 3 months (coinciding with formal disease assessment) while on HER2
           targeted treatment for a maximum of 5 years (cohort 1)

      Blood will be processed to serum, which will be analysed for RNA and protein biomarkers.
