      study, Mesothelioma Avastin plus Pemetrexed-cisplatin Study 2 (MAPS 2), prospective in 2nd
      line or more, found 40% and 52% disease control rate with respectively an anti-PD1 antibody
      or a combo of anti-PD1 and Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte-Associated protein 4 (anti-CTLA4). Safety
      was rather good with 14% and 26% grade 3-4 in the Nivolumab and combo group respectively.

      Thanks to this trial and data from the literature, Programmed cell death 1 (anti-PD1) /
      (PDL1) Programmed death-ligand 1 (PDL1) immunotherapy became an option in the treatment of
      malignant pleural mesothelioma, after validation by a multidisciplinary meeting.

      The objective of this multicentre descriptive analysis is to describe the clinical and
      biological characteristics of patients who have received anti-PD1/PDL1 immunotherapy outside
      of a clinical trial in terms of efficacy and safety.
