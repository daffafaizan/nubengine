      with a bout of moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) on glucose concentrations over
      the subsequent 24h period. Fourteen people with type 1 diabetes (duration of type 1 diabetes
      8.2Â±1.4 years), all on basal-bolus regimen, completed a randomised, counterbalanced,
      crossover study. Continuous glucose monitoring was used to assess glycaemic control following
      a single bout of HIT (6 x 1min intervals) and 30 mins of moderate-intensity continuous
      training (MICT) on separate days, compared to a non-exercise control day (CON). Exercise was
      undertaken following an overnight fast with omission of short-acting insulin. Capillary blood
      glucose samples were recorded pre and post-exercise to assess the acute changes in glycaemia
      during HIT and MICT.
