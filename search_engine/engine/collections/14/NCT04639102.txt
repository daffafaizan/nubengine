      emergency department, including visiting home nurses, visiting home physical and occupational
      therapists, scheduled frequent telephone visits with a medical provider, care coordination to
      arrange outpatient evaluation and testing, social work services, and other services. The
      purpose of this study is to evaluate whether the PATH program allows patients to spend more
      days at home in comparison to patients who receive regular care.

      The broad goal of this program is to provide patients with a personalized package of enhanced
      services following discharge from the emergency department. In some cases, patients enrolled
      in the PATH program are likely to be discharged home regardless of enrollment, but are deemed
      potentially high-risk for returning to the hospital due to their illness or other factors. In
      other cases, enrolled patients might otherwise have been hospitalized but decide with their
      clinician that recovery at home is possible with the increased supervision and care provided
      by PATH. For all patients, we seek to determine whether PATH is effective in expediting
      patient recovery from acute illness and reduce the time spent in hospital or nursing
      facilities.
