    
      This Phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical study
      evaluated the safety and efficacy of ferumoxytol compared with placebo for the treatment of
      IDA, specifically in adult patients with IDA who have a history of unsatisfactory oral iron
      therapy or in whom oral iron could not be used. The effect of ferumoxytol on hemoglobin, iron
      parameters and patient reported outcomes (PROs) compared with placebo was evaluated.
      Investigators were blinded to key laboratory parameters that could potentially unblind the
      treatment arms of the study, eg, hemoglobin [Hgb], hematocrit [Hct], iron, ferritin, total
      iron binding capacity [TIBC], and transferrin saturation [TSAT], and neither the
      Investigators nor the subjects were aware of their treatment assignment, hemoglobin or other
      laboratory values.
