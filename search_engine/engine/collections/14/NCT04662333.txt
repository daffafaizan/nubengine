    
      Patients in need for implant-supported restoration in maxillary posterior sites with bone
      deficiencies will be randomly allocated to two different arms.

      Full-mouth periodontal chart and standardized radiographs will be evaluated at the time of
      inclusion.

      Crestal sinus lift with simultaneous implant placement will be performed in both groups.

      Control group: crestal sinus lift with no adjunctive biomaterial; the healing abutment in
      this group is made up of PEEK (poly-ether-ether-ketone).

      Test group: crestal sinus lift associated with xenogenic bone graft and collagen membrane;
      the healing abutment in this group is made up of titanium;

      Resonance frequency analysis will be performed at the time of implant placement and at 1, 3,
      6 months of follow-up.

      Both healing abutment will be undersized: this characteristic will allow to harvest a
      1mm-wide biopsy of the transmucosal tract at the end of the healing phase (6 months).

      Six months after implant placement, impression will be taken and implants loaded with
      definitive screw-retained prostheses.

      Six months later, patients will be recalled for clinical and radiographic assessment.
