      conservatively. The Sponsor, in addition to the support of recent peer reviewed literature
      illustrating a need for an appropriate criteria and more suitable speech recognition measure,
      believe it is appropriate at this time to re-evaluate the candidacy requirements associated
      with adult cochlear implantation. Specifically, this will be accomplished by evaluating the
      safety and efficacy of the Cochlear™ Nucleus® cochlear implant system under revised cochlear
      implant indications. The proposed approach would be to evaluate individuals scoring between
      10 - 40% inclusively on Consonant Nucleus Consonant (CNC) monosyllabic words who do not meet
      current approved speech perception criteria with the widely used sentence measure Hearing In
      Noise Test (HINT) in quiet. No change to current qualifying audiometric criteria (bilateral
      moderate to profound sensorineural hearing loss in the low frequencies and profound hearing
      loss in the mid to high speech frequencies) for implant candidacy is proposed.
