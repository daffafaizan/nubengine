    
      The primary objective is to determine the incremental benefit of a routine ART strategy for
      PMTCT on a population basis, when compared to short-course Zidovudine and single-dose
      Nevirapine (the current PMTCT standard of care).

      We will take advantage of planned implementation of a pilot project for routine ART across
      four primary care centres in rural Zambia (Kafue District). Using a community-based survey
      modeled after the Demographic and Health Survey, we will measure HIV-free survival among
      children under two years of age in the catchment areas surrounding these pilot sites, both
      before and after implementation of services. We will use before-after comparisons in each of
      these four communities to better understand the incremental benefit of providing these
      services.
