           intention to initiate treatment with an immune checkpoint inhibitor. This screening of
           candidate patients by the investigators will be non-interventional. Patients that are
           considered eligible candidates will be invited to participate in this study and to Page
           3/18 provide written informed consent.

        2. Study phase:

             -  Collection of baseline demographic data, prior disease history, nature of ICI
                therapy, outcome data of ICI therapy (treatment disposition, toxicity, tumor
                response and survival).

             -  Collection of blood samples will be performed every 3 to 4 weeks for the first year
                on ICI therapy and every 6 to 12 weeks thereafter until the end of ICI therapy,
                disease progression, death or loss to follow-up. Collection of blood samples will
                be aligned with the visits necessary for the administration of the ICI therapy.

             -  Collection of archival melanoma metastasis tissues will be performed on a
                continuous basis and be triggered by availability of such tissue following
                therapeutic resections of melanoma metastases.

        3. Follow-up phase: patients who stop treatment with the immune checkpoint inhibitor will
           be followed-up for
