      blanket and Group underbody blanket. All patients will receive general anesthesia and body
      temperature will be measured and registered by an esophageal thermometer with 15 minutes
      interval beginning immediately after tracheal intubation up to tracheal extubation. The
      warming unit used (Bair Hugger 750 warming unit, Arizant Healthcare) will be the same for
      both groups and the blankets tested will be: upper body blanket (Bair Hugger 522 upper body
      blanket, 3M) and underbody blanket (Bair Hugger 635 full acess underbody blanket, 3M).
      Surgical and anesthetic complications will be noted. Only surgeries with minimum 45 minutes
      duration will be accepted for the purposes of this study.
