      between 25 - 45 years with a diagnosis of chronic non-specific low back pain will be invited
      to participate in this study. Subjects who will fulfill the study's criteria and who are
      willing to participate in this study will be asked to sign an informed consent form. The
      primary outcome will be the active and passive range of motion (ROM) of the hip internal
      rotators and it will be measured using digital inclinometer. The secondary outcomes in this
      study will be the maximum torque of the hip abductors (gluteus medius), concentric at a
      constant, low-speed, and high-speed. The peak torque and strength will be measured using
      isokinetic dynamometry, pain intensity will be assessed using a visual analog scale and
      disability will be assessed using Oswestry disability index. All participants will have their
      information taken by the principal investigator. Subsequently, participants will randomly be
      assigned to either the FRC group or the conventional treatment group by the principal
      investigator. Concealed randomization will be performed by means of a computer-generated
      table of random numbers. Outcomes will be measured at baseline, week 4 and week 8 for all
      participants in both groups by an assistant researcher.
