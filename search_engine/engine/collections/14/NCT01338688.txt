      may cause side effects and also increase the medical expense.5 Further, the opportunity of
      assessing a rising tetanus antibody titer may be missed after simultaneous injection of
      tetanus-diphtheria vaccine (Td) and TIG. According to age, the elevation of the tetanus
      antibody titer after tetanus prophylaxis might be not equivalent because of different levels
      of basal immunity and the time-interval of the last tetanus vaccination. Therefore, we wanted
      to determine whether TIG influences the formation of tetanus antibody after simultaneous
      tetanus vaccination according to age and the time-interval of the last tetanus vaccination.
