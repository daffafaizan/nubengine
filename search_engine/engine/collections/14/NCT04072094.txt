      standard treatment options recommended the use of intramedullary nail for treating such
      fractures. Recent studies also showed favorable results for the use of plates in managing
      open tibial fractures. However, it is unknown whether locking plate or intramedullary nail
      fixation will result in lower complication rates and better function.

      This study is a prospective, randomized trial to compare the safety and efficiency of
      minimally invasive plate osteosynthesis and reamed intramedullary nails in treating type I-II
      open tibial shaft fractures. The investigators hypothesize that neither intervention resulted
      in a superior disability rating at 12 months. Outcomes evaluated will include the rate of
      infection, the number of re-hospitalization for the complication, the time to bone healing,
      Patient-Reported outcome and quality of life and other complications.
