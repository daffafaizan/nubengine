      antigen (PSA) value, it is unclear which strategy offers the highest detection rate for
      prostate cancer. The hypothesis of this study is that targeted MRI-guided biopsy combined
      with transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided biopsy may potentially detect more cancers than
      MRI-guided prostate biopsies alone.

      Men with at least one previously negative TRUS-guided biopsy and persistently elevated PSA
      values will be submitted to a multiparametric MRI examination of the prostate. Subsequently,
      all participants will be randomized (1:1) into both study arms. In study arm A patients will
      be submitted to targeted prostate biopsy based on the multiparametric MRI findings. Targeted
      biopsies will be performed using MRI-guided in-bore prostate biopsy. In study arm B targeted
      biopsies will be performed using MRI/TRUS-fusion-guided prostate biopsy with
      software-registration (MRI/TRUS image fusion). Patients of study arm B undergo additional
      systematic 12-core TRUS-guided prostate biopsy.
