      whether an intervention program consisting of group and individual instruction in a
      meditation-based practice of stress-reduction and cognitive-affective-behavioral learning has
      the potential for reducing disabling distress and improving quality of life in a population
      vulnerable to the progression or recurrence of disease. Quality of life will be assessed at
      12 months.
