      comparison with quantitative PET imaging. First pass dynamic contrast enhanced MRI scans will
      be performed at rest and during hyperemia caused by either adenosine infusion or regadenoson.
      After custom reconstruction and post-processing the data will be fit to a compartment model
      and quantitative perfusion and MPR values obtained.

      On another day, the subjects will have quantitative PET imaging with O-15 labeled radioactive
      water. This will be done at rest and hyperemia caused by either adenosine or regadenoson. A
      low dose CT scan will be acquired to perform attenuation correction of the PET images. The
      images will be reconstructed and processed as reported in the literature to provide reference
      standard perfusion and MPR values. These values will be compared with those obtained by MRI.
