      with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that does not have any mutation to be
      targeted. However, the concept that tumors evade immune surveillance through a variety of
      mechanisms, and that activating the immune system can lead to tumor regression in a variety
      of tumor types has been known for decades. Thus, this study combines the effects to blocking
      2 different pathways- inhibition of PD-1 pathway and angiogenic pathway via inhibition of
      VEGR signaling to improve survival as blocking each pathway individually has demonstrated a
      modest increment. There has been no study using nivolumab in combination with a VEGFR2
      inhibitor, a drug which has both anti-angiogenic and pleotropic immunomodulatory effects and
      may synergize with the effect of an anti-PD-1 agent, in solid tumors. Activating the
      anti-tumor effects of T cells by utilizing multiple pathways of both nivolumab and
      ramucirumab is an endeavor which merits investigation.

      Thus, the study investigates the synergistic effect of targeted anti-antitumor activity of
      immune checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab and immune-suppressive activity of VEGF-inhibitor
      ramicirumab expecting a favorable overall survival in NSCLC patients, with the additional
      benefit of tolerable toxicities.
