      stage, 9-12 patients with advance solid tumor will be sequentially enrolled in Cohort A
      (Fruquintinib 3 mg QD (once a day), oral dosing, 3 weeks on/1 weeks off+Sintilimab 200mg
      Q4W(4 times a week), intravenous dosing) and Cohort B (Fruquintinib 4 mg QD, oral dosing, 3
      weeks on/1 week off+Sintilimab 200mg Q4W, intravenous dosing). The MTD or RP2D will be
      determined in this stage. In dose expansion stage, 75 patients with advanced solid tumor will
      be enrolled and treated with RP2D. Efficacy, safety and tolerability will be assessed and PK
      (Pharmacokinetics) analysis will be performed in this study.
