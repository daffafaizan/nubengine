      program on arterial stiffness and cardiovascular risk in the hemodialysis population. The
      primary objective will be to assess the effect of a 16 week exercise program on aortic pulse
      wave velocity as the vascular parameter and gait speed as the physical functioning parameter.
      The secondary objectives will assess the effect of the exercise program on ultrafiltration
      rates, weight, SBP, DBP, BNP, hsTroponin, serum calcium, phosphate, albumin, glucose, LDL,
      HDL, TG, glycated hemoglobin, hemoglobin, CRP, micro RNAs (21, 126, 133, 146a, 221/222 and
      210) and hospitalizations.

      Study Design:

      Randomized-controlled study of end stage renal disease patients between the age of 18 and 90
      years to assess the effect of exercise on arterial stiffness. Our aim is to have 23 patients
      in both groups. The study period will be 24 weeks-4 weeks for recruitment, 16 weeks for the
      intervention and 4 weeks for data collection and analysis. The protocol will be submitted to
      the MUHC Research Ethics Board.

      The following outcomes are of interest:

        1. change in gait speed before and after the exercise program

        2. change in pulse wave velocity before and after the exercise program

        3. change in BNP, blood pressure, dialysis ultrafiltration, hemoglobin, micro RNAs before
           and after the exercise program
