      Immunosuppression may be associated with more frequent persistent infection and HBV
      infections in renal dialysis patients can become chronic. The routes of transmission of the
      virus is well established; direct percutaneous inoculation of virus via exchange of
      contaminated blood, blood products, body fluids, and hemodialysis. The Center for Diseases
      Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends immunization in high-risk groups, including
      hemodialysis patients. Ninety to ninety five percent of healthy, immunocompent adults develop
      protective anti-hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) with a primary series of hepatitis B
      vaccination, but the overall efficacy in renal dialysis patients is much lower. The
      proportion of hemodialysis patients who develop a seroprotective antibody even with higher
      doses of vaccination is a median 64% (range: 34-88%).

      Reports suggest that combined vaccination of hepatitis B and hepatitis A (TwinrixÂ®:
      combination vaccine containing inactivated hepatitis A and recombinant hepatitis B) may
      improve immunogenicity in healthy individuals. In one study, comparing Anti-HBs geometric
      mean titres (GMT) at month 6 of the series, subjects receiving the combined vaccine showed a
      statistically significant higher response than those who obtained the monovalent vaccines.
      Other studies also reflect the same trend at varying points in the vaccination series.

      Currently, there are 426 patients in the hemodialysis program at St. Joseph's Healthcare in
      Hamilton and 324(76%) patients are susceptible to HBV infection.

      Our study will determine if the improved immunogenicity observed with combined HAV and HBV
      vaccine will increase the efficacy of HBV vaccine in hemodialysis patients.
