    
      An estimated up to 120 youth meeting eligibility criteria will be screened for vitamin D
      deficiency, and if found deficient, will be offered enrollment in this study.

      Eligible children who assent and whose parent/guardian consent to participate will be
      randomized to low dose vs. higher dose vitamin D to take across a 3-month period of time.
      Blood, questionnaires, and pulmonary function tests will be obtained at baseline and end of
      study. Weekly phone calls will check on any questions or concerns the participant or their
      family may have.

      Aims and Hypotheses:

      Aim I: Evaluate effect sizes for relationships between omega-FA and vitD biomarkers, pre- and
      post- low and higher dose vitamin D supplementation, in diet, immune function, and asthma
      severity.

      Aim II: Characterize changes in innate and adaptive immune function and inflammatory
      responses in asthmatic D-deficient youth at baseline and after vitD supplements, by O6:O3FA
      status and vitD dose.

      Exploratory: Compute effect sizes/odds ratios for differences in pulmonary function,
      self-reported asthma severity, depressive symptoms, hospitalization/ED visits, and medication
      changes based on treatment group.

      Effect sizes will be calculated for all continuous outcome variables by:

      Effect Size (ES) = Average of the post-test scores - Average of the pre-test scores Average
      standard deviation

      Odds ratios for the categorical asthma severity variable will be computed through logistic
      regression by treatment group with no covariates.

      Examine differences in pulmonary function tests, self-reported asthma severity, depressive
      symptoms, hospitalization/ED visits, and medication changes based on treatment group. Omega
      fatty acid intake and allergic status will be included as potentially mediating variables.
