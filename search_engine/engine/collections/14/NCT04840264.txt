      will run simultaneously. In Cohort 1, participants who have received at least two prior
      therapies for their advanced disease will receive the experimental regimen. In Cohort 2,
      participants who have received only one previous therapy for their disease will receive the
      same regimen. In Cohort 3, participants who have not received any previous therapy will
      receive the triplet combination.
