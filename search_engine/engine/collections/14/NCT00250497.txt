      girls alternative to regular physical education class for inactive high school girls. New
      Moves uses a large-scale community randomized controlled study involving girls from six
      intervention schools and six control schools. The New Moves class includes physical activity,
      nutritional guidance, and social support within a supportive, non-competitive environment. In
      addition the program includes individual counseling sessions.

      The primary research hypothesis is that girls in the intervention condition will
      significantly decrease their percent body fat as compared to girls in the control condition.
      Secondary research hypothesis to be tested are that girls in the intervention condition will
      significantly increase their level of physical activity and improve the quality of their
      dietary intake as compared to girls in the control condition. In addition a range of
      socioenvironmental, personal, and behavioral variables will be compared across conditions.
