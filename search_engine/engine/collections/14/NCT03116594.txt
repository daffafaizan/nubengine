    
      This is a multi-center, randomized, double blinded, parallel-group study to assess the
      Immunogenicity and safety of NBP608 compared to Zostavax which are indicated for the
      prevention of herpes zoster. Total of 646 healthy subjects aged 50 and over are enrolled, and
      each subject is administered with single dose of vaccine which is randomly assigned to low,
      high potency of NBP608 group and Zostavax group in 1:1:2 ratio. Stratified randomization for
      age group is used to achieve the balance of treatment assignment within age strata.

      Total of six visits are scheduled including two visits via telephone contact. Blood sampling
      is conducted for immunogenicity assessment before and 6 weeks, 52 weeks after vaccination at
      Visit 2, Visit 4, Visit 6 respectively. Safety is monitored 1 week, 6 weeks, 26 weeks and 52
      weeks after vaccination through Visit 3*, Visit 4, Visit 5*, Visit 6. (* telephone contact)
