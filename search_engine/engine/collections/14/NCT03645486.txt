      NADPH oxidase multienzyme complex. It is associated with severe and life-threatening
      bacterial and fungal infections. Approximately two-thirds of all CGD cases result from
      mutations within the X-linked gp91phox gene (CYBB), followed by the autosomal recessive forms
      of CGD, with defects in the gene coding for p47phox (NCF1) accounting for 10-30% of all CGD
      cases.

      The primary objectives are to evaluate the safety of the advanced self-inactivating
      lentiviral vector TYF-CYBB and TYF-NCF1, the ex-vivo gene transfer clinical protocol and the
      efficacy of immune reconstitution in patients overcoming frequent infections present at the
      time of treatment, assessment of vector integration sites, and finally the long-term
      correction of immune dysfunctions.
