      advantages of minimal invasion and rapid recovery compared to open approach. However, for
      progressive gastric and rectal cancer, laparoscopic approach has not been officially promoted
      by NCCN guideline (2015).

      Over the past decade, circulating tumor cells (CTCs), originated from a tumor cell, have been
      identified as potential blood-based biomarkers capable of providing prognostic and predictive
      Information.

      In the present study, the investigators utilize the CTCBIOPSYÂ® system (YZYBIO Company, Wuhan,
      China), which has been approved by CFDA (Chinese Food and Drug Administration), to detect
      CTCs, and try to compare both short-term and long-term treatment effect of laparoscopic vs.
      open approach on progressive gastric and rectal cancer, based on circulating tumor cell (CTC)
      test results as well as disease-free survivals, and figure out principles of laparoscopic
      approach for progressive gastric and rectal cancer. Secondary purpose is to establish an
      evaluation system for laparoscopic surgery for progressive gastric and rectal cancer
      treatment using CTC as a biomarker.
