    
      This is a prospective, single-blind clinical investigation randomizing subjects to OCT-guided
      coronary stent implantation vs. angiography-guided coronary stent implantation in a 1:1
      ratio. The clinical investigation will be conducted at approximately 125 centers in North
      America (US and Canada), Europe, Middle East and Asia-Pacific.

      All patients will undergo baseline and post PCI imaging with their randomized modality. In
      addition, the Angiography group will undergo a blinded post-PCI OCT run to allow comparison
      of OCT derived minimum stent area (MSA) in both groups.

      After hospital discharge, all patients will have clinical follow-up at 30 days, 1 year, and 2
      years.
