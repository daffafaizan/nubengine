    
      The protocol got a favorable judgment from an ethic committee (CPP SudMed 2) on November 9th,
      2012 and was authorized by the French drug agency (ANSM) on January 24th, 2013. It will be
      proposed to HIV-1 infected volunteers to participate to a phase I/II clinical trial to test
      the Tat Oyi vaccine. Volunteers will have an undetectable viremia (lower than 40 copies/ml)
      and a level of CD4 cells higher than 350 /mm3 since at least one year under Anti Retroviral
      Treatment (ART). It will be a randomized double blinded clinical trial with a placebo.

      Main Objective: No undesirable events due to vaccination and viremia remaining < 100
      copies/ml after interruption of cART.

      Secondary objective: An immune response against Tat characterized by the cross recognition of
      Tat variants representative of the five main HIV-1 clades.

      Main parameter of evaluation: Plasma viremia. Secondary parameter of evaluation: Detection
      with ELISA of antibodies able to recognize Tat variants representative of the five main HIV-1
      clades.
