    
      This study had 2 parts. Part A was a multicenter, double-blind, randomized,
      placebo-controlled, non-confirmatory crossover study assessing response to a high-fat meal
      challenge in the setting of pradigastat versus placebo. Part A had 2 cohorts i.e. Cohort 1
      patients with stable coronary artery disease and hypertriglyceridemia and Cohort 2 patients
      with asymptomatic non-obstructive coronary artery disease or elevated coronary heart disease
      risk and hypertriglyceridemia.

      Part B was a double blinded phase designed to assess response to three months of chronic
      treatment with pradigastat versus placebo on a normal diet.

      The trial was terminated after the interim analysis of Part A, Cohort 1. The interim analysis
      results indicated that the high-fat meal challenge did not induce any impairment on either
      myocardial perfusion reserve index (MPRi) or exercise treadmill performance. Part B was never
      started.
