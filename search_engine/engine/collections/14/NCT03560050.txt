      have access to nutritious foods. Over 25% of children in ECE (1.2 million children) attend
      Family Child Care Homes (FCCH). Improvements in the Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP)
      may introduce new barriers for FCCH, which have limited meal preparation capacity. Limited
      research has examined foods served by FCCH providers, and no group randomized trials have
      been conducted using a Community-Based Participatory approach in FCCH and including an
      evaluation of intervention costs.

      Goals: 1. Determine compliance of menus and meals provided in FCCH with CACFP guidelines. 2.
      Determine the effectiveness of a pilot community-based Nutrition Technical Assistance
      intervention to enhance meeting CACFP best-practices. 3. Determine the effectiveness of a
      statewide community-based Nutrition Technical Assistance Intervention to enhance meeting
      CACFP best-practices. 4. Expand university student opportunities for participation in health
      research.

      Methods: Conduct a cross-sectional assessment of a random sample of FCCH providers' (n=52)
      menus and meals served. Foods will be evaluated against the CACFP requirements and
      best-practices. After the cross-sectional examination, providers in the pilot will be
      randomly assigned to a Nutrition Technical Assistance (n=26) or attention comparison
      intervention (n=26). Following the pilot, trained Extension Educators will implement both
      interventions (n=27 intervention, n=27 comparison) in six selected counties, reaching
      underserved rural and low-income populations. The intervention is based on theoretical
      foundations and formative interviews, and will consist of two 60-90-minute visits to the FCCH
      and one group class lasting approximately 3 hours.
