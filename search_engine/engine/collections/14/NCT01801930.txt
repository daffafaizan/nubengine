      starting OCV-C02 administration at dose level 1 (OCV-103 and OCV-104 at 0.3 mg each),
      increasing the dose to dose level 2 (at 1 mg each), level 3 (at 3 mg each), and then up to
      dose level 4 (at 6 mg each). Once-weekly administration will be repeated four times in each
      treatment cycle, and the incidence of DLT from Day 1 to Day 29 will be evaluated.

      At the end of Cycle 1, patients who wish to continue OCV-C02 treatment and have provided
      their written consent will be permitted to continue participation in the trial using the same
      dosing schedule for each subsequent cycle as that for Cycle 1.
