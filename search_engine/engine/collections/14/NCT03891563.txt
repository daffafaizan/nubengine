    
      This is a multi-centre, international longitudinal cohort study evaluating 200 participants
      between the ages of 12-14 that include sport specialists at the moderate to vigorous physical
      activity (MVPA) level and non-sport specialists at any activity level. Participant groups
      will be defined according to the AOSSM and AMSSM early sport specialization criteria (2016).
      We will monitor physical activity levels of all participants using an activity log and a
      wrist-mounted activity tracker, with synced data collected every 3 months during the study
      period. In addition, participants will be evaluated clinically and radiographically at time
      of enrollment and 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. The primary study outcome is the incidence of FAI
      between groups at 2 years, determined via MRI. Secondary outcomes include hip function and
      health-related quality of life between subjects diagnosed with FAI versus no FAI at 2 years,
      as determined by the HOS and PedsQL questionnaires.
