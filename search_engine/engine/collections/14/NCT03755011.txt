      very much fragmented and poor in this setting, as documented in numerous studies. White noise
      is a simple intervention that has been shown to improve sleep, including in the ICU setting.
      The aim is to conduct a pilot trial evaluating the feasibility of providing white noise to
      patients in the ICU at night to help improve sleep. The plan to measure feasibility metrics
      including patient acceptance, patient tolerance, and intervention fidelity; also to seek
      feedback from patients, nurses, and providers. Secondly is to evaluate the benefits of
      providing white noise at night in the ICU on sleep as measured by actigraphy and
      Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaires and total room sound.
