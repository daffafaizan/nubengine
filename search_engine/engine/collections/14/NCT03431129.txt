    
      Briefly, at the beginning of an approximate three hour study visit, the qualified
      investigator (QI) / delegate will explain the study procedure to the participants and the
      participants will have an opportunity to ask questions regarding the study procedure.
      Following the explanation of the study, written informed consent will be collected. During
      the study visit, participants will undergo: 1) brief medical history and clinical
      examination, 2) full pulmonary function tests, 3) proton MRI, 4) HP 129Xe MRI. Qualified
      research team members will perform a clinical examination on the participant to record their
      vital statistics like age, gender, height, weight, heart rate, respiratory rate, oral
      temperature and blood pressure. The QI/delegate, during a brief conversation with the
      participant, will collect relevant medical history from the participant to make sure the
      participant meets all the inclusion/exclusion criteria for the study. The QI will also make
      sure that the participant understands the study procedure and is willing to participate in
      the study. At each study visit at SickKids, the QI or delegate will also administer the QOL
      questionnaire to the participant. Based on the clinical examination results, medical history
      and the pulmonary function test results, the QI/delegate will determine if all the
      inclusion/exclusion criteria are met to proceed with the MRI part of the study visit.
