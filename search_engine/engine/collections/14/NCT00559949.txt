      I. Ascertain the objective response rate (complete response and partial response) in patients
      with iodine I 131-refractory papillary thyroid cancer treated with selumetinib.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the toxicity of this treatment in these patients. II. Determine the
      pharmacokinetic profile of this treatment in these patients. III. Determine the
      progression-free and overall survival of these patients. IV. Assess proxy measures of
      treatment response (thyroglobulin and PET scan) in patients treated with selumetinib.

      IV. Compare relevant laboratory correlates between responders and non-responders.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral selumetinib twice daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days
      in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

      Archived tissue is examined for gene mutations, including RET, BRAF, NTRK, and RAS, by
      fluorescence in situ hybridization and/or polymerase chain reaction and fluorescence melting
      curve analysis. Protein expression of ERK and phosphorylated ERK is assessed by
      immunohistochemical staining.

      Blood samples are collected periodically for pharmacokinetic analysis and biomarker
      assessment (thyroglobulin and antithyroglobulin autoantibodies).

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically for up to 2 years.
