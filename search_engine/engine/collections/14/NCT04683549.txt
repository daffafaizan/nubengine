      carcinogenic HPVs. Locally advanced stage IB2 to IVA cervical cancers are treated with
      definitive chemoradiation therapy (CRT). Despite known clinical prognostic factors of poor
      treatment outcome such as advanced stage and positive nodal status, we still don't know
      predictors of relapse.

      HPV status will be assessed in the neoplastic tissue and DNA from the blood serum of patients
      with cervical cancer will be isolated and analyzed by real-time PCR. Plasma HPV DNA would
      identify patients with residual disease after CRT due to persistent detectable HPV. This
      would earlier detect high risk patients who would benefit from adjuvant therapy.

      While metabolic response in post - therapy FDG PET CT is predictive of survival, there is
      usually 3 months waiting period time needed to perform this imaging. This pilot study will
      provide preliminary estimates of the correlation between plasma HPV DNA level, PET finding
      and clinical outcome in polish cervical cancer patients.
