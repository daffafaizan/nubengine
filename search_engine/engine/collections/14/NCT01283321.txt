      bleeding. Several studies indicate that acquired fibrinogen deficiency can be the primary
      cause of bleeding after cardiac surgery. The aim of the study is to compare hematologica and
      transfusion profiles between the first-line fibrinogen replacement and platelet transfusion
      in post-cardiac surgical bleeding. In this prospective randomized, open-lable study, 20 adult
      patients undergoing valve replacement or repair, and fulfilling preset visual bleeding scale
      (0=excellent hemostasis; 1=oozing; 2=moderate bleeding; 3=severe bleeding from multiple
      bleeding sites) are randomized to 4 g of fibrinogen or 1 unit of apheresis platelet
      transfusion. After the initial randomized intervention, additional transfusions are given in
      the presence of bleeding (>200 ml/hour) according to the institutional practie as follows; 1
      apheresis platelet unit if platelet count is less than 100 x 10^9 /L, 2 units of plasma if
      international normalized ratio is >1.6, or 10 units of cryoprecipitate if fibrinogen level is
      <200 mg/dL. Primary endpoints include hemostatic condition in the surgical field and 24-hour
      hemostatic product usage. Hematologica data, clinical outcome, and safety date are collected
      up to the 28th day postoperative visit.
