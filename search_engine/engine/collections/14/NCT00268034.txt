    
      Ventricular aneurysms in the pediatric population are rare and no standardized method of
      treatment exists.

      We plan on reviewing five patient charts between the dates of 6.30.02 and 6.30.04 as to
      causes of aneurysms. The patient charts selected will be in the following "aneurysm
      categories":

      Mostly occur after:

      Ross/Ross-Konno procedures modified Rastelli-type interventricular tunnels repeated
      resections of subaortic stenosis and possibly after: myocardial ischemia trauma drainage of
      abscess in infective endocarditis progressive herniation of endocardium mostly located: in LV
      outflow tract

      We plan on collecting echocardiograms and / or cardiac catheterizations data in order to
      confirm the diagnosis of an aneurysm. We will also collect the following information:

        -  Procedures including the dates performed

        -  Medications

        -  Physical Exam Findings

        -  Weight

        -  Gestational Age

        -  Outcome
