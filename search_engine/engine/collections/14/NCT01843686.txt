      rich plasma (PRP) gel following excision and autologous skin grafting of acute deep 2nd and
      3rd degree burns. This treatment is intended to stimulate rapid healing and improve the
      outcome of standard of care treatments for burns common to active duty military personnel,
      and more broadly for treatment of all acute burns. The care is specific to excision and split
      thickness skin grafting in the context of this burn study. The study will enroll 42 patients
      receiving surgical management of acute 2nd and 3rd degree burns requiring excision and skin
      grafting. The patient's total body surface area burn injury should not exceed 20%. The study
      will be conducted for 12 months. This study will provide further information for the
      development of enhanced treatment of wound-deployable cellular therapy for advanced trauma
      care of burned warriors.
