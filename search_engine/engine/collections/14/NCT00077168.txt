      Primary

        -  Compare ipsilateral tumor relapse and breast cancer metastases in women with completely
           excised low-risk estrogen receptor- or progesterone receptor-positive ductal carcinoma
           in situ of the breast receiving adjuvant tamoxifen or anastrozole and treated with
           adjuvant radiotherapy vs observation alone.

        -  Compare the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the minimal surgical margins required to minimize the local recurrence rate in
           patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Identify molecular markers that predict ipsilateral tumor recurrence in patients treated
           with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      participating center. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      All patients receive adjuvant tamoxifen or anastrozole for 5 years.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo radiotherapy 5 days a week for 3 or 5 weeks.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo observation alone. Quality of life is assessed at baseline, at
           6 months, and then at 1, 2, and 5 years.

      Patients are followed every 6 months for 1 year and then annually for up to 10 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 2,000 patients (1,000 per treatment arm) will be accrued for
      this study within 5 years.
