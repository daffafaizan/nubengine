      calcium phosphate and calcium glycerophosphate (CaGP) are still a matter of debate. It has
      been suggested that CaGP increases the phosphorus content in the biofilm and, as a result,
      the buffering capacity of the biofilm is intensified. The pH levels of the biofilm are
      maintained above the 5.0-5.5 range. This is above the critical range for enamel
      demineralization.
