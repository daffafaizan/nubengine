      expectation-disconfirming experiences; however, research has shown that people suffering from
      MDD have difficulty in changing their expectations after experiences that disconfirm
      expectations. Recently, the investigators have shown that this persistence of expectations is
      due to maladaptive information processing involving "cognitive immunization", defined as a
      cognitive reappraisal of expectation-disconfirming experiences in such a way that the
      individual's expectations are maintained. In view of psychotherapeutic interventions aiming
      to modify patients' dysfunctional expectations, effective strategies to inhibit cognitive
      immunization strategies need to be identified. Therefore, the aim of this study was to
      compare different immunization-inhibiting strategies with regard to their effectivity in
      enhancing expectation change. For this purpose, the investigators use a standardized
      experimental paradigm, which was developed and validated in a previous study.
