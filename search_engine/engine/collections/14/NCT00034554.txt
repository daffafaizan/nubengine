      with gp75 DNA in patients with stage III or IV melanoma. Secondary objectives are to observe
      the patient for any evidence of anti-tumor response and to establish the optimal biologically
      effective dose. Up to 24 evaluable patients with stage III or IV metastatic melanoma or with
      stage III melanoma, currently disease-free, but at high risk for recurrence will be enrolled.
      Patients will be be enrolled into an assigned dose group and will receive five vaccinations
      of gp75. In order for dose escalation to proceed, only one patient in the current dose group
      may have demonstrated a dose limiting toxicity (DLT). If a second patient experiences such
      toxicity then both patients will move down to the previous dose level, and the previous dose
      level will be considered to be the MTD. If no DLTs are encountered, patients will continue on
      study at the assigned dose level. Any patient experiencing a DLT will not receive further
      vaccination until the toxicity has resolved. Patients exhibiting both serological and
      stable/clinical response after receiving the fifth vaccination will be eligible to receive
      booster vaccinations. An additional patient will be accrued to the dose level for every
      patient that progresses prior to the fifth vaccination.
