      supplementation after bariatric surgery, identify factors that may influence adherence, as
      well as study the development of micronutrient deficinencies detectable by blood sampling.

      All study participants are prescribed life-long treatment with daily oral vitamin B12 and
      Calcium/Vitamin-D. Menstruating women are also prescribed daily oral iron supplementation.

      Post-operative adherence rate is retrieved from pharmacy refill data, collected from The
      Swedish Prescribed Drug Register, at one, two and five years after bariatric surgery.
