      patients. The advent of next generation sequencing can allow us to potentially characterize
      each individual's tumor for oncogenic driver mutations. It is unknown at present if a wide
      range of mutations in the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway predict for
      responsiveness to a PI3K inhibitor as would be expected in a situation of "oncogene
      addiction". In this study, we plan to explore two cohorts of patients and response to BYL719,
      an oral selective PI3K-alpha inhibitor: 1. Metastatic triple negative breast cancer (triple
      negative breast cancer [TNBC] which is defined as ER-/HER2-) and 2. PI3K pathway abnormal
      metastatic luminal breast cancer (ER+/HER2-). Both cohorts are eligible for this study after
      progression after standard first line therapy. In recent large sequencing efforts, for
      example The Cancer Genome Atlas [TCGA], primary breast cancers were found to have a large
      number of Pi3K pathway abnormalities- in TNBC there was a high rate of genetic abnormalities
      in the Pi3K pathway (combined mutations, amplifications and deletions in nearly 100% of
      TNBC)- as well as in ER+/HER2- disease. Therefore, in this study we plan to study responses
      to BYL719 and associations with genetic features that could signify Pi3K pathway activation
      in a cohort of fully molecular- characterized metastatic breast cancers in order to identify
      biomarkers of response to selective PI3K alpha inhibition in breast cancer.
