      United States. It has an incidence of about 1 in 300 births. A combination of general
      anesthesia and a caudal block or general anesthesia combined with a pudendal nerve block are
      commonly used for hypospadias repair.

      In our institution, hypospadias repair is typically done in infants and children ages 6
      months to age two. A comparison of the efficacy of pudendal block versus the caudal block has
      not been undertaken in this younger population.
