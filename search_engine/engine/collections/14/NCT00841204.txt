      I. To determine sulindac and metabolite levels in healthy participants with atypical nevi and
      benign nevus at increased risk for melanoma treated with sulindac versus placebo.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the effects of sulindac on apoptosis in atypical nevi of these participants.

      II. To assess the effects of sulindac on VEGF expression in atypical nevi of these
      participants.

      III. To assess sulindac and metabolite levels in plasma and its association with drug levels
      in the target tissue.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Participants receive oral sulindac twice daily.

      ARM II: Participants receive oral placebo twice daily.

      In both arms, treatment continues for 8 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      Blood and tissue samples are collected at baseline and/or after completion of study therapy
      and analyzed for sulindac and metabolite levels via high performance liquid chromatography
      tandem mass spectrometry; the detection of apoptotic cells via TUNEL assay; and VEGF
      expression via immunohistochemistry assays.

      After completion of study therapy, participants are followed for 2 weeks.
