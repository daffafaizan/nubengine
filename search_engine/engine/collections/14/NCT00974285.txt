           lymphocyte count was reduced gradually at the rate of 50~100cells/ul/year. When the CD4
           T lymphocyte count dropped below 350cells/ul and viral load increased to 105 in AIDS
           patients, HAART will be carried out. But, CD4 T lymphocyte was 350~550 cells/ul, there
           is no intervention measures.

        -  Immunity 1 (Fuzheng 1) is composed of herbs which have tonic and detoxific function. The
           long-term clinical application has proved the safety and effect. It can improve the
           symptoms and signs in AIDS patients with the effective rate of 70% and can significantly
           improve the quality of life. It can also improve and stabilize immune function and
           inhibit viral replication. The basis study have shown that Immunity 1 (Fuzheng 1) can
           inhibit viral replication from multi-target, multi-link, enhance immune function,
           increase the secretion of IL-2, IFN-γ, participate in immune regulation effect, enhance
           NK cell activity, promote CD3+CD4+T cell proliferation and increase macrophage
           phagocytes capacity.

        -  Through the clinical trials, we are going to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
           Immunity 1 (Fuzheng 1) on immune reconstitution of HIV patients in WHOⅠ、II period.
