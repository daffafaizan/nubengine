    
      This is a double-arm, randomized, multi-center, current practice-controlled study.
      Approximately 150 cancer pain patients with collecting questionnaires admitted to an
      inpatient department from 3 national hospitals: Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital,
      Kaohsiung Municipal Ta-Tung Hospital and Kaohsiung Municipal HsiaoKang Hospital will be
      invited into this study. Eligible patients will be randomized to one of the following pain
      control wards in a 1:1 ratio.

        -  GPM Ward: Good Pain management ward

        -  Control Ward: Current practice-controlled ward Surveys, pain level measurements and
           dosage used will be collected in 48±8 hours. The pain management index (PMI) will be
           assessed as primary objective. The patient satisfaction, outcome questionnaire (APS-POQ)
           and SF-36 will be assessed in secondary objectives.

      Once patient is admitted to the ward and agrees to participate in the study, the patient will
      be randomly and blindly assigned to either GPM ward or Control Ward. In the Control Ward,
      patient will receive the current practice of pain management, with less assessment procedure.

      This study will investigate the benefits and effect of good pain control on patient outcomes
      in hospitalized cancer pain patients. The results aim to demonstrate the viability of GPM
      ward in daily practices and its measurable impact on the patient outcomes including patient
      treatment satisfaction as well as quality of life.

        1. Primary objectives:

           • To assess pain management index (PMI)

        2. Secondary objectives:

      (1) To assess the satisfaction of pain control during admission (2) To analyze the Patient
      Outcome Questionnaire (APS-POQ) (3) To analyze the SF-36 Questionnaire
