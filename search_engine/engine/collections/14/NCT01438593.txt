      isolated from UCB (blood obtained at birth from the umbilical cord blood of babies).
      StemCyte, a leading accredited UCB banking company with branches in the United States and
      Taiwan, will provide the units of UCB that match at least 5 out of 6 HLA (human leukocyte
      antigens) for transplantation. The HLA-matching is the same as that used to match cells and
      organs for transplantation so that the body does not reject the cells. We will isolate CD34
      cells from these units, purified them, suspend the cells in solution (1 ml containing 2-8
      million cells), and inject the cells into brain around the site damaged by the stroke
