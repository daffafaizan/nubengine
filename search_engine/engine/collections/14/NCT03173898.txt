      to the periodontal ligament (PDL) anesthetic injection as compared to the traditional
      infiltration injection, for the non-surgical extraction of one posterior maxillary permanent
      tooth. Methods: All patients scheduled for non-surgical symmetrical maxillary posterior
      permanent teeth extraction in the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (OMFS) at the
      University of Jordan Hospital, Amman, Jordan, over a-seven-month period, were invited to
      participate in this prospective randomized double blinded, split mouth study. Every patient
      received the recommended volumes of 2% lidocaine with 1:100.000 epinephrine for PDL injection
      on the experimental side, and for local infiltration on the control side. A Visual Analogue
      Scale (VAS) and a Verbal Rating Scale (VRS) were used to describe the pain felt during
      injection and extraction, respectively. Statistical significance was based on probability
      values of <0.05 and measured using Chi-Square and Student-t tests, and Nonparametric
      Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests.
