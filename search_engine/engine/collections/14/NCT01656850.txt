      inflammation, and oxidative stress in 20 Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus
      (T2DM). To follow-up and expand this work with a more robust trial, the investigators propose
      a larger (n = 40), longer-term (90-d) investigation of the effect of almonds (~60 g/d) on
      adipokine regulation, endothelial function, glucoregulation, inflammation, lipid profile, and
      oxidative stress in Chinese patients with T2DM as compared to a placebo control. The
      investigators will conduct a 7-mo randomized, cross-over, placebo controlled clinical trial
      in which all meals will be provided to all subjects (n = 40). During the first 2 weeks
      (run-in period), all subjects will receive a control diet resembling a typical Taiwan diet,
      prepared based on the NCEP Step 2 guidelines. During the following 3 mo (Phase I), subjects
      will be randomized to receive either the control diet or the control diet with whole almonds
      (~60g/d) incorporated to replace 20% calories. After a 2-wk washout period during which all
      subjects will once again receive the control diet, subjects will receive the opposite diet to
      the one assigned during the Phase I for the other 3 months (Phase II). The caloric content of
      each diet will be adjusted to each subjects' energy needs to prevent any change in body
      weight. The following biomarkers will be determined at the baseline and end of each dietary
      intervention: Glucoregulation: fasted serum HbA1c, glucose and insulin, postprandial serum
      glucose and insulin, and urinary C-peptide; Endothelial Function: brachial artery FMD and
      serum nitric oxide, e-selectin, endothelial-1 (ET-1), and intracellular adhesion molecule-1
      (ICAM-1); Adipokine Regulation: serum adiponectin, leptin, and resistin; Inflammation: serum
      high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, retinol binding
      protein-4 (RBP-4), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-Î±; Oxidative Stress: urinary isoprostanes
      (adjusted for creatinine) and serum protein carbonyls and oxidized LDL; and Lipid Profile:
      serum cholesterol, triglycerides, and apolipoproteins A1 and B.
