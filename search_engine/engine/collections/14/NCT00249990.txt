      1966. As a topoisomerase I inhibitor, it has powerful anticancer properties and has been used
      clinically in the treatment of a variety of cancers. It possesses significant toxicity,
      especially involving the bone marrow and gastrointestinal tract that has limited its use.
      Derivatives of 20-(S)-camptothecin have been made to increase the aqueous solubility of these
      compounds and/or modify the A-ring to increase membrane association. The 9-nitrocamptothecin
      (9-NC) derivative to be used in this study is insoluble in water, but has demonstrated potent
      antitumor effects in mice and antitumor effect in humans. However, the therapeutic index is
      low. In order to increase the therapeutic index, a liposomal formulation has been developed,
      which can be administered as an aerosol. In humans, dose of 0.52 mg/m2/day 5 days per weeks
      for eight 8 weeks of a 10 week course were well tolerated in the Phase I study. Partial
      responses were noted in patients with endometrial cancers. The recommended starting dose of
      L9NC in the Phase II study is 0.52 mg/m2/day to be administered once a day by aerosol
      (mouth-only breathing) for five consecutive days per week x 8 weeks followed by a 2 week
      rest. Courses are 10 weeks. This dose corresponds to approximately 1/6 of the MTD of oral
      9-NC administered to untreated cancer patients.
