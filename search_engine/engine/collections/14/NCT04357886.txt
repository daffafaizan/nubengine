      study, SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences / SPSS 21.0) was analyzed using the
      statistical program. In the study, arithmetic averages are presented with tables and graphs
      as mean Â± SD (standard deviation) and values indicated by counting in numbers (percent).
      Demographic information of the participants and their responses to the questionnaire
      questions were evaluated using descriptive statistical analysis method. In the study,
      Independent Sample t Test was used in parametric data and ANOVA was used in normal
      non-parametric data. In all analyzes, p <0,05 was considered statistically significant.

      Sampling: Sample size was calculated based on the number of questions asked. Accordingly, the
      number of questions multiplied by the formula of 60 is the lower limit (42*60=2520).
      Considering the 20% probability of a drop-out and the fact that participants did not want to
      volunteer, it was decided to take 3150 people to the study. Consent will be obtained from the
      participants through a voluntary information form.
