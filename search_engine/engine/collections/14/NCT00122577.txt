      including patients with multiple failures. In such patients, having multi-resistant virus,
      the introduction of one new drug only in the salvage regimen will infrequently result in
      undetectable virus load in the plasma. Tenofovir DF and atazanavir appear promising because
      of their pharmacokinetic profile, activity, safety and resistance properties. In addition,
      pharmacokinetic data in healthy volunteers suggest that atazanavir could be optimized by
      adding ritonavir at low dose. Thus, one may speculate that atazanavir pharmacokinetic and
      antiviral activity could be optimized by adding ritonavir at low dose in patients exhibiting
      high rate of protease inhibitor mutations.

      This protocol is aimed at studying the antiviral activity, toxicity and PK interactions, of
      tenofovir DF and atazanavir enhanced with low dose of ritonavir given alone and then
      concomitantly as part of a salvage regimen to patients with multiple failure, under
      conditions allowing to tease out the specific role of atazanavir combined with low dose of
      ritonavir.

      EKG abnormalities (increased PR and QTc intervals) were observed in normal volunteers treated
      with atazanavir, therefore EKG safety monitoring will be performed on all subjects during
      this study
