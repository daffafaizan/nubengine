      world's population. Antipsychotic drugs remain the cornerstone in the pharmacotherapy of
      schizophrenia. There are a number of antipsychotic drugs in use but none is ideal, in
      particular because their safety profile is complex and their effectiveness is limited.

      Thus, present treatment options leave room for improvement and call for new, more effective
      pharmacotherapies for the treatment of schizophrenia. In the current study, non-acute
      patients with schizophrenia will be randomised to blinded treatment with either zicronapine
      or a standard antipsychotic treatment for 24 weeks. The safety (with focus on metabolic
      parameters) and efficacy of zicronapine will be evaluated in comparison to risperidone.
