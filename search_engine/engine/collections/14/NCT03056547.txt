      dyspnoea. It will open therapeutic possibilities through a better understanding of the
      mechanisms of dyspnea.

      Healthy volunteers will underwent two types of dyspnea. The subjects will be first familiar
      with both types of dyspnea and dyspnea measurement scales. Different components of dyspnea
      will be measured.

      Blood tests will be performed at different times (before dyspnea, during dyspnea, 60 and 90
      min after dyspnea)
