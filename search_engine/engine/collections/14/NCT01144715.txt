      stroke therapy delivery and monitoring system in rural and underserved locations that
      provides accessible, effective and affordable care for stroke survivors with residual limb
      impairment. The study is a prospective, single-blind, multi-site Randomized Controlled Trial.
      A total of 96 patients within 6 months post-stroke will be enrolled and randomly assigned to
      one of two groups: robotic based home therapy or a self administered (non-robotic) home
      therapy program.
