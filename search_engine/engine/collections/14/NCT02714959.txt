      by various autoantibodies targeting neural cells or synapses. The responses to immunotherapy
      is generally good, considerable proportion of patients with autoimmune encephalitis have
      unfavorable clinical outcomes. Recently, depletion of regulatory T cell (Treg cell) is
      reported in variable autoimmune diseases and multiple studies have shown that low-dose
      interleukin-2(IL-2) specifically activates Treg cells to control autoimmunity and
      inflammation.

      Protocol: This study is a single arm open-label study assessing clinical responses to the
      administration of low-dose IL-2 in autoimmune encephalitis patients who are refractory to
      first- and second-line immunotherapy.

      Objective: To assess the efficacy of low-dose IL-2 in autoimmune encephalitis, resistant to
      first- and second- line immunotherapy.

      Methods: This is a single arm open-label study. Each patients will receive four cycles of
      subcutaneous Proleukin (Interleukin-2, IL-2) (Week-1; 1.5 million IU (MIU)/d from Day-1 to
      Day-5, Week-3, -6, -9; 3MIU/d from Day-1 to Day-5) in the hospital. The patients will be
      followed up for 3 months (Week-21).

      Primary outcome - clinical efficacy by modified Rankin Scale Secondary outcome - Immunologic
      follow-up of Treg cells before, during, and after IL-2 therapy, quality of life, cognitive
      function, side effect of low-dose IL-2
