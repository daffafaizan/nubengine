    
      A prospective, single arm, continued access protocol to evaluate the effectiveness of the OCS
      Liver System to preserve and assess donor livers having one or more of the following
      characteristics:

        1. Donor age equal to or greater than 40 years old, or

        2. Expected cross clamp time of 6 hours or greater, or

        3. Donor after circulatory death (DCD) with age less than or equal to 55 years; or

        4. Steatotic lever >0% and less than or equal to 40% at time of retrieval, based on
           pre-retrieval histology)

      A maximum of 21 sites will enroll up to 184 transplanted liver recipients. The primary
      effectiveness endpoint will be the incidence of Early Allograft Dysfunction (EAD) or primary
      non-function.

      All recipients will be followed for 24 months from the date of transplantation (some of which
      will be post-market).
