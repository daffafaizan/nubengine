      I. To evaluate the proportion of patients with unresectable hepatocellular or biliary
      carcinoma treated with OSI-774 who are progression-free at 24 weeks.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the toxicity profile of this treatment in each of the patient groups.

      II. To evaluate the objective response rate of patients with hepatocellular or biliary
      carcinoma treated with OSI-774.

      III. To evaluate overall and progression-free survival. IV. To assess the EGFR protein levels
      and explore their association with clinical outcome.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 groups according to
      cancer type (hepatocellular vs biliary).

      Patients receive oral erlotinib once daily. Treatment repeats every 28 days for at least 6
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for up to 3 years.
