      anticoagulant of choice for hemodialysis therapies is unfractionated heparin (UFH), whereas
      in Western Europe, it is low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). Dalteparin is more commonly
      used in Canada and has been approved for use in the in-centre thrice-weekly hemodialysis
      population at a fixed dose of 5000 units. However, there have been no published studies to
      assess the use of dalteparin in home quotidian and/or nocturnal hemodialysis therapies.
      Patients on frequent hemodialysis or nocturnal hemodialysis in the home will be converted to
      Dalteparin from Heparin for 4 weeks to evaluate the optimal dosage and to assess its safety
      in this population
