      intensive care .

      There are multiple methods for monitoring the raised ICP either invasive or non-invasive.The
      gold standard is the invasive devices because it is more accurate and reliable .However ,it
      requires a surgical intervention which has many hazards such as (infection
      ,hemorrhage,malfunction ).

      Optic nerve sheath ultrasonography is a promising bedside tool for detection of increased
      ICP. The optic nerve is surrounded by cerebro-spinal fluid ,thus if the circulation of
      cerebro-spinal fluid not blocked ,an increase in ICP will be transmitted through the
      subarachnoid space around the optic nerve within the nerve sheath especially the retro-bulbar
      segment.

      The study will be conducted to monitor the dynamic changes of intracranial pressure by optic
      nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) in response to mannitol osmotherapy as a primary outcome and
      secondary to evaluate the efficacy of ONSD in assessing the severity of the disease
