    
      Randomized, prospective, multisite, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study of
      a Placebo Topical Solution versus Cocaine HCl 4% or 10% Topical Solution as an anesthetic
      prior to a diagnostic procedure or surgery.

      In the Safety and Efficacy first phase, subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 fashion to one
      of the three treatment groups (placebo, Cocaine HCl 4% or 10% topical solution) pre-procedure
      and given one application of up to 4 mL from one bottle of the assigned test product. After
      pre-procedure Von Frey filament testing, the blind will be broken, but only relative to
      placebo versus cocaine, not relative to the strength of the cocaine. The placebo subjects
      will then exit participation in the efficacy portion of the trial, and be followed for safety
      for 7 days. Treatment group subjects who do not feel pain after Von Frey testing will receive
      their surgery or diagnostic procedure and also be followed for safety for 7 days.

      In the Safety second phase, subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to one of the two
      treatment groups (Cocaine HCl 4% or 10% topical solution) pre-procedure and given one
      application of up to one 4 mL of the assigned test product. After pre-procedure Von Frey
      filament testing reveals a pain score of 0, subjects will receive their surgery or diagnostic
      procedure, and then all subjects will be followed for safety for 7 days.
