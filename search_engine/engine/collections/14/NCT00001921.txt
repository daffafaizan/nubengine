      brain regions in normals, patients with schizophrenia and unaffected family members. We will
      perform electrophysiological recordings (MEG, EEG) during cognitive activation (Continuous
      Performance Task, Sternberg paradigm, working memory). We will focus on the investigation of
      oscillatory brain activity as this is considered to be crucial for information processing
      related to neuronal integration. The measurements will be closely adapted to equivalent
      fMRI-measurements presented as an independent protocol (00-M-0085). The combination of both
      methods will help to improve activity source localization (MEG/EEG) and correlation of this
      activity between different parts of the brain. In addition, local activity patterns (fMRI)
      can be better characterized in the time domain (tonic versus phasic BOLD-activation). We will
      address whether cognitive activation goes along with an increase or decrease of correlation
      between regional brain areas. In this context, we will investigate whether this correlated
      activation pattern is different in schizophrenics and unaffected siblings when compared with
      normals. The study is integrated with the schizophrenia-sibling study (95-M-0150). Siblings
      of schizophrenic patients are investigated in order to achieve a better understanding of the
      genetic determination of schizophrenia-related pathophysiology.
