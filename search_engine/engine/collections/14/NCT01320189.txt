      intake. Therefore, in response to an unbalanced menu relative to the usual daily intake
      target, protein intake should be prioritized. Individuals may over-consume carbohydrate and
      fat of a menu containing a lower ratio of protein to carbohydrate and fat until the daily
      intake target amount of protein is ingested, and not the target of total energy intake
      because of a deficit of protein intake. In contrast, individuals may under-consume energy
      when the menu has an increased protein to carbohydrate and fat ratio. The protein leverage
      hypothesis requires evidence for why protein intake is more important than carbohydrate or
      fat in relation to food intake regulation.
