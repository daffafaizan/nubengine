      selected group of patients with metastatic melanoma to the brain. This combination has been
      tested in primary brain tumors and in melanoma not involving the brain. The 6-week on, 2-week
      off low-dose schedule proposed in this trial capitalizes on preclinical data demonstrating
      that temozolomide inhibits angiogenesis at low, non-toxic doses that correspond to the plasma
      concentrations achieved by an oral administration, a so-called 'metronomic' scheduling. The
      precise mechanism of its antiangiogenic action remains to be elucidated. This potential
      synergistic mechanism, together with the bulk of evidence for activity presented above
      suggests that the combination will be well-tolerated, safe and possibly more effective.
