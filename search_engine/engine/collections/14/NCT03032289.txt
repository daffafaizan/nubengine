      Ischaemia National Audit Project between 2010 and 2013. Data on active transport according to
      local authority was obtained from the UK 2001 and 2011 census, whilst important confounders
      including deprivation levels, prevalence of obesity and population smoking estimates were
      obtained from Public Health England.

      In addition to investigating the association between active transport and AMI, we also
      studied the extent to which the components of active transport, cycling and walking, were
      associated with AMI, and investigated whether any associations were contingent on a time lag
      effect between the dates of exposure to active transport and indecent AMI.
