    
      This study will compare a 3-month rifapentine (RPT)/clofazimine (CFZ)-containing regimen with
      CFZ loading dose versus 6-month standard of care (SOC) for drug-susceptible (DS) tuberculosis
      (TB).

      Randomization will be stratified based on HIV status and the presence of advanced disease as
      determined by chest X-ray.

      Participants will be randomized to one of three arms:

        -  Arm 1 (Experimental): rifapentine/isoniazid/pyrazinamide/ethambutol (PHZE) + CFZ 300 mg
           once daily for 2 weeks; then PHZE + CFZ 100 mg once daily for 6 weeks; then
           rifapentine/isoniazid/pyrazinamide (PHZ) + CFZ 100 mg once daily for 5 weeks

        -  Arm 2 (SOC): rifampicin/isoniazid/pyrazinamide/ethambutol (RHZE) for 8 weeks; then
           rifampicin/isoniazid (RH) for 18 weeks

        -  Arm C (Pharmacokinetic [PK]-only subgroup): PHZE + CFZ 100 mg once daily for 4 weeks;
           then remain on study, off study medications and treated according to SOC (RHZE for 4
           weeks; then RH for 18 weeks)

      All participants must receive pyridoxine (vitamin B6) with each dose of isoniazid (INH) based
      on current local, national or international dosing guidelines.

      Arm 1 participants will be treated for 13 weeks (including a 2-week CFZ loading dose of 300
      mg daily). Arm 2 participants will be treated for 26 weeks, and Arm C participants will be
      treated for 4 weeks.

      All participants in Arms 1, 2, and C will be followed from randomization to Week 65. Study
      visits may include physical examinations; blood, urine, and/or sputum collection; chest
      X-rays; and electrocardiograms (ECG).
