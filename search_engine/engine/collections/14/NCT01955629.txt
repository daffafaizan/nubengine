      weeks, study drug administrations every 3 weeks up to disease progression, unacceptable
      toxicity or participant's refusal of further study treatment, followed by a minimum of 30-day
      follow-up after the last study treatment administration.

      After study treatment discontinuation each participant will be followed-up until death,
      participant's refusal or end of study (whichever comes first).

      This trial is being conducted in Europe, where the INN designation for the study molecule is
      "aflibercept" and this term is therefore used throughout the synopsis. In the US, the US
      proper name is "ziv-aflibercept".
