      exposure to radiation. Typical radiation exposure for a patient submitted to ureteroscopy
      ranges from 2.5 to 100 mSv. The International Commission on Radiological Protection
      recommends an annual occupational radiation exposure limit of no more than 50 mSv per year.
      One of the most effective strategies to decrease radiation exposure during ureteroscopy is to
      use low dose. However, the quality of the image obtained is inferior to full dose image. The
      main concern is to maintain the stone free and complication rate despite the inferior quality
      of image obtained. Our aim was to evaluate if reducing the dose of fluoroscopy to Â¼ instead
      of full dose would impact in a reduction of total radiation exposure despite a possible
      increase in fluoroscopy time. Also, if this strategy would impact in operation time, stone
      free rate and complication rate of unilateral semi-rigid ureteroscopy for ureteral stone
      treatment due too less than optimal fluoroscopy image. All patients over 18 years old
      diagnosed with ureteral stone from 5 mm to 20 mm in diameter by CT scan were counseled
      regarding their treatment options. Patients who failed spontaneous passage or medical
      treatment or chose endourologic treatment were included in this study. Patients with abnormal
      urinary anatomy such as horseshoe kidney, pelvic kidney or duplex system were excluded from
      the study.
