      arches , but in the same time the conventional method to weld this metal framework to the
      implants by casting technique in lab usually involves a several disadvantages eg. cost and
      time consuming in addition to laboratory errors, Thus , this study aims to find another
      method to weld the metal framework intraorally by an electric welding device
