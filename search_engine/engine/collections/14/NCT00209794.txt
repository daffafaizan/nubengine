    
      The study is a randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled trial of the antimalarial drug
      sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine administered intermittently at 3, 4 and 9 months of age through
      the EPI scheme at the time of routine immunisations.

      Children will be randomized into placebo and SP treatment groups by block randomization, and
      it is expected a similar age distribution and a similar number of children in each group.

      Doses of sulphadoxine (25 mg/kg)-pyrimethamine (1.25 mg/kg) (SP) or placebo will be given by
      a health assistant according to bodyweight (a quarter of a tablet for those <5kg, a half for
      those 5-10 kg, and a whole tablet for children >10 kg). The tablets will be crashed and
      diluted with water for their administration.
