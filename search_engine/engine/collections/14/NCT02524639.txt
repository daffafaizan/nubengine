      channel hyperinsulinism (KATPHI) are limited and most of them require a near-total
      pancreatectomy to control the hypoglycemia. However, at least 40% of these children continue
      to have persistent hypoglycemia after surgery and their long-term outcomes are complicated by
      the development of diabetes.

      There is evidence that suggests that mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors are
      useful in controlling the hypoglycemia in hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia. But before adapting
      this as standard therapy for children with hyperinsulinism, a carefully controlled study of
      the efficacy and safety of sirolimus for hyperinsulinism is clearly needed.

      Sirolimus is an mTOR inhibitor, which is FDA-approved for the prophylaxis of organ rejection
      in patients age 13 years and older receiving kidney transplantation. This is an open label
      pilot study to assess the effect, safety and tolerability of sirolimus in infants with
      diazoxide-unresponsive HI due to mutations in the genes encoding the KATP channels. Subjects
      will be treated with sirolimus for 6 weeks.
