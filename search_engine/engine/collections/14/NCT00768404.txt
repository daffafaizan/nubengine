      multiple sites in the United States in which up to 40 male and female subjects, 19-75 years
      of age (inclusive), with varying degrees of renal function may be enrolled and dosed to
      obtain at least 32 evaluable subjects (4 groups, 8 subjects per group). Subjects will report
      to the study site on the evening before treatment and will remain at the site until the
      48-hour PK sample has been drawn (approximately 3 days). All subjects will be fasted
      overnight for a minimum of 8 hours before drug treatment in the morning. A single oral dose
      of the combination product VI-0521 (15 mg phentermine and 92 mg topiramate) will be
      administered with 240 mL of water at hour 0. Standard meals will be provided uniformly to all
      subjects at approximately 4 and 9 hours after dosing, and an evening snack will be provided
      approximately 12 - 13 hours after dosing. Blood samples for the determination of phentermine
      and topiramate concentrations in plasma will be collected at 0 (pre-dose), 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
      8, 9, 10, 12, 16, 24, 36 and 48 hours post dosing. Subjects will be released from the study
      site following the 48-hour sample but will return to the site for PK sampling at 72, 96, 120,
      144, 168 and 192 hours post dose. The severe renal impairment group will be given the option
      to stay at the site for the duration of the study.
