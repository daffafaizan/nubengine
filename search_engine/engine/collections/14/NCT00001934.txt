      system (CNS) that preferentially affects young adults. While its etiology is unknown, current
      concepts assume that CD4+ helper T cells with specificity for components of the myelin sheath
      initiate the pathogenetic process. The activation and expansion of such autoreactive T cells
      involves the secretion of autocrine growth factors, particularly interleukin-2 (IL-2), and
      the concomitant expression of its receptor, IL-2R, on the surface of T cells. Since only
      activated T lymphocytes can migrate through the blood brain barrier into the CNS and induce
      the inflammatory process, blocking the IL-2R should have an impact on disease activity in MS.

      In this trial , a humanized antibody against the IL-2Ra subunit (Zenapax(Registered
      Trademark)) will be used to inhibit T cell activation in MS patients who have failed
      conventional therapy by interferon-b. We will focus on the latter group of patients, since a
      substantial number of patients on conventional therapy respond only partially or completely
      fail treatment after longer periods of time. Up to 10 patients fulfilling these criteria will
      be enrolled in this baseline-to-treatment, cross-over, MRI-controlled single-center phase
      I/II trial to assess the safety of Zenapax(Registered Trademark) treatment and, at the same
      time, examine the clinical course and particularly the inflammatory activity in the CNS by
      monthly magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Furthermore, immunological studies will be
      performed in parallel to the trial in order to a) identify the impact of Zenapax(Registered
      Trademark) treatment on immune parameters that should be affected by the blocking of the
      IL-2R, and b) to improve our understanding of the relevance of activated autoreactive T
      lymphocytes in MS.
