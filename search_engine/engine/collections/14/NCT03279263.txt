      Pharmacological agents, such as metformin, Î±-glucosidase inhibitors, orlistat, and
      thiazolidinediones, have been shown to decrease incident diabetes. Metformin has the
      strongest evidence base and demonstrated long-term safety as pharmacological therapy for
      diabetes treatment. The American Diabetes association position statement on diabetes care
      recommends that if Hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) targets are not achieved after approximately 3
      months of metformin anti-diabetic monotherapy, a combination of metformin and one of several
      oral treatment options should be considered.

      In this study, subjects with a diagnosis of T2DM who are not adequately controlled (HbA1C
      between 7.0% and 10.0%, inclusive) and started metformin therapy at least 3 months prior to
      Screening will be recruited into the study. Subjects will continue taking metformin for the
      duration of the study and once daily oral MLR 1023 or placebo will be added to metformin.

      The efficacious dose-level range of MLR 1023 in diabetic subjects is anticipated to be
      between 25 and 100 mg. Therefore, the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of 25 mg and 50 mg
      doses in addition to the 100 mg dose that was shown to be effective in the Phase 2a proof of
      concept study will be assessed.
