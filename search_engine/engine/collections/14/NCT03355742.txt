      implantation in HBR patients. A minimum of 800 to a maximum of 960 subjects will be
      registered from approximately 50 sites globally and subject registration is capped at 120 per
      site. Eligibility of P2Y12 receptor inhibitor discontinuation will be assessed at 1-month
      follow-up. Subjects who are free from myocardial infarction (MI), repeat coronary
      revascularization, stroke, or stent thrombosis (ARC definite/probable) within 1 month (prior
      to 1-month visit but at least 28 days) after stenting and have been compliant with 1-month
      DAPT without interruption of either aspirin and/or P2Y12 receptor inhibitor for > 7
      consecutive days are considered as "1-month clear", and will discontinue P2Y12 receptor
      inhibitor as early as 28 days and continue with aspirin monotherapy through 12-month
      follow-up.

      All registered subjects will be followed at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months post index procedure. The
      data collected from the XIENCE 28 Global Study will be compared with the historical control
      of non-complex HBR subjects treated with standard DAPT up to 12 months from the XIENCE V USA
      Study .
