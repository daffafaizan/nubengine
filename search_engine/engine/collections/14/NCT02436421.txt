      Outpatient cardiology providers will be randomly allocated into one of three groups. The
      first group will receive the BPA for hypertension alone. The second group will receive the
      BPA for atrial fibrillation alone. The final group will receive both BPAs. The rate of blood
      pressure control for all patients and anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation in
      each group will be evaluated prior to and after the implementation of the BPAs to determine
      the effect of the BPA.
