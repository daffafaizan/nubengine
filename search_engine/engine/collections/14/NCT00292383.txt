      pacemaker patients. Pacing systems with only ventricular stimulation (VVI and VDD) have a
      fraction of about 40% of all pacemakers in Germany. About 50% of the implanted pacemakers in
      Germany are dual-chamber pacemakers and one half of them is used for treatment of AV blocks.

      A lot of studies proved in the past that the pacing site influenced the development of
      hemodynamics, heart failure (HF) and atrial fibrillation (AF). Unfortunately, the results are
      not commonly applicable or statistically assured. Due to this, further examinations are
      required in order to get explicit statements regarding application of alternative, nonapical
      ventricular lead positioning.

        1. Pilotphase It shall be determined whether a randomized positioning of ventricular leads
           at 2 defined positions (either Group A: Positioning at right ventricular apex or Group
           B:. Positioning at right ventricular high septum) is feasible. Included patients will
           already by examined and followed according to protocol. After having proved feasibility
           of randomized positioning, the data of these patients shall be used for evaluation of
           the V-PASS study.

        2. Study Phase It shall be evaluated how far 2 defined different ventricular lead positions
           for permanent pacemaker therapy can influence the combined study endpoint mortality and
           clinically relevant symptoms of heart failure. Further more the development of
           hemodynamics and the incidence of atrial fibrillation shall be studied.
