    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the 2-year progression-free survival of patients with advanced mantle cell
           lymphoma or indolent lymphoma treated with bortezomib, cladribine, and rituximab.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the 2-year overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the complete response and overall response rate in patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Describe the long- and short-term toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the prognostic importance of Aurora kinase A in patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine the cytokine profiles for each lymphoma subtype and how they change with this
           regimen.

        -  Evaluate the prognostic importance of major carcinogenic pathways using tissue
           microarray.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive bortezomib IV on days 1 and 4, cladribine IV over 2 hours on days
      1-5, and rituximab IV on day 1. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Blood samples are collected at baseline and after course 1 for cytokine profile studies.
      Previously collected tissue samples are obtained for analysis of Aurora kinase A and B,
      Ki-67, cyclin D, Bcl-2, phosphor-HisH3, c-Met, and VEGF expression by using tissue microarray
      (IHC staining), reverse transcriptase-PCR, and/or western blotting.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years.
