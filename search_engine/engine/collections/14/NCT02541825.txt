      ascites,which are the complications of cirrhosis. At present, the high incidence of hepatic
      encephalopathy has been a major problem after TIPS. The high incidence rate of hepatic
      encephalopathy was closly associated with the diameter of the stent. We often use the stent
      of diameter 8mm in TIPS.In this study, we try to use the stent of smaller diameter of 7mm in
      TIPS,and compare the incidence of hepatic encephalopathy between the stent of diameter of 7mm
      and 8mm .
