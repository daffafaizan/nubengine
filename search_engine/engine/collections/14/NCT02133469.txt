      study involving Chinese infants, Prevenar was shown to be immunogenic, well tolerated, and
      safe when given either separately or concomitantly with a diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular
      pertussis (DTaP) vaccine at 3, 4, and 5 months of age. Controlled clinical trials elsewhere
      in the world showed the correlation between immunogenicity and disease prevention. In
      addition to the direct effect of Prevenar, immunization of children has also reduced the
      incidence of disease in adults. The changes are presumed to be due to reductions in
      nasopharyngeal carriage of vaccine serotype S. pneumoniae in children who have been
      vaccinated.

      The purpose of this study will be to assess the effectiveness of Prevenar vaccination to
      reduce vaccine serotype (VT) NPC rates in Chinese children aged 2 to 5 years old.
