      screening options limits the effectiveness of CRC screening initiatives; as stated by Sidney
      Winawer, MD, "the best test is the one that gets done." Current CRC screening guidelines
      include FOBT, sigmoidoscopy (alone or with FOBT), or colonoscopy. Non-invasive screening is
      conducted using FOBT, which while inexpensive, exhibits a low compliance rate (around 16% in
      the US) due to its use restrictions, perceived inconvenience and lack of consumer acceptance.
      The gold standard procedure for CRC detection is colonoscopy; it exhibits excellent
      performance characteristics, but has a limited utility as a first line screen due to its high
      cost, healthcare delivery resource limitations, and inadequate patient acceptance. It is
      believed a noninvasive, first-line screening assay capable of detecting individuals with
      colorectal disease, confirmed by colonoscopy, would have greater utility for population
      screening.

      Epigenomics has identified methylated gene regions that are specific for colorectal cancer or
      pre-malignant tissue. Aberrantly methylated genes represent attractive candidate markers for
      cancer screening, as cancer-specific methylation changes occur early in tumorigenesis, appear
      to be stable, yield a positive amplifiable signal, and can be assayed with high analytical
      sensitivity. Since methylation occurs early and in distinct genomic areas, it is possible to
      achieve high clinical sensitivity with a small number of methylated DNA markers. Studies have
      shown that aberrantly methylated DNA markers can be detected in tissue and body fluids and
      are highly correlated to colorectal cancer.
