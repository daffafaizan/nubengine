      administration reduces the number or severity of nocturnal leg cramps, compared to placebo.
      Symptom diaries will be used throughout the study to assess frequency and severity of cramps.
      We will enroll a total of 70 men and women at least 50 years of age who have nocturnal leg
      cramps at least twice weekly and have previously received quinine for this. Those meeting
      baseline laboratory criteria and who report at least two leg cramps per week in a two-week
      "diary run-in" period will be randomized to vitamin D or placebo. Baseline, mid-study, and
      final laboratory testing will assess any changes in 25-hydroxyvitamin D(OHD) and related
      variables (25-hydroxyvitamin D is the best measure of vitamin D status.) The time from the
      beginning of the diary run-in through the final dose of drug and last labs,will be about 14
      weeks.

      Optimal vitamin D status for health is unknown, although many experts aim for serum
      25-hydroxyvitamin D of 35-40 ng/ml. Subjects in this study randomized to vitamin D will take
      a vitamin D capsule (50,000 units) once daily for 10 days, followed by a once weekly vitamin
      D (50,000 units) maintenance dose for 7 weeks. Based on published literature on the ability
      of vitamin D to raise serum 25-OHD over time, we estimate that the loading doses will "boost"
      levels after 10 days by an increment of ~40ng/ml (up to ~65 ng/mL total, starting with a
      typical person's baseline of 25ng/ml). This achieved level of 65 is within the reference
      range of our VA's reference range of 20-100. (In the PI's experience, most veterans without
      special D supplementation have baseline levels between 15 and 40).
