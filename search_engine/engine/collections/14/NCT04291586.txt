      schizophrenia, depression, etc. and are not always given sufficient attention despite its
      limitations in activities of daily living (ADL's). Current cognitive rehabilitation methods
      mostly rely on paper-and-pencil tasks targeting isolated domains, which is not consistent
      with everyday life, and have limited ecological validity.

      Virtual Reality (VR) has shown to be a solution for the development of accessible and
      ecologically valid systems but, does it have more impact than a paper and pencil personalized
      intervention?

      Through a participatory design approach, with health professionals, the investigators have
      developed:

      a motor-accessible and cognitive-personalized VR-based system, where conventional cognitive
      tasks were operationalized in meaningful simulations of ADL's (Reh@City) and; a web tool
      which generates personalized paper and pencil tasks (Task Generator).

      The investigators goal is to have a sample of 30 inpatients from a psychosocial
      rehabilitation unit, with no age limit, randomly allocated in two groups: 1) the experimental
      group, where participants will perform 30 minutes of the VR training with Reh@City; and 2)
      the control group, where participants will perform 30 minutes of the paper and pencil
      training with the Task Generator.
