      Anterior chamber depth (ACD) and width (ACW), lens vault (LV), ciliary process-ciliary
      process distance(CCD), trabecular-ciliary processes distance (TCPD), ciliary body max
      thickness (CBMT), peripheral iris thickness (PIT), trabecular ciliary process angle (TCPA),
      and anterior vault (AV), were measured by ultrasound biomicroscopy. Other parameters measured
      by A-scan ultrasonography and optical coherence tomography.
