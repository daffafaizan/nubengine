      aging and disease is becoming a frequently encountered health challenge. In our proposed
      study, we will investigate the effects of mindfulness-based interventions (MBI), which have
      shown significant promise in halting and even reversing age-related cognitive impairment. MBI
      enhances the quality and frequency of mindfulness, defined as a mental state achieved by
      focusing one's attention and awareness on the present moment, while calmly acknowledging and
      accepting one's feelings, thoughts, and bodily sensations. In this study, we will administer
      a standardized MBI program or Cognitive Rehabilitation Therapy to a group of 60 patients
      diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a condition marked by deficits in language,
      memory and attention that often leads to dementia; an additional 30 patients will be assigned
      to the control group. There will be 3 runs with 30 persons per run; each group will have 10
      randomly assigned participants. By comparing the 3 groups across the 3 runs, we seek to test
      the following hypotheses: 1) MBI will result in significantly greater improvements in
      neuropsychological testing outcomes across multiple cognitive domains, including attention,
      memory, language and processing speed, 2) MBI will strengthen cortical connectivity as
      measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and 3) MBI will lead to changes in
      fMRI activation on a test of facets of attention. Neuropsychological testing will take place
      in SGH, while fMRI and EEG scanning will take place in the Center for Cognitive Neuroscience
      at Duke-NUS. Both the MBI and CRT will be facilitated by trained personnel. Our proposed
      experiment comprises one of the most comprehensive interrogations of the effects of MBT on
      patients to date, and if successful, could rapidly translate into a program with both
      clinical and economic impact.
