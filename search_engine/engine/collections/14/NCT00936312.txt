      treatment of each participant to be completed by a staff member; the other is a questionnaire
      to be completed by the participant on how the disease has affected her life. Finally, for
      those participants who have not previously had genetic testing, the third part of the study
      is an optional blood test to determine the genetic cause, what change in the factor VIII or
      factor IX gene, caused the hemophilia. The test results will be available to those
      participants who wish to learn their results. With the data we collect we will compile a
      database to examine the connection between the genetic cause of hemophilia and the course and
      symptoms of the disease.
