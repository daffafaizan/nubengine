      for about 2.6% of all pediatric neoplasms, it predominantly occurs in the extremities, with a
      peak incidence in the second decade of life.

      In Upper Egypt, we have a higher proportion of the population in underdeveloped communities
      with limited access to medical care so the patients usually seek medical advice at advanced
      stage leading to a higher prevalence of metastatic disease at initial presentation, as well
      as a greater proportion of larger tumor size that more likely to be associated with potential
      adverse risk criteria prior to surgery.

      A previous study from Upper Egypt showed that a metastatic disease at diagnosis was
      independently correlated to a dismal outcome. Since the effect of many other factors of
      prognostic significance, such as, gender, age, tumor location and response to chemotherapy
      may have been mitigated by the large effect of the metastatic disease on the prognosis; So,
      here, we will analyze the data of 30 patients with non-metastatic osteosarcoma of the
      extremities, to determine prognostic factors associated with survival, and also to develop a
      model for a better prediction of factors correlated to that a certain surgical approach was
      employed in these patients based on their baseline clinical data and the tumor response to
      chemotherapy.

      Patients & Methods We will carry out a retrospective analysis of data assembled from medical
      records of 30 pediatric patients with a histologically-verified non-metastatic osteosarcoma
      of the extremities treated at South Egypt Cancer Institute with a unified chemotherapy
      protocol between January 2001 and December 2015. These data will be categorized according to
      demographic data, clinical characteristics, tumor response to chemotherapy, and surgical
      methods employed in these patients. Prognostic factors will be determined using univariable
      and multivariable methods. A predictive model for surgical outcomes in these patients based
      on the baseline clinical factors, and their tumor response to chemotherapy will be developed.
