        -  To use fixed lung tissue for histological evaluation and fresh tissue samples for
           molecular studies to study DNA, RNA, and protein abnormalities in lung preneoplastic and
           neoplastic lesions.

        -  To use proteomic techniques, including matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-mass
           spectrometry (MALDI-MS), to develop a method of diagnosing and staging both pre-invasive
           and invasive lesions, using less invasive methods.

      OUTLINE: Blood, urine, nasal cell, and sputum samples are collected. Lung tissue samples are
      also collected using fluorescence bronchoscopy and epithelial cell collection.

      Samples are studied by genetic and proteomic analyses, including comparative genomic
      hybridization, expression microarray, and protein profiling.
