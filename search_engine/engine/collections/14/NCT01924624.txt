      analyzed. Both preoperative and adjuvant transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) were
      found to be unable to reduce the risk of postoperative recurrence significantly, or confer a
      survival advantage. Vitamin K (VK) is a fat-soluble vitamin that regulates clotting factor
      production by acting as a coenzyme for a VK dependent carboxylase that catalyzes
      carboxylation of glutamic acid residues into gamma-carboxyglutamic acid. The findings in
      vitro have indicated that VK2 has an antiproliferative effects against hepatoma cell lines,
      but its efficacy in suppressing HCC recurrence was not confirmed in human studies. Interferon
      has a variety of biologic properties, including antiviral, immunomodulatory,
      antiproliferative, antiangiogenic and tumoricidal effects. It is reported that interferon is
      effective in preventing the development of HCC recurrence after its curative treatment in
      HCV-related cirrhosis. However, interferon treatment also has side-effects, including
      flu-like symptoms, fatigue, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, depression, bone marrow
      suppression, and unmasking or exacerbation of autoimmune illnesses, which lead either to
      treatment disruption or dose modification. Polyprenoic acid, an acyclic retinoid, reportedly
      is effective in prevention of second primary hepatomas, but long-term safety and efficacy
      data are lacking.

      Thalidomide possesses immunomodulatory,anti-inflammatory, and antiangiogenic properties.It
      has successfully been applied for the treatment of various malignancies including HCC.To
      investigated whether postoperative adjuvant therapy with Thalidomide could inhibite the
      recurrence of HCC after radical resection,we planed to conduct this clinical trial.
