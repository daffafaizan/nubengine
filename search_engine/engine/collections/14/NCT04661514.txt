      nervosa, a disorder with high chronicity, many individuals seek out alternative approaches to
      care. Recent evidence has suggested that anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder, and
      diminished reward or motivation play key roles in the development and maintenance of
      dysfunctional eating, and poor outcome. In recent years, a growing number of studies have
      demonstrated the safety and preliminary efficacy of psilocybin in clinical trials for a range
      of psychiatric illnesses including treatment resistant depression, obsessive compulsive
      disorder, addiction, and anxiety. Psilocybin may represent a promising new treatment for
      anorexia nervosa. However, no studies have tested psilocybin in this eating disorder
      population. Accordingly, this study aims to establish the safety, tolerability and dosing of
      psilocybin in adult patients with anorexia nervosa, as well as gather pilot data on possible
      efficacy.

      For this study, the investigators will recruit adults who currently have a DSM-V diagnosis of
      anorexia nervosa. Participants will undergo medical and psychological screening and those who
      are deemed eligible will partake in a maximum of 7 study visits, lasting from 4-8 weeks. On
      dosing day, participants will receive a single 25 mg dose of psilocybin along with
      psychotherapeutic support, which includes preparation and integration sessions surrounding
      the experience. There will be a follow-up period of one month following the psilocybin
      session during which a range of psychological measures (questionnaires and interviews) will
      be collected.
