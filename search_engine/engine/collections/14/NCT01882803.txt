    
      This is an open-label, single arm safety and efficacy study of duvelisib administered orally
      to subjects who have been diagnosed with iNHL (Follicular Lymphoma, Marginal Zone Lymphoma,
      or Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma) whose disease is refractory to rituximab and to either
      chemotherapy or RIT.

      Approximately 120 subjects will receive 25 mg duvelisib BID over the course of 28-day
      treatment cycles for up to 13 cycles.

      After completing 13 treatment cycles of duvelisib, subjects may continue to receive
      additional cycles of duvelisib until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. However,
      to receive additional cycles of duvelisib beyond 13 cycles, subjects must have evidence of
      response (CR or PR) according to the IWG criteria1 by the end of Cycle 13.
