    
      Patients going on the waiting list for TKR at our hospital will be enrolled prospectively.

      Each patient will have two radiographs preoperatively. One radiograph will be the novel HKAH
      radiograph to measure the alignment of the heel to the whole leg and the other will be the
      HAV radiograph which will be used as the standard to which the HKAH measure of alignment will
      be compared. The HKAH radiograph will be taken instead of the standard care HKA radiograph
      and the HAV is additional to standard care.

      Each participant will receive an information sheet along with the outpatients appointment
      letter which is dispatched approximately a week in advance of their appointment date. This
      will carry information about the study, and the risks (one additional radiograph).

      Participants who are going to have a knee replacement will have a written & informed consent
      to take part in the study. If they agree then they will have an additional radiograph before
      surgery. If they don't agree then they will have a single radiograph before surgery as is the
      norm in our hospital.

      Whether they take part or not will have absolutely no bearing on the treatment they receive,
      or the aftercare.
