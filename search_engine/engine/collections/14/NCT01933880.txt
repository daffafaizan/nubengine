      following participants forward in time), self-controlled, long-term post-marketing study in
      participants with ADHD. The study consists of 3 periods: screening period, wash-out

      into 2 periods that is dosage adjustment period and dose-optimization period. The total
      duration of the study is 12 weeks. During the dosage adjustment period, the dose of
      methylphenidate hydrochloride was adjusted to the optimal dose within 1-3 weeks starting with
      initial dosage of 18 milligram per day (mg/d) which can be increased to 36 mg/d up to a
      maximum dosage of 54 mg/d according to the therapeutic effect and tolerance or maintained at
      36 mg or re-adjusted to 18 mg due to intolerance. Participants will receive the optimal dose
      determined during dose adjustment period for 9 weeks during the dose-optimization period. In
      the study, 2 types of participants will be enrolled in 2 groups (according to condition):
      OROS-MPH group (participants with ADHD) and the normal children group (healthy participants).
      The efficacy will be assessed primarily by Digit Span Test and Inattention /Over activity
      With Aggression (IOWA) Conners evaluation scale. Participants' safety will be monitored
      throughout the study.
