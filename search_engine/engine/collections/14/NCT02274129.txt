      healing cap has the same function as previous healing caps, but it soft instead of hard. Due
      to this, the healing cap is anticipated to not fall off as easily, but at the same time does
      not risk transferring larger forces than previously to the implant. Secondly, the patients
      will start using the sound processor 1-2 weeks after surgery. The implant stability will be
      monitored before and after loading by the use of resonance frequency analysis, an established
      method to evaluate and monitor osseointegrated implants.
