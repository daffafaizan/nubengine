      nature. Epileptic seizures are caused by abnormal brain cell firing. Nonepileptic seizures
      appear similar to epileptic seizures, but are associated with traumatic experiences and
      underlying psychological stressors. Both types of seizure are common and disabling, and many
      patients with seizures do not have adequate control resulting in loss of quality of life.

      In this proposed 3-site study ( Providence, RI and Birmingham, AL), which are epilepsy
      centers with expertise both in epilepsy and psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES), we will
      enroll 88 patients with video-EEG confirmed PNES and 88 with confirmed post-traumatic
      epilepsy (PTE) and will obtain functional neuroimaging before and after they receive a
      behavioral treatment - Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Seizures. The functional neuroimaging
      studies in these patients will be compared to patients with traumatic brain injury without
      seizures to test the hypothesis that the faulty processing of emotions and stress in patients
      with PNES/PTE and abnormal brain connectivity have unique signals in patients with seizures
      compared to Veterans without seizures and that the neuroimaging signatures can be modified
      using behavioral intervention.

      Impact: This grant application for the first study investigating mechanisms of PNES and PTE
      will provide increased understanding of neural circuitry in PTE and PNES, which can inform
      PTE and PNES treatments and could change clinical neurologic and psychiatric practice for PTE
      and PNES.

      Participants will be recruited at the Providence VA Medical Center, Rhode Island Hospital,
      and University of Alabama, Birmingham (UAB).
