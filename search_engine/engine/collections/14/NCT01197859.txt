      comparison with a currently marketed silicone hydrogel: BiofinityÂ® (CooperVision). This is a
      3-month, open-label, bilateral, parallel group, randomised, daily wear study. Approx.
      two-thirds of the subjects will wear the Contamac Silicone Hydrogel lens in both eyes while
      the other third will wear control lenses.
