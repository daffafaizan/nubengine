      visit, a three-week wash-in period (one week with each of the three different size pen
      needles) followed by two consecutive 12 week study periods. The purpose of the three week
      wash-in period is to minimize the number of dropouts during the following study periods by
      ensuring that subjects have experience using each of the three study needles and find them
      generally acceptable for use during the study.

      Only subjects who complete the wash-in period and confirm their agreement to continue
      participating will be randomized into one of the two study arms. Subjects will be randomly
      assigned to use the BD Ultra-Fine™ 4mm pen needle and either the BD Ultra-Fine™ 8mm pen
      needle or the BD Ultra-Fine™ 12.7mm pen needle. The randomization will also specify which of
      the two study pen needles to be used first. Half of the study subjects will use the BD
      Ultra-Fine™ 4mm and BD Ultra-Fine™ 8mm pen needles (4mm/8mm arm) and the other half will use
      the BD Ultra-Fine™ 4mm and the BD Ultra-Fine™ 12.7mm pen needles (4mm/12.7mm arm). At the end
      of the first 12 week study period subjects will switch to the other assigned pen needle for
      the second and final study period.

      Glycemic control (based on HbA1c concentrations) will be assessed at baseline and at the end
      of each 12 week study period.
