      North America. Information on FMT methodology employed (e.g., screening of donor and
      recipient, preparation, FMT delivery) will be collected from each site. The indication for
      FMT as well as baseline information on recipient will also be collected. Following FMT,
      patients will be followed at regular intervals up to 10 years post FMT. This will include
      follow-up information from the patient's healthcare provider at 1 month, 6 months, 1 year,
      and 2 years after FMT as well as direct communication with patients at least annually up to
      10 years after FMT. Follow-up information collected will be designed to assess potential
      short-term and long-term safety and effectiveness.
