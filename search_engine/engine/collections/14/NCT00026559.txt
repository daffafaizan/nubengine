      short-duration response evoked by explicit threat cues and anxiety a more sustained state of
      apprehension evoked by unpredictable threat. This protocol studied fear using Pavlovian fear
      conditioning in two studies. Studies 1 and 3. Study 2 focused on anxiety. Studies 1 and 3
      will be discontinued to focus uniquely on the study of anxiety. Specifically, we will examine
      the interactions between anxiety induced experimentally using verbal threat and cognitive
      processes. We will seek to 1) characterize the effect of anxiety on key cognitive processes
      including working memory and attention control and 2) examine the extent to which performance
      of cognitive tasks distract from anxiety.

      Study population: This more-than-minimal-risk protocol will test medically and
      psychiatrically healthy volunteers aged 18-50. Pregnant or nursing women will be excluded.

      Method: Fear and anxiety will be measured using the startle reflex to brief and loud sounds.
      Fear conditioning will be assessed using shock as unconditioned stimulus. Cognitive
      performance will be examined during periods of unpredictable shock anticipation.

      Outcome measures: The study will include cognitive performance and measure of aversive
      states, primarily the startle reflex.
