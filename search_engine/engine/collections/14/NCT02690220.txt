      obtain usability and postmarket information on the TiLOOP® pelvic floor reconstruction meshes
      and in particular to obtain the improvement of patients' quality of life.

      It is expected that the patient's quality of life is meliorated after implantation of a
      TiLOOP® PRO A mesh. To verify this, it will be shown that by means of a validated
      questionnaire the subjective quality of life after 12 months is significantly better than
      before implantation.
