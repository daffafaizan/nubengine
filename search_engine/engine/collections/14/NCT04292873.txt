      higher sepsis-related mortality. The preliminary results of 145 ICU patients of the Northern
      Medical Centers in Taiwan in our ongoing multicenter clinical trial showed that the mean
      calcifediol concentration was about 20.9 ng/mL, much lower than the normal value of 30-60
      ng/ml. An Austrian randomized clinical trial has shown that supplementation of high-dose
      vitamin D in critically ill patients with vitamin D deficiency can reduce patient mortality,
      so it is important to treat critically ill patients with vitamin D deficiency. At present,
      there is no clinical reference data on how much the concentration of calcifediol in the blood
      increases after supplementing with vitamin D for Taiwanese ICU patients. This study aims to
      investigate the effects of enteral supplementation of vitamin D in critically ill patients
      with vitamin D deficiency. The results of the study are expected to provide clinical
      reference data to intensivists to select adequate dosage of vitamin D supplementation for
      their patients with vitamin D deficiency.

      This is a multi-center, randomized clinical trial. ICU patients will receive vitamin D level
      examination. If the subject's blood calcifediol concentration is less than 20 ng / mL, the
      subject will be included in this clinical trial. Patients who are suitable to enteral
      supplement of vitamin D will be randomly divided to group Control (no vitamin D supplement)
      and group Vitamin D (enteral supplement of 569,600 IU vitamin D). The vitamin D level will be
      measures at specific time points. The patients' diagnosis, vital signs, laboratory data,
      30-day survival, and 90-day survival will be recorded.
