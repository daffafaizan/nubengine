    
      muscle precursor cells (MPCs) will be isolated from biopsies of the lower leg of patients,
      seeded, expanded and cultivated in vitro in a GMP facility to generate vital muscle cells
      dedicated for implantation.

      These muscle cells exhibit myogenic phenotype (IHC and flow cytometry) and therefore
      morphological and histological prerequisites approximating the properties of native skeletal
      muscle tissue. The muscle progenitor cells shall be applied in external sphincter muscle for
      the treatment of patients with stress urinary incontinence.
