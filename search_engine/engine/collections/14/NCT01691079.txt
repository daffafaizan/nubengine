      mechanisms of asthma appear to be different between athletes and non-athletes, in that the
      occurrence of asthma is higher among endurance athletes and seems to be promoted by training.
      This suggests that factors inherent to athleticism, such as the parasympathetic nervous
      system, which has been shown to change with endurance training and is known to lead to
      narrowing of the airways, may be involved with the development of asthma in athletes.
      Although asthma mechanisms and treatments have been extensively studied in classic
      asthmatics, there is very limited data in athletes.

      This will be a double-blind placebo-controlled study in which we plan to study 40 competitive
      endurance athletes. We will conduct an exercise test to evaluate maximal oxygen uptake and 2
      exercise challenge tests to provoke EIA. Prior to the exercise challenge tests the athletes
      will randomly receive inhaled placebo or inhaled ipratropium bromide. We will compare the
      athletes' airway response to the exercise challenge with and without the active drug.

      If ipratropium bromide proves to prevent EIA in athletes, this drug may be appropriate and
      effective to target EIA in this population. The results of this study may lead to improved
      clinical management of athletes with asthma.
