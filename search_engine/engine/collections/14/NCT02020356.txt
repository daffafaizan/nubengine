      university hospital of Montpellier: the "U" sequence. The musical sequence lasts 20 minutes
      and is made up of several phases that progressively induce a relaxed state in the patient.
      This effect is obtained by modulating the rhythm of the music, the orchestral formation,
      frequencies and volume. The phase of maximum relaxation is followed by a stimulating phase.
      These musical sequences have been specially designed by the music publishers Music CareÂ©.
