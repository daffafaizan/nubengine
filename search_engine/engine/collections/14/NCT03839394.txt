      receive either a series of educational pamphlets on CVD risk reduction plus a telephone-based
      CVD risk reduction curriculum delivered over 24 weeks [intervention arm], or the educational
      pamphlets alone [control arm]. Anthropomorphic data, blood pressure and lipid profiles will
      be obtained from patients to assess the efficacy of the intervention in reducing blood
      pressure and serum low-density lipoprotein levels (LDL).
