      represents participants exposed to risk based conventional protocol, (A2) represents
      participants exposed to chlorhexidine containing varnish and risk based conventional
      preventive protocol. The study will be carried over a period of 10 months (one academic
      year), the study will be divided into three phases Phase I: Information of the Cariogram
      parameters (caries experience, diet content, diet frequency, plaque amount, mutans
      streptococci, fluoride program, saliva secretion and saliva buffer capacity) will be
      collected, which will be used to generate the individual caries profile, based on which the
      participants will be divided into 2 risks groups. Phase II: Risk based preventive program
      will be implemented including the restorative part. Phase III: At the end of 10 months,
      caries profile will be generated again
