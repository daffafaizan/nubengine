      hypoxia has been shown to be associated with a poor prognosis and an increase in resistance
      to chemotherapy and radiotherapy (Brizel 1997, Vaupel 2007, Shannon 2003).

      It is likely that an agent that could effectively target hypoxic regions in tumors would
      improve efficacy when combined with standard chemotherapy or radiotherapy. TH-302 is
      activated at lower oxygen concentrations than other bioreductive prodrugs (Duan 2008) and
      tirapazamine, a hypoxic cytotoxin that has been extensively studied in both preclinical and
      clinical studies. This should result in an improved therapeutic ratio (tumor vs normal tissue
      toxicity) as compared with other bioreductive agents. Because TH-302 is expected to be
      minimally toxic to aerobic cancer cells, optimal efficacy would be expected when TH-302 is
      combined with treatments that are most effective under aerobic conditions such as
      radiotherapy and cytotoxic chemotherapy. Preclinical data have shown at least additive
      efficacy when TH-302 is combined with chemotherapy. In order to minimize the risk of additive
      toxicity, TH-302 is not being evaluated in combination with alkylating agents. The study will
      enroll subjects with advanced soft tissue sarcoma. These tumors have evidence supporting the
      presence of hypoxia based on pO2 histography, F-MISO and gene expression profiling (Vaupel
      2007, Francis 2007, Rajendran 2003).
