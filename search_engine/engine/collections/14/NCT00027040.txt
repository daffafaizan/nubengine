      disease. This study proposes to non-invasively examine the pattern and extent of cerebral
      injury associated with HIV infection and its response to selegiline by using 1H-MRS. The
      following hypotheses will be tested: selegiline, a compound with antioxidant and
      anti-apoptotic properties, will reverse the metabolic abnormalities measured by 1H-MRS, and
      these changes will parallel the degree of improvement in cognitive and functional
      performance.

      This is a substudy of ACTG A5090. The pattern and extent of cerebral injury associated with
      HIV infection and its response to selegiline are examined using a 1H-MRS. 1H-MRS evaluations
      are performed at screening and Week 24 (or at the time of premature discontinuation) of Step
      1 of A5090. The screening MRS exams may only be performed once all A5090 screening
      evaluations (including the lumbar puncture) have been completed and it has been determined
      that the patient is eligible for A5090 study entry.

      The screening MRS must be performed prior to A5090 study drug administration. The Week-24 MRS
      must be performed while the patient is still on blinded study drug.
