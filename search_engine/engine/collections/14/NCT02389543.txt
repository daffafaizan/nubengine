    
      In Phase 1 (Dose Escalation), patients will be randomized to either once-weekly (Arm A) or
      twice- weekly (Arm B) dosing with selinexor. Dose escalation will be performed within each
      arm for both lenalidomide and selinexor to determine the selinexor MTD for that arm. Each arm
      will be expanded until approximately 17 patients have been treated at the MTD in each arm.
      The Sponsor and Investigator will review the MTD, efficacy, and safety data from Phase 1 to
      determine which dose schedule (Arm A or B) to be used as the RP2D dose in the Expansion
      Phase.

      In Phase 2 (Expansion), patients who had received the MTD dose that was nominated for RP2D
      will continue at the same dose. Patients who did not receive the RP2D for that arm will stay
      on their Phase 1 dose. Additional patients will be accrued, as needed, to achieve the target
      population size of approximately 34 patients at the RP2D.
