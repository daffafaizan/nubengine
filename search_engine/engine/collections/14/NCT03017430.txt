      Eighty patients admitted to an inpatient addiction treatment program will be randomly
      assigned to two groups. The first group (N=40) receives up to 600 mg a day of Pregabalin for
      six days along with symptomatic therapy that is divided into basic treatment that is given to
      all patients (Doxylamin 30 mg/day) and additional medications based on patients' needs as
      determined by a psychiatrist using the Opioid Withdrawal Scale and included Ketorolac,
      Loperamide, Metoclopramide, Nefazolin and Phenazepam (benzodiazepine). The second group (N=
      40) receives up to 600 micrograms of Clonidine a day as the main treatment along with the
      same basic and symptomatic regimen. Opiate withdrawal severity, craving, sleep disturbance,
      anxiety and depression, as well as general clinical impressions and side effects are assessed
      daily by psychiatrists who are blind to patients' group assignment using internationally
      validated quantitative psychometric instruments.
