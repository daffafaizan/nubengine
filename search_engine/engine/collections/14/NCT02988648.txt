        1. To evaluate the feasibility of using 124I- PET/CT scans to identify patients whose
           metastatic lesions accumulate radioactive iodide and therefore are candidates for 131I-
           therapy.

        2. Determine the frequency of iodide (124I) enriching metastatic breast cancer.

        3. Evaluate the safety and clinical activity of one-time 131I treatment to patients who
           screen positive on 124I- PET/CT screening, positivity is defined as calculated iodide
           enrichment that will allow delivering 2000 cGy or more radiation to one or more
           metastatic lesion by administering up to 200mCi 131I-.

      The secondary objectives of the study are as follows:

      1. To investigate a correlation between NIS expression in tumor tissue with 124I- uptake on
      screening PET/CT scan

      The Phase I portion will follow a 3+3 design with 4 dose levels (30, 60, 120, and 200 mCi) of
      I- treatment. The maximum tolerated dose will be used in the Phase II efficacy assessment
      which will follow a Simon's optimal two-stage design. The primary efficacy measure is
      objective tumor response rate (CR or PR) with targeted activity level of > 20% response rate.

      The study will be terminated for futility if no tumor response is seen in the first 12
      patients. If futility criteria is not met, a total of 37 eligible patients will be enrolled
      in the Phase II portion. If 4 or more responses are seen after 37 patients were evaluated,
      then the investigators will conclude that the regimen warrants further study.
