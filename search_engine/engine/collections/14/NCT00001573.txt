    
      SU101 is a member of a novel class of antineoplastic agents, platelet-derived growth factor
      (PDGF) receptor inhibitors. Preclinical data suggests that SU101 might be an effective agent
      against neuroglial tumors as well as a variety of sarcomas. A pediatric phase I trial of
      SU101 in children with these malignancies will be conducted to find the maximum tolerated
      dose of SU101 and define the toxicity profile of this agent. In addition, we will define the
      pharmacokinetics of SU101 and its active metabolite SU0020 in pediatric patients and gather
      preliminary information regarding response.
