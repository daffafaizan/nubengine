      development (complete stent expansion and apposition and lack of edge dissection or other
      complications after implantation), and the size of the vessel undergoing stent implantation.
      The novel 60 megahertz(60MHz) high-definition IVUS has evolved as a next-generation IVUS
      imaging technology to provide higher image resolution than conventional 40 megahertz(40MHz)
      IVUS but with sufficient imaging depth preserved for the assessment of the entire vessel wall
      structure.

      InSight Lifetech IVUS system is a novel device with high-speed and high-resolution, including
      TrueVisionTM intravascular ultrasound diagnostic catheter and VivoHeartTM intravascular
      ultrasound diagnostic device, and its higher image acquisition rate also enables high-speed
      pullback imaging at up to 10mm/sec. This study is a prospective, multi-center, randomized,
      single-blind, controlled study with the purpose of the differences, if any, between IVUS
      measurement by the InSight Lifetech IVUS system and Boston Scientific IVUS system whose
      imaging catheter is conventional 40MHz. The secondary purpose is to analyze the feasibility
      of high-speed pullback in the assessment of IVUS. A total of 125 patients will be recruited
      at 6 centers in China.
