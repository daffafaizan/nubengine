      supplements can help reduce pain and also reduce the need for pain medications for some
      people. We will ask about 100 people to participate. All of them will get a low-fat, vegan
      diet and a nutritional supplement (mixture of omega-3 oils and vitamin E or a placebo),
      although some will get the diet first, and others will get the supplement first. This order
      in which they will get the diet and the supplement will be determined randomly, that is, by
      chance (like the toss of a coin). The principal measures are pain as measured by Visual
      Analog Scale (VAS)and the change in migraines frequency.
