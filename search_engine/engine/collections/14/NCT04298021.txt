      patients who have failed to 1st-line chemotherapy. Patients will be enrolled to AZD6738 and
      Durvalumab combination or AZD6738 and Olaparib combination cohorts. Based on the new emerging
      therapies, cohorts can be added into existing protocol.

        1. AZD6738 + Durvalumab cohort:

             -  Durvalumab 1500 mg iv on D1

             -  AZD6738 240 mg bid on D15-D28 Every 4 weeks C1D1 dose of durvalumab will be
                delivered, and AZD6738 of 240 mg bid will be dosed at D15-D28. Every cycle consists
                of 4 weeks.

        2. AZD6738 + Olaparib cohort:

             -  AZD6738 160 mg qd on D1-D7

             -  Olaparib 300 mg bid on D1-D28 Every 4 weeks Every cycle consists of 4 weeks.
                AZD6738 of 160 mg qd will be administered on D1-D7. Olaparib will be delivered as
                300 mg bid dose on D1-D28.

      One cycle consists of 4weeks. Response evaluation will be done every 8 weeks (every 2 cycles)
      of treatment

        1. tumor biopsy is mandatory : screening, after 8weeks (1st-response evaluation), at
           disease progression (PD)

        2. blood sampling for biomarker study is mandatory: every cycles

        3. To evaluate the metabolic changes, 18 F-FDG PET is mandatory at screening and after 8
           weeks (1st-response evaluation).
