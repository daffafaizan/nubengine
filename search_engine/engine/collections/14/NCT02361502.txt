      major drug for the treatment of overactive bladder symptoms, muscarinic receptor antagonists
      are used, but precautions should be taken by a specialist when using muscarinic receptor
      antagonists due to possibilities of dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision and post-dose
      dysuria and acute ischuria. Mirabegron is a selective Î²3-adrenoceptor agonist that relax the
      detrusor smooth muscle and increase functional bladder capacity to improve overactive bladder
      symptoms. This study will examine the efficacy and safety of mirabegron, a new drug, for
      improvement of urinary frequency.

      The efficacy of mirabegron compared to the placebo has been demonstrated by the phase III
      study, but the analysis of only patients in Korea has not obtained significant difference
      from the placebo. The prevalence of overactive bladder was 9.7% in men and 11.6% in women,
      which showed similar rates 1), but the cure rate is higher in men than in women (OR 1.891, CI
      1.362, 2.2627, p=0.0001). Male patients are important customers for the OAB market and
      low-dose anticholinergic agents with relatively low risk of urinary retention are preferred
      for the treatment of male overactive bladder (OAB) in Korea. We will conduct this clinical
      study because we think mirabegron will be an alternative for the therapy for male OAB
      patients with a risk of urinary retention.
