    
      This study is a prospective, subject-masked, bilateral, randomized, parallel group dispensing
      study comparing the SHSCL test lens against the 1-Month ACUVUE® VITA™ (1-MAV) control lenses.
      Each subject will be randomized to wear either the test or of the control with
      similar/comparable lens parameters optimized for vision.

      Both test and control lens will be used in their daily wear, monthly replacement modality for
      thirteen (13) weeks. It is anticipated that this study will involve up to 6 scheduled visits.
