      to correct the position or movement of the sacroiliac joint.

      The muscle-energy technique consists of the therapist correcting the sacroiliac joint while
      the participant is applying active resistance.

      For the placebo manipulation, participants will receive a false manipulation over the
      affected joint, without producing movement at the sacroiliac joint.
