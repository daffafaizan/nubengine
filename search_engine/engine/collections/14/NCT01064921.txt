      I. To determine the maximally tolerated dose of Vorinostat in combination with concurrent
      chemoradiotherapy for the treatment of advance stage OPSCC.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      l. To determine the complete response rate, overall survival and progression free survival
      using the maximally tolerated dose of Vorinostat.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess treatment related acute and late toxicities when combining Vorinostat with
      chemoradiation and correlate these toxicities to molecular markers of apoptosis in tumor and
      normal oral mucosa.

      II. To evaluate the effect of Vorinostat on tumor immune surveillance, particularly in HPV
      positive patients.

      III. To illustrate that Vorinostat alters the methylation status of commonly methylated genes
      in OPSCC.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of vorinostat. Patients receive oral vorinostat on
      days 0-2 and cisplatin IV on days 7, 21, and 35. Patients undergo radiotherapy 5 days a week
      beginning on day 7. Patients also receive concurrent oral vorinostat along with the
      radiotherapy to be given 3 days per week (Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday). Treatment
      continues for 7 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.
