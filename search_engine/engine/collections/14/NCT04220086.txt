    
      Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by deÔ¨Åcits in
      social interactions and communication skills, both verbal and non-verbal, restricted
      interests, and stereotypical behaviors. However, at present, there is no drug has proven
      effective in alleviating the core symptoms of social and communication difficulties in ASD.

      ASD families are becoming turn to complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). They use CAM
      to treat symptoms of autism in general, comorbid symptoms (such as attention, hyperactivity,
      irritability, moodiness, gastrointestinal symptoms, seizures, sleep and tactile sensitivity).
      In addition, some families report that the use of CAM has less negative side effects compared
      with conventional treatments.

      As a traditional TCM therapy, pediatric massage has been used in treating various pediatric
      diseases including ASD. A large number of clinical studies have shown that pediatric massage
      can improve ASD and its accompanied symptoms effectively. However, its exact effectiveness
      and mechanism need to be further explored.

      In the proposed study, pediatric massage will be employed to treat children with ASD, to
      confirm the effectiveness and safety of pediatric massage therapy for children with ASD, and
      to explore the potential mechanism and target of pediatric massage for ASD.
