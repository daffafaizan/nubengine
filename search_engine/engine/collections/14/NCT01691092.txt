    
      Aim 1: To determine the acute effect of medication-induced glutamate release on mGluR5
      availability in human subjects. Hypothesis 1: We hypothesize administration of ketamine or
      n-acetylcysteine (NAC) will lead to a decrease in mGluR5 availability.

      Aim 2: To determine if glutamate release via administration of ketamine or NAC has pro
      cognitive benefits.

      Hypothesis 2: We hypothesize an improvement in memory and attentional skills after drug
      challenge.

      Aim 3: To determine if there is synaptogenesis detectable by PET and MRI post ketamine or NAC
      within a week of drug challenge (at the time of greatest antidepressant response). Hypothesis
      3: We hypothesize an increase in mGluR5 availability and change in MRI measures, post drug
      challenge as compared to baseline, signifying synaptogenesis.

      Aim 4: To determine if there is a difference in reduction of mGluR5 availability after
      ketamine administration when radiotracer is administered bolus as compared to bolus to
      constant infusion in the same subjects (ABP688 radiotracer only).

      Hypothesis 4: We expect there should not be a significant difference in reduction in mGluR5
      availability due to differences in ABP688 radiotracer infusion.
