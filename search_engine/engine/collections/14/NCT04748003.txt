      deaths.

      The myocardial contusion (MC) is a distinct injury, which has a prevalence increasing with
      the severity of the trauma. The diagnostic tool is a major factor to vary the prevalence of
      MC (i.e. clinical exam, biology, electrocardiogram), with the highest values for autopsy
      series, until 24% of patients. It does not exist therefore of gold standard for the diagnosis
      of MC in clinical practice leading to a modest knowledge of this nosological entity. In
      clinical practice, troponin plasma level determines the diagnostic.

      Otherwise, the measurement of myocardial strain (2D-strain) by transthoracic echocardiography
      (TTE) is a robust tool to assess the myocardial function. This ultrasound analysis allows an
      objective and topographical quantification of an acute myocardial dysfunction, be it global
      or segmental. 2D-strain has been thus has been validated for the diagnosis of myocardial
      dysfunction in medical setting. Its use in trauma setting has never been reported.
