      receiving high emetogenic chemotherapy. Olanzapine may be more effective than aprepitant in
      this setting but cheaper. However, there is no strong evidence supporting the advantages of
      olanzapine over aprepitant - and this is the reason why aprepitant is still the standard of
      care. Due to high cost aprepitant can be not affordable in low- and middle income countries;
      this compromises quality of life of cancer patients. On the other hand, recommended
      olanzapine-based regimen includes palonosetron, whose price is quite high as well and
      undesired sedation is a common side effect for olanzapine doses that currently recommended,
      these adverse events precludes wide use of olanzapine in oncology. Development of effective,
      tolerable and affordable regimen for CINV prophylaxis based on low-dose olanzapine and
      short-acting 5-HT3 inhibitors can improve quality of care for many cancer patients.
