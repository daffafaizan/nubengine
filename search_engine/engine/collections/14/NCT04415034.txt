      Subjects with eligible criteria were included and informed consent from the parents or legal
      guardian were obtained.

      The diagnosis of pediculosis capitis was made based on the findings of eggs, larva, or an
      adult parasite on the scalp or in the hair of the students. All subjects were asked for both
      VAS and 5-D itch scale.The VAS is categorized into five groups based on the point, as
      follows: 0 for no pruritus, <3 for mild pruritus, ≥ 3 - <7 for moderate pruritus, ≥ 7 - <9
      for severe pruritus, and ≥ 9 for very severe pruritus. The 5-D itch scale consists of five
      parameters: duration, degree, direction, disability (sleep, leisure/social activities,
      housework/errands, work/school), and distribution of the pruritus with points ranging from
      one to five.

      Data were recorded for statistical analysis, a chi-square test was used to determine the
      relationship between two categorical variables. The correlation coefficient between the VAS
      and 5-D itch scale was calculated using Spearman's rank correlation
