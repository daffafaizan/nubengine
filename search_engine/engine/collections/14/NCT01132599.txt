        -  To compare C-11 choline to 18F-fluoromethylcholine using positron emission tomography
           and computed tomography imaging in their ability to detect metastatic prostate cancer.

        -  To compare the best early-phase (immediate) scanning of the two agents against the
           late-phase (one-hour delayed) 18F-fluoromethylcholine scanning in their ability to
           detect metastatic prostate cancer.

        -  To assess the safety of C-11 choline and 18F-fluoromethylcholine in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive C-11 choline IV followed by a 10-minute dynamic positron emission
      tomography (PET) scan over the pelvis and then 5-minute scans at each bed position, from the
      pelvis to the base of the skull, (up to a maximum of 7 additional bed positions) lasting up
      to 45 minutes on day 1. Beginning 3 hours later, patients receive 18F-fluoromethylcholine IV
      followed by the same scanning protocol above lasting approximately 45 minutes. An additional
      1-hour delayed PET-computed tomography (CT) scanning is then performed, which involves a
      5-minute scan at each bed position from the pelvis to the base of the skull (up to a maximum
      of 7 bed positions) with 18F-fluoromethylcholine, lasting approximately 35 minutes. Patients
      then undergo treatment as per the normal standard of care following participation in this
      trial.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed between 3-7 days.
