      craving and smoking could be achieved with a brief behavioral intervention designed to alter
      memory processes underlying smoking-related nicotine addiction. The proposed project will
      replicate and extend these findings by 1) increasing the dose of intervention so as to
      bolster the observed treatment effects, 2) employing brain imaging methods to identify
      patterns of brain activity uniquely associated with the intervention and potentially
      predictive of treatment outcome, 3) extending follow-up period to more completely document
      the long-term effects of the intervention. Positive findings from this study could lead to
      the development of brief therapy that will not only improve treatment outcomes for smokers,
      but also be used in the treatment other substance use disorders and frequently co-occurring
      comorbidities such as PTSD.
