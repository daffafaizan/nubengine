      Primary

        -  Determine the effect of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and interferon alfa on converting
           patients with locally advanced unresectable adenocarcinoma of the pancreas to
           resectability.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the rate and severity of early and late toxic effects of these regimens in
           these patients.

        -  Improve surgical morbidity profile and overall survival of patients who undergo surgical
           resection.

        -  Determine overall and progression-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is an pilot, single center study.

        -  Part 1 (neoadjuvant therapy): Patients receive fluorouracil IV continuously over 24
           hours on days 1-38; cisplatin IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, and 36; and
           interferon alfa subcutaneously on days 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, 12, 15, 17, 19, 22, 24, 26, 29,
           31, 33, 36, and 38. Patients also undergo radiotherapy on days 1-5, 8-12, 15-19, 22-26,
           29-33, and 36-38. Patients then undergo restaging. Patients with resectable disease
           undergo surgery, and 4-10 weeks later, proceed to part 2. Patients with unresectable
           disease proceed directly to part 2, 4 weeks after completion of neoadjuvant therapy.

        -  Part 2 (chemotherapy): Patients receive fluorouracil IV on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, and
           36. Treatment repeats every 56 days for up to 2 courses in the absence of disease
           progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with unresectable disease undergo
           restaging after each course of fluorouracil. If the tumor subsequently becomes
           resectable, patients then undergo surgery.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 5 years and then
      annually thereafter.
