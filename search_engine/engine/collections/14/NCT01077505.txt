      albiglutide administration on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a standard oral
      contraceptive regimen (Brevicon). The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the
      lack of effect of albiglutide doses on the pharmacokinetics of norethindrone and ethinyl
      estradiol in healthy female subjects.
