      to collect baseline information. The study team will teach the patients how to use the Fitbit
      and the associated smart phone application. Patients will also set an account with a platform
      that will provide information from the Fitbit (number of steps, sleep behaviors, and exercise
      log) to the study team. Patients will also have blood drawn, do a 6-minute walk test, and
      complete questionnaires at clinic visits 1, 8, 16, and 24 weeks after receiving the Fitbit.
      At the end of the study, patients will return the Fitbit to the study team.
