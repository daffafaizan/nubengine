      field energy to determine the location of sensor-tipped catheter electrodes within the LV. On
      the basis of previous experimental and human studies correlating the extent of myocardial
      ischemia with the amplitude of electrical signals, we hypothesize that such an integrated LV
      electromechanical mapping system could be used to distinguish healthy from ischemic or
      immobile myocardium on the basis of the extent of electromechanical endocardial signals. If
      this hypothesis is confirmed, the ability to detect on-line myocardial viability and ischemia
      in the catheterization laboratory may be feasible.

      The present study attempts to distinguish between ischemic, immobile, and normal myocardium
      by comparing LV electromechanical mapping data at rest and during pharmacologic stimulation,
      with imaging studies using MRI, PET, thallium and echo in patients with coronary artery
      disease.
