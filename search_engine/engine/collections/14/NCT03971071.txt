    
      Study 20170703 is a phase 4, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group,
      placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of erenumab against placebo in a
      chronic migraine (CM) population with medication overuse headache (MOH) and prior history of
      treatment failure. Subjects will be enrolled based on fulfilment of the International
      Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd Edition (ICHD-3) CM and MOH criteria and will not
      be advised to early discontinue acute medication.

      Subjects who successfully complete the 24-week double-blind treatment period (DBTP) of the
      study will be offered an opportunity to continue in an open-label treatment period (OLTP) of
      28-weeks duration. Subjects who received erenumab treatment during the DBTP will continue to
      receive the same erenumab dose during the OLTP. Subjects who received placebo during the DBTP
      will be allocated in a 1:1 ratio to receive either erenumab 70 mg or 140 mg SC QM during the
      OLTP. All subjects will remain blinded to their original DBTP treatment assignment.
