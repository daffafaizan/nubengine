    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, phase III two-arm multi-center study aiming at estimating
      the relative efficacy of the combination of RAD001 and paclitaxel versus that of paclitaxel
      alone as second-, third- or fourth-line treatment in terms of hazard ratio of overall
      survival in patients with gastric cancer who have relapsed after one treatment regimen
      containing a fluoropyrimidine (e.g., 5-FU, S-1, capecitabine and other 5-FU prodrugs or
      derivatives). Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio for a total of 240 patients per
      treatment arm. Randomization will be stratified according to performance status (0-1 versus
      2), prior taxan use (yes vs. no) and treatment line (2nd versus 3rd/4th line).

      Study treatment will be continued until progression or intolerable toxicity. Patients will be
      seen at baseline/screening, and weekly for paclitaxel administration and safety assessment
      until disease progression or discontinuation of trial therapy for other reasons. Radiological
      tumor assessment will be performed every second cycle (every 8 weeks) or earlier if
      clinically indicated. Post-study follow-up will be completed every 8 weeks for survival.
