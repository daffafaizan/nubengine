      hours post dose, mean percentage of time with pH > 4 and average of mean pH were greater for
      dexlansoprazole than esomeprazole . However, the study did not report the clinical effect
      after tablets used. There was no report on the short-term clinical effects and timing to
      symptom relief of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) between dexlansoprazole 60 mg and
      esomeprazole 40 mg. Therefore, we conducted a randomized controlled, open-label, study to
      compare the 7-day clinical effects of single doses of dexlansoprazole 60 mg and esomeprazole
      40 mg in for GERD.
