    
      After inclusion, patients undergo intravenous infusion of 20 mg/Kg of amikacin with amikacin
      serum concentrations being monitored over the following 24 hours.

      Randomization occures after this first amikacin infusion. Patients are randomized to group
      nebulized amikacin or intravenous amikacin. The three next days of the study patients recieve
      nebulized amikacin (or nebulized placebo) during mechanical ventilation and a placebo
      infusion (amikacin infusion in case of placebo nebulization) using a air driven jet
      nebulizer. Amikacin serum concentrations are monitored over 24 hours after each nebulization.

      Patients are followed up during 10 days for safety and efficacy. The dose of amikacin to be
      nebulized is 60 mg/Kg for the first 6 patients (phase A), 80 mg/Kg for the next 6 patients
      (phase B) and 100 mg/Kg for the last 6 patients (phase C). Each phase is started after review
      of the results of the preceeding phase by an idependent safety and monitoring board.
