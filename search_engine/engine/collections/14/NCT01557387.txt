      taken for research purposes as detailed above. All of the imaging techniques are part of the
      accepted standard of care as follows: high definition white light, narrow band imaging,
      chromoendoscopy, and histologic examination following biopsy. Comparison of the predictive
      values of the imaging modalities in predicting histology from biopsy underlies the primary
      question of this research protocol. Cost analysis of modalities versus histology will also be
      performed. Time for use of the individual modalities will be recorded.

      Subjects will be identified by one of the investigators during their outpatient clinic visits
      or while inpatient at University of Miami Hospital. Subjects who meet the inclusion/exclusion
      criteria and are scheduled to undergo a colonoscopy for standard of care purposes will be
      asked to participate in the study. Patients over 18 years of age with a confirmed diagnosis
      of inflammatory bowel disease with plans for routine colonoscopic evaluation and able to
      provide informed consent will be included.
