      receptors associated with GABA(A) receptors. Although PBR was initially identified in
      peripheral organs such as kidneys, endocrine glands and lungs, later studies identified PBR
      in the central nervous system. In normal conditions, PBR is expressed in low levels in some
      neurons and glial cells. PBR can be a clinically useful marker to detect neuroinflammation
      because activated microglial cells in inflammatory areas express much greater levels of PBR
      than in microglial cells in resting conditions.

      PBR has been imaged with positron emission tomography (PET) using
      [(11)C]1-(2-chlorophenyl-N-methylpropyl)-3-isoquinoline carboxamide (PK11195). However, this
      classical ligand provides only low levels of specific signals and is not sensitive to detect
      changes occurred in vivo. Recently we developed a new ligand,
      N-acetyl-N-(2-methoxybenzyl)-2-phenoxy-5-pyridinamine [(11)C]PBR28, which showed much greater
      specific signals than [(11)C]PK11195 in non-human primates. In the present protocol, we plan
      to perform a kinetic brain imaging study in healthy human subjects to measure PBR in brain
      regions with [(11)C]PBR28. Successful development of a PET ligand to image PBR will have a
      strong impact on clinical management of brain disorders with inflammation such as multiple
      sclerosis and ischemia and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's
      disease where inflammation is involved in the disease progression.
