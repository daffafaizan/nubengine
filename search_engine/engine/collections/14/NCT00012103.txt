        -  Determine the ability of computed tomography (CT) to detect early lung parenchymal
           abnormalities in women at high risk for lung cancer.

        -  Determine the number of abnormal findings detected by CT that develop into lung cancer
           in these patients.

        -  Correlate these abnormalities with the presence of K-ras and p53 mutations in the sputum
           and bronchoalveolar lavage in these patients.

        -  Develop and implement appropriate educational materials regarding lung cancer in women
           and provide referrals to other programs, such as smoking cessation programs.

      OUTLINE: Patients complete a questionnaire at baseline to assess demographics, medical
      history, smoking history, menopausal status, estrogen therapy, and diet.

      Patients then undergo a low-dose computed tomography (CT) scan without contrast. Patients
      with normal CT results undergo additional CT scans every 12 months.

      Patients with abnormal CT results undergo a diagnostic CT scan (in the absence of prior
      studies). Patients with indeterminate nodules (less than 5 mm in size) undergo surveillance
      CT studies within 3-4 months. If nodules remain unchanged in size, patients undergo
      additional surveillance CT studies at 6 months and 1 year. Patients with lung parenchymal
      abnormalities on CT suspicious for malignancy undergo a bronchoscopy with biopsy and
      bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Patients with abnormal CT scan(s) and negative BAL for p53
      and/or K-ras mutations or normal histology and positive BAL for K-ras and/or p53 mutations
      undergo additional CT scans at 6 months and 1 year. Patients with biopsy-proven malignancy
      after bronchoscopy are referred for definitive treatment.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 500 patients will be accrued for this study.
