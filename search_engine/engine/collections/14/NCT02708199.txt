      molecular markers in asymptomatic malaria infected local residents in study site. Only local
      residence who are not migrants, are recruited in the study and active and passive
      surveillance have been carried out within one year observation period. At the time of
      enrollment, blood film examination, rapid diagnosis test (RDT) testing have been done all
      together with the collection of the venous blood (about 1-2 mL) that would be used for
      molecular analysis later. All of the RDT or microscopy positive cases were treated according
      to the National Malaria Treatment Policy in Myanmar. A total of at least 1000 participants
      have been recruited in the study. Active case detection has been done in every three months.
      The venous blood were used for molecular based detection of the asymptomatic malaria
      infection by using High-throughout pooling strategy. All of the positive samples, (falciparum
      and vivax), have been checked for drug resistance molecular analaysis compared with the
      previously collected symptomatic malaria infection cases in the same region.
