      is placed in sequentially numbered opaque sealed envelopes by a non-investigator. Enrolment
      and data collection are performed by trained research staff who are not involved in the care
      of the patients. The treating clinicians are not possible to be blinded to the assignment
      group, but all other staff involved in both the collection and collation of data, and
      administration of neurocognitive testing, are blinded to group allocation.
