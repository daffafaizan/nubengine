    
      Anesthesiologist will be asked to score still images of laryngeal views, which will be
      obtained from patients requiring intubation for general anesthesia, after obtaining written
      informed consent.

      The images of the larynx will be captured first with the Macintosh blade and thereafter with
      the D blade. A group of independent anesthesiologist will score these images with the Cormack
      Lehane and POGO scores. The set of images will be prepared from patients with both difficult
      and normal airway anatomy. Some images in the series will be repeated to assess intra rater
      variability.

      The anesthesiologist will be asked to rate 20 images both with the CL and POGO scores.

      The experience of the raters in airway management, their experience with videolaryngoscopy
      and scoring systems used currently when documenting videolaryngoscopy and demographic data
      will be also obtained.

      The POGO scores of the participants and investigators will be compared.

      The outcome of interest is the correct POGO score rate of the participants.
