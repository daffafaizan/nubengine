      cardiovascular diseases. This increased risk may, in part, be related to abnormalities in the
      blood vessels. MeS is defined as having 3 or more of the following 5 criteria:

        -  Abdominal obesity (waist measurement >39.8 inches in men, >34.4 inches in women)

        -  Elevated triglycerides (>150 mg/dl)

        -  Low HDL or "good" cholesterol (<40 mg/dl in men or <50 mg/dl in women)

        -  Elevated blood pressure (>130/85) or treatment for high blood pressure

        -  Elevated fasting blood sugar (>100 mg/dl)

      Metformin is a medication that is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the
      treatment of diabetes; however, it can also be safely administered to non-diabetic subjects.
      We are evaluating whether Metformin reduces the stiffness of blood vessels and improves
      endothelial function.

      This study requires 4 visits to the NIA Clinical Research Center (located on the premises of
      Harbor Hospital) over a 5-month period. At the initial visit, patients will be given a
      physical examination with blood and urine tests, and an EKG. They will be randomized into one
      of two groups; one group will receive Metformin (1700 mg per day), while the other group will
      receive a placebo. Participants will take the medication for 4 months. Subsequent visits will
      include additional blood tests, ultrasound and echo exams.

      Taking part in this study is entirely voluntary. All testing and medications will be provided
      at no cost to the participant or their family.
