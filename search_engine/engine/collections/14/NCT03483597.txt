      However, the improvement of remission rate cannot fully represent needs of patients for
      health. To meet health demands of patients and improve their satisfaction, an efficacy
      evaluation system based on the outcome report of patients should be established. A
      questionnaire for this research is designed and mended in view of TSQM-II treatment
      satisfaction questionnaire and the actual situation of RA diagnosis and treatment in China.
      An investigation on treatment satisfaction and its influencing factors for Chinese rheumatoid
      immunologists and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients as well as their expectations for this
      disease is carried out based on 120 rheumatoid immunologists and 1,200 rheumatoid arthritis
      patients (1:10) from Chinese 12 public tertiary hospitals distributed directionally by
      Chinese Rheumatism Data Center (CRDC). The research concludes rheumatoid specialist
      physicians for doctor population, and persons aged over 18 for patient population who has
      been confirmed as RA for 6 months above, excluding patients with Chinese reading
      comprehension barriers or without any RA treatment. Finally, summarize and analyze the total
      score of satisfaction from doctors and patients, average score of doctors and patients for
      various medical demands, as well as the satisfaction of patients about communication and
      service during medical treatment.
