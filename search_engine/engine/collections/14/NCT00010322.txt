      cancer treated with toremifene with or without atamestane. II. Compare the response rate,
      overall survival, duration of response, and time to treatment failure in patients treated
      with these regimens. III. Compare the safety profile of these regimens in this patient
      population.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients
      are stratified according to study center. Patients are randomized to one of two treatment
      arms. Arm I: Patients receive oral toremifene daily and oral atamestane twice daily. Arm II:
      Patients receive oral toremifene as in arm I and an oral placebo twice daily. Treatment
      continues for 12-30 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients are followed every 12 weeks for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 594 patients (297 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 18 months.
