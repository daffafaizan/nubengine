      2 diabetic diagnosed patients with hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c%) above 9% were hospitalized, and
      were randomly divided into two groups: NovoRapid group (group Asp) and Prandilin group (group
      Lis) in CSII, combined with metformin therapy. Treatments were maintained for 2-3 weeks after
      the glycaemic target was reached. To complete the assessment of general information, fasting
      C-peptide (C-P0), 2-h postprandial C-peptide (C-P2h), fasting insulin (Ins0), 2-h
      postprandial insulin (Ins2h), HbA1c% and fructosamine on the baseline and endpoint. 4 days
      continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) was performed on after three days stable glucose.
