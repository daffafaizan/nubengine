      escalation design under randomized double-blind and fasting conditions. In each dose group,
      volunteers will be randomized to receive an oral administration of either active drug
      (ASP7991) or placebo. The dose escalation will be determined after blinded safety assessment.

      Part 2 is a study to evaluate the effect of food intake. ASP7991 will be administered to
      volunteers under 2 conditions, fasting and fed, on 2-way crossover method.
