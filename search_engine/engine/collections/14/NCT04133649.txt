    
      Subjects willing to participate who meet with the inclusion - exclusion criteria, will be
      treated with a single dose of LGT delivered intravascularly (IV).

      Baseline will be performed within 8 weeks of beginning the treatment regimen. The treatment
      regimen will begin with IV delivery of AAV-hTERT, defined as "Day 0." Safety and efficacy
      analyses will be conducted at Weeks 1, 4, 13, 26, 39, and 52 post-treatment.

      Study objectives

      Primary: Safety and Tolerability

      1. Investigate the safety and tolerability of AAV-hTERT by intravenous (IV) administration.

      Secondary: Provisional Efficacy

        1. To determine changes from baseline in hTERT expression, telomerase activity, and
           telomere length in cells after treatment with AAV-hTERT.

        2. To determine changes from baseline in health and aging-related biomarkers after
           treatment with AAV-hTERT.

        3. To determine changes from baseline in the immune system after treatment with AAV-hTERT.

        4. To determine changes from baseline in physical function measures after treatment with
           AAV-hTERT
