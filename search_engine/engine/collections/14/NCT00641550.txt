      beginning at 13 weeks, 20 weeks or no exercise group.

      The objectives are:

        1. To describe and compare biological and obstetrical variables.

        2. To study doppler flow velocimetry indexes.

        3. To determine the association between physical exercise and maternal complications:
           preeclampsia, preterm labor, gestational diabetes and weight gain in pregnancy.

        4. To determine the association between physical exercise and perinatal outcomes: Apgar
           scores, birthweight, admission at intensive neonatal care unit, body composition and
           neonatal complications.
