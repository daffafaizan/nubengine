      lavage, bronchial brushings, and bronchial wall biopsies as well as to collect samples of
      sputum, exhaled breath condensates and blood, in order to evaluate the molecular mechanisms
      underlying the pathogenesis of airway inflammation, airway hyperresponsiveness, and airway
      remodeling in asthmatic subjects.
