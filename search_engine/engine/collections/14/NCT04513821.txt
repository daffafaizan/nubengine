    
      This is an Intermediate-Size Expanded Access, Open-Label Study for Use of Mino-Lok Therapy
      (MLT) in Combination with Systemic Antibiotics in the Treatment of Central Line Associated
      Bloodstream Infection.

      Mino-Lok Therapy is being developed as an adjunctive therapy for the treatment of
      catheter-related or central line associated bloodstream infection (CRBSI/CLABSI) in
      combination with appropriate systemic antibiotic(s), to preserve central venous access and to
      avoid the complications and morbidities associated with catheter removal and reinsertion.

      This is an expanded access program (EAP). This program is designed to provide access to
      Mino-Lok. A physician must decide whether the potential benefit outweighs the risk of
      receiving an investigational therapy.
