      inhibition on insulin release during a hyperglycemic clamp while GLP-1 is being infused and,
      2) further elucidate the role of the metabolite of GLP-1, that is GLP-1 9-36 amide (GLP-1m).
      During stable and very reproducible elevated plasma glucose levels the effect of increased
      active incretin levels with DPP-4 inhibitors should result in increased plasma insulin
      levels. Therefore the aim of this protocol is to document whether plasma insulin levels are
      increased following GLP-1 infusion in the presence or absence of DPP-4 inhibitors.
      Additionally, the investigators have shown that some improvement in glucose homeostasis
      during GLP-1 administration is due in part to the metabolite of GLP-1, i.e. GLP-1 (9-36)
      amide (GLP-1m). Therefore, the investigators will also test the role of the latter by
      infusing GLP-1m when the volunteers are being treated with DPP-4 inhibitors.
