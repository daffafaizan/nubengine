      and efficacy of B-701 (vofatamab) plus pembrolizumab in the treatment of subjects with
      locally advanced or metastatic UCC, who have progressed following platinum-based chemotherapy
      and who have not received prior immune checkpoint inhibitor or FGFR inhibitor-targeted
      therapy. The study consists of 2 parts: a Phase 1b lead-in phase enrolling 6 to 18 subjects
      and a Phase 2 dose expansion phase enrolling up to a total of 74 subjects.

      Subjects who discontinue B-701 (vofatamab) may continue on study and receive pembrolizumab
      alone until disease progression, death, withdrawal of patient consent, or study termination.
