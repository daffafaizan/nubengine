    
      Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency, also called Alpha-1-Proteinase Inhibitor (API) deficiency, is
      a genetic disorder characterized by the production of an abnormal amount of AAT protein and
      reduced circulating levels of this protein. Subjects with AAT deficiency are at increased
      risk for developing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It is believed that this is
      the result of the chronic activity of elastase released by cells continually present in the
      lungs in low numbers.

      This study is a randomized, double-blind comparison of Kamada API, an Alpha-1-Proteinase
      Inhibitor with a currently marketed API product.
