      pandemic, researchers at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)
      are leading a large international collaboration to characterize the innate and adaptive
      immune responses to acute severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
      infection and convalescence. This protocol will allow the NIAID Laboratory of Clinical
      Immunology and Microbiology (LCIM) to remotely enroll participants for send-in sample
      collection for analyses to characterize the immune response to SARS-CoV-2, better enabling
      the LCIM to support NIAID s commitment to safeguarding the health of Americans and people
      around the world by accelerating research efforts to characterize SARS CoV 2. This is a
      prospective sample collection protocol to receive send in biological samples (e.g., blood,
      saliva, stool, and leftover clinically collected samples) for exploratory studies to
      characterize the immune response to COVID 19. Participants will not be seen at the NIH for
      study visits. Under this protocol, samples will be collected longitudinally from up to 300
      patients with confirmed or suspected SARS CoV 2 infection and sent to the NIH for research
      evaluations. Additionally, samples will be collected from up to 200 uninfected patients and
      patient relatives. Testing will be performed to improve understanding of host immune
      responses to COVID-19, including but not limited to genetic, molecular, and proteomic
      testing. Findings relevant to participants health and medical care may be returned to them
      and their referring health care providers or study teams.
