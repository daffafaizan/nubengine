      the last years. Last studies have shown that adding an unstable device increased
      electromyographic activity of the lower limb and the trunk muscles. However, no studies have
      investigated the effects of wearing unstable shoes during a whole-body vibration training on
      balance in healthy young people.

      Aim: To compare the effects of different type of shoes (unstable [Intervention group] or
      stable [Control group]) combined with a 12-weeks whole body vibration training on balance.

      Setting: Laboratory of biomechanics.
