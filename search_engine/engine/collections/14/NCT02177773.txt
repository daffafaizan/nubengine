    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if gallium Ga 68-DOTA-TOC (gallium-68 labeled DOTA-TOC) results in the
      delineation of more lesions than with conventional imaging.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if the incorporation of gallium (Ga)-68 DOTA-TOC PET/CT into the management
      decision making process results in a change in stage of the patient.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive gallium Ga 68-DOTA-TOC intravenously (IV) over 1-2 minutes. Within 55-70
      minutes, patients then undergo a PET/CT scan over 30-40 minutes or a PET/MRI scan over 50
      minutes.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up for 2 weeks.
