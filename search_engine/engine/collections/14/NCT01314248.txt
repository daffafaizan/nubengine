      the standard LMA, LMA Unique TM,with the air-Q ILA in pediatric patients. Oropharyngeal leak
      pressure is commonly used as an indicator of airway seal adequacy. Similarly, flexible
      fiberoptic bronchoscope examination is often employed to assess proper placement of airway
      devices. Our hypothesis is that the air-Q ILA is superior to the standard LMA in both these
      regards:

        1. We hypothesize that airway leak pressures will be higher with the ILA. Airway leak
           pressures will be measured by recording the circuit pressure at which an equilibrium is
           reached.

        2. We hypothesize that flexible fiberoptic view of the airway will be superior with the
           ILA. The airway view will be assessed using a previously used and published grading
           scale.
