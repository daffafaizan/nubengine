      responses during exercise compared with either premenopausal women or men of similar age.
      Arterial stiffness and exaggerated BP responses to exercise are prognostic for heart wall
      thickening, future hypertension, adverse cardiovascular events, and mortality. Previous
      studies have reported that acute consumption of nitrate-rich beetroot juice can lower resting
      and exercising BP responses in older adults. However, these studies included both sexes and
      did not compare the effects of beetroot juice to a nitrate-depleted placebo (a true control).
      Thus, the potential BP lowering effects of nitrate supplementation per se have not been
      established in postmenopausal women. The present study examines the acute (single dose)
      effects of nitrate-rich beetroot juice on resting hemodynamics (peripheral and central BP,
      arterial wave properties, etc), and physiological responses to handgrip exercise in
      metabolically healthy post-menopausal women.
