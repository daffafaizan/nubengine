      efficacy and pharmacokinetic characteristics of Mitoxantrone Hydrochloride Liposome in
      subjects with advanced solid tumor. 60subjects will be recruited and randomly assigned into 2
      groups. The 30 subjects in group A will receive the Mitoxantrone Hydrochloride Liposome 20
      mg/m2 by an intravenous infusion (IV), every 28 days (q4w, 1 cycle). The 30 subjects in group
      B will receive Mitoxantrone Hydrochloride Liposome 20 mg/m2, IV, every 21 days (q3w, 1
      cycle). All subjects will receive the treatment until disease progression, intolerable toxic
      reaction, death, or withdrawal by investigator or subject decision (a maximum of 8 cycles).
      Delays in drug administration is allowed from cycle 2, however, the delays should be no more
      than 3 weeks. Dose adjustments after cycle 2 is permitted, and the minimum dose is 12 mg/m2.
