      treatment. A matched sibling donor is optimal but may not be available. Therefore, a
      partially matched family member (haploidentical) may be a viable alternative. The incidence
      of graft vs. host disease, however, can become more of a significant, even fatal, factor with
      partial matches.

      T-cells have been shown to be the key player in the post-transplant immune phenomena. The
      majority of T-cells are composed of alpha beta T-cells with a small minority of gamma delta
      T-cells, which are known to have the unique ability to kill malignant cells without antigen
      recognition.

      This study proposes to extract, concentrate, and activate gamma delta T-cells from the
      peripheral blood to provide innate anti-tumor effect with minimal risk of GVHD. Safety and
      impact and/or the rate of GVHD will be evaluated.
