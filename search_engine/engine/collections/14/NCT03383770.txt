      been on ultrasound-supported regional anaesthesia, and the stimulation methods that were
      often used in the past were no longer used or used less frequently. The combination of both
      methods may be an additional safety aspect and can contribute to an improved blocking
      quality. In addition to the best possible ultrasound quality, an optimal stimulation quality
      is also required. The investigators plan to carry out dual-guidance blockages of the
      ischiadic nerve with various regional anaesthesia needles (manufacturer of the used needles:
      Pajunk Medical Produkte GmbH, Geisingen, Germany; Teleflex Medical GmbH, Kernen, Germany).
      All regional anaesthesia cannulae are approved for the planned blockades of humans in
      Germany.
