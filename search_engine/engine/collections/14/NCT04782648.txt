    
      Prospective data base of 100 consecutive morbidly obese patients who had undergone transit
      bipartition (TB, also termed "Single Anastomosis Sleeve Ileal bypass") after a previous
      sleeve gastrectomy (LSG). Inclusion criteria were TB for excess weight loss (EWL) < 50% â‰¥ 12
      months post LSG or weight recidivism of > 5 kg/qm with a body mass index (BMI) > 30 kg/qm.
      Patients with endocrine disorders other than type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D), major
      psychiatric disorders, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) III and higher or pregnant
      patients were excluded from the study. Data were prospectively collected in strictly
      pseudonymous form. Follow up time points were at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months following TB. The
      primary endpoint of the study is weight loss at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after TB. A subgroup
      analysis evaluates the effect of the length of the common channel. Secondary endpoints
      include impact on obesity related comorbidities such as T2D, hypertension, sleep apnea,
      gastroesophageal reflux as well as safety.
