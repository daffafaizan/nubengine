    
      The VILT-502 study is an open-label, single-arm study to assess the long-term safety and
      effectiveness of viltolarsen, an exon skipping therapy for the treatment of DMD. Patients who
      complete the Phase II long-term extension study and meet the additional inclusion and
      exclusion criteria of the present protocol will be invited to enroll. Viltolarsen will be
      administered through weekly IV infusions, at the study site or at home.

      The VILT-502 study will be conducted as a non-interventional study in the US, and as a
      low-intervention clinical trial in Canada where viltolarsen is not yet commercially
      available, owing to differences in the stage of regulatory approval in the two countries.
