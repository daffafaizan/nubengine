    
      In the South and Central America Region, an estimated 9.4% of the adult population (20-79
      years) has diabetes in 2015, and Brazil is the first country in number of people with
      diabetes. Of these, 39.0% are undiagnosed, at risk for developing complications such as
      diabetic retinopathy (DR)(1).

      The rising number of people with diabetes in the world has become a real challenge for the
      public health system to provide care for patients with DR and for people with diabetes at
      risk for this complication(2). A large proportion of patients with diabetes was inadequately
      controlled in Brazil, which may contribute to increased rates of diabetic complications (3).

      The detection of any degree of DR may result in improved medical monitoring and optimization
      of risk factors, delaying the progression of the disease(4). In Brazil, the great demand in
      the public service causes delay in early diagnosis, worsening health status of patients with
      diabetic retinopathy and increasing the cost of their treatment.

      Due to the increasing prevalence of diabetes and high percentage of patients with
      uncontrolled disease, cost-effective tools are needed with focused attention on diabetes
      prevention and management in the current health system.

      Several studies have shown that systematic screening for DR is an effective way of prevention
      (5). Furthermore, the automatic retinopathy detection can enlarge the screening, reducing the
      workload and costs compared to manual image graders(6). There are no reports on automated DR
      detection in Brazilian population, especially in screening campaigns with large-scale
      diagnosis.
