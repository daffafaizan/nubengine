      bleeding using tranexamic acid (TXAg), bismuth subgallate (BSg) or dry gauze (DGg) as local
      hemostatic 2) explore the relation between bleeding and the occurrence of hematomas, with
      length of incision, duration of surgery, and alveolar ridge recontouring. 80 surgical
      procedures performed in a total of 71 patients (20 surgical procedures in 18 patients not on
      OAT and 60 surgical procedures performed in 53 patients on OAT) that were assigned to one of
      four groups, so that each group included 20 procedures. The control group (Cg) comprised 20
      procedures performed in patients not on OAT. The 60 procedures to be performed in patients on
      OAT were randomly to one of the three following experimental groups: 1) TXAg group, OAT plus
      TXA as local hemostatic agent; 2) BSg group, OAT plus BS as local hemostatic agent; 3) DGg
      group, OAT plus compression with dry gauze as local hemostatic agent. Outcomes variables
      were:

      Intraoperative variables: length of incision expressed (Li) alveolar ridge recontouring
      (Arr), total duration of surgery (Ds), surgical quadrant and implant location.

      Postoperative variables: immediate postoperative bleeding (within the first 30 minutes after
      surgery), short-term bleeding: within the first 5 days post-surgery, determined according to
      the index described by Bacci, presence of intraoral/extraoral hematomas in skin or mucosa.
      Descriptive statistical, analysis of variance and regression logistic analysis was performed.
      Statistical significance was set at a value of p<0.05.
