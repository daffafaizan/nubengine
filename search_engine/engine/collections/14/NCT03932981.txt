      chemotherapy in infiltrative non-enhancing adult brainstem gliomas that are progressing in an
      infiltrative and non-threatening way. Upon progression, (radiotherapy) RT will be
      administered. Main inclusion criteria are:18 years of age or older/Karnofsky's Index over 50
      /Non-enhancing lesion at MRI/Histologically proven infiltrating pattern of brainstem glioma
      except in case of formal contraindication to surgery determined via discussion of the case
      with expert neurosurgeons during a national webmeeting ((GLIome du TRonc de l'ADulte group
      (GLITRAD))/Clinical and/or radiological progression with an infiltrative but non-threatening
      pattern, warranting antitumoral treatment. The treatment delivered will be Temozolomide at a
      monthly standard dose of 150-200 mg/m2/day at day 1 to day 5 for a duration of treatment of
      12 months. The study is a prospective single-arm phase II trial. Primary end point is
      objective response rate (radiographic and clinical response) to Temozolomide according to
      Response assessment in neuro-oncology criteria (RANO criteria). Secondary end points are
      histological pattern of adult brainstem gliomas/Molecular pattern of adult brainstem gliomas/
      Radiological pattern of adult brainstem gliomas based on standard and multimodal
      MRI/Metabolic pattern of adult brainstem gliomas based on 18F-DOPA PET CT at initial
      diagnosis and its change after treatment /Global survival/Quality of life questionnaire
      (EORTC QLQ-C30 with BN-20)/Tolerance to temozolomide/Volumetric velocity of the tumor growth
      during follow-up before treatment from the initial MRI until the last MRI before beginning of
      the treatment, established with sagittal cube FLAIR sequences/Volumetric velocity of the
      tumor growth during follow-up during treatment of chemotherapy, established with sagittal
      cube FLAIR sequences/Rate of objective response, stabilization and progression under
      treatment obtained by combining the RANO criteria and the scores obtained on 3 scales (ataxia
      measured by the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA), diet measured by the
      Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS) and diplopia).A number of 60 patients should be enrolled.
      THe duration of the study is 4 years.
