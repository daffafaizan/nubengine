           obstruction: They permit the interim internal bypass drainage of urine when obstruction
           in the ureter especially in cases of lithiasis or after surgical intervention on the
           upper urinary tract.

        -  There are many indications for double loop stent placement and population chosen for
           this study are adult patients with intra-renal calcium calculi of 7-20 mm in diameter
           for whom the treatment indication is a flexible ureterorenoscopy.

        -  The aims of the use of a double loop stent are to

             -  prevent complications (pain, infection) associated with the ureteral obstruction by
                any residual stone fragments, blood clot or local oedema generated by the
                intervention.

             -  preserve the renal function.

             -  facilitate healing process while limiting the risk of stenosis and probably reduce
                the rate of readmission after patients' discharge.

        -  Double loop Stent-related symptoms have a high prevalence and may affect over 80% of
           patients.

        -  Assessment tools are important to determine the symptoms intensity and allow for
           comparisons at different times. The Urinary Stent Symptom Questionnaire (USSQ) is the
           most adapted tool designed for this purpose.

        -  An ideal ureteral stent is expected to drain well, to be easy to insert and to be
           comfortable for the patients. The investigators designed a hydro-coated Silicone JJ
           stent with additional properties for improving patient's comfort.

        -  The investigators decided to perform a randomized clinical investigation to evaluate the
           Coloplast Hydrocoated Silicone JJ in comparison to the Boston Percuflex Plus JJ stent on
           patients' comfort.
