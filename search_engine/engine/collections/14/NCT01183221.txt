      perform an empathic accuracy task, a novel and ecologically valid measure of complex social
      cognition, in conjunction with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The
      investigators will investigate the effects of oxytocin (versus placebo) on the behavioral and
      neural correlates of empathic accuracy.
