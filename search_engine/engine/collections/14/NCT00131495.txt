      Hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) is a condition suffered by as many as 32% of the
      menopausal population. It is generally defined as a low libido which causes distress.
      Testosterone therapy (transdermal patch) is currently under investigation for this disorder
      and results of three phase 3 trials have shown evidence of efficacy in menopausal patients on
      hormone replacement therapy. Low libido does not discriminate between those women utilizing
      hormone replacement therapy and those who do not. This study is designed to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of 2 doses of the transdermal testosterone patch in naturally or
      surgically menopausal women with low libido who are not receiving systemic estrogen or
      estrogen progestin therapy. Persons could elect to go into a single blind study for one year
      after completing the first yeat double blind
