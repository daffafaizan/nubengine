    
      This study is a one-center observational study examining DVT with PET/CT. 80 individuals with
      recent deep venous thrombosis (DVT) will be recruited from MGH. Imaging and clinical
      evaluation will be performed to look for predictors of a major complication of DVT: the
      post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS)

      There are 5 visits to attend. The imaging visits will last 2-3 hours. The clinical evaluation
      visits will last 1-2 hours.

        1. Screening - This visit will take place after initial DVT (deep venous thrombosis)
           diagnosis. It will involve clinical assessments and blood labs, to determine subject
           eligibility. If an ultrasound was not performed at the time of DVT diagnosis, an
           ultrasound should be performed.

        2. Visit 1 (0-7 days after DVT diagnosis) - Imaging Visit 1 - At this visit, patients will
           receive a positron-emission tomography/ computed tomography (PET/CT) scan, and
           contrast-enhanced CT of the lower extremity (CTA) and will have blood labs drawn.

        3. Visit 2 (21-28 days after DVT diagnosis) - Imaging Visit 2 - At this visit, patients
           will receive a PET/CT scan and will have blood labs drawn.

        4. Visit 3 (6 months after DVT diagnosis) - Clinical Evaluation - At this visit, patients
           will meet to evaluate symptoms of DVT and PTS. Blood labs will be drawn. An ultrasound
           will be performed as well.

        5. Visit 4 (24 months after DVT diagnosis OR time of PTS diagnosis) - Clinical Evaluation -
           At this visit, patients will meet to evaluate symptoms of DVT and PTS. Blood labs will
           be drawn. An ultrasound will be performed as well.
