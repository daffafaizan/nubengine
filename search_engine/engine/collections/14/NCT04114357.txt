    
      This is a pilot, single center clinical trial to evaluate the effect of using the prebiotic,
      HAMS-AB, on the gut microbiome profile, glycemia and β-cell function in children and
      adolescents ages 12-16 years with recently diagnosed type 1 diabetes.

      Approximately 12 participants will be randomized first to take the supplement or follow a
      diabetic diet for 4 weeks and then cross-over after a 4 week washout period.

      The primary objective is to determine the effect of using the prebiotic on the gut microbiome
      profile in youth with T1D.

      The secondary objectives are to determine the effect of using the prebiotic on SCFA
      production, glycemia and β-cell health and function
