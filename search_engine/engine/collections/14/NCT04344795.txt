    
      This is a first-in-human Phase 1a/1b, multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation, dose and
      schedule optimization, and expansion study of TPST-1495 to determine its MTD, safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PD), pharmacodynamics (PK) and preliminary anti-tumor
      activity in subjects with advanced solid tumors. Subjects with all histologic types of solid
      tumors are eligible for the study. However, the preferred tumor types for enrollment are
      colorectal cancer (CRC), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), squamous cell carcinoma of the
      head and neck (SCCHN), urothelial cancer, endometrial cancer, and gastroesophageal junction
      (GEJ) or gastric adenocarcinoma. Tumor prostaglandin production and downstream signaling in
      both tumor cells and other cell types, including immune suppressive cell population in the
      tumor microenvironment, is thought to be a principal driver of progression in each of these
      selected malignancies. To be eligible, subjects must have no remaining standard therapy known
      to confer clinical benefit.

      The study is composed of 3 stages. The Dose-Escalation stage will determine the MTD of
      single-agent TPST-1495 administered twice a day (BID). The Schedule and Dose Optimization
      stage will evaluate alternative TPST-1495 administration schedules and determine an RP2D for
      the selected schedule. The Expansion stage will evaluate the activity of TPST-1495 at the
      selected schedule and dose in disease-specific cohorts.
