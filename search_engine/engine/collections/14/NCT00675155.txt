      blood vessels causes brain cells (neurons) in the affected area to die. The effects of a
      stroke depend on where the brain was injured, as well as how much damage occurred. A stroke
      can impact any number of areas including your ability to move, see, remember, speak, reason
      and read and write.

      It is hereby postulated that irradiation using far infrared, with wavelength between 5 to 20
      microns, of the central nervous system, the endocrine system and the whole body could
      prevent, control, manage or possibly lead to complete rehabilitation of people with stroke.
