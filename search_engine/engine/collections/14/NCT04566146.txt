      literature shoulder impingement is reported between 48% and 65% of all painful shoulder
      conditions.

      The coordinated coupled motion between the scapula and humerus, the so-called scapulohumeral
      rhythm (SHR), is needed for efficient arm movement. Reduced scapular mobility reduces the
      acromio-humeral distance during arm abduction and therefore increases the risk for shoulder
      impingement syndrome.

      Clinical prediction rules (CPRs) are tools designed to improve decision making in clinical
      practice by assisting practitioners in making a particular diagnosis, establishing a
      prognosis, or matching patients to optimal interventions based on a parsimonious subset of
      predictor variables from the history and physical examination.

      HYPOTHESES:

      Pain severity will not be predictor for treatment success in patients suffering from
      subacromial impingement syndrome treated with scapular training.

      Scapular upward rotation angle will not be predictor for treatment success in patients
      suffering from subacromial impingement syndrome treated with scapular training.

      Ratio of upper trapezius /serratus anterior isometric strength will not be predictor for
      treatment success in patients suffering from subacromial impingement syndrome treated with
      scapular training.

      RESEARCH QUESTION:

      Does pain severity, scapular upward rotation angle and upper trapezius/serratus anterior
      isometric strength ratio predict patient's esponse to scapular training in patients with
      subacromial impingement syndrome?
