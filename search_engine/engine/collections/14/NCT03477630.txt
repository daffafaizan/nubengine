      knees. Both products reduce negative symptoms such as pain and inflammation. But they use
      different mechanisms. Plasma is a biological product that acts mainly as an anti-inflammatory
      reducing pain and collaborating to re establish the chemical balance within the knee, which
      slows down the deterioration of the joint.

      Hyaluronic acid is a knee lubricant that decreases friction and therefore stress inside the
      knee.
