      characterized by symptoms of gastrointestinal complaints and eosinophilic inflammation
      limited to the esophagus. Currently, first line therapeutic recommendations include
      swallowed, topical steroids or dietary therapy. While both work for the majority of patients,
      they both have limitations.

      The investigators are examining the use of oral cromolyn sodium as a treatment for this
      condition. This medication is a non-steroid that is already approved for other conditions.
      When taken orally, it is essentially not absorbed systemically, so side effects are minimal.
      There is only 1 brief, retrospective report of its use in this condition suggesting it does
      not work. However, from studying swallowed, topical steroids, it may require formulating the
      medication into a viscous preparation for it to work.
