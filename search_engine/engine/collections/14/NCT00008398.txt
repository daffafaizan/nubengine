        -  Determine the efficacy of sargramostim (GM-CSF) in terms of reducing the severity and
           expected duration of radiotherapy-induced oral mucositis in patients with head and neck
           cancer receiving radiotherapy.

        -  Determine the correlation between reduced mucosal injury and quality of life improvement
           in patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients are
      stratified according to concurrent cisplatin chemotherapy (yes vs no). Patients are
      randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive radiotherapy once daily five days a week for 6-7 weeks. Patients
           also receive sargramostim (GM-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) three times a week (except on
           days if receiving concurrent cisplatin) beginning 1 week prior to radiotherapy and
           continuing until 2 weeks after completion of radiotherapy for a total of approximately 9
           weeks.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive radiotherapy as in arm I. Patients also receive placebo SC on
           the same schedule as GM-CSF in arm I.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, and then at 3, 6, and 12 months.

      Patients are followed at 3, 6 and 11 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 126 patients (63 per arm) will be accrued within 1.2-1.4 years.
