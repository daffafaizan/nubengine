      Primary

        -  Determine time to progression from surgery in patients who have undergone cytoreductive
           surgery and intraperitoneal hyperthermic chemotherapy for peritoneal carcinomatosis or
           adenomucinosis secondary to colorectal or appendiceal cancer treated with adjuvant
           thalidomide.

      Secondary

        -  Estimate progression-free survival probability of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Obtain toxicity data for patients receiving long-term oral thalidomide therapy.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral thalidomide once daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every
      28 days for up to 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 12 months.
