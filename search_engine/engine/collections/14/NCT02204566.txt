      undergone Atrial RF ablation will be enrolled in the study. Patients will be asked to swallow
      the OFDI capsule while being unsedated. The capsule is attached to a tether that allows the
      capsule operator to navigate the capsule as it progresses down the esophagus using natural
      propulsion called peristalsis as well as to bring it back up to pulled out of the mouth when
      the procedure is done.

      As the capsule progresses down the esophagus, multiple, two dimensional, microscopic cross-
      sectional images of the esophagus are acquired.
