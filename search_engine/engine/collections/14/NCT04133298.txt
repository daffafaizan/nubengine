      recession coverage. The technique provide better blood supply which enhances wound healing
      and results in successful root coverage and attachment gain. Tunneling technique is suggested
      to be incorporated with a soft tissue tissue for better recipient site outcome.

      In a systemic review and meta-analysis conducted in 2019 there was limited evidence available
      comparing subepithelial connective tissue graft to the de-epithelialized gingival graft.
      However the de-epithelialized gingival graft showed superior mean root coverage, keratinized
      tissue gain and clinical attachment gain over the subepithelial connective tissue graft
      making it the technique of choice when incorporated with coronal advancement flap in
      treatment of gingival recession. Laser de-epithelization may enrich the advantages of the
      conventional de-epithelization method where more uniform predictable epithelization can be
      obtained.
