      The study will enroll 30 HIV-infected patients on a stable ART regimen with a suppressed HIV
      RNA < 50 copies/ml for at least one year. Patients will be switched to the experimental
      regimen (maraviroc 300 mg twice a day plus either raltegravir 400 mg twice a day or
      dolutegravir 50 mg once a-day) and followed for 96 weeks. The decision to use raltegravir or
      dolutegravir will be left to investigator/subject preference, as the two integrate inhibitors
      are largely interchangeable aside from twice daily (raltegravir) vs. daily (dolutegravir)
      dosing.

      Primary endpoint:

        -  The primary endpoint is the proportion of patients virologically suppressed (HIV RNA <
           50 copies/ml) at 48 weeks.

      Definitions:

        -  Virologic suppression is an HIV RNA < 50 copies/ml.

        -  Virologic failure is an HIV RNA â‰¥ 50 copies/ml confirmed on 2 separate occasions,
           separated by > 1 week after viral suppression.

      Secondary endpoints:

        -  The percent change in total cholesterol, LDL, and HDL at 48 and 96 weeks.

        -  The number of adverse events.

        -  The proportion of patients who are virologically suppressed (HIV RNA < 50 copies/ml) at
           96 weeks.

      Exploratory endpoints:

        -  Telomerase activity and telomere length measured at baseline and 24, 48, and 96 weeks.
