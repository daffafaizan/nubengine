      controlled study to evaluate sacubitril/valsartan compared to individualized medical therapy
      on NT proBNP, exercise capacity, symptoms and QoL in patients with heart failure and
      preserved left ventricular ejection (HFpEF) fraction (LVEF > 40%). Patients were initially
      stratified into one of three strata according to prior treatment for comorbidities:
      Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi), angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) or no
      prior renin angiotensin system inhibitors (RASi). Patients in each stratum were randomized in
      a 1:1 ratio and received either sacubitril/valsartan or comparator (i.e.

      enalapril for patients in ACEi strata, valsartan for patients in the ARB strata and placebo
      for patients in the No RASi strata). There was no designated proportion of patients planned
      in each stratum; the strata were populated based upon the patient's prior treatment regimen.
      The study consisted of a screening epoch of up to 2 weeks and a randomized treatment epoch of
      24 weeks, which included a 1 to 4 week study drug up-titration epoch followed by a 20 to 23
      week maintenance epoch. Uptitration to target doses was recommended to occur within the first
      four weeks of the study, and was performed by Investigator's discretion based on the
      patient's clinical status.
