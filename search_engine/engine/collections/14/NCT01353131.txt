      analysis of 69,088 routine 12-lead ECGs performed in a large medical institution during a 6
      month period by combining previously established indices of abnormal repolarization (wide
      QRS-T angle) with validated measures of myocardial damage (Selvester QRS score). Among
      patients considered at risk, 4.9% had perished 18 months later and among the survivors those
      > 70 years of age or with LV ejection fraction â‰¤ 35%, or at a high risk of dying within 3
      years from cancer, end stage cardiac, pulmonary, renal, immunologic or neurologic diseases,
      were excluded using a simple and reproducible screening arborescence based on the digital
      medical record. From the pool of remaining at risk patients derived from the application of
      the same screening methods in three other similarly large academic institutions, a sample of
      1100 individuals will be recruited for further risk stratification as participants of the
      C-TRIP Stage 2 prospective study. For C-TRIP Stage 2, patients will undergo detailed
      phenotypic studies including contrast-enhanced cardiac MRI, ECG Holter recordings at rest and
      during a 6 minute walk, signal averaged ECG and biomarkers of inflammation, myocardial
      ischemia and stress, as well as indices of collagen synthesis and turnover. Patients will be
      followed for 3 years for the development of a combined clinical outcome including mortality
      (all cause, cardiac and sudden cardiac death) and hospitalization for non-fatal myocardial
      infarction, acute coronary syndromes, ventricular arrhythmias and heart failure. From the
      combination of selected phenotypic markers of poor outcome, a risk score will be developed
      and used for the design of prophylactic strategies aimed at curbing premature sudden cardiac
      death and end-stage cardiac disease among patients currently classified as having
      intermediate levels of risk.
