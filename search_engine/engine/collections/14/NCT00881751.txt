      Primary

        -  To estimate the overall survival in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma
           treated with bevacizumab and erlotinib hydrochloride vs sorafenib tosylate.

      Secondary

        -  To estimate the event-free survival and tumor response rate of these patients.

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of these regimens in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15 and oral
           erlotinib hydrochloride once daily on days 1-28.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral sorafenib tosylate twice daily on days 1-28. In both arms,
           courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
           toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 30 days and then every 3 months
      for 1 year.
