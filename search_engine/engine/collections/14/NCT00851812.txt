      and its treatment is different from fatigue occurring in other situations and its specific
      causes have not been identified. Exercise may or may not improve this type of fatigue. The
      purpose of this study is to examine how cancer treatments impact normal lifestyle physical
      activity patterns and participation in physical activity, as well as the ability of a walking
      and progressive resistance exercise program to reduce cancer-related fatigue in breast cancer
      patients. This study also examines if the walking and progressive resistance exercise program
      improves other factors such as quality of life, depression, anxiety, ability to sleep, self
      esteem, cardiovascular fitness, energy expenditure, muscular strength, muscle mass, and
      immune function (as measured by inflammatory cytokines).
