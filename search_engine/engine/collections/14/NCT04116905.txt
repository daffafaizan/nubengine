      according to previous studies. It is associated with a series of chronic non-communicable
      diseases, including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, non-alcoholic fatty liver,
      polycystic ovary syndrome, cancer, and etc. Worth noting, obesity contributed a lot to the
      occurrence of metabolic syndrome, and many studies had proven the positive significance of
      sufficient weight loss to the improvement of components of metabolic syndrome.

      The study is examining the effect of an intensive lifestyle intervention program, designed to
      achieve and maintain a 15% decrease in body weight by intensive calorie restriction and
      physical exercise, in overweight and obese volunteers with metabolic syndrome. In this
      program, volunteers will be supposed on very low calorie diet with partial diet replacement,
      followed by carefully managed food reintroduction and then weight loss maintenance. In
      addtion, mobile phone applications (apps) will be used during the weight loss program.

      The control group will be involved in a control condition involving a program of metabolic
      support and education, designed to achieve and maintain a 5% decrease in body weight. Mobile
      phone applications (apps) will be alos adopted during the weight loss program.

      The study will also test the effect of intensive lifestyle intervention on appetite, body
      fat, abdominal fat, gut microbiota, bone mineral density, vascular endothelial function, and
      etc.
