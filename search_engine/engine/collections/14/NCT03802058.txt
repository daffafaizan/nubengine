      nab-paclitaxel, carboplatin and thoracic radiotherapy in inoperable local advanced squamous
      cell lung cancer. Patients will be given nab-paclitaxel weekly at a dose of 40mg/m2, in
      combination with carboplatin (AUC 2) weekly during concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Thoracic
      radiation was administered at a dose of 60-66 Gy/30-33 fractions, both 3 dimensional
      conformal and intensity modulated radiation therapy are allowed.
