      infection. PEG-IFN may have less harmful side effects than non-pegylated IFN. Recombinant
      PEG-IFN alfa-2a is a synthetic version of IFN and is used in hepatitis C virus treatment.
      PEG-IFN alfa-2a has demonstrated potentially useful antiviral properties in HIV treatment;
      however, due to the high doses that must be administered to maintain viral suppression,
      toxicity (especially to the blood) is a concern. This study will evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, and antiretroviral activity of PEG-IFN alfa-2a in HIV infected patients who
      have received ART in the past but are currently off ART or who are ART naive.

      The study will last 18 weeks. Participants will receive weekly injections of 180 mcg PEG-IFN
      alfa-2a at the clinic for 12 weeks. After Week 12, participants will be followed
      off-treatment until Week 18. Physical exams will be performed weekly. Blood collection to
      monitor viral load, PEG-IFN alfa-2a serum levels, and CD4 and CD8 counts will be conducted at
      selected weeks during the study. Filgrastim will be given to patients who exhibit neutropenic
      toxicity.
