      taking an important final examination, consisting of a single multiple choice question with
      16 equally appropriate responses, having months or even years to second-guess your choice,
      and then getting a grade but never being told the correct answer.

      Making the choice between these options can be overwhelming, leaving patients feeling both
      disempowered and depersonalized in the decision-making process.

      In order to allow a better, more personalized, decision-making process the investigators
      introduce a side effect aversion calculator, which takes a patient's individual side effect
      aversion profile into consideration when discussing the start of a new disease modifier
      (initial drug, or drug switch). Subjects will be multiple sclerosis patients who have a
      provider-identified need for DMD initiation or DMD switch and receive their care at Duke.
      Recruitment goal is 100 subjects. Those randomized to "calculator arms" will be reminded that
      the purpose of the calculator is to facilitate the DMD choice discussion, NOT make the
      decision. Subjects asked to rate level of concern over adverse events (AEs) across all DMDs.
      Calculator multiplies subject response by the prevalence reported within DMD prescribing
      information. Sum of these weighted scores reveals a DMD's Total Aversion score and medication
      ranking by patient's specific side effect aversion profile, therefore framing discussion.
      Enrollment visit concludes with survey designed to collect MS clinical history, MS symptoms,
      medication history, medication adherence and self-efficacy. This same survey is conducted
      prior to subsequent three clinic visits.
