      of two pain control regimens. The control group received conventional opioid based post
      operative analgesia while the test group received an enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS)
      based anesthesia with use of acetaminophen and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for the
      post operative period with opioid medications available for break through pain only. Pain
      scores (measured on visual analog scale) and opioid use (measured in morphine equivalent
      dose) were measured after completion of the operation.
