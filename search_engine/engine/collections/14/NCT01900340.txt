      convert its anorectic action into useful, safe and effective drugs. So far, it is however not
      clear to what extent GLP-1 is a hormonal regulator of eating or whether the observed effects
      are rather a pharmacological phenomenon. By applying classical algorithms from endocrinology
      several criteria must be fulfilled before a hormone can be considered an endogenous
      physiological satiety signal. One is that exogenous administration of a selective antagonist
      should prevent the eating-inhibitory effect of GLP-1. At present, cholecystokinin (CCK) is
      the only peptide in humans identified to fit these criteria. For intestinal GLP-1, it has not
      been investigated whether a specific GLP-1 receptor antagonist can block the
      eating-inhibitory effect in humans. The availability of a specific GLP-1 receptor antagonist,
      exendin (9-39), now makes it possible to further investigate this pathway. Exendin (9-39), is
      a powerful tool available for human use to characterize of endogenous GLP-1 as a
      physiological regulator of different biological functions. The molecule has been used to
      document that endogenous GLP-1 is an important incretin hormone and a regulator of
      antro-pyloro-duodenal motility. The role of endogenous GLP-1 in regulating food intake and
      appetite has, however, not been investigated before.
