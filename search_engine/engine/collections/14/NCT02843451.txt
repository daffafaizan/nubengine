      thistle) in adults with body dysmorphic disorder. The hypothesis to be tested is that
      silymarin will be more effective and well tolerated in adults with body dysmorphic disorder
      compared to placebo. The proposed study will provide needed data on the treatment of a
      disabling disorder that currently lacks a clearly effective treatment.

      The primary aim of this application is to conduct a randomized placebo-controlled
      pharmacotherapy trial using silymarin (milk thistle) in 15 participants with body dysmorphic
      disorder. The study will consist of three phases: a 4 week active treatment phase with milk
      thistle, a 4 week placebo phase, and a one week wash out phase between the active and placebo
      phases. The subjects will be randomized to either receive active or placebo treatment in the
      first 4 weeks, and the other during the remaining 4 week phase.

      This will be one of few studies assessing the use of pharmacotherapy for the treatment of
      body dysmorphic disorder in adults. Assessing the efficacy and safety of silymarin (milk
      thistle), will help inform clinicians about additional treatment options for adults suffering
      from this disorder.
