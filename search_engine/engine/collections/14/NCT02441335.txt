      perinatal morbidity and mortality. Several genetic and environmental factors have been
      associated with spontaneous preterm birth, but the pathways by which these factors induce
      preterm delivery have not been defined. The March of Dimes CPR at the University of
      Pennsylvania was created to help elucidate the pathogenesis of preterm birth by bringing
      together a diverse team of investigators with expertise in preterm birth, cellular
      metabolism, genetics, mitochondrial functional analyses, genome, epigenome, and transcriptome
      profiling, integrated bioinformatics analyses, and microbiome research. The center will focus
      on addressing the interactions between bioenergetics, genetics, microbiome, abnormal cervical
      remodeling and placental dysfunction. Each one of these factors will be studied independently
      and in relation to the other factors. In order to study metabolic processes in relation to
      spontaneous PTB, a prospective case-control study will be performed. This study will involve
      women with singleton pregnancies with spontaneous preterm labor (PTL), preterm premature
      rupture of membranes (PPROM), and cervical insufficiency, between 20-0/7 and 36-6/7 weeks
      gestational age (cases), and women with term deliveries (38 to 41 weeks gestation, controls).
      The investigators will obtain information regarding the patients' pertinent past medical and
      obstetric histories, and the following specimens will be collected: maternal blood, maternal
      urine, and cervical epithelial cells at enrollment; and umbilical cord blood and placental
      biopsies at delivery. We will follow and record each of these patients' pregnancy outcomes.
