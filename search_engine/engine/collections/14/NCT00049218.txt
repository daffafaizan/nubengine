        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of autologous dendritic cell-adenovirus p53
           vaccine, administered after standard chemotherapy, in patients with extensive stage
           small cell lung cancer.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the development of an anti-p53-specific immune response in these patients
           after treatment with this regimen.

        -  Determine the tumor response rate, time to progression, and overall survival of patients
           treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the frequency of anti-adenovirus immune responses in these patients after
           treatment with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of autologous dendritic cell-adenovirus p53 vaccine.

      Patients undergo leukapheresis and dendritic cells are cultured. Adenovirus carrying p53 gene
      particles are added to the dendritic cells to make the vaccine. Leukapheresis is performed
      before chemotherapy or 8 weeks after the last dose of chemotherapy if the patient has already
      started chemotherapy.

      Patients receive standard chemotherapy before receiving the vaccine. The recommended regimen
      is carboplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1 and etoposide IV over 1 hour on days 1-3. Treatment
      repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients with progressive disease (PD) at 6 weeks after chemotherapy are removed from the
      study.

      Patients are followed at day 140 and then every 3 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 43-58 patients (3-18 for phase I and 40 for phase II) will be
      accrued for this study within 3 years.
