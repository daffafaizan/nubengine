      rAAVrh.74.MHCK7.DYSF.DV transferred to the extensor digitorum brevis muscle (EDB). The study
      is designed as a randomized, controlled, dose escalation trial with one EDB receiving the
      rAAVrh.74.MHCK7.DYSF.DV and the other side receiving saline alone. It will follow the
      previously safe and effective IM gene transfer to EDB for LGMD2D.2, 3 The first cohort,
      inclusive of three Dysferlinopathy subjects, will receive a gene transfer total dose of 2 x
      10^12 vector genomes. Muscle biopsies will be performed at Day 45 (two subjects) and Day 90
      (one subject). If there are no safety concerns, three additional subjects will be enrolled
      and receive an escalated dose at 6 X 10^12 vg (total dose). Muscle biopsies in the second
      cohort will be performed at Day 90 (one subject) and Day 180 (two subjects). This protocol
      design gives us a maximum period of observation ranging from 6 weeks to 6 months to capture
      both transient and delayed gene expression, and to recognize sustained expression.
