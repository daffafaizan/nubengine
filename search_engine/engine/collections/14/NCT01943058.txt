    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (IUS) results in
      histologic regression of the endometrial lesion (complex atypical hyperplasia [CAH] and grade
      1 endometrial cancer [EC]) comparable to that achieved with oral megestrol (megestrol
      acetate).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare both the side effect profiles, such as weight gain and mood changes as well as
      compliance with assigned treatment between the 2 treatment arms.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe fertility-related outcomes, ovulation, menstrual pattern and fertility
      abnormalities determined during usual workup (e.g., semen analysis), pregnancy and delivery
      within 18-months of treatment.

      II. To characterize the incidence of endocrine comorbidities (e.g., hypothyroidism,
      polycystic ovarian syndrome, and diabetes).

      III. To characterize the association of levels of endoplasmic reticular (ER) stress and
      protein kinase B (Akt)-activation in endometrial samples with clinicopathologic-response to
      Progestin (therapeutic progesterone) therapy.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive megestrol acetate orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for up to 18 months
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM B: Patients receive levonorgestrel-releasing IUS with continuous release for up to 18
      months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3 and 6 months.
