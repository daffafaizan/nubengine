    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the efficacy and safety of maintenance midostaurin (a fms related tyrosine
      kinase 3 [FLT3] inhibitor) for elderly patients with FLT3-internal tandem duplication
      (ITD)/tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) mutated acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who were previously
      enrolled on study HEMAML0022/CPKC412AUS27T and have then undergone allogeneic transplant.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether maintenance midostaurin after allogeneic transplant decreases the
      relapse rate in patients with FLT3-ITD/TKD mutated AML.

      OUTLINE:

      Beginning 30 days post-hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), patients receive midostaurin
      orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then up to 1
      year.
