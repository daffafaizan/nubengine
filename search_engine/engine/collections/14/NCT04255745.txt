      understanding of high blood pressure due to sarcopenia, and provide new evidence for the
      discernible relationship between low muscle strength and blood pressure in sarcopenia, and
      effective non-pharmaceutical treatment approaches. This study will evaluate the feasibility
      of recruitment, retention, implementation and adherence to an empirically-based progressive
      resistance training (PRT) intervention to test its effect on blood pressure in a targeted
      population of older adults with sarcopenia who are randomized (via block permuted scheme) to
      the PRT intervention. Built within this randomized control intervention design, the
      investigators will further explore reversibility to examine whether muscle strength serves as
      an intervention target for blood pressure control in sarcopenic adults, which will be more
      appropriately tested in subsequently well-powered R-level intervention studies.
      Physiologically plausible microvascular mechanisms by which the PRT impacts changes in blood
      pressure will also be explored.
