      in combination with Hitachi Preirus Hi-Vision ultrasound processor with installed
      elastography software. Normal international guidelines for staging, diagnosis and specimen
      acquisition will be followed. For a normal evaluation B-mode measurements from all lymph node
      regions are obtained assessing size and standard ultrasound characteristics and all lymph
      nodes in the regions of interest that meet the criteria for fine needle aspiration will be
      sampled. For this study, in addition to the normal B-mode assessment of five sonographic
      B-mode characteristics elastography strain graph video, elastography image, and a strain
      histogram from the region of interest will be obtained.

      Fine needle aspiration for cytology evaluation will be obtained from nodes based on imaging
      characteristics or standard sonography characteristics following current everyday clinical
      practice and the international guidelines. Subsequently, the patient charts will be
      retrospectively analysed after completion of the diagnostic and/or surgical treatment of the
      (suspected) lung cancer to match the obtained imaging data to pathology results (cytology and
      or histology where present) and clinical follow up until 6 months after the diagnostic
      procedure.
