    
      This is a phase III, multinational, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group,
      active and placebo-controlled study to examine CUSA-081 versus placebo or alteplase in
      subjects with dysfunctional non-hemodialysis Central Venous Access Devices (CVADs).

      During the study, the treatment period will consist of one visit which may take place on the
      same day as screening or on the following day. After meeting all inclusion criteria, subjects
      will be randomized in a 9:1:6 ratio of CUSA-081: placebo: alteplase. There will be a
      follow-up assessment performed on Day 30 (Â±2 days) after treatment with study drug.

      Routine blood pressure measurement, heart rate and urine pregnancy test will be performed
      before enrollment in the study. Safety, including Treatment Emergent AEs (TEAEs), Adverse
      Drug Reactions (ADRs) and Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI), will be recorded
      throughout the study. The end of the trial is defined as the last follow-up contact of the
      last subject to receive study drug in the trial.
