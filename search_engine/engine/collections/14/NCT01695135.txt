      physician nor patient knows the treatment that the patient receives) placebo (an inactive
      substance that is compared with a drug to test whether the drug has a real effect in a
      clinical trial)-controlled study with a randomization allocation ratio of 2:1 between the
      abiraterone acetate group (abiraterone acetate plus prednisone) and the placebo group
      (placebo plus prednisone). Approximately 200 (133 in the abiraterone acetate group and 67 in
      the placebo group) medically or surgically castrated male patients with mCRPC who have failed
      docetaxel-based chemotherapy will be enrolled in this study for up to 27 months. The study
      protocol includes the following phases: screening (within 28 days prior to randomization on
      Cycle 1 Day 1), double-blind treatment (28-day cycles until protocol-defined disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity), and survival follow-up (up to Month 60). During the
      follow-up phase, patients with disease progression will be provided open-label (identity of
      assigned study drug will be known) extension treatment with abiraterone acetate. In the event
      of a positive study result at the time of the final analysis, participants in the placebo
      group who have not shown progressive disease in the double-blind treatment Phase of the study
      will be enrolled in an open-label extension treatment with abiraterone acetate treatment
      based on the participant's choice and treating physician's endorsement if they meet the
      criteria for subsequent abiraterone acetate. Abiraterone acetate 1000 mg tablets or placebo
      will be taken orally (by mouth) once daily plus prednisone 5 mg tablet orally twice daily.
      Efficacy and safety will be monitored throughout the study.
