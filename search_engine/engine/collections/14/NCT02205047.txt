    
      This is a randomized phase II trial with an internal control. The randomization will be a
      1:2:2 randomization (control: experimental arm 1: experimental arm 2). Potentially eligible
      patients will be screened centrally for the HER-2 status. After confirmation of HER-2
      positive disease, eligible patients will be centrally randomized through the EORTC
      randomization system. A minimization technique will be used for random treatment allocation
      between the three treatment arms. Stratification will be done by histological subtype
      (intestinal/non-intestinal); Korea versus Europe; stage II versus III; node positive versus
      node negative.
