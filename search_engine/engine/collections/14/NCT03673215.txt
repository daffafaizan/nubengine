    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, dose-escalation phase Ia study to
      evaluate the tolerability, safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of recombinant human
      thrombopoietin. According Child- Pugh class of liver function impairment and different dose
      of recombinant human thrombopoietin, nine arms be designed in this study. Each subject in Arm
      A will be only administered recombinant human thrombopoietin. Each subject in Arm B and C
      will be randomly assigned to accept either recombinant human thrombopoietin or placebo in 5:1
      ratio.
