    
      The progression free survival (PFS) expected for lymphoplasmacytic/lymphoplasmocytoid
      lymphoma/Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia with the same characteristics indicated into the study
      and treated with standard Rituximab plus chemotherapy may be estimated to be 50% at 18
      months.

      The Investigators would consider a positive result to increase 18 months-PFS rate from 50 to
      65%.
