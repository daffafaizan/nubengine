      adherence. One hundred twenty adults with major depressive disorder (MDD) who are initiating
      antidepressant treatment will be randomized in equal proportion to 1) usual care, 2) usual
      care and an escalating daily financial incentive for 6 weeks, or 3) usual care and a
      de-escalating financial incentive for daily antidepressant adherence for 6 weeks. Study
      patients will participate in three assessments over a 12 week period as well as passive
      monitoring of antidepressant daily adherence through a wireless electronic pill bottle over
      the same 12 week period. The primary outcome will be the number of antidepressant daily doses
      taken during the initial six weeks of treatment. The secondary outcome will be daily
      adherence during the next six weeks following the discontinuation of the intervention.
