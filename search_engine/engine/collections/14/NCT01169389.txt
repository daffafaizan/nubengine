      anaesthetic. Hyaluronic acid supplementation given at the time of knee arthroscopy has not
      been fully evaluated as a possible alternative. We have studied the efficacy of a hyaluronic
      acid (HA) supplement (Durolane®) and a local anaesthetic (Bupivacaine) at providing early and
      short-term post-operative analgesic control following knee arthroscopy.Patients will be
      randomised to receive either 10mls of 0.5% Bupivacaine or 10mls of Durolane® into the joint
      immediately after completion of surgery. WOMAC and Tegner-Lysholm scores were obtained at
      baseline then at 1, 2, and 6-weeks post surgery. VAS pain scores were obtained at baseline; 1
      and 24-hours; and 1, 2 and 6 weeks following surgery.
