    
      The Phase 1 study is a double-blind, multiple ascending dose trial evaluating a total of 64
      patients across two dose cohort groups. Each cohort will include 32 patients (24 active; 8
      placebo) who will be randomized to receive three doses of either PNT001 or placebo. Doses
      studied will be 1000mg and 2700mg.

      Patients admitted to the trauma center who meet entrance criteria will receive their first
      dose of study drug within 24 hours of documented TBI. They will remain in the facility for at
      least 2 nights. Baseline plasma and CSF biomarker collection and cognitive assessments will
      be completed. Study medication will be administered as an IV infusion over 30 minutes
      followed by collection of safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic, biomarker, imaging, and
      cognitive data over 12 weeks. Once discharged, patients will be instructed to return for
      study visits.

      Subsequent visits for dosing will include a lumbar puncture (LP; Day 28) for pharmacokinetics
      (PK) and biomarkers followed by safety, PK, biomarker and clinical assessments.
