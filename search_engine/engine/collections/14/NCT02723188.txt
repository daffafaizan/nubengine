      and stress-related disorders. Moreover, considerable translational research examines the
      neural correlates of these processes. However, virtually no research in humans manipulates
      neural correlates of these processes, which limits basic-clinical integration. The present
      study aimed to use transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) to modulate processes associated
      with fear extinction in order to assess the potential utility of tES in enhancing
      exposure-based treatment. To this end, healthy participants underwent a three-day fear
      conditioning and extinction paradigm. Participants were randomly assigned into 3 groups,
      differing in terms of tES applied during the extinction learning phase (Day 2) and targeting
      the medial prefrontal cortex: 1) direct current (DC) stimulation, aimed at enhancing
      extinction learning; 2) alternate current (AC) stimulation, aimed at interfering with
      reconsolidation of the fear memory activated during the extinction phase; and 3) sham
      stimulation. The outcome measures (outlined next) involve the assessment of extinction recall
      during a test phase (Day 3). Successful modulation of extinction learning by tES would be
      reflected in enhanced extinction recall.
