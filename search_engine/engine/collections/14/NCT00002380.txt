    
      This Phase I/II study will be conducted in 2 parts each lasting at least 24 weeks.
      Pharmacokinetics and safety data for part 1, a treatment regimen containing saquinavir and
      nucleoside antiretrovirals, will be collected for 8 weeks before proceeding to part 2. During
      the first 8 weeks, pharmacokinetic data will be analyzed to allow dose adjustments for
      individual patients and to confirm the starting dose estimates for part 2. In addition,
      safety data will be reviewed to ensure that saquinavir is well tolerated with nucleoside
      antiretrovirals before it is combined with a second protease inhibitor. In part 2, saquinavir
      will be combined with nelfinavir, a protease inhibitor recently approved for use in children.
      The pharmacokinetics and safety profile of these drugs in combination will be determined.
