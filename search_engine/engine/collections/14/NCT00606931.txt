      breast cancer who have one or more breast abnormalities moderately suspicious or highly
      suggestive of malignancy on breast imaging and requiring biopsy (the lesion(s) of interest).
      Prospective subjects will be asked to sign IRB-approved consent forms, explaining the use of
      PET imaging for guiding biopsy of suspicious lesion(s). Up to 30 patients will be recruited
      in the study. The study will be terminated after approximately 20 subjects undergo PET-guided
      interventional procedures. In the course of the study, a subject will be injected with
      18F-FDG and imaged using the PEM Flex PET scanner. Once an abnormality requiring biopsy is
      identified on the PET scan, the physician conducting the procedure will use the PET image to
      plan the biopsy trajectory using the Stereo Navigator Software Module, and use the Stereo
      Navigator Needle Guide Holder to guide insertion of the introducing stylet toward the lesion.
      The sampling will be performed using commercially available core biopsy tools routinely used
      for MRI-guided biopsy.Immediately after the PET-guided biopsy, conventional biopsy markers
      will be inserted at the biopsy site(s) for correlation with other imaging modalities.
      Placement of the biopsy marker will be documented using mammography, as per standard clinical
      practice. Histopathologic results will be correlated with imaging findings. The procedure may
      be repeated for additional lesions identified on PET at the investigator's discretion.
