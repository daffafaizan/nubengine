      the uteri-sacral ligaments (USL)and the pubourethral ligaments (PUL). In a preliminary study
      (URGE I) we repaired the USL by cesa or vasa. Those patients who are still incontinent after
      cesa and vasa get the repair of the PUL by means of trans-obturator tapes (TOT). That
      treatment is compared to conservative medical treatment. Cross over after completion of three
      months is possible if no continence is achieved.
