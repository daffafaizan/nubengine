        -  Determine the effect of adjuvant sunitinib malate, tamoxifen citrate, and cisplatin on
           disease-free survival and overall survival of patients with high-risk ocular melanoma
           who have undergone primary therapy.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.

      Patients receive oral sunitinib malate once daily on days 1-21, oral tamoxifen citrate twice
      daily on days 1-7, and cisplatin IV on days 2 and 3. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 4
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 2 months for 2 years.
