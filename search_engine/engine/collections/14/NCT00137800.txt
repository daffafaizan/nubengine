      number of cycles or planned dose interruptions. For the purposes of evaluation, toxicity and
      efficacy, a four week (28 day period) will be considered 1 cycle.

      Patients will continue to receive OSI-774 until they develop progressive disease,
      unacceptable side-effects or wish to withdraw from the study.

      Patients will have radiographic evaluations after every two cycles of therapy. After cycle 2,
      patients will also be evaluated by FDG-PET scanning.

      Patients will also be asked to fill out a Lung Cancer Symptom Scale (LCSS) on the first day
      of each cycle.

      Bloodwork will also be performed on day 1 of each cycle as well as at the end of the study.
