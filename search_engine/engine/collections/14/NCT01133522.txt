      subcutaneous placebo or evolocumab and enrolled sequentially into one of 5 dose-escalation
      cohorts:

        1. Evolocumab 14 mg/placebo once weekly (QW) × 6 doses

        2. Evolocumab 35 mg/placebo once weekly (QW) × 6 doses

        3. Evolocumab 140 mg/placebo every 2 weeks (Q2W) × 3 doses

        4. Evolocumab 280 mg/placebo every 2 weeks (Q2W) × 3 doses

        5. Evolocumab 420 mg/placebo every 4 weeks (Q2W) × 2 doses.

      Participants receiving high-dose statins were randomized 1:3 to receive subcutaneous placebo
      or evolocumab 140 mg every 2 weeks × 3 doses (Cohort 6).

      Participants diagnosed with familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) were randomized 1:2 to
      receive subcutaneous placebo or evolocumab 140 mg every 2 weeks × 3 doses (Cohort 7).
