      usual weekly therapy in treating Cerebral Palsy (CP) in children 2-8 years of age for motor
      rehabilitation. In this prospective randomized controlled trial (RCT), 108 children ages 2 to
      8 years of age with CP will be enrolled and assigned to one of 2 service delivery models: 1
      hour per day, 1 x per week for 40 weeks (usual weekly); and 2 hours every weekday for two
      10-consecutive-weekdays (total 4 weeks), for a repeated "periodic" bout (high intense
      periodic). Participants unable to consent to randomization are allowed to chose a treatment
      group. All patients enrolled in ACHIEVE will also have 1 hour per month of Physical Therapy
      Consultation (PTC) during the treatment period of 40 weeks (9 months). PTCs provide monthly
      motor skill monitoring, consultation, and home therapy program progression. Outcome
      evaluations will be performed by blinded evaluators at baseline (month 0, before treatment),
      month 9 for all patients to assess short term effects, and at months 12 and 18 for patients
      to assess long term effects. Parent surveys will be collected at 0, 4.5, and 9 months only
      (PC-2). Short-term and long-term effects will be analyzed to determine individual differences
      in children's response to intensity. A subset will be analyzed at 12 and 18 month.
