      demonstrated clinical benefit as far as improving survival or decreasing risk of progression
      to AIDS. The results of the two landmark, international, multicenter, phase III, randomized
      trials of IL-2 in HIV infected participants (SILCAAT and ESPRIT) have been recently
      published. These trials, which started more than a decade ago, enrolled over 5800
      participants who were randomized to anti-retroviral therapy (ART) +/- IL-2 and showed no
      benefit to IL-2 treatment in survival or progression to AIDS. Many individuals with HIV
      infection can lead normal lives on ART but replication-competent virus remains within resting
      CD4+ cells, referred to as the "HIV reservoir". There is a renewed interest in strategies to
      decrease or eliminate the viral reservoir in an attempt to provide a sterilizing or a
      functional "cure" for HIV that would allow the discontinuation of ART, which currently must
      be taken life-long. These therapies have long-term metabolic and cardiovascular toxicities as
      well as substantial cost. More recent data suggest that IL-2 administration may decrease the
      size of the HIV reservoir, getting ART-treated participants closer to levels of HIV
      persistence that may ultimately allow for sterilizing or functional cure.

      The purpose of this pilot study is to examine the effects of eight 5-day cycles of
      subcutaneous recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2) given every 8 weeks on levels of
      replication-competent HIV in CD4 cells and on the size of HIV viral reservoir in up to 20
      participants with chronically suppressed HIV infection (viral load <50 copies/mL).
