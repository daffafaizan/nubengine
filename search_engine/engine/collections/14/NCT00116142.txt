      high-risk prostate cancer. In this study, we want to see whether or not adding the
      chemotherapy drug docetaxel (Taxotere)will make this treatment more effective. Docetaxel has
      shown a benefit in median survival when given to men who have become resistant to hormonal
      therapy and in men who have metastatic prostate cancer (spread to other areas of the body).
