        -  To compare the relapse-free survival of patients treated with radiotherapy and cisplatin
           with vs without fluorouracil.

        -  To compare the overall survival, local control without surgery, and patterns of failure
           in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  To compare the acute and long-term toxicity of these regimens in these patients.

        -  To compare the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  To prospectively collect biopsy material, mucosal scrapings, and serum in an effort to
           generate hypotheses for future correlative studies.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to radiotherapy
      schedule (once daily vs twice daily) and radiotherapy planning (2D vs 3D vs
      intensity-modulated radiotherapy). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo full-dose radiotherapy once or twice daily 5 days a week for up
           to 7 weeks and receive cisplatin IV over 1 hour on days 1, 22, and 43 of radiotherapy.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo radiotherapy as in arm I and receive fluorouracil IV and
           cisplatin IV continuously on days 1-4 and 22-25 of radiotherapy.

      Patients with biopsy-verified residual disease at the primary site or local recurrence after
      achieving a complete response to chemoradiotherapy may undergo salvage surgery 12 weeks after
      the completion of chemoradiotherapy.

      Patients complete questionnaires periodically to assess late toxicity and quality of life.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.
