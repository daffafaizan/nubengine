      learning and functioning in school. Poor sustained attention is a relatively common problem
      in childhood with as many as 24% of children exhibiting frequent inattention. Children with
      attentional difficulties are at increased risk for a variety of negative educational
      outcomes, including lower standardised grades, dropping out of school and repeating a year.
      This evidence highlights the need to develop interventions aimed at enhancing students'
      sustained attention capacity. Current school-based interventions for student attention
      problems include intervention strategies targeting behavioural, academic and self-regulation.
      However, none of these interventions aim to enhance attentional capacity. Attention network
      training (or attention training) has been identified as a potentially promising intervention
      for enhancing attentional capacity. This pilot study aimed to evaluate the preliminary
      efficacy of a theory-driven attention training programme, Keeping Score!, in improving
      students' capacity to sustain attention in a school setting. Training was based on sustained
      updating. Children engaged this process by mentally keeping score during an interactive
      face-to-face game without external aids. The study used a cluster randomised design. Students
      (N = 36) were assigned based on their class group to either the 6-week attention training
      programme (n = 18) or an active control (n = 18). Outcome measures were assessed at baseline,
      immediately after training and an approximate 6-week follow up.
