      likely to die from infection during the neonatal and infant periods than infants born at
      term. While studies have demonstrated that premature infants have decreased adaptive and
      innate immune responses compared with infants born at term, there has been little
      investigation into whether this impaired immunity improves and becomes similar to full term
      infants once the ex-preterm infants reach term-corrected gestational age. There have likewise
      not been studies to determine whether specific immune markers may predict the risk of
      developing sepsis. Given the immaturity of the preterm immune system and the many potential
      infectious and inflammatory insults they are exposed to during the preterm period
      (infections, poor nutrition, stress, steroid therapy), there is also a possibility that the
      relative immune deficiency experienced by preterm infants may persist into infancy.

      The goal of this study is to determine whether former preterm infants have sustained
      differences in immunity compared to age-matched controls, which would have significant
      implications for infection risk and response to vaccination. Additionally, this study hopes
      to examine whether certain immune system abnormalities make certain babies more likely to
      have a serious infection. The present study will assess composition and function of T and B
      cell compartments in preterm and former preterm infants.
