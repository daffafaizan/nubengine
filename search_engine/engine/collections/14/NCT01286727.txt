      days after transplantation although the definition can also include failure to improve
      preexisting renal function. DGF is an important problem in renal allograft transplantation
      that affects approximately 25% of transplanted cadaveric kidneys. It has generally been
      observed that delayed graft function has been associated with reduced graft survival. In
      addition to an association of DGF with graft loss, DGF imposes an economic burden due to
      prolonged hospitalization and dialysis. The strongest association with occurrence of DGF is
      ischemia around the time of transplantation. Aside from approaches to minimize ischemia time
      and use of antibody induction, there are no good specific therapeutic options to prevent or
      treat delayed graft function. This study is designed to evaluate the safety and activity of
      an investigational drug in improving renal function in patients who have undergone renal
      transplantation and have signs and symptoms of significant renal injury and are at risk for
      dialysis.
