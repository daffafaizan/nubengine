      the sample size based on the fixed dose recommended by the results of previous dose
      exploration studies in order to further evaluate the study drug's efficacy and safety with
      overall objective tumor response rate (ORR) as the primary efficacy evaluation indicator, and
      further evaluate subjects' duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS),
      disease control rate (DCR), overall survival (OS) and quality of life (QoL). Safety
      indicators of subjects are further evaluated through adverse events, vital signs and clinical
      laboratory parameters.
