      and severity of mouth pain caused by radiation therapy to the oral cavity. II. Evaluate the
      toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study. Patients are
      stratified according to dentures (yes vs no), smoking history (none vs currently vs past
      only), radiation therapy (primary vs postoperative adjuvant), planned radiation dose
      (5000-6000 cGy vs greater than 6000 cGy), planned fluoride use (yes vs no), and amount of
      oral mucosa in radiation field (one- to two-thirds vs greater than two-thirds). Patients
      receive one lozenge orally of capsaicin or placebo four times daily. Treatment begins within
      the first 3 days of radiation therapy and continues during and for two weeks after radiation
      therapy is completed.
