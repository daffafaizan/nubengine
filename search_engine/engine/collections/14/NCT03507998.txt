      tolerated dose of CGX1321 when administered to subjects with advanced GI tumors that have
      relapsed or are refractory to or not considered medically suitable to receive standard of
      care treatment.

      Once the dose is identified in the Dose Escalation Phase, the Dose Expansion Phase will
      start. The purpose of the Dose Expansion Phase is to continue to examine the safety and
      confirm the final Phase 2 dose of CGX1321 when administered to subjects with advanced GI
      tumors who meet the entry criteria.
