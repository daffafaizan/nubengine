    
      An open-label, non-randomized, two-stage, multicenter study evaluating clinical efficacy,
      safety, and pharmacokinetics effects of PQR309 in patients with relapsed or refractory
      Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma (PCNSL).

      The first stage of the study will enroll a minimum of 12 patients with relapsed or refractory
      Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma (PCNSL) evaluable for the primary study objective. If
      during the first stage of the study data emerge that 80 mg p.o. qd is not adequately
      tolerated or is inefficacious in patients with relapsed or refractory Primary Central Nervous
      System Lymphoma (PCNSL), additional patients may be enrolled in the study to evaluate
      alternative dosing regimens, either a lower daily dose (eg. 60 mg) or a lower weekly dose
      with administration on 2 consecutive days followed by 5 days without treatment in 7-day
      treatment cycles (intermittent dosing schedule A).In all cases data from at least 12
      evaluable patients will be required on the selected dosing regimen (daily or weekly) before
      the decision is made to proceed with this regimen into the second stage of the study.Nine (9)
      additional patients will be enrolled for the second stage of the study, for a minimum of 21
      patients on the selected dosing regimen in total, evaluable for the final primary endpoint
      analysis.All patients evaluable for the primary endpoint will be followed until disease
      progression or death.

      Secondary objectives, PQR309 treatment safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) will be evaluated in
      all enrolled patients in both study stages.
