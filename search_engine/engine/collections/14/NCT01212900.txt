      to lipid lowering to standard therapy guided by clinical risk factors and blood lipid levels.
      Men and women over age 55 who are candidates for statin therapy will be randomized to usual
      cholesterol lowering care, or to care guided by MRI images of the carotid arteries.
      Participants randomized to the second, imaging guided, group will be assigned to LDL
      cholesterol targets according to the degree of atherosclerosis seen by MRI. The study
      endpoints will be the total degree of plaque regression seen, the dosage of statin drugs
      required to achieve that reduction, and the rate of cardiovascular events.

      FDG-PET is hypothesized to enable visualization of anti-inflammatory effects of statins that
      most likely occur before anatomic regression of the plaques can be demonstrated on MRI. A
      pilot substudy is to be conducted to explore this relationship. A subgroup of patients
      participating in the main study will be asked to participate in FDG PET imaging. The purpose
      of this pilot study is to determine if FDG avid lesions undergo a greater degree of
      morphologic regression with therapy controlling for the reduction in LDL cholesterol and the
      dosage of statins required to achieve that target.

      Although contrast-enhanced coronary CT angiography (CTA) with multidetector computed
      tomography (MDCT) has been used extensively to characterize coronary artery plaque
      composition, there is little data regarding its reproducibility. A recent study demonstrated
      excellent reproducibility for this technique but this study was performed using the older 64
      detector row CT scanners2. A pilot substudy will be conducted to study the reproducibility of
      coronary CT angiography using the newer generation of 320 detector row CT scanners.
