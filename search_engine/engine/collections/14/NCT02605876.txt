      walking gait biomechanics in manners that contribute to development of knee osteoarthritis.
      Current rehabilitation techniques are minimally effective for addressing these complications
      and preventing knee osteoarthritis. Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction dramatically
      increases the risk of knee osteoarthritis, and represents an ideal model for evaluating novel
      rehabilitation techniques for preventing knee osteoarthritis.

      Direct (local muscle vibration) and indirect (whole body vibration) vibratory stimuli enhance
      quadriceps function and proprioception, and may improve rehabilitation and reduce the risk of
      knee osteoarthritis. The purpose of this investigation is to determine and compare the acute
      effects of whole body vibration and local muscle vibration on quadriceps function, knee
      proprioception, and gait biomechanics in individuals with anterior cruciate ligament
      reconstruction. The investigators hypothesize that vibratory stimuli will enhance quadriceps
      function, knee proprioception, and gait biomechanics in manners that would reduce the risk of
      developing knee osteoarthritis, and that whole body vibration and local muscle vibration will
      produce equivalent improvements in these characteristics.
