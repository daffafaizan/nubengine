    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-centre trial to evaluate the
      safety and efficacy of ambrisentan for the treatment of severe COVID-19. The population
      consists of hospitalized subjects who have a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 (a coronavirus (CoV) )
      infection, are at high-risk of progression to respiratory failure or death and have low
      oxygen saturation and/or require oxygen supplementation at the time of admission. Pregnant or
      lactating women will not be allowed to participate in this study given the teratogenic
      potential of ambrisentan. Subjects requiring mechanical ventilation or intubation at the time
      of enrolment are considered to have respiratory failure and will not be allowed into the
      study, as one primary objective of the study is to evaluate the effect of ambrisentan in
      preventing respiratory failure.

      Enrolled subjects will be randomly assigned to the treatment arm or control arm at a 1:1
      ratio. In the treatment arm, subjects will receive ambrisentan on top of the
      standard-of-care. In the control arm, subjects will receive the administration vehicle only
      (i.e., placebo) and on top of the standard of care. The study medication (ambrisentan or
      placebo) will be administered for up to 28 days. In the event that the subject is discharged
      between Day 4 and Day 28, the subject will continue the study treatment at home until
      completion of the 28-day study medication regimen. Investigators, the Sponsor and the subject
      will be blinded to the treatment assignment. A Drug Safety Monitoring Board will be
      monitoring the safety of the study.
