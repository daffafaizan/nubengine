      be identified for potential enrollment in this study. Enrolled patients will first be asked
      to complete questionnaires to assess their symptoms and risk of having sleep apnea.

      Relevant information will be obtained from the electronic medical record (age, gender, body
      mass index, co-morbidities, medications, prior echocardiography results). Subjects will then
      undergo a "type III" portable monitoring sleep study on the first or second night of their
      hospital admission, which measures respiratory effort, nasal airflow, oxyhemoglobin
      saturation, and heart rate. Blood samples will be collected on the evening before (08:00 PM
      +/- 2 hours), and the morning after (06:00 AM +/-2 hours) sleep apnea testing. If not
      otherwise obtained clinically, echocardiography will be obtained within 48 hours of
      admission. After a period of medical management for acutely decompensated heart failure,
      subjects will then have a second portable sleep apnea study (with associated pre and
      post-sleep blood draws) on the evening prior to discharge (approximately hospital day 5 or
      6). Later, clinical outcomes such as incidence of renal dysfunction, hospital length of stay
      etc. will be collected from the electronic medical record. Blood samples will be processed,
      stored, and subsequently analyzed for high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T and I.
