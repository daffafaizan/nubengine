      experiences. One such problem is posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which involves
      symptoms such as persistent unwanted memories of traumatic events, avoidance of reminders of
      the events, excessive watchfulness, jumpiness and irritability. Current therapies for PTSD
      focus chiefly on fear related to life-threat and were developed chiefly on civilians. We
      developed and piloted tested a psychological treatment for PTSD specifically for service
      members who suffer not only life-threat, but also traumatic loss and inner conflicts from
      morally challenging experiences. This intervention, Adaptive Disclosure (AD) is an
      eight-session PTSD treatment that helps Marines to identify unhelpful beliefs about a
      traumatic event and find ways to move forward. Preliminary clinical data suggests that AD is
      acceptable to Marines, feasible to implement, and safe and that it reduces PTSD and
      depression. The primary objective of this randomized controlled non-inferiority trial is to
      determine whether or not AD is as least as effective as Cognitive Processing Therapy,
      cognitive only version (CPT-C), which is an empirically validated and commonly used PTSD
      treatment.

      We plan to recruit 266 Marines for this project. They will be randomly assigned to AD or
      CPT-C and followed during and after treatment. The groups will be compared on measures of
      mental health (particularly PTSD and depression), work-related functioning, trauma-related
      beliefs, coping and attitudes about mental health care.
