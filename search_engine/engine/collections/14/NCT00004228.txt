    
      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the event-free survival and overall survival of children or adolescents with
           newly diagnosed disseminated stage III or IV lymphoblastic lymphoma treated with 4
           chemotherapy regimens*.

        -  Determine whether treatment with a regimen without methotrexate maintains the same
           disease-free survival as NHL/BFM 90 in these patients.

        -  Determine whether intensification with anthracycline and cyclophosphamide improves
           disease-free survival in these patients.

        -  Collect outcome data on uniformly treated patients with localized disease or
           CNS-positive disease.

        -  Determine whether rapid reduction in tumor volume by chest radiography and CT scan is
           predictive of improved outcome in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Determine the prevalence of bone marrow involvement at presentation in these patients.

        -  Determine whether peripheral blood can replace bone marrow in the initial staging of
           these patients.

        -  Determine the clinical significance of bone marrow and peripheral blood involvement in
           these patients.

      NOTE: *All patients as of 4/2006 receive treatment on Arm III regimen only

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified by disease characteristics (disseminated lymphoblastic
      lymphoma vs localized lymphoblastic lymphoma [localized lymphoblastic lymphoma is closed to
      accrual as of 10/2005]) and age. Patients with CNS negative disseminated lymphoblastic
      lymphoma are randomized to 1 of 4 treatment arms*. Patients with testicular involvement at
      diagnosis are nonrandomly assigned to arm IV and do not receive testicular radiotherapy.
      Patients with localized lymphoblastic lymphoma (closed to accrual as of 10/2005) are not
      randomized.
