      Primary

        -  Determine the time to progression in patients with locally advanced unresectable or
           metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma treated with bevacizumab,
           oxaliplatin, and docetaxel.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the response rate in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine time to treatment failure and overall survival of patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine the changes in general and disease-specific quality of life, in terms of
           response to treatment, in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes, oxaliplatin IV over 120 minutes, and
      docetaxel IV over 60 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving a complete response (CR) receive 2
      additional courses beyond CR.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 38 patients will be accrued for this study within 18-23 months.
