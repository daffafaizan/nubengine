      echocardiography. Exercise was performed on treadmills under close supervision of an exercise
      physiologist. Patients had to complete over 70% of sessions to be included in analysis. Three
      sessions were scheduled every week. Heart rate (HR) was about 85 % of max HR in the high
      intensity group, and about 65 % in the moderate intensity group.
