      decreased mortality rates as a result of increased screening and prevention methods when a
      person is known to be at high risk. Though there are several risk assessment models that are
      commonly used, it is important to continue to improve the process of calculating risk.
      Several genetic markers have been noted to potentially indicate risk of developing breast
      cancer. New tests, called SNP panels, can detect some of these genetic markers. This study
      aims to use both these SNP panels and the commonly used risk models to calculate risk and
      examine outcomes in women coming in to do screening mammography. This study will enroll women
      between the ages of 40-65 who are undergoing screening mammography (n=1000), in addition to
      women with BIRADS category 4 mammogram readings who are about to undergo biopsy (n=600), all
      with no personal history of breast or ovarian cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), mantle
      radiation, or known BRCA 1/2/mutation in self or family members. The participants will only
      be expected rto provide consent, swabs of the inside of the cheek of her mouth, and baseline
      questionnaire answers that will allow for a risk assessment to be performed.
