      the method of super centrifugation to create gradient segments in sucrose sugar produced by
      IVAC, or placebo produced by IVAC. Vaccines are produced on eggs, inactivated with
      formaldehyde. The dose of the vaccine tested was 15 mcg of HA for each antigen component in
      0.5 ml. The influenza virus strains used to produce the 2020-2021 seasonal vaccine will also
      be provided by the NIBSC, which will be used according to WHO recommendations, which are
      expected to include the following Southern Hemisphere strains:

      Influenza A / H1N1 strain: Recombinant strain IVR-190 44250 E12 of the strain (A / Brisbane /
      02/2018).

      Influenza strain A / H3N2: strain IVR-197 (H3N2) 44850 E14 recombinant strain (A / South
      Australia / 34/2019).

      Flu strain B (B / Washington / February 2019). Extensive phase 3 was conducted 2 sites:
      District Health Center (DHC) of Vu Thu, Thai Binh, Vietnam; and DHC of Binh Luc, Ha Nam.
      Subjects were from two age groups: 6 months-under 18 years and over 60 years. Both safety and
      immunogenicity were assessed
