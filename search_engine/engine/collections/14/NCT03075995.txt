      ,those overexpress the HER2 are associated with a higher risk. Lapatinib is approved for use
      to treat advanced metastatic breast cancer. The pharmacokinetic parameters of lapatinib have
      been characterized previously.It can reach steady state concentration after 6 or 7 days oral
      dosing, but the bioavailability is very different between different patients. The effect of
      food on lapatinib pharmacokinetics in humans was first examined in 19 healthy participants
      who were given single 100-mg doses with a high-fat breakfast. Food caused a 60% increase in
      the relative bioavailability of lapatinib.Another test showed that the bioavailability of
      lapatinib was 3 times more in low-fat diet than in emptiness.

      Some investigators think that it can change the mode for taking lapatinib with food or
      without food to enhance the absorption.It may decrease the oral dose but the lapatinib can
      reach the same steady state concentration,so it can achieve maximum economic benefits.

      By continuous change for lapatinib and fat diet, The change of lapatinib pharmacokinetic is
      lack of discussion. If the adverse reactions increase since the absorption of lapatinib
      increase, the existing research data are still lacking.

      The trial By examine the steady blood drug concentration in the same individual at different
      treatment mode for lapatinib, emptiness or taken with fatty food, discuss the best mode of
      taking lapatinib with fatty food.
