        -  Determine the efficacy and toxicity of cisplatin, paclitaxel, and gemcitabine in
           patients with progressive unresectable regional or metastatic transitional cell
           carcinoma of the bladder.

        -  Determine the progression free survival of these patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8, and cisplatin IV over 1 hour
      and paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 6 courses.

      Patients are followed every 3 months until disease progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 39 patients will be accrued for this study within 18 months.
