      dependent as 70% of AF patients is between 65 and 85 years old. With increasing life
      expectancy, AF prevalence will increase 2,5 times during the next 50 years and constitute an
      even more important health concern. In younger patients Pulmonary vein ablation is an
      accepted procedure with superior efficacy compared to medical treatment. In this study the
      safety and efficacy of PVI in patients over 70 years old will be evaluated.
