        1. to establish if patients affected by dry AMD have a different speed discriminating
           threshold using peripheral vision fields than their healthy counterparts.

        2. to determine if the driving skills of AMD and glaucoma patients differ from healthy
           controls.

      Two tasks will be used: 1) A speed discrimination test. (Glaucoma patient are not asked to
      perform this task as it assesses the peripheral visual fields, which is affected by the
      disease.) 2) A driving simulation session. Participant will undergo both tests on the same
      day, no later than a month after the initial recruitement visit.

      For both diseases, patients will be compared to healthy controls matched for age and gender,
      but also to a younger control group. The latter group was added in order to take into account
      the normal aging impact on driving skills (visual and cognitive).

      Our hypothesis is that AMD patient will show a better speed discriminating threshold than
      matched control and maybe better or equal to the younger control groups. We also hypothesize
      that driving skills involving peripheric speed awareness, such as passing another car, will
      be enhanced in the AMD group when compared to glaucoma patients and age-matched control
      group.
