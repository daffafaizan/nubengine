    
      -  For potential candidates for this trial, the recommended acute GVHD prophylaxis is a
           tacrolimus, methotrexate and atorvastatin combination. However, any acute GVHD
           prophylaxis regimen at the discretion of treating physician (not involving in vivo or ex
           vivo T-cell depletion, cluster of differentiation 34 (CD34) + cell selection, or
           post-HCT cyclophosphamide) will be permitted.

        -  During the phase I portion for chronic GVHD prophylaxis, four doses of MLN9708 will be
           administered orally (to patients undergoing either matched sibling or unrelated donor
           transplantation) on days 1, 8, 15 and 22, starting on day +60 to +74 post allogeneic
           HCT.

      If zero of three patients experienced DLT at dose level 2, then it would be considered a MTD.
      If two or more patients experienced a DLT, dose escalation would halt and the dose level
      would be expanded to six patients to determine the MTD. If the dose level below already has
      six patients, enrolled, then it will be considered the MTD. If two or more patients
      experience DLT on first dose level (i.e., dose level 1), then, patients will be enrolled on
      dose level -1. No intrapatient dose escalation will be permitted.

        -  MTD is defined at maximum dose level with fewer than two of six patients experiencing
           DLT.

        -  The phase II portion will utilize the MTD for MLN9708, determined from phase I portion
           of the study. In phase II, patients will be enrolled in two independent cohorts of
           matched sibling and matched unrelated donor transplants.

        -  During the phase II portion, for chronic GVHD prophylaxis, four doses of MLN9708 will be
           administered orally on days 1, 8, 15 and 22, starting on day +60 to +90 post allogeneic
           HCT.
