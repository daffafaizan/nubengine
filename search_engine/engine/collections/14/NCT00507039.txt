      Specific provocation with inhaled allergens is an established tool in clinical practice and
      research, supporting the understanding of pathophysiology of allergic asthma, and analysing
      the efficacy of new therapies. This study examines the repeatability of a bolus-dose
      inhalative allergen challenge with grass pollen.

      Method:

      Forty grass pollen allergics should undergo an incremental-dose grass pollen challenge to
      calculate their PD20-dose. This calculated dose will be applicated twice to analyse the
      repeatability of the bolus dose challenge. Before and twenty-four hours after the
      provocation, exhaled nitric oxid (FeNO) will be determined as a marker of bronchial
      inflammation.
