      physicians. Efficacy of conventional treatment, such as surgery, radiotherapy and
      chemotherapy is limited. AS novel therapy, immunotherapy shows great prospects.

      Human iNKT cells can directly lysis tumor cells by a perforin-dependent mechanism,and
      intracellular granzyme B expression may also potentiate cell killing. Tumor cells expressing
      CD1d may be especially susceptible to direct NKT cell lysis. iNKT cells play important role
      in immune regulation by secreting various cytokines. Expansion method of iNKT cells in vitro
      is developed as published in the patent of the investigators. Infusion of iNKT cells has been
      proved safe in mice.

      In this clinical trial, the safety and efficacy of the immunotherapy of infusion of iNKT
      cells are assessed.
