      focus was on remote visibility and thus better handling of daily activities.

      Therapy with high-contrast administration is used for amblyopia in childhood. Furthermore,
      simulation therapy is used in hemianopsia in the adult age, in which case the lesion is
      usually not located in the eye.

      This stimulating therapy for children and adult patients led to the hypothesis that this
      treatment could also improve AMD's situation. The entire visual procedure also shows the
      possibility of change even in adult patients.

      The presented study investigates if regular training with a device that provides a moving
      grating-stimulus, the "Medical Eye Trainer" (MET), can improve the subjective perception of
      visual performance during typical activities of daily living. The aims of the study were not
      to show improvement of reading vision nor to show changes in the retinal structure.
