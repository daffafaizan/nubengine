      lead to cirrhosis and liver transplantation. Transplant infection by hepatitis C virus is
      constant after transplantation. A main factor determining the severity of recurrent hepatitis
      C after transplantation may be immunosuppression. Thus optimization of immunosuppressive
      regimens might be a key aspect to improve the prognosis of chronic hepatitis C in
      transplanted patients. The two most frequently used immunosuppressive drugs are cyclosporin
      and tacrolimus. However, it has been shown that virus replication could be inhibited by
      cyclosporin, through the blockade of cyclophilins, decreasing hepatitis C viral load and
      improving liver function. These effects were not found with tacrolimus.

      The aim of our study is to assess the efficacy on C virological response of the switch from
      tacrolimus to cyclosporin associated with a peginterferon alfa-2a / ribavirin bitherapy, in
      non-responder or with a recurrent VHC+ disease liver transplanted patients.

      Patients will receive a 19 month cyclosporin treatment, associated during 12 months with a
      peginterferon alfa-2a / ribavirin bitherapy. Efficacy will be assessed by the percentage of
      patients with a negative qualitative PCR after 19 months of cyclosporin treatment.
