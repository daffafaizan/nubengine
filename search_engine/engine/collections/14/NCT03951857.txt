        1. To examine the distribution and contractile properties (cross-sectional area, maximal
           force, specific force, maximal shortening velocity) of single muscle fiber sex/Myosin
           heavy chain (MHC) type-related differences, by extracting a single muscle fiber from the
           vastus lateralis in young men and women.

        2. To examine the effects of intramyocellular lipids on physical activity ability, muscle
           dysfunction, and metabolic disorders in relation to aging and obesity.

        3. To examine the effects of intramyocellular lipids on physical activity ability, muscular
           dysfunction, and metabolic disorders after 12 weeks resistance exercise intervention.
