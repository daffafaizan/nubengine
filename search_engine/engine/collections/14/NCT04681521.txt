      Renal Disease (ESRD) worldwide. Although HD is a life-saving treatment for people with ESRD,
      it causes some acute and chronic complications. Muscle cramps and fatigue are two of the most
      common complications in HD, and these also cause reducing comfort. Management of
      complications in HD patients and ensuring an optimal comfort level are pivotal for nurses.
      According to the literature, recommended nursing practices for the management of cramps in HD
      patients include hot and cold therapy methods. Besides, preventing cramps can improve comfort
      by reducing fatigue. Therefore, this study aimed to examine and compare the effects of hot
      and cold compresses administration on muscle cramps, fatigue, and comfort in hemodialysis
      (HD) patients.
