      childbearing age. It affects 4-8% of the population and of them, approximately 74% present
      anovulatory cycles and, therefore, fertility problems.

      improve ovarian function and metabolism in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome.

      /D-chiro-inositol on parameters related to the fertility of women with PCOS.

      It is a multicenter, controlled, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, 12-week clinical
      trial which will be conducted in 13 public and private hospitals from Spain.
