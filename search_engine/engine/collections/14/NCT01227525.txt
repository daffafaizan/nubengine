    
      One hundred children will be recruited from the UNMC Pediatric Dentistry clinic. Eligible
      children will be selected from the 4-6 year group who are scheduled for routine dental
      restorative treatment and who have or have never received a dental injection. Each patient
      will randomly participate in either a control or experimental condition. The device will be
      attached for both conditions. During the control injection, the dentist will perform the
      dental injection as usual. During the experimental injection, the dentist will activate the
      attached device and perform the injection. Immediately following each injection, the patient
      will rate the pain on a visual analog scale and a trained observer will rate the child's
      behavior on a Frankl behavior scale. A videotape of the procedure will be reviewed by an
      independent dentist who will evaluate the child's response and any perceived disruptive
      behavior. This observer will be blind to whether the instrument is functioning.
