    
      This is a clinical, randomized, controlled placebo and double-blind study. Forty-eight
      participants performed muscular training protocol. Subjects practiced a protocol training
      with 60% of the load followed by 80% of the load, measured through 1-repetition maximum test,
      in all sessions of the training protocol. The training protocol consisted in performing 3
      sets of 7 repetitions with 60% of 1-RM, and 4 set of 7 repetitions with 80% of 1-RM. This
      protocol was performed in every sessions, three times a week, employing leg press and leg
      extension machines.

      Phototherapy, active or placebo, were applied in 6 different points of anterior muscle of the
      thigh before and after each training session. Only one investigator, that did not participate
      in any phase of the assessments and trainings sessions, knew about what program is active or
      placebo in phototherapy device. Randomisation carried out by a simple drawing of lots (A, B,
      C, or D) in the first visit. The phototherapy unit emitted the same sound regardless of the
      program used, active or placebo. Either strength training lasted 12 weeks and assessments
      were performed at baseline, 4, 8 and 12 weeks. There were evaluated maximal voluntary
      contraction (MVC), concentric torque, bilateral thigh perimetry and 1-repetition maximum test
      (1-RM).
