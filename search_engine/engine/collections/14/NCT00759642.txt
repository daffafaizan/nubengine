      hormone receptor positive breast cancer. Although most patients with advanced estrogen
      receptor positive metastatic disease respond initially to endocrine therapies, this response
      is short lived. New therapies able to provide additional benefit to patients with hormone
      receptor positive, endocrine-resistant, advanced metastatic breast cancer are required. This
      study proposes to add lapatinib to endocrine therapy to treat hormone receptor positive HER-2
      negative metastatic breast cancer patients.
