    
      All patients that underwent congenital cardiac surgery from 2004 till 2010 and required PCA
      or NCA will be included. Data will be collected from the pain team database and charts
      review. Data will include; patient's age, weight, sex, procedure, pain scores and sedation
      score during the times of PCA and NCA use, side effects (respiratory depression, nausea,
      vomitting, pruritus, itching and other).In addition we will record the total days of PCA and
      NCA use. We will also look at the incidence of changes done in the PCA/NCA and drug itself.

      Identifying the ideal drug and dose based on the patient's age and procedure will allow us to
      take better care of our patients. Our patient population is peculiar in the fact that a big
      percentage of our patients are extubated in the Operating Room. For this reason, sedation and
      analgesia play an important role for our continued success in taking care of them.
