      groups will stay on their current MS medication, and one group will discontinue their
      medication. They will also have some extra assessments done at their regular routine MS
      clinic appointment and every 6 months for the next 2 years. The following items will be done
      in addition to any assessments or procedures they are already having done as part of their
      clinical care:

        -  Some questionnaires about the participant's quality of life including questions about
           health, mood, thinking, and social life

        -  Some questionnaires about the participant's MS symptoms

        -  A test of the participant's attention, concentration, and thinking that involves adding
           and repeating numbers

        -  A test of the participant's physical symptoms

        -  Along with the MRIs the participants get as part of their routine care, they will also
