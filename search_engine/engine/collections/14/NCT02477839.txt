    
      The trial consists of a 7-day Baseline Period, a 20-day Titration Period, a 7-day Maintenance
      Period, and a 12-day Transition Period for subjects who complete the study and choose to
      enter the extension study. Subjects who will not enter the extension study will continue
      after the Maintenance Period with a 16-day Taper Period followed by a 30-day Safety Follow-Up
      Period. The Taper Period and Safety Follow-Up are also applicable for subjects not eligible
      for continuation and therefore ending the study earlier.

      If subjects meet the eligibility criteria, they will be randomized to receive either
      lacosamide 8 mg/kg/day to 12 mg/kg/day, or placebo during the Maintenance Phase. The dose of
      lacosamide will be titrated from 4 mg/kg/day at study start to maximum of 12 mg/kg/day at
      4-day intervals of 1-2 mg/kg/day.

      All subjects who complete the 20-day Titration Period will enter the 7-day Maintenance
      Period. No dose adjustment is allowed during the Maintenance Phase. The Treatment Phase is
      defined as the combined Titration and Maintenance Phases.
