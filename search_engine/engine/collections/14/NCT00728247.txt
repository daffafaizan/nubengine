      subject, one of four treatment modalities: (1) soft-tissue stretch, (2) myofascial release,
      (3) muscle energy, or (4) functional (indirect) method. These modalities are standard to the
      care and practice of osteopathic manual medicine, they are taught in the Osteopathic
      curriculum, and they are practiced each day at the Michigan State University Clinical Center.

      After the initial treatment, there will be an immediate follow-up kinematic test to collect
      the 3-D motion data. Then, subjects will return for subsequent kinematic assessments at: 24
      hours post treatment, 48 hours post treatment and seven days post treatment. At the seven day
      mark, subjects will be evaluated as in the initial assessment and the physician will use his
      professional judgment to determine if the subject would benefit from a second treatment. If
      so, then the process of treatment and kinematic assessment would occur a second time, with
      kinematic assessment 24 hours post treatment, 48 hours post treatment and seven days post
      treatment. A maximum of two treatment sessions will be performed.
