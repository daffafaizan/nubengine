      discussed for a long time due to high non-union rates in non-operative treatment and high
      complication rates in surgical treatment. A recently developed implant was proven to ensure a
      biomechanically sufficient fixation of fractures leading to bony union and promising
      functional outcome in a small collective of patients.

      In this prospective study patients with dislocated fractures of the lateral clavicle
      (Jäger&Breitner I-III, Neer I-III) are enrolled. All patients are surgically treated using
      the locking compression plate (LCP) for the superior anterior clavicle (Synthes®). Functional
      outcome is recorded using the Munich Shoulder Questionnaire (MSQ) allowing for qualitative
      self-assessment of the Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI), of the Disability of the
      Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) score and of the Constant Score. Acromioclavicular joint
      stability is evaluated using the Taft-Score.
