    
      Children ages 7 years 0 months to 12 years 11 months will be recruited into 1 clinical group
      (ASD+/FC+), utilizing the following clinics in Southern California:

      CHLA-affiliated Clinics

        -  Boone-Fetter Clinic, home of the CHLA Autism Treatment Network

        -  University Center of Excellence on Developmental Disabilities (UCEDD) Clinic at CHLA -
           UC Irvine/Orange County-affiliated clinics

        -  Center for Autism and Neurodevelopmental Disorders in Orange County

        -  Children's Hospital of Orange County Exclusion criteria include a diagnosed syndromic
           disorder, prematurity, failure to meet standard birth weight, not enrolled in any ASD
           treatment program. For each child, the Questionnaire on Pediatric Gastrointestinal
           Symptoms (QPGS)-Rome III is administered and the child is seen by a board-certified
           pediatric gastroenterologist. The child will be seen at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months for
           their research visits. Treatment of FC in children with ASD is based on the Autism
           Treatment Network (ATN) modified protocol of the North American Society for Pediatric
           Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (NASPGHAN) and includes the following: 1) a
           thorough dietary history is reviewed and adjusted for introducing a diet rich in fiber
           (or supplements if able to be tolerated by the child; typically this will be in older
           children in the study); 2) assessment of abdominal pain, perianal skin tags,
           hemorrhoids, fissures, rectal exam if needed, frequency of stooling, quality of stool,
           rectal bleeding, other possible associated symptoms such as reflux/dyspepsia, vomiting,
           headaches, increase or decrease in appetite; 3) behavioral techniques, such as toileting
           after meal times, and other strategies are added; and 4) medicine and dietary
           adjustments are made. At each visit, the following instruments/questionnaires will be
           administered by a clinical psychologist: 1) social responsiveness scale; 2) Kaufman
           Brief Intelligence Test; 3) Child Behavior Checklist; 4) Aberrant Behavior Checklist; 5)
           Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (Peds QL); 6) Repetitive Behavioral Scale-Revised;
           7) Autism Impact Measure; 8) Pearson Short Sensory Profile. The Vineland will be
           administered at baseline and 12 months. The ADOS-2 will be used at baseline to ensure an
           ASD diagnosis.

      At each visit, subject urine is collected and stored until an assay for the oxidative stress
      marker F2-isoprostane is measured.

      A buccal swab is collected and DNA extracted for future genetic studies.
