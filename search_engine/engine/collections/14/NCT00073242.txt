      Leptin is secreted by fat cells in circulating concentrations that are directly proportional
      to fat mass. Leptin-deficiency is associated with severe obesity in rodents and in humans and
      the obesity is relieved by leptin administration. These studies examine the hypothesis that
      some of this metabolic opposition cto the maintenance of an altered body weight can be
      relieved by restoring circulating concentrations of the hormone leptin to the same range as
      at usual body weight in subjects who are maintaining a reduced body weight. The basic design
      of this study is to observe subjects at a 10% reduced body weight and then again at that
      reduced body weight while receiving physiological leptin or T3 supplementation.
