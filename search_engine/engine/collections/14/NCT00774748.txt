      to patients for the prevention or treatment of venous thromboembolism; however, no studies
      have been performed to evaluate the ports' reliability in delivering this type of drug.
      Hence, it is not known whether absorption of the drug is constant over the seven-day lifespan
      of the port. Although the use of subcutaneous ports is not currently the standard of care,
      health care providers are more frequently using this as an alternative method to direct
      injection of LMWH, particularly in pediatric patients.

      The main advantage of subcutaneous ports is the decreased number of needle sticks when using
      the ports to administer the medication. However, it is possible that, due to potential
      repeated bleeding into the subcutaneous space at the port site or other factors, drug
      absorption may decrease over the seven day lifespan of the port, resulting in a decrease of
      plasma drug level. Subtherapeutic LMWH levels and, hence, ineffective anticoagulation may
      result. This study's aim is to determine if the current use of subcutaneous ports is a safe,
      effective and reliable way of administering LMWH for the purpose of anticoagulation.
