    
      This is a single arm, open label, multi-center phase 2 study to assess the safety and
      anti-tumor activity of intratumoral tavo electroporation in participants with stage IB to
      IIIB mycosis fungoides. All participants received up to four cycles of treatment consisting
      of three treatment days, Days 1, 5 and 8, in a 12-week cycle. Patients will receive
      intra-tumoral injection of tavo at a concentration of 1.0 mg/mL (maximum volume of 1 mL/day
      distributed over 2-4 lesions), followed immediately by electrical discharge around the tumor
      site resulting in electroporation of plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) into tumor cells.
      Prior to the first cycle of treatment, the investigator will select at least one lesion, or
      affected area in erythrodermic patients, to be left untreated for the duration of the study
      to allow for clinical observation of an untreated site. Participants will be followed for
      safety and clinical evaluation every 4 weeks. Quality of Life will be assessed using the
      Skindex29, Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - General (FACT-G) and Visual Analog Scale
      for Pruritus (VAS-P) instruments. Survival follow up will occur at 3-month intervals over 2
      years following end of study.
