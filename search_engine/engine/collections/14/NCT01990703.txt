      of U.S. efforts to decrease our nation's high rate of unplanned pregnancy. Many women
      initiate use of this method in the post partum period. The major advantage of immediate
      postplacental LNG IUD insertion is the prompt initiation of a highly effective contraceptive
      method at a time that does not interfere with the intense demands of newborn care, but any
      contraceptive method initiated in the postpartum period must not interfere with
      breastfeeding.

      Our long-term goal is to understand the impact of hormonal contraceptives, initiated early in
      the postpartum period, on breastfeeding. The central hypothesis is that quality of
      breastfeeding is not negatively affected by progestin-only hormonal contraceptives.

      We will pursue three specific aims comparing women randomized to immediate post-placental vs.
      delayed (4-6 week) postpartum LNG IUD insertion:

      Aim #1: To determine breastfeeding continuation rates at 8 weeks in both groups Aim #2: To
      determine timing of lactogenesis in both groups Aim #3: To assess breastfeeding continuation,
      exclusivity, and satisfaction as well as continuation and satisfaction with the LNG IUD at 26
      weeks postpartum in both groups

      This proposal will support a non-inferiority RCT where participants will be randomly assigned
      to immediate postplacental insertion (within 10 minutes of placental delivery) or delayed
      postpartum insertion (4-6 weeks postpartum). This project will provide needed evidence on
      breastfeeding impact of early postpartum initiation of the LNG IUD.
