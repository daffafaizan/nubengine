      mineralization of bone. Lactating women and infants are considered to be at risk of vitamin D
      deficiency due to increased needs for vitamin D and calcium. Stores of vitamin D acquired in
      utero and breast milk are the main sources of vitamin D for infants. Maternal vitamin D
      deficiency, exclusive breastfeeding, skin pigmentation and limited sun exposure are commonly
      seen in infants with rickets. However, the UV exposure, dress habits, traditional practices
      and other risk factors to vitamin D deficiency in Ethiopia have not been explored. This study
      aims to fill this research gap.
