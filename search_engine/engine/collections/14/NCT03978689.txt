      specific T cells to eradicate human papilloma virus (HPV)-driven malignancies. HPV causes
      multiple tumor types including cervical, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and
      anal cancers. Initial testing of CUE-101 will be conducted in HPV16+ HNSCC patients.

      The primary objectives of the Part A&B, first-in-human trial, are to assess the safety and
      tolerability of CUE-101 in subjects with recurrent/metastatic HNSCC in the second line
      setting and to determine the maximum tolerated dose or recommended Phase 2 dose based on
      markers of biological activity. Pharmacokinetics (PK), antitumor immune response, preliminary
      antitumor activity and the potential for immunogenicity will also be assessed. The goal of
      Part C&D is to characterize the safety, tolerability, and biological effects of CUE-101 in
      combination with pembrolizumab in patients with recurrent/metastatic HNSCC in the first line
      setting. This will be an open-label multicenter phase I trial conducted in the U.S. involving
      approximately 85 patients.
