      Raf kinase and VEGF receptor tyrosine kinases, and has shown efficacy against NSCLC in Phase
      I/II trials. Because the targets of sorafenib are different from that of EGFR-TKI, it is
      reasonable for sorafenib to treat relapsed advanced NSCLC after failure of EGFR-TKI
      treatment.
