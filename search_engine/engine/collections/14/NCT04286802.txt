      uncontrolled (systolic BP ≥140 mmHg or diastolic BP ≥90 mmHg) despite therapy or
      antihypertensive-naïve. Patients were randomized to receive salt meter to use in conjunction
      with dietary education (group A) or receive education only (group B), and were followed up
      for 8 weeks. Dietary education was provided by certified dietician without awareness of
      patients' allocation. The primary endpoint was change in 24-hour urinary sodium excretion.
      Changes in BP, salt taste sensitivity threshold, cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI), as well
      as motivation to maintain low salt diet were also analyzed.
