      therapy in patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer. The first part of the
      study is a Phase I design to evaluate the maximum tolerated dose of S-3304 when given in
      combination with radiation and paclitaxel/carboplatin chemotherapy that is appropriate for
      further evaluation. The second part of the study is a randomized Phase II design to evaluate
      the efficacy of recommended S-3304 dose in combination with chemo-radiation.
