      quality of life and is associated with an increased mortality rate. The operative treatment
      of MR - either mitral valve repair or replacement - is the current gold standard. However
      mere half of the patients with a severe and symptomatic MR actually undergo an operative
      treatment (EURO-HEART-SURVEY) due to restricted left ventricular ejection fraction, elderly
      patients with co-morbidities and high perioperative morbidity and mortality. In contrast,
      patients with severe and symptomatic MR not suitable for operation are treated with
      palliative medical therapy (heart insufficiency therapy). With the development of the
      MitraClip device - a minimal-invasive, percutaneous catheter-based technique - high-risk
      patients not suitable for surgery may receive a promising alternative treatment by
      approximating the mitral leaflets, thus creating a permanent leaflet coaptation and reducing
      or even abrogating the MR. The current data support the assumption of a safe and effective MR
      reduction with the MitraClip-System in inoperable high-risk patients with severe MR. But the
      feasibility still has to be proven in this special patient population.
