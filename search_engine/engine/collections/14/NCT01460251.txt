      previous studies 901 and 910 (an extension to 901) to continue treatment with DiaPep277 and
      clinical follow-up, for up to 2 additional years.The aim of the study is to collect safety
      and efficacy data of long term treatment effect of Diapep277.Only patients who completed
      studies 901 or 910 and still have stimulated C-peptide level equal to or above 0.2 nmol/L
      will be eligible for this extension study. The optimal dose and dosing regimen for this study
      will be the same as applied in the phase 3 study (901) and its extension study protocol
      (910), namely 1.0 mg DiaPep277Â® administered every 3 months. These conditions were determined
      as optimal based on the outcome of the phase 2 studies. For patients who just completed the
      2-year 901 study, a 3-year extended treatment will be offered with 13 administrations;
      patients who completed the 2-year 910 extension study will be offered a 3rd year of treatment
      with 5 additional administrations.
