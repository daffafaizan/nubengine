      and satisfactory results.

      Thus, acupuncture seeks to balance all physiological systems, using specific points on the
      body where needles are inserted.

      In turn, the use of taping is associated to various benefits such as improved blood and
      lymphatic function. In addition, it assists in the correction of muscle function and in the
      decrease of pain for neurological suppression. The constant afferent mechanical and
      somatosensory stimuli are perceived in cortical level and may produce motor unit recruitment
      and contribute to neuroplasticity of the nervous system.

      Thus, this research aims to analyze the effects of Acupuncture associated with Functional
      Taping on patients' upper limb with chronic hemiparesis after Stroke through a prospective,
      randomized intervention. Seventy-five patients will be evaluated before and after
      intervention with Acupuncture and / or Function Taping, divided into three groups
      (Acupuncture, Functional Taping and Acupuncture plus Functional Taping). The evaluation will
      consist of Isokinetic, Mini-Mental State Examination, Modified Ashworth Scale, Motor Activity
      Log, Wolf Motor Function Test and Visual Analog Scale of Pain. The results will be analyzed
      and presented descriptively, as of statistical comparisons of pre- and post-treatment and the
      relationship between the groups.
