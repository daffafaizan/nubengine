      combined (breast, colon and prostate cancer). Cigarette smoking is the most important risk
      factor in the development of lung cancer. Another population of particular interest in
      Alberta involves workers with occupational exposure to asbestos as asbestos and tobacco
      exposure results in a synergistic effect on lung cancer risk. Mesothelioma is a rare cancer
      of the lining of the lung with poor prognosis of which 80% of cases are believed to be
      related to asbestos exposure.

      Unfortunately, despite some advances in treatment, there has been little impact on overall
      survival for both lung cancer and mesothelioma in the past 20 years in great part because
      patients usually present with disease at an advanced and incurable stage. Additional
      strategies are desperately needed to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with this
      disease.

      The objectives of this study are to develop and implement a LDCT screening approach for lung
      cancer and mesothelioma in asbestos-exposed workers in Alberta; to determine participants'
      motivation and expectations associated with a screening program, their satisfaction with the
      program, and the psychosocial consequences of the screening program; to determine the
      accuracy of a lung cancer risk prediction model modified to include asbestos exposure; and to
      determine the 3-year clinical incidence of lung cancer in asbestos-exposed individuals
      interested in lung cancer screening but who do not meet minimal risk threshold.

      The investigators will offer a combined lung cancer and mesothelioma screening program for
      200 Alberta asbestos-exposed workers based on low-dose CT scanning.
