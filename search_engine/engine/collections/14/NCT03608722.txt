      method. Informed consent will be obtain from all participants/parents as well as assent from
      minors. Participants will be asked to complete a brief yes/no questionnaire before the study
      begins. Participants will be asked to complete a 10 minute battery of tests consisting of
      simple video games designed to measure cognitive health. No personally identifiable
      information will be collected during the tests and all test data will remain anonymous. Data
      will be stored on servers with HIPAA-level security. No participants will be asked to modify
      their normal behavior in any way. No feedback or results will be given to participants. The
      tests will not be distressing in any way. To meet the objective of detecting cognitive
      impairment, investigators will test a broad array of participants from ages 10 through 99 in
      several different settings in parallel. The targeted cognitive stressors of advanced age,
      head injuries, physical strain, sleep deprivation, alcohol ingestion, and marijuana ingestion
      will be compared to healthy baseline controls. Collectively, these experiments aim to yield
      an end- deliverable of a rapid, non-invasive, portable piece of software that can be used to
      detect cognitive impairment.

      A subset of participants will be asked to take the tests up to three times, so the total
      testing time is a max of 30 minutes. A subset of participants will be asked simple auxiliary
      questions, such as "Estimated in minutes, how long was your exercise or workout?". A subset
      of participants will be asked to wear a FitBit device to monitor their heart rate. A subset
      of participants will be asked to take a breathalyzer test (BACtrack S80).
