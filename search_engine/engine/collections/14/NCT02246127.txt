    
      STZ based chemotherapy, STZ-5FU, is the actual standard of care for advanced pancreatic
      Neuroendocrine tumours (pNETS) in the European Union. Everolimus has been recently approved
      for its use in advanced pNETs by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and in Europe by the
      European Medical Agency (EMA).

      A randomized study is needed to have a clear knowledge about the best sequence for its
      administration; this is, before or after palliative chemotherapy.

      There may or may not be any benefits from giving first each other treatment of the study. The
      information obtained from this study will help the physician improve the treatment and
      management of patients with advanced pNET.

      This study was planned to compare STZ-5FU chemotherapy followed by everolimus upon
      progression versus the reverse sequence. However sequential studies with pNETs are hard to be
      managed in terms of time and costs. Therefore the protocol was amended to have PFS1
      (progression free survival after course 1) as primary endpoint and PFS2 (i.e. progression
      free survival after both STZ based chemotherapy and Everolimus or the reverse order) as
      secondary endpoint. This information will be extremely valuable for the day to day clinical
      practice of NET oncologists
