      platinum-based chemotherapy is poor. The efficacy of second-line chemotherapy for those
      patients that cannot be re-irradiated or re-operated is limited according to NCCN guideline
      and other published data. New agent for second-line treatment of recurrent and/or metastatic
      head and neck tumors is urgently needed. Recombinant human endostatin is an anti-angiogenetic
      target drug, which has been demonstrated a good efficacy for NSCLC. Studies about recombinant
      human endostatin in head and neck cancer mainly focus on NPC. And phase I study of endostatin
      combined with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy for NPC showed a promising results.

      This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of endostatin combined with
      second-line chemotherapy for patients of recurrent/metastatic head and neck epithelial tumors
      that cannot be re-irradiated or re-operated after fist-line platinum-based chemotherapy.
