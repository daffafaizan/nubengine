    
      Dose level and escalating schedule are followings;

        -  S-1 (level 1/2, 3/4, 5/6: 60, 70, 80 mg/m2/day) every 12-h p.o. on days 1(evening)-15
           (morning)

        -  Irinotecan (level 1,2/3, 4/5, 6: 120, 130, 140, 150 mg/m2) mixed in d5w or normal saline
           500 ml iv over 90 min on day 1

        -  Oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2 fixed dose mixed in d5w 250 ml iv infusion over 2-h on day 1

      Treatment will be administered every 3 weeks. Start at dose level 1. Thereafter, dose level
      2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. If dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) occurs at dose level 1, dose level at -1
      will follow

      Dose escalation will be continued until more than one-third of the patients in a given cohort
      show dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) during treatment cycle 1. At least three patients will be
      enrolled in each cohort. Before escalating to the next dose level, all three patients should
      have received at least one treatment cycle. If none of the first three treated patients
      develops DLT in the first cycle at a specific dose level, dose escalation will be continued.
      If one of the first three treated patients develops DLT at any dose level, then three
      additional patients are to be entered on the same dose level. If only one in six patients at
      a given level experiences a DLT, escalation will proceed. The MTD is defined as the dose
      level at which at least one-third of patients experienced a DLT. The RD for the subsequent
      phase II study is defined as the preceding dose level before the MTD is attained.
      Intra-patient dose escalation will not be permitted. Treatment will be continued in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity with maximum 12 cycles. For purpose
      of determining the MTD, only DLT occurring during the first cycle of therapy will be
      considered.

      DLTs are defined as any of following;

        -  Grade 4 neutropenia lasting at least 7 days or grade 3 or 4 neutropenia associated with
           fever  38.3C as single axillary temperature or 38 C for 1-h

        -  Grade 4 thrombocytopenia

        -  Grade 3 or 4 non-hematological toxicity except alopecia, and nausea/vomiting

        -  Grade 3 or 4 nausea/vomiting not reduced to grade 1 with aggressive antiemetic support

        -  Inability of the patient to take 75% of the planned chemotherapy dose during the
           treatment period
