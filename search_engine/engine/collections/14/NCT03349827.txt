      Apatinib in the conversion therapy of peritoneal metastases from gastric cancer, patients
      undergo HIPEC with Docetaxel/ Lobaplatin at the time of fist surgery and twice repeat within
      one week after the surgery, following 2 cycles of 3-week Oxaliplatin/S1 chemotherapy combined
      with Apatinib and 1 cycles of 3-week Oxaliplatin/S1 chemotherapy. The second surgery,
      exploratory laparoscopy or laparotomy, is carried out one week later after the series of
      systemic chemotherapy.
