      collection card from subjects with no known history of COVID-19 infection. The specimens will
      be collected at Biomerica in Irvine CA for specimen collection, banking, and matrix
      equivalency studies for projects in development at Biomerica for detection to IgG or IgA or
      IgM antibodies to Sars-CoV2 antibodies. Subject will also be asked to self-collect a nasal
      swab for COVID-19 PCR
