      important driver of antibiotic resistance. In critical care setting, antibiotic therapies are
      widely used due to the high number of patients presenting with sepsis. However, some authors
      have shown that up to 50% of antibiotic treatments in critically ill patients are
      inappropriate, mostly because they are used in patients with non-bacterial infections.

      In order to improve antibiotic use, several antibiotic stewardship programs have been
      implemented worldwide. However, only few of them have taken into account the determinants of
      prescribing behaviors. Yet, these determinants have been shown to play a role among general
      practitioners of hospital doctors. Nevertheless, none of these factors have been studied
      among intensivists.

      The study is designed to investigate social, cultural, contextual and personal factors
      influencing antibiotic prescribing among French intensivists. The design will consist of
      three phases:

        -  Phase 1: construction and validation of a questionnaire

        -  Phase 2: the questionnaire will be sent to all intensivist, including residents, in
           France

        -  Phase 3: qualitative study, based on semi-structured interviews.

      The current project represent phase 1 of the study.
