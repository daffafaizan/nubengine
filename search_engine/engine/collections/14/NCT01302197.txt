      age and occur in over 780,000 persons each year in the U.S. As our adult population ages, the
      number of strokes in the United States is anticipated to double, reaching nearly 1.5 million
      annually by the year 2050. Following stroke, patients remain at continued high risk for
      recurrent stroke with almost a third of them suffering recurrent stroke within 5 years, even
      despite optimal medical management. Age and cardiac disease are among the most important
      longitudinal predictors of cardiovascular health outcomes and survival after stroke. Notably,
      75% of chronic stroke survivors have residual disability emphasizing the need for
      rehabilitation strategies.

      Knowledge of the skeletal muscle changes that occur in the early phases after stroke is
      essential to create new guidelines which incorporate exercise rehabilitation, much like
      cardiac rehabilitation, in order to facilitate and improve the health care of stroke
      survivors.
