      clinical management of patients as well as for research purposes. The most commonly used tool
      for the assessment of AR severity is the Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS). Objective
      biomarkers like skin prick test size or specific IgE levels don't correlate with TNSS.

      We studied skin prick test size and specific IgE and several patient reported outcomes
      including symptom score, medication scores, combined score and Juniper mini rhinitis quality
      of life questionnaire (RQLQ). Psychometric evaluation was performed using 5 different
      psychological questionnaires that measure 13 different psychological factors.
