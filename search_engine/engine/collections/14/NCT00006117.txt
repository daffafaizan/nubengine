      or metastatic pancreatic carcinoma when treated with gemcitabine and oxaliplatin. II.
      Determine the tolerablility and clinical benefit of this regimen in these patients. III.
      Evaluate the progression free survival and the overall survival of these patients when
      treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive gemcitabine IV on day 1 over 1.5 hours
      and oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 2. Treatment continues every 2 weeks in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with locally advanced disease receive
      6-8 courses and then may undergo surgery, radiotherapy, and/or additional chemotherapy.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 66 patients will be accrued for this study.
