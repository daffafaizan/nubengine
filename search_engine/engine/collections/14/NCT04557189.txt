      prophylaxis for postoperative nausea and vomiting in high risk participants.

      The study will enroll approximately 100 patients. Participants will be randomly assigned in
      1:1 ratio (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groups-which will
      remain undisclosed to the patient and study doctor during the study (unless there is an
      urgent medical need):

        -  Group A: All participants will be asked to take ondansetron placebo-matching intravenous
           (IV) injection before induction followed by TAK-951 4 mg subcutaneous (SC) injection
           approximately 30-45 minutes end of surgery.

        -  Group B: All participants will be asked to take ondansetron 4 mg IV injection before
           induction followed by TAK-951 placebo-matching SC injection approximately 30-45 minutes
           before the end of surgery.

      This trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to participate in the
      study from the time of surgery to completion is approximately 14 days. Participants will make
      multiple visits to the clinic, and will be contacted by telephone after receiving their last
      dose of drug for a follow-up assessment.
