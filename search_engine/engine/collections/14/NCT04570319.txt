      westernized populations. Acne pathophysiology is multifactorial and may include alterations
      of the pilosebaceous unit function, skin microbiota, hormone imbalance and gut microbiota.
      Acne pathology shares features with inflammatory chronic conditions such as metabolic
      syndrome, obesity or diabetes.

      Probiotics are live microorganisms that when administered in adequate amounts confer a health
      benefit for the host. Probiotics are proposed for the treatment of inflammatory chronic
      conditions, including dermatological diseases as atopic dermatitis and psoriasis. However,
      the clinical evidence is limited. Therefore, usefulness of probiotics for acne vulgaris
      treatment must be ascertained in humans.

      This randomized study aims to evaluate the effect of a probiotic on the treatment and
      clinical and subjective evolution of acne vulgaris.
