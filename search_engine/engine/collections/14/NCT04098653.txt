      (allo-HSCT) could be a valuable treatment choice for myeloid tumors, such as acute myeloid
      leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome. BUCY conditioning regimen is the standard
      myeloablative regimen for myeloid tumors undergoing allo-HSCT. However, it appears to have
      higher relapse rate and lower survival. To reduce the relapse rate and improve the survival,
      decitabine is added in the conditioning regimen. In this prospective randomized controlled
      study, the safety and efficacy of Decitabine + BUCY and BUCY myeloablative conditioning
      regimens in myeloid tumors undergoing allo-HSCT are evaluated.
