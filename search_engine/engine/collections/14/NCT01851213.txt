      facilitates an individualized approach to cancer treatment by sub-classifying diseases on an
      individual basis. Physicians can utilize an in depth understanding of disease at a molecular
      level to optimize therapy by selecting the most appropriate drugs and therapeutic targets.
      Genomic profiling has identified multiple genomic aberrations that are predictive markers for
      treatment response with targeted therapeutics.

      FoundationOne™ is a commercially available molecular diagnostics test, for all solid tumor
      types, that analyzes routine clinical specimens for somatic alterations in relevant
      cancer-related genes. This validated in vitro diagnostic test, is performed in a single
      Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certified and College of American
      Pathologists (CAP) approved laboratory at Foundation Medicine, Inc. It provides
      individualized, potentially actionable information regarding a patient's molecular cancer
      subtype that can be used by physicians to tailor treatment options.

      With the recent commercial availability of the FoundationOne™ test, knowledge gaps exist
      regarding practice patterns associated with the use of this test in routine clinical practice
      and the impact of this test on clinical decision making. There is limited information
      regarding physician and patient characteristics that determine which patients receive the
      test, rationale for patient selection, and how physicians interpret and use the test results.
      Findings from this study will help to optimize patient selection and maximize the clinical
      impact of the test in terms of guiding therapy.
