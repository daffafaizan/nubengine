    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the protective benefit to performing lymphovenous bypass (LVB) surgery at the
      time of axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) for patients that are high risk for developing
      breast-cancer related lymphedema (LE) of the upper extremity.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare the medical outcomes for patients receiving LVB surgery with those receiving
      standard surgery without the intervention.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Patients receive indocyanine green intravenously (IV) and undergo lymphangiography,
      then undergo LVB at the time of ALND.

      GROUP II: Patients do not receive indocyanine green, undergo lymphangiography, nor undergo
      LVB at the time of ALND.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 2 weeks, and then at 6, 12, and 18
      months.
