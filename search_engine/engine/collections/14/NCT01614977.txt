      combined with corticosteroids for the treatment of NTM lymphadenitis in children.

      The study will be conducted over a 3-year period in the Day Hospitalization Unit and ward C
      of the Schneider Children's Medical Center of Israel using a double- blind placebo-controlled
      design.

      Eighty children aged 3 months to 20 years treated for laboratory-proven subacute/chronic NTM
      lymphadenitis at the Schneider Children's Medical Center of Israel will be enrolled in the
      study.

      Children with any of the following findings will be excluded:

        -  congenital or acquired immunodeficiency

        -  chronic disease, such as diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, chronic liver
           disease, inflammatory bowel disease, or chronic arthritis

        -  immunosuppressive drug use (except inhaled steroids)

        -  elevated hepatocellular enzyme levels (more than twice the upper limit of normal) ---
