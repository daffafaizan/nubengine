      by rapid and disorderly atrial fibrillation wave, is the most acute atrial electrical
      activity disorders, is also one of the common tachyarrhythmias. So far, the mechanism of
      atrial fibrillation has not yet been completely clarified. At present, there are various
      mechanisms to participate in the occurrence and maintenance of atrial fibrillation, which
      mainly involves two aspects. One is the triggering factor of atrial fibrillation, and the
      other is the occurrence and maintenance of atrial fibrillation (substrate). Trigger factors
      are varied, including sympathetic and parasympathetic stimulation, bradycardia, atrial
      premature beats or tachycardia, atrioventricular bypass and acute atrial pull, etc, which
      pulmonary vein electrical activity triggered the most common, but also is an most important
      theoretical Basis for the Radiofrequency Catheter Ablation of Atrial Fibrillation . Substrate
      is a necessary condition for the onset and maintenance of atrial fibrillation. Electrical
      remodeling and structural remodeling are by shortening the atrial effective refractory
      period. Atrial dilatation and atrial fibrosis play a major role in the formation of atrial
      fibrillation reentry.Circumferential pulmonary Vein Isolation (CPVI) is considered to be the
      cornerstone of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation ablation, but recently reported in the
      literature that pure CPVI treatment for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation the 5-year success
      rate as low as 46.6%, and the incidence of atrial reentry tachycardia is also high in the
      follow-up period. Therefore it is necessary for us to explore whether the success rate of
      CPVI combined with Leftatrium Roofline Ablation (CPVI + LARA) for paroxysmal atrial
      fibrillation is higher than the pure CPVI.
