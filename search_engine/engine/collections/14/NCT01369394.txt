      children ages six years and younger who have not yet received the MMR vaccine. Parents will
      complete a three-item measure that assesses their baseline intentions for having their
      children vaccinated with MMR. Participants will then fill out a short, computer-based survey
      that assesses demographic factors, prior experience with MMR, and views about a variety of
      potential barriers to MMR vaccination. Following the survey, the intervention group (40
      parents) will view a series of tailored educational messages resembling web pages that uses
      their survey data to address at an individual level their specific concerns about the MMR
      vaccine. The control group (40 parents) will view a series of generic educational messages
      resembling web pages that is similar in appearance to the intervention, but contains only
      untailored information about the vaccine. After navigating through these educational
      messages, MMR vaccination intention will be reassessed using the same three-item measure as
      for the baseline assessment of vaccination intention. The vaccine administration records of
      the children of these parents will be accessed after parents' participation in the study to
      assess whether the MMR vaccine was provided to the child.
