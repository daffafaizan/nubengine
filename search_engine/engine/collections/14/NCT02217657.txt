      fibrillation (AF).

      The three main techniques described for ablation of persistent AF include pulmonary vein (PV)
      isolation, ablation based on electrogram analysis, and left atrial (LA) linear lesions.

      The ideal endpoint of linear lesions should be complete electrical block; however, this is
      technically challenging, time consuming, and potentially hazardous. The ST catheter combined
      with 3D mapping and navigation software, gives physicians a real-time, objective measure of
      tip-to-tissue contact force during the catheter ablation procedure and will allow physicians
      to more safely and effectively treat atrial fibrillation.
