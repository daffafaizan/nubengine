      increased risk of arterial calcification and mortality. Calcium-based phosphate binders can
      induce hypercalcaemia and are associated with progression of vascular calcification. A recent
      randomized study demonstrated that sevelamer, a non-calcium-based phosphate binders, reduced
      mortality in elderly hemodialysis patients compared with calcium-based phosphate binders.
      Lanthanum carbonate is another efficacious and well-tolerated non-calcium phosphate binder. A
      post-hoc survival analysis of lanthanum carbonate versus standard therapy suggested a
      survival benefit of lanthanum carbonate treatment for elderly patients.
