    
      Patients will be included on the first day after TKA surgery and randomized in two groups.
      Each group will receive 2 ACB with a 1 hour interval, one ACB with an active drug,
      Ropivacaine, and another ACB with a placebo drug, Saline.

      At T0, arm ACB_active/placebo will receive the active ACB with Ropivacaine followed by the
      placebo ACB at T60 (60 minutes after T0).

      At T0, arm ACB_placebo/active will receive the placebo ACB with Saline followed by the active
      ACB with Ropivacaine at T60 (60 minutes after T0).

      Outcome measurements will be made at T60, 1 hour after the first ACB, and the difference in
      outcome between the groups will be compared.

      Baseline values will be measured prior to the first ACB. Final measurements at T120 (120
      minutes after the initial ACB), will determine if the differences between the groups are
      eliminated, since both groups then have received an active ACB.
