      condition. The participating subjects were required to have an overnight fast and in the next
      morning were given orally one capsule of the test drug (Pregabalin 150 mg produced by Dexa
      Medica) or one capsule of the reference drug (LyricaÂ® 150 mg, Pfizer Manufacturing
      Deutschland GmbH, Germany).

      Blood samples were drawn immediately before taking the drug (control), at 20, 40 minutes, and
      1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 24, 36 hours after drug administration. Seven days after the
      first drug administration (washout period), the procedure was repeated using the alternate
      drug. The plasma concentrations of pregabalin were determined by using validated liquid
      chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry detection (LC-MS/MS) method.
