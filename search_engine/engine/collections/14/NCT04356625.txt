      by the physician in charge of the patient and maximal expiratory pressure (MEP) as usually
      measured greater than 30 centimeters of water (cmH2O). Following this, the patient was
      allowed to rest for 5 minutes in the same condition. With the patient in the supine position
      sitting 45 ° to 60 °, the closed suction catheter was removed, an elbow was placed at 90 °
      and a bacterial filter in series with the endotracheal tube (ET), an adapter was also coupled
      with a outlet port to the aneroid pressure gauge. In series an inspiratory unidirectional
      valve was placed that did not allow expiration. Immediately 2 ml of physiological solution
      was slowly instilled through the port in the 90º elbow to trigger the cough reflex. The
      presence or absence of reflex cough and the MEP during induced cough (MEPic) value were
      verified.

      As a safety method, the procedures were stopped if the patient presented signs of intolerance
      such as respiratory rate (RF)> 35 breaths per minute, saturation <90%, heart rate (HR)> 140
      beats per minute or increase of 20 % of resting levels.
