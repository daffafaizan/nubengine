      ARDS severity or outcome. Simultaneously, investigators will measure gene expression of
      peripheral blood. Both plasma biomarkers and gene expression profiles will be analyzed using
      various machine learning techniques, including classification and regression tree, latent
      class analysis, and hierarchical clustering with the goal of identifying sub-phenotypes of
      ARDS. These sub-phenotypes will be examined for association with outcome (primary is 28-day
      mortality), and explicitly tested for variation in response to exogenous treatments (e.g.,
      corticosteroids).
