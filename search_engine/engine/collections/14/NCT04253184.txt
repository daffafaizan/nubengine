    
      The Micra AV Registry is a global, prospective, observational, multi-site registry. Patients
      enrolled in the Micra AV Registry will be prospectively followed for a minimum of 3 years
      post-implant or until registry closure, patient death, patient exit from the registry (i.e.,
      withdrawal of consent).

      Enrolled patients will have scheduled follow-up visits at least annually or as prompted by
      reportable adverse events; however, all Micra AV system follow-up patient visits are to be
      reported. Therefore, if more frequent scheduled visits occur per a provider's routine
      clinical care practice, those visits are reported. The total estimated registry duration is
      4.5 years
