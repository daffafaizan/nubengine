      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicities of the combination
      of ixabepilone, mitoxantrone hydrochloride, and prednisone in patients with
      hormone-refractory metastatic prostate cancer that progressed during or after taxane-based
      chemotherapy. (Phase I) II. Assess the efficacy, as measured by reduction in
      prostate-specific antigen, of this regimen in these patients. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the overall safety of this regimen as second-line chemotherapy in these patients.

      II. Evaluate the objective response rate in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, phase I, open label, dose-escalation study of mitoxantrone
      hydrochloride and ixabepilone followed by a phase II study.

      PHASE I: Patients receive mitoxantrone hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes and
      ixabepilone IV over 3 hours on day 1 and oral prednisone twice daily on days 1-21. Treatment
      repeats every 21 days for â‰¥ 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of mitoxantrone hydrochloride and
      ixabepilone until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the
      dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      PHASE II: Patients receive mitoxantrone hydrochloride and ixabepilone at the MTD determined
      in phase I and prednisone as in phase I.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months.
