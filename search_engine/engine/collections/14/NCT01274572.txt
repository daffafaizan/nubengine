    
      This study is being conducted to assess and monitor immune response in patients with
      minimally symptomatic or asymptomatic hormone refractory prostate cancer who will be
      receiving Provenge® (Sipuleucel-T) therapy as part of their standard of care treatment
      regimen. The trial only involves the collection of additional blood samples for the purposes
      of monitoring immune response. These samples will be taken at 7 time points before, during
      and after patients receive Provenge® (Sipuleucel-T). There will be no other study-specific
      procedures performed (other than the blood draws) nor any use of investigational agents in
      this study.
