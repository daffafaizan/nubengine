      gonorrhea/chlamydia testing. First, all men will be provided a brief (5 minute) introduction
      to gonorrhea and chlamydia testing using a pamphlet. Program organizers will then explain the
      pay-it-forward program to each man separately. Briefly, men will be told that the hospital
      list price of gonorrhea and chlamydia testing was 150 RMB ($24 USD), but previous men
      attending the clinic had donated money to cover the cost of his test. Thus, each man could
      receive a free gonorrhea and chlamydia test, then decide whether to donate money
      (pay-it-forward) for future men to receive the same option. Men will be assured that donating
      is completely optional and advised to pay any amount that is feasible for them. Each man's
      gonorrhea and chlamydia test fees will be covered by a combination of the initial funding
      pool from the program organizers and the donations from previous participants. Men will also
      be shown a postcard with a message written by a previous pay-it-forward contributor. Messages
      will contain information encouraging men to be tested/slogans to promote sexual health and
      testing (i.e. taking ownership of their health). They will be told that they could also write
      a postcard message for a future participant.

      Men will then decide whether or not to receive combined urine gonorrhea/chlamydia testing.
      Program organizers will inform participants of their test results via WeChat. Patients with
      positive test results will be counseled and directed to the WeChat page of designated
      hospitals where they could make an appointment to receive treatment and follow-up.
