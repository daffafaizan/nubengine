      different home-based exercise programs namely OKC and CKC strengthening exercise
      intervention, on pain, disability, and quality of life on individuals with mild grade knee
      OA. Our secondary aim is to compare the effectiveness of OKC and CKC strengthening exercises
      on lower limb biomechanics during walking gait and sit to stand task. We hypothesize that
      after eight weeks of intervention OKC and CKC groups will show more improvements in pain,
      disability, and quality of life scores (what about the secondary outcomes) than the control
      group.

      For the CKC and OKC exercise group, participants will perform an 8-week individualized home
      exercise, a minimum of three sessions in a week. Each session lasts about 30 minutes,
      including 5 minutes of walking as warming up session and quadriceps and hamstring stretching
      as the cooldown session. Daily Paracetamol 3000mg will be provided to all three groups.
      However, the consumption depends on each participant's needs, and the participants need to
      record it in the diary given. The exercise diary will be given to each participant to ensure
      patients' adherence to home exercise. During the intervention phase, a designated research
      team member will contact the participants personally to encourage them to continue their
      exercises.

      The untreated control group received the patient's clinical education about clinical
      manifestations, risk factors, diagnosis, treatment, and nursing care for knee OA except the
      information related to exercise. The control group will not receive any home exercise
      guidance. Upon completing the trial, participants in the control group will receive either
      CKC or OKC exercises depending on their preference.
