      primary efficacy data by the study's external independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC).
      The DMC assessed the data as demonstrating significant differences between the treatment arms
      in virologic responses and failures. The DMC recommended and the Sponsor concurred that the
      study be terminated because of the inferior efficacy of the Maraviroc arm as compared to the
      comparator arm (Emtricitabine/Tenofovir).
