      significantly affect the patient's body alignment and participation. Especially during
      walking, balance disorders occur, resulting in falls, disability and injury in the advanced
      stage of the disease. As a result of these losses in patients, falls can be seen, and the
      severity of disability that increases with age affects the quality of life of individuals by
      affecting their living in their own homes.

      Dubousset Functional Test (DFT); A conceptually practical four-component assessment test has
      been proposed by Dr. Jean Dubousset to assess the functional capacity of adult individuals.
      The validity of the test was made in individuals with spinal deformity. DFT; It consists of
      four components: getting up from a chair without arms and walking 5 meters forward and
      backward, descending and climbing steps, transition from standing to sitting on the ground,
      and the dual task test in which the individual walks while counting down from 50 at the same
      time

      In the literature, there are many scales that evaluate balance and functional performance in
      Parkinson Disease. However there is no validity and reliability study of Dubousset Function
      Test developed to evaluate balance and functional performance of Parkinson Disease. For this
      reason, the aim of study is to examine the validity and reliability of Dubousset Function
      Test in Parkinson Disease.
