      system in clinical treatment.This clinical trial is a prospective, multi-center, randomized,
      single-blind, parallel-controlled study. The system used in the experimental group is the
      endoscopic instrument control system developed by WEGO Surgical Robot Co., Ltd., and the
      system used in the control group is the da Vinci endoscopic instrument control system
      developed by Intuitive Surgical. Before patients are enrolled in this clinical study, the
      researchers will do a detailed screening of the subjects based on the inclusion criteria and
      the exclusion criteria to determine if the patients are appropriate for the clinical study.
      Patients who meet the conditions of the study will be required to sign an informed consent
      form. Then they will be randomly assigned to the experimental group or the control group. To
      evaluate the primary outcome measures and secondary outcome measures and to observe the
      incidence of organ and vascular injury. Finally, we evaluate the safety and efficacy of the
      test product through the comparison of the data obtained from the experimental group and the
      control group during the treatment.
