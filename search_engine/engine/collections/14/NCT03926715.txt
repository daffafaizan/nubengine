      significantly in short-, mid- and long-term clinical outcome. The prevalence of malnutrition
      is reported between 25% and over 70% based on nutritional assessments. Nutritional disorders
      represent an important risk factor for the occurence of postoperative complications.

      Main obstacles to improving nutritional care include lack of awareness for the problem among
      the general public and lack of awareness among decision makers and even care providers.

      Considering the high prevalence of malnutrition and its repercussions in patient
      morbidity-mortality and healthcare cost, nutritional screening measures must be included in
      an integrated nutritional care plan for patients before surgery and while in the hospital.

      The PRoMiS study was conceived to quantify nutritional disorders among gastrointestinal
      cancer patients undergoing surgery in Italy. The data obtained will contribute to increase
      the awareness of nutritional disorders among oncology surgical patients and their impact on
      clinical outcome, favoring the inclusion of the initial assessment of nutritional status
      before surgery and of the nutritional intervention.
