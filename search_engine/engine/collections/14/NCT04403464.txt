      improvement in the motor and functional abilities of children with cerebral palsy (CP).
      However they usually miss the functional motor skill learning qualities to match the changes
      observed in high intensity motor skill learning based interventions.REAtouchÂ® is a new
      interactive interface based on motor skill learning principles that could be implemented in
      intensive interventions.

      Therefore, the study aims to investigate the effects of intensive interventions with or
      without the interface on the motor and functional abilities of children with bilateral CP.
