    
      This is a randomized, crossover trial that includes two screening visits, one baseline visit,
      and two test periods of 2 weeks each, each ending with a test visit, separated by a 2-week
      washout. Subjects consume each day a refined carbohydrate-rich breakfast containing 8/66/26%
      kcal from protein/carbohydrate/fat, respectively (Control Condition), or a high pork protein
      breakfast containing 35/39/26% kcal from protein/carbohydrate/fat, respectively (Active
      Condition). Study products for daily breakfast consumption will be dispensed to the subjects
      at the beginning of each test period. Subjects will complete 3-day diet records at baseline
      and the end of each test period, and a daily Appetite Visual Analog Scale (VAS) Diary to
      asses perceived hunger and fullness each evening before retiring throughout each test period.
      VAS assessments of hunger, fullness, desire to eat, prospective food consumption, focus and
      energy will also be assessed at the clinic visit at the end of each test period, pre- and
      post-breakfast consumption (multiple time points). Subjects will also complete a palatability
      questionnaire at the each of each test period. Blood samples will be collected at fasting at
      baseline and pre- and post-breakfast consumption (multiple sampling) at the end of each test
      period to evaluate glucose, insulin, and lipoprotein lipid concentrations.
