    
      Mechanical bowel preparation (MBP) has been routinely used prior to minimally invasive
      gynaecologic procedures (MIGP) hypothetically to improve intraoperative bowel handling and
      visualization of the surgical field, and also to reduce faecal contamination in the setting
      of bowel injury and/or resection.

      The studies investigating the effect of MBP on MIGP are limited and most of existing data are
      extrapolated from the reports of colorectal and urological surgery studies.

      Besides, evaluation of the surgical workspace visualization and intraoperative bowel handling
      are far from being objective since they were mostly measured by a 4/5/10-point Likert scales
      or rated verbally on scales of excellent to poor by the operating surgeons.

      In contrary, it is planned to use objective visualize index, and objective surgical
      conditions to measure whether MBP has any effect or not.
