      SPADE cluster and scores on each of its five component scales. The recently released Federal
      Pain Research Strategy states that pain cannot be measured in isolation, but rather should be
      assessed in conjunction with other outcome measures in 'non-pain domains,' such as quality of
      life. It recognizes that pain may be affected by, and affect, such patient attributes as
      sleep, mood, cognition, function, and quality of life. Further, the report states that
      improvement in pain without concomitant improvement in other domains may not constitute a
      clinically meaningful outcome. This study primarily aims to assess the utility of a
      health-related quality of life report in improving quality of life, back pain intensity, and
      back-related disability in participants with chronic low back pain. Another aspect of the
      study will be to determine how the health-related quality of life report may impact the
      physician-patient interaction. This will be assessed using validated measures of physician
      interpersonal manner, empathy, and communication style, as well as end-of-trial survey data
      acquired from participants assigned to the experimental group. The survey will include an
      overall assessment of the report, as well as specific actions attributed to the report.
