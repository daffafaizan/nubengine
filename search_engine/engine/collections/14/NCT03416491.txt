      highly variable HCV genotype geographic distribution. A simple, universal,
      non-genotype-specific treatment regimen is preferred for anti-HCV treatment in clinical
      practice and public health. KW-136 and sofosbuvir are potent anti-HCV agents targeting at
      different HCV proteins, namely, nonstructural protein 5A and 5B, respectively. The
      combination regimen of KW-136 and sofosbuvir is expected to completely suppress HCV
      replication in subjects chronically infected with HCV and achieve a sustained virologic
      response, namely, HCV not detected or below a predefined limit in plasma, 12 or 24 weeks
      after cessation of treatment.

      As KW-136 and sofosbuvir are both pan-genotypic anti-HCV agents (in simple words, effective
      for all known common genotypes of HCV), the combination of these two agents is also supposed
      to be efficacious for treatment of subjects chronically infected with HCV of all major
      genotypes and subtypes. An apparent clinical benefit of this pan-genotypic anti-HCV treatment
      regimen is that no complex, delicate HCV genotype sequencing is required before initiation of
      treatment to determine genotype-specific treatment alternatives of choice. This advantage is
      of great significance in the primary care setting.
