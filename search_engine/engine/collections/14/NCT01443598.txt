      interstitial lung disease.

      In this context, PH represents an important factor of morbidity and mortality for these
      patients.

      One of the purposes of HYPID is to determine predictive factors of mortality within this
      cohort of patients.

      In order to reach that aim,the study includes an evaluation based on exams conducted for the
      routine follow-up of patients. Each patient will be followed during 2 years at least.
