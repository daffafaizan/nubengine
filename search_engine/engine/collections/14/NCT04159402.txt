      out in the mouse model. Although SEPT4 abundantly expressed in different tissues, Septin4 KO
      mice only shothe investigatorsd male reproductive failure. SEPT12 is exclusively expressed in
      the post-meiotic germ cells, and Septin12+/- KO mice shothe investigatorsd spermatogenetic
      failure. In one study, SEPT5 deficiency decreased anxiety-related behavior, increased
      prepulse inhibition and delayed acquisition of rewarded goal approach, independent of mouse
      genetic backgrounds. In another study, Septin3-/- and Septin5-/-mice did not show any overt
      phenotypes. Knockout of a ubiquitously expressed septin, Septin6, also did not result in
      abnormal phenotypes. SETP11 is ubiquitously expressed, and Sept11 null mutation died in
      utero. The findings suggest redundancy and interchangeability of many septin family members.
      Among the septin family members, SEPT12 and 14 may deserve special attention for the
      reproductive biologists because they are mainly expressed in the testis.
