    
      This is an open-label, multicenter, phase 1 study to determine the safety and antitumor
      activity of BZ019 in adult patients with R/R large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL),including: DLBCL,
      not otherwise specified (NOS), transformed DLBCL, high-grade B-cell lymphoma with MYC and
      BCL2 and/or BCL6 rearrangements and primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL).The safety
      and efficacy of a single dose of different target doses of BZ019 will be evaluated in the
      dose-escalation phase and dose-expansion phase.

      Upon enrollment, subjects will undergo leukapheresis to enable BZ019 product generation. A
      baseline tumor biopsy (in subjects with accessible disease) and bone marrow aspirate and
      biopsy will be obtained.

      Upon successful BZ019 product generation, subjects will enter the treatment phase and receive
      BZ019 infusion. A completed treatment program will include lymphodepleting chemotherapy with
      fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (flu/cy) followed by single-dose of BZ019 infusion. BZ019
      will be administered 2 to 14 days after the completion of lymphodepleting chemotherapy.

      After the infusion of BZ019, subjects will be in the follow-up period upon 12 months for
      evaluation the safety and efficacy of BZ019. Subjects will be followed for long-term safety,
      overall survival even after disease progression.
