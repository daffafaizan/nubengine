      I. To determine whether the application of a topical anesthetic (EMLA cream) to the LP site
      will decrease the total dose of propofol administered to pediatric oncology patients who are
      being sedated for LPs compared to application of a topical placebo cream.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether the use of EMLA cream decreases complication rates from sedation.

      II. To determine whether the use of EMLA cream decreases traumatic lumbar punctures.

      III. To determine whether the use of EMLA cream shortens recovery time. IV. To determine
      practitioner and parent satisfaction with the use of EMLA cream.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive topical EMLA cream 60 minutes to 4 hours prior to the LP followed by
      standard sedation with fentanyl citrate and propofol.

      ARM II: Patients receive topical placebo cream 60 minutes to 4 hours prior to the LP followed
      by standard sedation with fentanyl citrate and propofol.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up within 1 week.
