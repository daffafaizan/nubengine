      Clinic and the combined Endocrine/Neurosurgical Pituitary Clinic at the University of Alberta
      Hospital, will be performed to determine the effectiveness of various treatment strategies on
      the long term outcome of specific pituitary disorders. The investigator's will collect
      retrospective demographic (age, sex, ethnicity), clinical (mode of presentation, hormonal
      parameters) and therapeutic outcome (surgical, medical, expectant and / or radiation
      treatment; co-morbidities and complications) of patients seen in these two clinics between
      January 2000 and December 2017.
