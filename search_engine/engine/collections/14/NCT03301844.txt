      discomfort or eye irritation. Treatment of blepharitis is recommended even in mild cases as
      chronic inflammation may cause permanent damage to the Meibomian glands.

      Each eye of each patient represents an experimental unit. Each patient will apply Blephapad
      Combo to one eye and standard treatment to the other eye in accordance with the randomization
      procedure.

      The aim of this randomized, controlled study with a closed sequential design is to evaluate
      versus standard treatment the efficacy of, and patient satisfaction with Blephapad Combo in
      the treatment of posterior blepharitis.
