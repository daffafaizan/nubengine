      randomly assigned to telmisartan/amlodipine combination in dose 80/5 mg (group I, n=34) or
      placebo (group II, n=30) taking daily for up to one week. Echocardiography was performed
      before the procedure, immediately after it, and after a week of therapy. The six-minute walk
      test and SF-36 questionnaire results were evaluated a day before the procedure and after a
      week of the therapy. The left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was invasively measured
      after transseptal puncture and before left atrial sheath removal.
