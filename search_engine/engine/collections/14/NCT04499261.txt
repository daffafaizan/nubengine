      originating in the paracaval portion often cling to or even invade major hepatic vascular
      structures. Open surgery is the traditional surgical method for resection of
      paracaval-originating lesions. With the development of laparoscopic surgery,
      paracaval-originating lesions are no longer an absolute contraindication for laparoscopic
      procedures. The high-definition magnified view and ability to change perspectives with the
      laparoscope are conducive to subtle manipulation, and compression of the carbon dioxide
      pneumoperitoneum can reduce venous bleeding. Nevertheless, laparoscopic anterior hepatic
      transection for paracaval-originating lesion resection is still a challenging procedure, and
      only a few cases have been reported. This study aimed to evaluate the safety, feasibility and
      efficacy of laparoscopic for resecting paracaval-originating lesions by contrast of open
      procedures.
