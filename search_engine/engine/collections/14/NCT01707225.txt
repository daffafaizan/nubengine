      Our key secondary outcomes will focus on study drug efficacy. Patient experience of the

      Need for Blood Transfusion Hospital Admission for GI Bleed

      Heart disease is a leading cause of death and disability, according to the American Heart
      Association. Current therapies include lifestyle modification, medical management and
      revascularization via Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) or Coronary Artery Bypass
      Surgery (CABG). However, a large portion of patients develop cardiomyopathy which is
      refractory to the above interventions. They are treated with chronic inotropes,
      resynchronization and other forms of medical management.

      Many of these patients eventually worsen and need consideration for cardiac transplantation.
      The Thoratec Heartmate II, which is the primary left ventricular assist device (LVAD)
      implanted at our institution, has been used as a bridge-to-transplantation. More recently it
      has been approved as destination therapy for patients who are not candidates for
      transplantation. Over 6000 of these devices have been implanted worldwide since their
      introduction. We have implanted over 70 here at the VCU Health System and the McGuire VA
      Medical Center.

      The early LVAD devices provided physiologic pulsatility, but were large in size and required
      large catheters for external venting. The newer continuous flow LVAD devices, such as the
      Heartmate II, offer the benefit of being smaller and easier to implant as well as improving
      mobility and thus quality of life. However, this benefit comes with a complication of an
      increased incidence of GI bleeding, thought to be related to the loss of pulsatility and the
      nature of these smaller devices.

      Approximately 10-30% of patients experience at least one episode GI bleeding which is likely
      multifactorial. It has already been demonstrated that an acquired von Willebrand Syndrome
      (vWS) develops due to destruction of multimeric vWF. Additionally, it has been shown that
      these patients have a higher than normal percentage of gastrointestinal angiodysplasia.
      Whether these are preexisting or develop as a result of de novo angiogenesis from the gut
      mucosa is unknown. It is thought that the loss of pulsatility and potential hypoxia result in
      secretion of angiogenic mediators and contribute to the development of angiodysplasia.

      Current treatment for LVAD associated GI bleeding is aimed at identifying the location of
      bleeding and treatment with blood product transfusion, cryoprecipitate for vWS, Desmopressin
      for platelet dysfunction, and interventions through Interventional Radiology (IR) and
      surgery. In addition to the obvious costs and increase in morbidity and mortality associated
      with the above therapies, patients who receive multiple transfusions develop antibodies and
      thus become more difficult to transplant. Thus a vicious cycle develops.

      We need to strive for a proactive stance in these patients and attack the problem at the
      source. There is a considerable amount of experience using octreotide in idiopathic chronic
      GI bleeding. This is likely due to its ability to decrease splanchnic blood flow and its
      potential ability to inhibit angiogenesis. Octreotide has been thoroughly studied and has a
      known safety profile. Off label use of octreotide LAR for the purpose of attenuating LVAD
      associated GI bleeding is currently practiced by some physicians at VCU with no adverse side
      effects encountered. It is time to formally study the safety and efficacy of octreotide LAR
      for this purpose. We propose an open-label safety study for 10 subjects to be followed for a
      total of 24 weeks. Should the safety study be favorably completed, a multi-center trial with
      randomization to octreotide LAR or placebo with endpoints of GI bleeding and transfusion will
      be pursued.
