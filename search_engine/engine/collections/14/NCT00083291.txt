      catalase-positive, Gram-negative rod with 4-6 sheathed flagella attached to one pole which
      allow for motility. The prevalence of H. pylori infection in humans is high; 50% of those
      over the age of 60 are infected. H. pylori infection causes chronic gastric inflammation,
      ulcer disease and gastric carcinoma. Further, chronic antigenic stimulation driven by H.
      pylori infection has been linked to the development of gastric mucosa associated lymphoid
      tissue (MALT) lymphoma. Infection with H. pylori induces a vigorous immune response resulting
      in the presence of local and systemic antibodies. H. pylori-specific immunoglobulin G
      antibodies present in serum, plasma, whole blood, saliva, gastric juice and urine have each
      been used to successfully detect the presence of infection in adults. The sensitivity and
      specificity of serological tests range from 80% to 95% depending upon the assay used. H.
      Pylori infection is characteristically associated with a vigorous inflammatory response and
      we have recently identified H. Pylori DNA in conjunctival MALT lymphoma using molecular
      diagnostic techniques. Ocular surface inflammation is a cardinal feature of
      keratoconjunctivitis sicca. Since we identified H. Pylori DNA in conjunctival MALT lymphoma
      we hypothesize that chronic infection may also be capable of triggering chronic ocular
      surface inflammation as seen in keratoconjunctivitis sicca. The purpose of this pilot study
      is to determine whether H. pylori DNA is detectable in the conjunctiva of seropositive KCS
      patients.
