      minority lupus patients (African-Americans and Hispanics) to make shared decisions for the
      management of their lupus nephritis considering what is the best for them. We have developed
      an individualized patient decision guide that is culturally sensitive since it was developed
      solely based on the values, beliefs and preferences of minority patients. We will test the
      effectiveness of individualized decision aids in African-American and Hispanic lupus
      nephritis patients in a 2-arm randomized trial including 200 patients. We hypothesize that
      use of decision-aid will be associated with reduction in decisional conflict and more
      informed choice compared to usual care group (American College of Rheumatology [ACR] lupus
      pamphlet; co-primary effectiveness outcomes), both clinically meaningful and patient-centered
      outcomes. We chose the low-literacy decisional conflict scale as our primary outcome, since
      it is a validated measure, and the most commonly used outcome measure in decision aids RCTs.
      We use informed choice as a co-primary outcome, since this is conceptually most immediate to
      the intervention. It will measure whether in those with knowledge of risks and benefits of
      immunosuppressive drugs, patient values are concordant with their choice of immunosuppressive
      drug. Secondary outcomes include patient involvement in decision-making (concordance on
      control preference scale) and patient-physician communication (Interpersonal Processes of
      Care (IPC) score and analysis of audiotaped physician-patient Interaction (using the Active
      Patient Participation Coding Scheme (APPC)). Since we planned to recruit patients with
      current lupus nephritis flare (making current decision for an immunosuppressive drug) and
      with past lupus nephritis flares (making the same decision for a future lupus nephritis
      flare), two secondary outcomes (control preference scale for concordance of preferred and
      real role in deciding about immunosuppressive drugs and the audiotaped physician-patient
      interaction about immunosuppressive drugs) will be analyzed only in patients with current
      lupus nephritis flare, a subset of the entire cohort.
