      TAC we want to assess whether subclinical cardiovascular damage is present in adult patients
      with breast cancer who have completed treatment with (neo)adjuvant TAC one year previously,
      using MIBG (meta-iodobenzylguanidine) scintigraphy, novel echocardiographic techniques and
      blood biomarkers. Following the study by Lipshultz et al. we expect to find at least in 25%
      of the patients signs of subclinical cardiovascular damage with at least one of the three
      techniques.(11) If at least 10% is observed we will conclude that it is useful to further
      pursue the use of these techniques for the detection of subclinical cardiotoxicity in a next
      clinical study which will be powered to assess the predictive value of these techniques for
      the development of clinical heart failure. If a lower percentage is observed we will conclude
      that it is not useful to further pursue the use of these techniques for the detection of
      subclinical cardiotoxicity.
