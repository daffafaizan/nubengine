    
      This study is a single-arm, open-label phase Ib clinical trial testing the hypothesis that
      the daily use of lenalidomide will be safe and tolerable as evidenced by the rate of
      dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) seen during one month of reinduction/consolidation in older (≥
      60 years of age) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients treated after one cycle of
      conventional, anthracycline-based induction. (Re-induction is the prescribed lenalidomide
      therapy given to patients who are in partial remission/response post induction while
      consolidation is the same prescribed lenalidomide therapy post induction given to patients
      who are in complete remission).

      Dose escalation will take place within cohorts during the 28-day re-induction/ consolidation
      lenalidomide treatment at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. After
      re-induction/consolidation, patients who harbor ≥ 5% peripheral blood or bone marrow
      myeloblasts will be removed from protocol therapy. Patients who have <5% peripheral blood or
      bone marrow myeloblasts after consolidation therapy will be allowed to continue to
      maintenance therapy: lenalidomide 10 mg/day continuously for up to 12 months. Up to 26
      patients will be enrolled.

      This trial includes a Geriatric Assessment (GA) of each enrolled patient at baseline and
      serially across the trial. The investigators also plan to study natural killer (NK) cell
      phenotype and cytolytic function in patients at various intervals across the study (baseline,
      post re-induction/consolidation, and during maintenance.
