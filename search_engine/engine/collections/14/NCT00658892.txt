    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the safety/toxicity of a single dose of B7-dendritic cell cross-linking
           antibody containing plasma in treating patients with stage IV melanoma.

      Secondary

        -  Describe the immunological changes (Th1/Th2 balance, frequency of tumor specific
           cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and plasma cytokine profiles) in the treated patients.

        -  Determine the treatment impact on tumor growth (e.g., objective response, time to
           progression).

      OUTLINE: Patients receive B7-dendritic cell cross-linking antibody IV once on day 1.

      Patients undergo peripheral blood collection at baseline and periodically after infusion for
      analysis of dendritic cell activation, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte activity, immune cell impact,
      and serum cytokine changes using immunophenotyping and flow cytometry.

      After completion of study treatment patients are followed every 2 months for 5 years.
