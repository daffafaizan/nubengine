      decline with age, such as those associated with executive control (e.g., abstract thinking,
      selective and divided attention, planning, task-switching and inhibitory control). The aim of
      the present study is to investigate the feasibility of a web-based computerized cognitive
      training based on executive control to cognitively healthy older adults. The participants
      will undergo the web-training in a daily type situation of meal preparation (i.e., Breakfast
      Task). The training protocol will occur in two phases. In the first phase of the protocol,
      participants will be randomized in two different training conditions: Table Setting (TS) or
      Cooking (CO). In the second phase, all participants will undergo a complex training condition
      combining TS and CO in a multi-tasking fashion (Emphasis Change approach). In addition,
      participants will undergo web-based cognitive evaluations at pre-training, between-training
      phases, and at post-training. This approach will allow us to understand (1) how different
      previous training experience impact on multi-tasking context, and (2) if Emphasis Change
      training is an effective approach to improve cognitive performance in a multi-task daily type
      context. If feasible, the investigators protocol will allow training older adults in critical
      cognitive skills for daily life situations. The web-based training is an advancement since it
      can be delivered at-home, remotely supervised, and is easily scalable. Recently, remote
      interventions have been particularly relevant to OA due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which may
      limit in-person research participation.
