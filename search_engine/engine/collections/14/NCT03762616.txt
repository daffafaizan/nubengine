      transrectal micro-ultrasound (micro-US), and multi-parametric MRI (mpMRI). These modalities
      are both used clinically to identify targets for prostate biopsy, however little data is
      available to compare their sensitivity. While mpMRI is used clinically to identify targets
      for biopsy, it is not used for real-time biopsy guidance due to challenges performing the
      biopsy procedure within the MRI gantry. Instead, targets identified on mpMRI are sampled
      during transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy as part of the prostate biopsy procedure, often
      using software assisted fusion products. For this investigation, the biopsy procedure will be
      guided by transrectal micro-US (current standard of care at Urology San Antonio), and will
      include systematic (standard, random, extended sextant) plus image-guided prostate biopsies
      among men with clinical suspicion of prostate cancer and an indication for prostate biopsy.
