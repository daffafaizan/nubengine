      Subjects will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either cobomarsen or vorinostat.
      Approximately 126 subjects (63 per arm) are expected to be enrolled. Cobomarsen will be
      administered in the clinic by 2-hr intravenous infusion on Days 1, 3, 5 and 8, and weekly
      thereafter. Vorinostat will be dispensed to study subjects and taken as a daily oral dose
      according to the manufacturer's labeled dosing instructions. Treatment will continue until
      the subject becomes intolerant, develops clinically significant side effects, progresses, or
      the trial is terminated. An interim analysis will be conducted after approximately 40
      subjects have been followed for a minimum of approximately 6 months. Enrollment will be
      suspended until the completion of the interim analysis.
