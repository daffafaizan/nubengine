      of open hemorrhoidectomy. Patients will be divided into a study group and a control group.
      Study group patients during a post-operation period except a standard treatment (antiseptic
      solutions and antibacterial and wound healing ointments) of a post-operation wound will be
      treated with cold argon plasma. Control group patients will be treated with a standard
      treatment. Wound healing speed will be researched.
