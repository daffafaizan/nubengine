      Primary

        -  Determine the safety of sunitinib malate in patients with localized or metastatic renal
           cell carcinoma.

        -  Determine the safety of surgery after 90 days of treatment with sunitinib malate in
           these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine response of these patients after 90 days of treatment with sunitinib malate.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral sunitinib malate once daily on days 1-90 in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then undergo radical nephrectomy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 3 months.
