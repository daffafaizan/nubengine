    
      The mission of the Louisville Cooperative Tissue Biorepository is to appropriately collect
      normal and abnormal tissues that are removed from the human body as a part of standard
      medical and surgical practice after adequate portions are secured by surgical pathologists to
      allow for correct diagnoses to be made. The LCTB securely stores appropriately collected
      human samples for research purposes and appropriately allocates these samples to local
      investigators for research purposes. The LCTB team appropriately documents all points in the
      process of obtaining informed consent, collection, storage, and allocation of tissues.
