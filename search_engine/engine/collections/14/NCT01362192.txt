    
      Each subject will receive 532 nm KTP laser treatment for their lower extremity spider veins
      in at least 2, and up to 4, separate areas. Subjects will receive 2 laser treatments spaced
      12 weeks apart. Subjects will be followed for 24 weeks (12 weeks after the final laser
      treatment). Efficacy will be evaluated by blinded independent physician assessment of
      improvement in treated spider veins using digital photographs taken at baseline and the final
      follow-up visit by a third-party medical photography service. In addition, efficacy will be
      evaluated by the Investigator's mean global assessment of improvement and the subject's mean
      assessment of improvement. Safety will be evaluated by continuous monitoring of adverse
      events (AEs) and measuring pain associated with laser treatment.
