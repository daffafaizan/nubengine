      (YAs) including online relapse prevention, brief telephone counseling and Assertive
      Continuing Care (ACC). Five sessions of in-person therapy or brief telephone counseling both
      have reduced relapse in youth completing treatment relative to a no CC condition, consistent
      with a growing body of research with adults supporting the efficacy of telephone-based CC
      (TCC). ACC has been thoroughly evaluated for adolescents. Some applications also have
      incorporated contingency management (CM) for engaging in activities including needed
      services; but ACC has not applied CM to biologically-verified abstinence -- an efficacious
      approach in adult CC. A significant drawback of ACC is that it is quite intensive, requiring
      extended clinician training and home visits. This increases the costs of the intervention and
      the difficulty of dissemination and implementation; therefore we plan to develop a less
      clinician-intensive continuing care model for YAs.

      The two phase pilot study will 1) interview 50 parents and 50 YAs recruited from residential
      substance abuse treatment programs and from parent groups to inform the development of the
      intervention and 2) conduct a two-arm pilot study that will recruit a maximum of 20 parents
      and their YA children into one of two conditions (Home-based Continuing Care [HCC]
      intervention group or Services as Usual [SAU] comparison group) with the main goal of
      determining whether conducting such an intervention is acceptable and sustainable, and to
      collect preliminary efficacy data. We hypothesize that pilot testing will indicate that: (a)
      HCC is acceptable and potentially sustainable; (b) conducting a randomized clinical trial is
      feasible, and (c) the magnitude of outcomes from HCC will be clinically meaningful.
