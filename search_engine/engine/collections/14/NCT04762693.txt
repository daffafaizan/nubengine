    
      This is a single-center prospective observational study that pretends to evaluate the
      accuracy of an acoustic surveillance mobile app to detect individual episodes of cough among
      a monitored population, as well as the barriers and facilitators that might affect uptake of
      similar platforms at a population level.

      The app in question, Hyfe cough tracker, runs in the background of smartphones, and records
      short snippets (<0.5 seconds) of explosive, putative cough sounds. These are then classified
      as cough or non-cough, using a convolutional neural network (CNN) model, and matched to GPS
      and time data collected by the smartphone.

      The night-time cough of participants will be monitored for a 30-day period, and their
      clinical records will be reviewed regularly, specifically looking for diagnoses of
      cough-producing diseases, and with special emphasis on COVID-19.

      Cough data will be used to create a heatmap of cough density and geographic distribution.
      Aggregated cough registries will be used to calculate the coughs per person-hour registered
      in the cohort. These data will be used to carry out an ARIMA analysis on three parallel time
      series at the community level: The incidence of respiratory disease in the monitored cohort,
      in the entire study area (including the Universidad de Navarra, and the neighbouring Cendea
      de Cizur), and the cough frequency per monitored hours.

      Changes in cough frequency will also be compared to other environmental variables such as
      temperature and pollution level registered in the study area.
