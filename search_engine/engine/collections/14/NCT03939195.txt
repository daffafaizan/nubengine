      lacunarity (Lac, without unit), vascular density (VD,%) and surface area of choroidal
      neovascular ( CNV, mm2).

      The fractal dimension of a vascular structure corresponds to its degree of complexity.
      Fractals are models found in nature and biological systems that show self-similarity at
      different magnifications. It is obtained from the "box counting" method calculating the
      number of vascular segments contained in squares of varied size. Normal retinal vessels have
      a known and quantified complexity (FD = 1.7).

      A neovascular tumor treated with anti-angiogenics will reduce vascular density, losing its
      random architecture; the investigators observe a return to a model standardized. NVCs have a
      random organization. The lower the FD, the more random the vascular architecture.

      Lacunarity represents the texture or the homogeneity of a lesion, this one is heterogeneous
      when it is little vascularized and homogeneous if the vascularization is very dense. The
      lower the lake, the more homogeneous the lesion.

      FD and Lac are obtained in Angiography Optical Coherence Tomography (OCTA) by the analysis of
      the hypersignal detected on the cut of the external retina.

      The image is automatically binarised and skeletonized. NVC delineation is automatic and
      associated with automatic background noise processing. This software is fully automatic whose
      inter and intra grader reproducibility will be evaluated.
