      problematic drinking within one year of treatment. Thus, additional treatment strategies are
      needed. Notably, up to 74% of individuals seeking treatment for AUD report co-occurring
      symptoms of insomnia, while 85% of those seeking SUD treatment report insomnia symptoms.
      Given the negative impact of insomnia on attention and emotion regulation, insomnia symptoms
      may decrease patients' abilities to attend to treatment for substance use and manage negative
      emotions that lead to craving and relapse. This project aims to examine the feasibility,
      acceptability, and initial efficacy of a CBT-I supplement to substance use treatment. Forty
      adults who meet diagnostic criteria for AUD or SUD and Insomnia Disorder will receive
      Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I). In order to generate hypotheses regarding
      the efficacy of CBT-I for individuals who are and are not engaged in substance use treatment,
      we aim to recruit 20 participants who are engaged in substance use treatment through the
      community at baseline and 20 participants who are not. Outcomes will be assessed at the end
      of the active intervention period (6 weeks) and at 6 weeks post-intervention
