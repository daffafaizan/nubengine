    
      This is a two-centre prospective cohort study in very preterm infants born below 32 0/7 weeks
      PMA and hospitalised in the neonatal intensive care units at the University Children's
      Hospital Basel and the Inselspital Berne during two years. After informed consent a sample of
      0.5 mL ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) full blood will be taken on day 7 of life (+/-
      2 days) during routine blood sampling. The biomarkers which are planned to measure include
      the C-terminal portion of the proendothelin-1 precursor (CT-proendothelin (proET)-1) and
      other plasma biomarkers of respiratory distress. At 36 weeks PMA, lung function testing will
      be performed during quiet unsedated sleep in supine position approximately 30 minutes post
      feeding. After placement of a facemask, tidal breathing will be recorded at the bedside using
      a commercially available ultrasonic flow meter (Spiroson, Exhalyzer D, Ecomedics, CH)
      according to American Thoracic Society (ATS) and European Respiratory Society (ERS) standards
      of infant lung function testing. Different capnographic indices will be calculated to
      investigate if they reflect the degree of lung disease at 36 weeks PMA.
