    
      This study will be a multicenter, single-arm, open-label Phase II trial. Patients with
      advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, who are previously treated with a
      platinum based regimen or with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy or both, will be eligible
      for participation on the study. After a baseline evaluation and biopsy (where feasible), they
      will be treated with weekly/bi-weekly intravenous cetuximab and daily oral afatinib. Biopsy
      will be repeated where feasible after 4 weeks (window of +1 week) on therapy and again at
      disease progression or end of treatment.

      Treatment will continue until disease progression or development of Grade 3 or higher drug
      related toxicities that fail to resolve to Grade 2 despite appropriate supportive care.
