    
      Patient randomization will be stratified based on patient's location (Memphis vs. other), use
      of antihypertensives prior to randomization, and factors known to influence osteonecrosis
      risk, specifically sex and self-declared race (non-Hispanic white vs. other). A target
      systolic blood pressure range will be chosen for each participant based on their
      randomization arm, age, sex, and height.

      Patients will be randomized on day 4 of induction therapy to either conventional or intensive
      blood pressure goals. Patients will be treated with antihypertensive therapy to achieve blood
      pressure control as indicated by their randomized arm. Therapy will be adjusted every 3-4
      days as needed to achieve targeted control based on the mean of blood pressures obtained in
      that period. Treatment of hypertension to the target will continue until the completion of
      reinduction II therapy. Patients will be evaluated for osteonecrosis as indicated in their
      primary therapeutic protocol using MRI during reinduction II.

      Patients will be asked to complete a symptom survey and a semi-structured interview.
