      features include neutropenia, anemia, and rheumatoid arthritis. The terminal effector memory
      phenotype (CD3+/CD8+/CD57+/CD45RA+/CD62L-) of leukemic LGL suggest a pivotal chronic antigen
      driven immune response. LGL survival is then promoted by PDGF and IL-15, resulting in global
      dysregulation of apoptosis and resistance to normal pathways of activation-induced death.
      These pathogenic features explain why treatment of LGL leukemia is based on immunosuppression
      therapy. However, no standard therapy has been established due to the absence of large
      prospective trials.

      Oral low dose MTX has been shown to be efficacious in the treatment of neutropenia. However,
      response to MTX is slow, requiring several months for the neutrophil count to increase above
      500/mm3. Also, complete clinical remission may not be achieved until after one year of MTX
      therapy. Oral Cy has been the primary drug used for the treatment of severe
      transfusion-dependent anemia. Beneficial clinical effects are seen despite this treatment
      having no apparent effect on the abnormal LGL clone. Normal hematocrits are maintained after
      cessation of Cy and these results contrast the effects seen with MTX, in which clinical
      remissions are often associated with the disappearance of the clone.

      This phase II trial undertaken by the Eastern Cooperative Group (ECOG) was initiated to
      investigate the mechanism of treatment response in patients with LGL leukemia, who need
      treatment for anemia or neutropenia.
