      hormone concentrations and ovulation in women. Women's sexuality, unlike that of most
      mammals, is not solely defined by sexual receptivity during the short window of fertility.
      Women are also prone to initiate luteal-phase sex when serum levels of progesterone are
      highest in the menstrual cycle.As a result of ovarian hormonal cessation after menopause
      women may face alterations in sexual desire.

      The role of progesterone supplementation in improving sexual desire in the menopausal period
      is investigated.
