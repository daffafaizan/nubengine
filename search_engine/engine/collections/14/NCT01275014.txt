      operation room under controlled conditions. After marking the points for insertion of the
      needles, a first 18 gauge injection needle was inserted into the upper intra-articular space
      of the TMJ. Correct positioning of the needle was determined by injecting and aspirating
      saline. Subsequently, a second 18 gauge needle was inserted into the upper joint space about
      8-10 mm anterior of the first needle. Correct positioning of the second needle was confirmed
      by allowing injected saline to leave the joint through the first needle. After positioning of
      the needles, one needle was connected to a medical infusion system to passively allow
      isotonic saline of 37 degrees Celsius to enter the upper joint compartment. The other needle
      was connected to an outflow tube to allow the fluid to exit the joint. In about 15 minutes,
      approximately 300 ml saline passively flushed the joint. Thereafter, the inflow was stopped
      and the prepared syringe (see randomisation procedure) that contained either dexamethasone or
      saline was connected to the inflow needle. In this way, either 1 cc of dexamethasone or an
      equal amount of saline was washed through the joint in a blinded way. At the end of the
      procedure, the needles were removed from the joint, and after hemostasis by compression (if
      necessary) the skin overlying the TMJ was covered with a sterile band aid.

      All patients were then instructed to avoid TMJ loading by following a soft diet for at least
      two weeks, then gradually advancing to more tough food. In addition, ibuprofen 600 mg 3dd was
      prescribed for the first 2-5 days to reduce any postoperative pain. All procedures were
      performed by one surgeon.

      Follow up visits were scheduled after 1 (T1), 3 (T2) and 24 (T3) weeks.
