      ducts. Standard treatment options for CCA include surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy,
      dependent upon if the CCA is intra- or extra-hepatic. Surgical removal of the tumor is the
      only potential cure, and CCA is very resistant to standard pharmaceutical drug treatment,
      though chemotherapy has some effect. Current chemotherapy uses cisplatin plus gemcitabine.
      Photochemical internalisation (PCI) is a novel technology, where photochemical reactions are
      used to enhance the effect of drugs by increasing their ability cross cell membranes to
      interact with their intended target. This study will assess the safety and effectiveness of
      fimaporfin-induced PCI of gemcitabine complemented by systemic gemcitabine/cisplatin
      chemotherapy compared to gemcitabine/cisplatin alone, in patients with inoperable CCA.
