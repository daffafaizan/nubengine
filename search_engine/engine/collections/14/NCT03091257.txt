      this study drug in this disease. "Investigational" means that the combination of drugs is
      being studied. It also means that the FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not
      approved the drugs for your type of cancer.

      The FDA has not approved Trametinib or Dabrafenib for your specific disease but they have
      been approved for other uses.

      Some cancers have changes (mutations) in a gene called BRAF or other genes, called KRAS or
      NRAS. These three genes tell the body to make a protein called BRAF, KRAS, or NRAS,
      respectively, which are all involved in sending signals in cells that can lead to cell
      growth. Certain mutations in these three genes cause a change in these proteins that can
      increase the growth and spread of cancer cells.

      Dabrafenib and trametinib work to prevent these altered proteins from working and sending
      signals in cancer cells, and thereby may block the growth and spread of cancer cells in
      people with cancers with BRAF, KRAS, or NRAS gene mutations. Dabrafenib and trametinib have
      been used in the treatment for other cancers in other research studies, and information from
      those research studies suggest that these agents may help to kill multiple myeloma cells.

      Dabrafenib and trametinib, which are investigated in this research study may or may not kill
      myeloma cells effectively. We would like to see if these drugs given alone or in combination
      safely and effectively kill these cancer cells.
