      (IXT), to determine if the treatment effect would persist after overminus minus lenses are
      discontinued and also to investigate if overminus lenses cause myopia.

      Materials and Method: Sixty-five consecutive cases of IXT followed for at least 48 months
      were included. Patients with a history of previous surgery, ocular pathology, convergence
      insufficiency, severe myopia (>-5.0 D), severe hyperopia (>+5.0 D), moderate or severe
      amblyopia and poor compliance with spectacles were excluded. Data was collected including
      near stereoacuity, AC/A ratio, control of IXT measured with Newcastle Control Score (NCS) at
      baseline and in all follow-up visits. Baseline values without overminus threapy were compared
      with postintervention values at every visit.
