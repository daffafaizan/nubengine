      to the development of new therapies to rehabilitate stroke survivors whose recovery of motor
      function has stalled with conventional therapeutic methodology. However, the efficacy of
      these new therapies appears to be limited to relatively high-functioning chronic stroke
      patients. A therapeutic approach that may be efficacious in restoring functional movement to
      low-functioning chronic stroke patients is "AMES," which stands for Assisted Movement with
      Enhanced Sensation. Despite the efficacy of AMES in restoring movement to low-functioning
      hemiparetic stroke patients, those with plegia at a joint tend not to recover movement in the
      plegic direction with AMES treatment or with other rehabilitation therapies. The objective of
      this study is to determine if AMES treatment in combination with biofeedback can be helpful
      in restoring functional movement to plegic stroke patients.
