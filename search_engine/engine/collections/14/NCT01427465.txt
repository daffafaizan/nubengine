    
      A total of 921 adolescents from two diverse high schools in northeast Florida were randomized
      to receive either the: 1) in-person consult, 2) parent-youth letter, 3) adolescent
      newsletter, or 4) standard care control . Three-month, one-year and 18-month follow-ups are
      planned, with interventions to be implemented in rotating fashion as re-interventions
      immediately after three-month and one-year data collections. Plans for following year include
      the following: 1) collecting and analyzing 3-month post-intervention data to determine the
      effects of the initial consult, parent-youth and adolescent print strategies, intervention
      costs, and assess possible mediators and moderators of outcomes; 2) implementing the first
      round of re-interventions; 3) collecting and analyzing one-year post-baseline effects of
      re-interventions, determining costs and cost-effectiveness of the
      interventions/re-interventions, and assessing possible mediators and moderators of outcomes;
      and 4) implementing the second round of re-interventions.
