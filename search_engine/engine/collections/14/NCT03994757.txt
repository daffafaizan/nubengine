      and objective assessment for pre-test, post-test and three-monthfollow-up after treatment.
      After pre-test, children will be randomized and assigned to either the experimental group or
      the control group. The experimental group willreceive RBEI and the control group willreceive
      traditional therapy. The treatment period is 12 weeks, 1-2 times a week, 1-2hours each time,
      and homework is given during the treatment period, allowing parents to do treatment at home.
      Post-test will be conducted immediately after the end of treatment period, and homework will
      continue until three-month follow-up conducts. It is expected that after intervention, the
      physical function, activities and participation, quality of life of the experimental group
      will improve and significantly different from the control group.
