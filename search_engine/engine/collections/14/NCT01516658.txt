    
      At least one Hydrocoil have to use in Hydrocoil arm, and only bare platinum coil have to use
      in Control arm.

      Primary endpoint is recanalization within 1 year after embolization, and secondary endpoint
      are:

        1. aneurysmal rupture within 1 year after embolization

        2. any event within 30 days after embolization

        3. recanalization within 6 months after embolization

        4. aneurysmal retreatment within 1 year after embolization

        5. aneurysmal rupture and any death within 1 year after embolization

        6. any stroke within 1 year after embolization

        7. any stroke, death hemorrhagic event, aneurysmal recanalization or retreatment within 1
           year after embolization

        8. change in aneurysmal occlusion

        9. any comlicaion within 1 year after embolization

       10. %length of Hydrocoil, maximum diameter of aneurysm, volume embolization ratio.
