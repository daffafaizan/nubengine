      increased dental sensitivity in adolescent patients submitted to tooth whitening with 6% and
      7.5% hydrogen peroxide using home kits with whitening strips. Adolescents aged 12 to 20 years
      will be allocated to different groups based on treatment (n = 16 per group): 1) placebo; 2)
      6.0% hydrogen peroxide (White Class with calcium - FGM); 3) 7.5% hydrogen peroxide (White
      Class with calcium - FGM); and 4) 7.5% hydrogen peroxide (Oral B 3D White - Oral-B). After
      the whitening procedures, the participants will be evaluated using a visual analogue scale
      for tooth sensitivity and digital spectrophotometry for the measurement of changes in color.
