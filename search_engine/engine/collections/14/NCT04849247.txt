    
      This is a Phase I, first-in-human study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the
      68Ga-DOTA-FAPI and 177Lu-DOTA-FAPI theranostic pair in patients with various types of cancer.
      PET imaging using 68Ga-DOTA-FAPI will be used to diagnose patients who are eligible for the
      177Lu-DOTA-FAPI. The overall purpose of this study is to identify the dose limiting toxicity
      (DLT) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of 177Lu-DOTA-FAPI. A 3+3 study design in is
      proposed to identify the RP2D of 177Lu-DOTA-FAPI. An expansion group will receive the RP2D in
      order to obtain initial estimates of response and additional information on safety of
      177Lu-DOTA-FAPI.

      The hypotheses of this phase I study are that a) 68Ga-DOTA-FAPI will detect lesions in
      patients with various types of locally advanced or metastatic cancer. b) the theranostic pair
      68Ga-DOTA-FAPI and 177Lu-DOTA-FAPI will be safe and well tolerated c) we will be able to
      identify a Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) for 177Lu-DOTA-FAPI therapy to be used in
      subsequent Phase II trials.
