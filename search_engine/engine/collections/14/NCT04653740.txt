    
      Patients enrolled in the study will receive the following interventions:

        -  Biospecimen sample collection: before and during treatment, and at progression

        -  Tumor biopsy before treatment and at progression

      The aim of this study is to describe molecular changes associated with resistance to
      Palbociclib at the individual level and describe longitudinal changes in the profile of
      tumor, VOCs and exosomes according to treatment response.

      Other objectives of the study include:

        -  Proportion of single or shared molecular alterations / signatures between patients at
           progression time

        -  Associations between tumor signatures, VOCs and exosomes

        -  Compare molecular changes identified by proteomics with those observed by genomics /
           transcriptomics

        -  Compare the evolution of VOCs and exosomes over time with evolution of liquid biopsy
           markers.
