    
      Dental erosions in 30 male and female patients with proven abnormal gastrooesophageal reflux
      will be assessed clinically and using a novel optical coherence tomography (OCT) laser
      technique before and after double-blind randomization to antisecretory treatment with
      esomeprazole 20mg or placebo bid for 3 weeks.

      The primary objective is to quantify tooth substance loss as well as changes in optical
      reflectance and scattering of dental hard tissues with and without acid inhibition.

      Secondary objectives are:

      To compare standardised visual scoring with OCT quantification of reflux damage at the
      different time points on different teeth.

      To assess sex differences in OCT- quantified dental tissue loss
