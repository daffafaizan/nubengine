      exacerbations of cystic fibrosis. Treatment of the metabolic alkalosis with volume and sodium
      chloride (NaCl) replacement could reduce hypoventilation and hypercapnia, thereby improving
      symptoms, sleep patterns and daytime activity level. This would avoid unnecessary treatment
      with non-invasive ventilation.

      Hypothesis: Volume and NaCl replacement corrects hypochloremic hypovolemic metabolic
      alkalosis and compensatory hypoventilation/ hypercapnia in acute exacerbations of cystic
      fibrosis and results in symptomatic improvement.

      Entry criteria:

        -  Adult cystic fibrosis patient

        -  Admission with acute exacerbation

        -  PaCO2 > 45 mmHg

        -  Primary metabolic alkalosis (acid-base diagram of Stinebaugh and Austin)

        -  Serum chloride (Cl) â‰¤ 98 mmol/L

        -  Serum albumin (alb) > 25 mmol/L

      Intervention:

        -  Normal saline intravenously day(D)1,2,3. (Replace greater of Cl deficiency or acute
           weight loss, with 2/3 on D1 and remainder D2, D3)

        -  NaCl tablets 3 tds D4 to 10 (calculated to replace 7 mmol NaCl loss in 60 kg subject)

      Random allocation to either:

        1. Intervention + standard care (including standard dietary advice) D1-10

        2. Standard care alone (including standard dietary advice) D1-10

      Primary outcome measures: (D1, D4, D10)

        -  PaCO2 (performed at same time of day as admission ABG's)

        -  Acid-base status (Stinebaugh and Austin, ABG's)

        -  Serum chloride

        -  Overnight oximetry (% night SpO2<90%) and PtcCO2 (rise in CO2 overnight)

      Secondary outcome measures: (D1, D4, D10)

        -  Serum albumin, sodium

        -  Body mass index (BMI)

        -  Spirometry (D1, D10)

        -  Headache scale

        -  Epworth sleepiness scale

        -  Wrist actigraphy (circadian rhythm and daytime activity level)(D1-10)

        -  Urinary chloride, potassium, sodium, pH, osmolality

        -  Baseline ABG's as stable outpatient (within 3 months, pre or post admission)
