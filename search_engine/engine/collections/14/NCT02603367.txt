      I. To assess the feasibility of the COMFORT Caregiver Intervention (CCI) for family
      caregivers.

      II. To explore common family caregiver communication concerns in oncology and their impact.

      III. Estimate the effects of the CCI on family caregivers' psychological distress (primary
      outcome) and caregiver confidence with communication (secondary outcome).

      OUTLINE:

      Participants receive the printed communication tool "A Communication Guide for Caregivers," a
      guide developed from the COMFORT communication curriculum, a national training program for
      palliative care communication. After a 1 week period to review the material, participants
      undergo communication coaching with a research nurse by phone over approximately 1 hour.

      After completion of the study, caregivers are followed up at 1 month to complete
      questionnaires and rate their satisfaction with the intervention.
