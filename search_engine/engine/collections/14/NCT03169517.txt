      peripheral nerve block will receive LSCI measurements and pinprick sensory tests before the
      block and at 5-min intervals till 30 min after the block. The sensitivity, specificity of
      LSCI as a diagnostic method will be determined by receiver operator characteristic analysis.

      Clinical Implications: LSCI with quantitative data could be used as an indicator of
      successful blocks.
