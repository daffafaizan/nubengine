        1. In patients with type 2 diabetes stratified by the existence of the risk alleles
           (R230C/C230C) or the wild variant (R230R) of ABC-A1, compare the changes resulting from
           the treatment with glibenclamide on following continuous variables:

             -  Fasting glucose

             -  Percentage reduction

             -  Hemoglobin A1c,

             -  Cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol

             -  Weight

        2. In patients with type 2 diabetes stratified by the existence of the risk alleles
           (R230C/C230C) or the wild variant (R230R) of ABC-A1, compare the changes resulting from
           the treatment with glibenclamide on following binomial variables:

             -  Number of cases that reach fasting plasma glucose lower than 110 mg/dl

             -  Number of cases that reach an HbA1c less than 7%
