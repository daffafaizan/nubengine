      efficacy of treating CLL subjects with hydroxychloroquine. The study schema and schedule of
      events are as follows:

      Prior to beginning hydroxychloroquine:

        -  Blood samples to be taken.

        -  Baseline tests confirming diagnosis of CLL as defined above (if not already obtained in
           records)

        -  Physical exam performed

        -  Either six months prior or 4 weeks within starting HCQ ophthalmologic exam documented

        -  Days 1-365 subject takes hydroxychloroquine 400mg/day

        -  At 2 weeks: CBC and chemistry

        -  Every 4 weeks: CBC, chemistry, history (including the inquiry about the presence or
           absence of visual symptoms) and physical exam.

        -  Starting at 4 weeks: blood samples taken for laboratory companion studies taken at
           office visit every 8 weeks.

        -  At 6 months (+ or - 30 days): subject will have follow up ophthalmologic exam). This
           will also be done in the presence of any visual/ocular symptoms.

      All subjects must meet the selection criteria for registration in this study. All subjects
      must have a peripheral blood sample submitted. It is estimated that approximately 70 subjects
      will be screened. The anticipated accrual period is 12 months.
