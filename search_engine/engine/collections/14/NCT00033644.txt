        -  Determine the antitumor activity of dacarbazine, mitomycin, doxorubicin, and cisplatin
           plus sargramostim (GM-CSF) in patients with advanced, persistent, or recurrent
           leiomyosarcoma of the uterus.

        -  Determine the nature and degree of toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive dacarbazine IV over 2 hours, followed by mitomycin IV over 2-5
      minutes, doxorubicin IV over 2-5 minutes, and cisplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1. Patients
      also receive sargramostim (GM-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) once every 12 hours on days -6 to -3
      before the first chemotherapy course and then on days 2-15 and 23-26 of all chemotherapy
      courses. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients achieving stable disease receive a maximum of 4 courses. Patients
      achieving complete or partial response receive a maximum of 6 courses.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-43 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-28
      months.
