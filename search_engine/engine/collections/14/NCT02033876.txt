      Hypothesis: The bile acid, ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) in delayed (ileocolonic)-release
      formulation, stimulates bile acid membrane receptor (TGR-5) and farnesol X (FXR) receptors in
      the ileum and colon, increasing the secretion of Fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF-19), GLP-1,
      oxyntomodulin (OXM), and Peptide (PYY3-36), improving insulin sensitivity and inducing weight
      loss.

      Aim: To study the effect of an ileocolonic formulation of UDCA on insulin sensitivity,
      postprandial plasma glycemia and incretin levels, gastric emptying and body weight in
      overweight or obese type 2 diabetic subjects on monotherapy with metformin.

      Study design: This is a single center, placebo-controlled, parallel group, single dose
      randomized controlled trial to study the effect of delayed (ileocolonic)-release UDCA 600 mg
      twice daily on insulin sensitivity, gastric emptying of liquids and solids (measured by
      scintigraphy)and weight loss in overweight or obese type 2 diabetic subjects. Participants
      will be receiving monotherapy with metformin. Blood samples will be collected at defined
      times to measure glycemia and the incretin (GLP-1, OXM, PYY3-36) fasting levels and responses
      to the meal.

      Anticipated Results: In comparison with placebo, UDCA will increase insulin sensitivity,
      enhance glycemic control, increase postprandial incretins, and delay gastric emptying (GE) of
      liquids.

      Significance: This study will prove that ileocolonic-release UDCA enhances glycemic control
      in T2DM patients.
