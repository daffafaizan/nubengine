      200 babies is born with congenital penile anomalies. In Korea, there is a rapid increase rate
      among other types of congenital anomalies from 1993 to 2010, from 0.7 to 10,000 to 9.9 per
      10,000 cases. It leaves long term sequelae into adulthood even after the corrective operation
      has been performed. Some of the sequelae that patients experienced were difficulties in
      micturition, dissatisfaction with the appearance of the penis, and decreased sexual function,
      as well as psychosexual well-being.

      Despite its high prevalence, hypospadias and related penile anomalies have no specific known
      etiology and mechanisms. However, numerous studies have shown that both gene and environment
      play a significant role in making etiologies multifactorial. Furthermore, a molecular trial
      shows that both genetics and environmental factors disrupt the normal development course of
      the phallus, or penis. Penis formation, growth, or the formation of the male urogenital
      system, in general, have shown to be androgen dependent. Any defect in the androgen synthesis
      leading to androgen deficiency or receptors may play a role, specifically, in the development
      of penile anomalies.

      Pediatric patients between the ages of 0 to 18 years, with congenital penile anomalies and
      scheduled to undergo penoplasty will be enrolled. In this prospective observational study,
      our aims are to collect dartos fascia, which is a tissue in penile region, and examine
      histochemistry of the sample.
