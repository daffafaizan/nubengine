      ropivacaine (0.1% vs. 0.4%) at an equal total dose has no impact on quadriceps muscle
      strength during a continuous femoral nerve block following total knee arthroplasty (TKA).
      These results will help define the optimal concentration of local anesthetic used for
      continuous peripheral nerve blocks.
