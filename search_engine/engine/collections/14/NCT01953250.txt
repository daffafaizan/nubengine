      the COREFO questionnaire (ColoRectal Functional Outcome).

      Depending on the amount of responses, we will try to make connections between peri-operative
      data and functional outcome after considerable period of follow-up. Peri-operative factors
      include grade of endometriosis, surgical technique and post-operative complications.
