      I. To determine the toxicity and efficacy of the high-dose chemotherapy regimen which employs
      busulfan, cyclophosphamide, and allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.

      II. To ascertain feasibility (safety) and efficacy of the use of intensive chemotherapy
      regimen (busulfan and cyclophosphamide) followed by allogeneic bone marrow transplantation in
      patients with leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes, multiple myeloma, and lymphoma.

      OUTLINE:

      HIGH-DOSE CHEMOTHERAPY: Patients receive oral busulfan every 6 hours on days -8 to -5 and
      cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours on days -4 and -3, or -4 to -2 .

      TRANSPLANTATION: Patients undergo allogeneic bone marrow transplant IV over 2-3 hours on day
      0.

      GRAFT-VERSUS-HOST DISEASE PROPHYLAXIS: Patients receive cyclosporine IV over 6 hours on day
      -1, over 10 hours twice daily on days 0-20, and then orally every 12 hours beginning on day
      21 and continuing for 12 months with taper at 9 months. Patients also receive
      methylprednisolone IV or orally beginning on day 8 and continuing for 7 months with taper at
      4 months. Some patients may also receive methotrexate IV on days 1, 3 and 6 .

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
