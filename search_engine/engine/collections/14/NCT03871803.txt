      randomization, clinical and cardiac rhythm will be continuously registered during 30 days.
      The primary endpoint (peakVO2) will be assessed by cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) at
      15 and 30-day in both groups. Patients with HFpEF, functional class NYHA II-III, chronic
      treatment with betablockers, and chronotropic incompetence will be enrolled. A sample size
      estimation [alfa: 0.05, power: 90%, a 15% loss rate, and delta change of mean peakVO2: +1.2
      mL/kg/min (SDÂ±2.5)] of 52 patients would be necessary to test our hypothesis.

      In conclusion, optimizing therapy that improve quality of life and autonomy has become a
      health care priority in HFpEF. The investigators believe this study will add important
      knowledge for the treatment of a subgroup of HFpEF.
