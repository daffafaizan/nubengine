      NTD-affected pregnancy, were planning to become pregnant again, and were prepared to be
      randomised to one of the two study arms. Both study and control groups received 5 mg folic
      acid (the standard UK supplement for pregnancies at high risk of NTD); the study group
      additionally received 1 g inositol, whereas the control group was prescribed a placebo
      instead of inositol.
