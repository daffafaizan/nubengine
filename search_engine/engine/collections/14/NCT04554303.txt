           - In this clinical study, Part 1 is conducted as a preliminary study on 10 subjects at a
           single center, and based on the results of Part 1, the sponsor and the principal
           investigator determine whether to proceed with Part 2. With Part 2 as the multicenter
           main study conducted on the remaining 70 subjects, 80 subjects in total have been
           planned for Part 1 and Part 2.

        2. Interim analysis

           - The interim analysis is conducted when the study on 10 subjects at a Part 1 single
           center has been completed; the analysis is made on all endpoints planned for this
           clinical study.

        3. Clinical study methods - During screening, subjects who have voluntarily signed the
           Informed Consent Form are tested for eligibility to this clinical study.

      After a wash-out period of at least two weeks, subjects who satisfy the inclusion/exclusion
      criteria are randomly assigned to two groups (S-amlodipine group, Amlodipine group).
      Thereafter, the subjects are enrolled and orally administered with the investigational
      product once a day for 12 weeks, during which they receive a total of five visits for tests
      conducted for assessment of efficacy and safety.

      (In case of confirmed eligibility without administration of contraindications, the wash-out
      period may be omitted and Visits 1 and 2 may be paid on the same day)
