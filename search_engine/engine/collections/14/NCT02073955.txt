      identification of stroke symptoms by community health workers ( CHW) in a peri-urban
      Pakistani community

      Specific Aims:

        1. To translate and adapt a stroke symptom questionnaire for identification of stroke
           symptoms by community workers in a peri-urban Pakistani community

        2. To validate community workers administered stroke symptom questionnaire against
           assessment by neurologist in a peri-urban Pakistani community

        3. To determine the feasibility of utilizing community workers for identification of stroke
           patients in the community in terms of subject refusals and difficulty in understanding
           questions

      The study will be conducted at the community site of AMAN community health project in Ibrahim
      Hyderi. Community health workers will systematically select households and from them
      individuals meeting eligibility criteria will be interviewed. Community workers will
      administer stroke symptom questionnaire to them at their homes. Those unable to answer will
      have a surrogate answering for them. In the second part of the study, two neurologists will
      independently assess all individuals. The purpose of this would be to validate the findings
      of the community workers based on the stroke symptom questionnaire.
