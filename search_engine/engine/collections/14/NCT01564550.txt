      has shown that these patients have an increased VLDL production and this could be a key
      factor in dyslipidemia development. Especially the production of VLDL1 seems to be increased
      where an inhibitory response to insulin is lacking. Further investigation in VLDL1 and VLDL2
      kinetics is required.

      The investigators wish:

        1. To extend the method of ex vivo labeling of VLDL-triglyceride, to include separate
           labeling of VLDL1- and VLDL2-triglyceride for evaluation of the separate lipoprotein
           subtype kinetics.

        2. To investigate VLDL1- and VLDL2-triglyceride kinetics in the post absorptive state and
           under experimental hyperinsulinemia in twelve type 2 diabetic males compared to twelve
           healthy age, sex, and BMI matched males.

        3. To investigate the effect of a three day isocaloric diet compared to a non-restricted
           diet on the day-to-day variation in VLDL1 and VLDL2-triglyceride kinetics in healthy
           men. The investigators here examine six subjects on two different days who ingest a
           non-restricted diet and compare this group to six subjects examined on two different
           days, who have prior ingest a three day isocaloric diet.
