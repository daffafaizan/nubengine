      The instruments attracts vitreous in its port through active suction and cuts with a blade at
      different cut rates. There is no consensus as to which cut rate would be ideal in order to
      minimize traction, neither there is agreement on whether increasing cut rates generate
      shorter collagen fragments or the fluid turbulence creates unpredictable flows at the port
      generating fragments of different length.

      The investigators plan to gather vitreous cut at 1,000, 2,000, 4,000, 8,000 and 16,000 cuts
      per minute and measure vitreous collagen average length
