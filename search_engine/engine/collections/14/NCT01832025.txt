      The proposed study design is a single site, double armed, randomized clinical trial. Subjects
      will be those whose diagnosis requires restoring the lateral maxillary edentulous area by
      performing sinus augmentation together with implant placement.

      Sample Size and Statistical Analysis Sample size A number of 46 subjects, 23 per each group,
      who meet study inclusion and exclusion criteria, will be treated for this study to allow for
      a dropout rate of up to 15%. Up to 60 subjects will be consented to reach the research goal
      of 46.

      The sample size was determined using nQuery program (version 7.0) - for a power of 80% with
      20 subjects/group, assuming the anticipated values for the Schneiderian membrane rate
      perforation as 55% (8) for the external procedure and 10% for the internal procedure (9),
      based on previously reported studies for each procedure.

      Randomization Randomization will be performed in a 1:1 ratio using a balanced design based on
      a computer-generated randomization scheme. A printout of this scheme will be used by the
      co-investigator which will have the randomization for each subject that qualifies in the
      order of qualification. Randomization will occur the day of surgery.

      Blinding Due to the nature of the procedures, this study will not be blinded.

      Subject Characteristics Subjects will include patients whose diagnosis requires restoring the
      lateral maxillary edentulous area by performing sinus augmentation together with implant
      placement.
