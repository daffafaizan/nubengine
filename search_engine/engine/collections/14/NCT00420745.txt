    
      This is a Phase 3b study.

      Each study group is further stratified into two sub-groups depending on the gestational age
      at birth of the subject:

        -  Stratum I: very pre-term infants, born after a gestational period of 27-30 weeks
           (189-216 days) (20% of enrolment).

        -  Stratum II: mild pre-term infants born after a gestational period of 31-36 weeks
           (217-258 days) (80% of enrolment).

      The study will be conducted in a double-blind manner with respect to the HRV vaccine and
      placebo. The study will not be blinded with respect to the type of concomitantly administered
      routine infant vaccination.

      In accordance with the local National Plan of Immunisation schedule in each of the respective
      participating countries, GSK Biologicals' Infanrix Hexa™ (DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib), Infanrix Quinta™
      (DTPa-IPV-Hib), Infanrix™+IPV+Hib (DTPa+IPV+Hib) and/or Engerix-B™ (HBV) will be
      co-administered (at a maximum interval of two days from each other) with each HRV vaccine or
      placebo dose.

      Hepatitis B and Bacille Calmette-Guérin vaccines (BCG) at birth are allowed if included in
      the local National Plan of Immunisation schedule in participating countries.

      At the discretion of the investigator the following vaccines may be administered during each
      subject's study participation:

        -  Vaccine against Streptococcus pneumoniae (Prevenar®) in France and Spain (concomitantly
           with HRV vaccine/Placebo).

        -  Vaccine against Neisseria meningitidis (Neis Vacc C®) is allowed if there is at least
           14-days interval with respect to the administration of the HRV vaccine/Placebo.
