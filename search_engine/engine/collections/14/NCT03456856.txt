    
      The goal of this study is to determine the impact of adding ivabradine therapy to the
      standard of care (SOC) in African-American/Black subjects with Heart Failure (HF) and reduced
      ejection fraction (HFrEF) on changes in heart rate (HR) from baseline (SOC alone). Changes in
      HR from baseline will be correlated with the changes from baseline in activity level of the
      subjects, as measured by both a standard 6-minute walk distance and an accelerometer device.

      The primary hypothesis is that ivabradine effectively reduces HR between baseline and day 57
      in African-American/Black subjects. Because mean reductions of approximately 5 beat per
      minute (bpm) have been observed in the overall placebo-treated subjects in the SHIFT study as
      well as in the placebo-treated subjects of the subgroup analysis of
      non-African-American/Black subjects enrolled in the SHIFT study, we will test whether the
      mean reduction with ivabradine exceeds 5 bpm, and estimate the degree to which the mean
      reduction with ivabradine exceeds 5 bpm.
