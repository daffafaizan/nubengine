      total energy expenditure (for ref see Gillen and Gibala 2014). IL-6 has been shown to
      increase adipose tissue lipolysis in vitro. Therefore, in an initial study on effects of
      sprint exercise on adipose tissue metabolism the investigators examined acute short-term
      effects on adipose tissue IL-6 exchange.

      METHODS: Four female and four male subjects perform repeated sprint exercise (3 x 30s with 20
      min rest between; Wingate-test). Blood samples are repeatedly obtained, up to 120 min after
      the last sprint (9 min post ex), from catheters inserted percutaneously into brachial artery
      and a superficial subcutaneous vein on the anterior abdominal wall providing access to the
      venous drainage from the subcutaneous adipose tissue and analyzed for IL-6 by ELISA and
      lactate by spectrophotometry. Fat biopsies from the stomach will be obtained before, 15 min
      and 120 min after the last sprint. Blood flow will be determined by administration of
      Xenon-133 in the adipose tissue of the stomach. The release rate of Xenon-133 will be
      registrated continuously during the total investigation.

      SUPPORT: This study is supported by grants from the Swedish National Center for Research in
      Sports
