      II-IV Pressure Ulcers through a prospective randomized controlled study design.

      Subjects may be enrolled for up to 24 weeks; if healing occurs prior to week 24, a follow up
      healing confirmation visit shall occur two weeks later to confirm maintenance of complete
      wound closure and participation may continue up to 24 weeks. Subjects that are randomized to
      the SOC group have the opportunity to cross over and receive PuraPly AM at week 12 if their
      index ulcer has not healed; they will then be followed for an additional 12 weeks for up to
      24 weeks.
