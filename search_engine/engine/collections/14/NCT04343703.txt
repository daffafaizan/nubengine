    
      Suicide is the leading cause of avoidable death worldwide, demanding urgent attention.
      Collecting national-representative data is the first step towards developing effective
      evidence-based public-policies.

      The SURVIVE study presents four inter-connected objectives:

        1. To determine the incidence of suicide attempts in Spain

        2. To follow up suicide attempters with the aim of studying the probability of them
           re-attempting

        3. To identify influential risk factors to explain suicide attempts and an increased risk
           of re-attempting

        4. To determine the efficacy of secondary prevention programs to prevent suicide
           re-attempts in comparison to treatment as usual (TAU).

      Study design: Multi-site-coordinated cohort study with nested randomized controlled trials.
      Participants will be recruited at mental-health sites distributed across Spain.

      Participants: A cohort of 2.000 individuals presenting a suicide attempt will be established.

      Individuals would be followed for 1-year, and assessed every 3 months.

      Participants (age >18) that meet inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomly allocated to:

      1) telephone-based management, or 2) iFightDepression for Suicide (iFD-Survive), a
      web-based-self-management tool. These interventions will be tested against TAU.

      Participants (age between 12-17) that meet inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomly
      allocated to: 1)a face-to-face individual intervention designed for youths Specific Aware of
      Mental Health Intervention for adolescents (SAM) or 2) TAU.
