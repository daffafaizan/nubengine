      time, and in particular whether their experience of time differs from that of healthy
      persons. Another aim was to investigate the relationship between the mood of the subjects and
      their time perception as well as determine a variable moderating that relationship.

      First, it was expected that eating-disordered patients experience time as a rather aversive
      and unfriendly force marked with chaos and void, in contrast to healthy subjects, who were
      predicted to treat it as something more friendly, appreciating its subtleties and the
      significance of the moment (Hypothesis 1).

      Moreover, it was expected that individuals with eating disorders would exhibit a more
      negative temporal orientation, whether past or present, as compared to healthy controls, who
      would reveal more positive past, present, or future orientations (Hypothesis 2).

      Finally, it was predicted that eating disorders moderate the relationship between mood and
      time perception (Hypothesis 3).

      The study encompassed 30 women with eating disorders (19 patients with anorexia nervosa and
      11 patients with bulimia nervosa) and 30 age-matched normal healthy controls. The clinical
      group consisted of patients of the residential eating disorder therapeutic center "Drzewo
      zycia" in Malawa as well as some outpatient clinics in Poland; some of the patients were not
      being actively treated at the time of the study. The controls included psychology students
      from two Polish universities (the Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski University and the University of
      Finance and Management, both in Warsaw), as well as researchers and educators who volunteered
      for the study.

      The three measures applied in the study were:

        -  The Time Metaphors Questionnaire by Sobol-Kwapinska;

        -  Time Perspective Inventory by Zimbardo (Zimbardo & Boyd, 1999; see also Zimbardo & Boyd,
           2009);

        -  The UWIST Mood Adjective Checklist (UMACL) (Matthews at al.; see also Gorynska, 2005).
