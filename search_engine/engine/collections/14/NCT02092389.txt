      in the usual manner in accordance with the terms of the local marketing authorization with
      regards to dose, population and indication. The assignment of the patient to a adalimumab
      containing regimen has to be decided in advance and has to be current practice. The
      prescription of adalimumab is clearly separated from the decision to include the participant
      in this study.
