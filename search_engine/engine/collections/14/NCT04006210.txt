    
      This is a phase III multi-center, randomized, active-controlled, double-blind, double-dummy,
      parallel group clinical trial, investigating the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of
      continuous subcutaneous ND0612 infusion in comparison to oral IR-LD/CD in subjects with
      Parkinson's disease experiencing motor fluctuations.

      This study is comprised of 6 periods:

        1. a Screening Period;

        2. an open-label oral IR-LD/CD Adjustment Period.

        3. an open-label ND0612 Conversion Period.

        4. a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled Maintenance Period.

        5. an optional open-label Treatment Extension; and

        6. a Safety Follow-up Period.
