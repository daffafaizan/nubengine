    
      This study is a prospective single arm, open label registry to evaluate the feasibility of
      blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) magnetic resonance imaging for the assessment of a
      potentially new functional surrogate of altered lower limb skeletal muscle oxygenation after
      a successful percutaneous endovascular intervention. Baseline MRI assessment using the BOLD
      technique will be performed on qualified subjects prior to undergoing a standard of care
      endovascular therapy. Post-procedure BOLD-MRI assessment will also be performed at 30 days
      and either 90 or 180 days post-procedure. Post-MR image acquisition processing and analysis
      will be performed, using pre-determined algorithms, by a core laboratory.
