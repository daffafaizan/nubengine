      the desired refractive outcome. In most cases, the desired outcome is an emmetropic eye, or
      an eye that sees 20/20 Snellen for distance vision post-surgery with the implant of a
      monofocal IOL. This, however, does not offer much in the way of intermediate and near vision.
      The increased desire for simultaneous distance, intermediate and near vision has increased
      the popularity of multifocal IOLs (MIOLs). However MIOLs provide visual acuity for all
      distances, they has occurence of optical phenomena such as glare and halo and lower contrast
      sensitivity. Extended depth of focus (EDOF) lens should provide distance vision as good as
      monofocal lens and intermediate vision better than monofocal but without any optical
      phenomenon or decreased contrast sensitivity.

      This study is conducted from 11/2019 to 08/2021 in the Ophthalmology department of Faculty
      Hospital Kralovske Vinohrady in Prague. The research protocol was explained to all
      participants and informed consent was signed before enrolling patient to the study. The study
      was approved by the Ethics Committee of Faculty Hospital Kralovske Vinohrady and will
      enrolled up to 25 patients with presence of cataract in both eyes.

      Bilateral clear corneal phacoemulsification and IOL implantation is performed by one surgeon
      using the same technique in both eyes. The surgical process involved topical anesthesia,
      superior 3-step clear corneal incision (2,2mm), 5,0mm curvilinear capsulorhexis,
      phacoemulsification, bilateral irrigation- aspiration and IOL implantation. One eye is
      implanted with EDOF IOL second eye with monofocal IOL. Type of IOL is chosen randomly and
      double masked.

      Patients are scheduled for visit at 3,6 and 12 months after the surgery.
