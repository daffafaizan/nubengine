      I. Determine the progression-free survival at 12 weeks in patients with stage IIIB or IV or
      recurrent non-small cell lung cancer treated with dasatinib.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the rate of response in patients treated with this drug. II. Examine the
      relationship between clinical response to this drug and epidermal growth factor receptor
      (EGFR) mutational status, EGFR copy number, and (phosphorylated Src) pSrc expression levels
      in pre-treatment tumor biopsies.

      III. Determine the toxicity of this drug.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients received oral dasatinib twice daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 21 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Previously obtained paraffin-embedded tumor tissue samples are analyzed by polymerase chain
      reaction and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) for epidermal growth factor receptor
      and by immunohistochemistry for pSrc expression.
