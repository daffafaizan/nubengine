    
      The primary endpoint is Overall survival time (OS).Secondary endpoints are overall response
      rate (ORR), time to treatment failure (TTF),progression free survival (PFS)and the adverse
      reactions(AE) of the two groups .

      Study design:

      This is a prospective randomized control study.

      Sample size:

      Sample size considerations were based on the survival end point. The improvement in median
      survival from 10 months in the S-1+cisplatin arm to 13 months in the S-1+oxaliplatin arm was
      considered clinically relevant in this patient population. A total of 576 patients were
      required for a two-tailed log-rank test at the 5% significance and at least 80% power. The
      planned enrolled time was 48 months and 1 year of follow up, and a drop-out rate of 5%.
