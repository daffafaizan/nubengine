      evidence-based program "Against Colorectal Cancer in Our Neighborhoods" (ACCION) for the
      Latino population in Texas as a guide, the proposed study will conduct a randomized
      controlled trial of Indigenous Samoan participants (N=312), ageâ‰¥ 50 recruited using
      Respondent-Driven Sampling (RDS). This design will compare use of non-tailored instruction
      for completing ColoCare FOBT home-kits (N=156) versus the experimental condition, using a
      ColoCare FOBT home-kit with instructions tailored to low health literacy and to enhance
      CRC-Knowledge Attitudes and Behavior (KAB) - (N=156). Our goal is to test the influence of
      tailored materials on timely completion of CRC screening using the ColoCARE FOBT.
