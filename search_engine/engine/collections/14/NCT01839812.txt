      to a single institution for congenital cardiac surgery.

      Blood was collected from study participants at 7 time points; 1) post-anesthesia induction,
      2) post-CPB/pre-MUF, 3) Intensive care unit (ICU) arrival, 4) post-op hour 4, 5) post-op hour
      8, 6) post-op hour 12, and 7) post-op hour 24. At each of the 7 time points blood was
      analyzed for levels of the following; dexamethasone, cortisol, ACTH, Interleukin (IL) 10, IL
      8, and IL 6. In addition, the innate stress response was evaluated with a cosyntropin
      stimulation test. Each patient received a 1 mcg/1.73 m2 intravenous dose of cosyntropin at;
      anesthesia induction, prior to dexamethasone (time 1), ICU arrival (time 3), and 24 hours
      after ICU arrival (time 7). Cortisol levels were measured before (time 1, 3, and 7) and 30
      minutes after cosyntropin administration (time 1a, 3a, and 7a).
