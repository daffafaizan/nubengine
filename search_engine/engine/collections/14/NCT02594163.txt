      without brentuximab vedotin. Patients who respond to combination treatment containing
      brentuximab vedotin and do not experience excessive toxicity may receive additional
      single-agent brentuximab vedotin following combination treatment, for up to an additional 10
      cycles (up to 16 total cycles of treatment).
