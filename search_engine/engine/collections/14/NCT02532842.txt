    
      This is a retrospective, non-interventional, multicenter study to retrospectively evaluate
      hospitalization and medical resource use, patterns of paliperidone palmitate use, and
      clinical outcomes documented within the medical records of young, adult, newly diagnosed
      schizophrenia participants for the first 12 months of continuous treatment with paliperidone
      palmitate. Only retrospective data available from clinical routine practice and documented in
      a participant's medical record will be collected. The study will be conducted in countries
      within the EMEA region in which paliperidone palmitate is approved and available. The study
      will be considered complete with the last data collection for the last participant
      participating in the study.
