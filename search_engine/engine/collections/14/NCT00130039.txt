    
      [Goal] To Reveal the Effect and Safety of Cilostazol Compared with Clopidogrel on the
      Prevention of the Progression of Symptomatic Intracranial Arterial Stenosis.

      [Trial Design] Double-Blind, Active-Controlled, Randomized, Multicenter Trial

      [Participants] Acute ischemic stroke patients with symptomatic intracranial arterial stenosis

      [Methods]

        -  Double-Blind, Active-Controlled, Randomized, Multicenter Trial

        -  Investigational product (Double Dummy Method):

      Cilostazol 200mg (100mg twice per day) versus clopidogrel 75mg

        -  Concomitant medication: Aspirin 100 (75-150) mg per day

        -  Medication Duration: 7 months

      [Outcome Variables]

      Primary Outcome Variable:

        -  Progression rate of symptomatic intracranial arterial stenosis

      Secondary outcome variables:

        -  The occurrence of new MRI (magnetic resonance image) lesion on follow-up MRI

        -  Stroke events

        -  Overall cardiovascular events: stroke, acute coronary syndrome, vascular death

        -  Ipsilateral ischemic stroke rate

        -  Fatal or major bleeding complications
