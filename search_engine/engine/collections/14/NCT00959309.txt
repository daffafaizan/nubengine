      children in the physician office setting. This setting is appealing for interventions
      directed to preschool children because of accessibility. In addition, other public health
      interventions implemented in a physician office setting, such as home safety advice, have
      been effective.

      The proposed study design will be a randomized controlled trial. The intervention group will
      receive the study intervention, which is a 15 minute session about the health impact of
      screen time in children and strategies to decrease screen time.

      The objective of this study is to determine if an office based intervention is effective in
      decreasing screen time (television, video viewing and playing video games) in preschool
      children.
