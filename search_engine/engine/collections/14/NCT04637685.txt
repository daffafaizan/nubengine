      with safe use of high vacuums, whilst allowing low and physiological infusion pressures,
      significantly lower than other surgical systems. There are reasons to expect that this will
      lead to patient benefit but it is uncertain if low infusion pressure during
      phacoemulsification will lead to improved outcomes. This is of particular interest in
      patients with vascular retinopathies such as diabetic retinopathy where the retinal
      vasculature is compromised, as well as glaucoma and other optic neuropathies where there is
      established nerve fibre layer loss.

      The investigator will carry out a feasibility study with a two surgeon RCT of 70 patients
      with diabetic retinopathy and/or glaucoma undergoing phacoemulsification with randomisation
      of two different infusion pressures (low (30mmHg) versus the higher pressure (~70mmHg) as
      currently used) using the active sentry system with assessment of a range of exploratory
      endpoints.
