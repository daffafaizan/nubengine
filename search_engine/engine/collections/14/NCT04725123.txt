      coming from 134 patients a prediction score named SPECIFY was developed. The SPECIFY score
      comprises four elements: low hemoglobin, increased urea, increased IL-8 and carriage of G
      alleles of rs2091172. The score has 80% positive predictive value and 95.8% specificity for
      the early detection of unfavorable outcome but the sensitivity is low. Unfavorable outcome is
      defined as any of: presentation or progression into severe CDI, relapse; and death. Stool
      samples of day 1 before start of therapy of the patients are stored refrigerated. Microbiome
      analysis will be done aiming to the integration of the Shannon diversity index to the already
      developed score in order to improve sensitivity.
