      obesity such as type II diabetes, fatty liver disease, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, asthma,
      sleep apnea, and depression are becoming increasing common in adolescents as more adolescents
      become obese. The only consistently durable and effective weight loss programs for the
      morbidly obese patients are those that include bariatric surgical procedures. The
      investigators believe that the best initial bariatric surgical option for adolescents is LAGB
      because of its low complication rates, adjustability, and reversibility. Obese adolescents
      ages 14-17 who meet criteria for entry will be enrolled to determine the degree of success of
      LAGB as measured by % excess weight loss, decreased % body fat, decreased body mass index
      (BMI), reduction in comorbid conditions, and metabolic parameters (including serum lipids and
      glucose tolerance) at intervals of 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, then annually for a total of 5
      years postoperatively. Eligible patients will have been followed for 6 months by physicians
      in the Center for Adolescent Bariatric Surgery and: 1) will attended a minimum of 75% of
      visits and 2) will have failed to lose at least 20% of excess weight. Following evaluation by
      the team (which will include evaluations by a nutritionist, an endocrinologist, a
      psychologist/psychiatrist, a pediatric nurse practitioner, and a surgeon) a patient may be
      offered LAGB.
