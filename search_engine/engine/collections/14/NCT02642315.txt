      efficacy of Horizant in patients with RLS who exhibit augmentation while on Dopaminergic
      therapy. Adult patients (age 18-85 years) with diagnosis of primary RLS (diagnosed by study
      investigators) with augmentation on dopaminergic therapy will be screened for participation
      in the study. RLS diagnosis will be made by the study investigators using International RLS
      study group criteria. Patients with augmentation on dopaminergic therapy as defined by NIH
      2007 with ASRS of 5 to 15 will be offered to participate in the study. Inclusion and
      exclusion criteria are listed below. The study will be performed after approval of the
      Institutional Review Board of the University of Missouri.

      A total of 50 subjects will be entered into the study over a period of 1 year. Written
      consent will be obtained from all patients. After pre-participation evaluation for
      eligibility, subjects will be selected and enrolled in the study and followed for a total of
      6 follow up visits (Days 0, 30, 90, 120, 180, 360). Subjects Enrollment period will last up
