      circulation system (MECC) have both been proposed as alternatives to avoid the harmful
      effects of conventional cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). However, with the technically more
      demanding nature of off-pump CABG, the potential short-term benefits of off-pump surgery may
      not translate into long-term benefits in providing optimal revascularization. In this
      prospective cohort study, it is our goal to evaluate short term outcomes as demonstrated by
      blood loss, transfusion need, and systemic inflammatory response during CABG surgery using
      MECC or conventional CPB or OPCAB.

      In addition to the technical challenges posed during off-pump CABG surgery, it is also known
      that a significant systemic inflammatory response is mounted in patients who undergo
      conventional CPB. This inflammatory response is a combined effect of 1) the placement of
      required tubes and lines for connection with the heart/lung machine, 2) hemodilution, and 3)
      hypothermia. In this study, we will measure levels of tissue inflammation through the use of
      specialized laboratory tests (C Reactive Protein, C5 complement activation and Interleukin
      6), and we will correlate these inflammation levels to the three different cardiopulmonary
      bypass options. It is our hypothesis that MECC will provide the stable operating environment
      of conventional CPB and the patient benefits of less blood loss, decreased transfusion rate,
      and decreased inflammation levels seen in patients with OPCAB.

      Statistical Analysis: Multivariable regression models will be used to investigate the
      association of the MECC pump, conventional CPB versus off-pump with the outcomes controlling
      for risk factors recognized by the STS associated with post-CABG adverse outcomes) and other
      clinical and non-clinical factors. The association of each outcome of interest with MECC
      versus conventional CPB and MECC versus off-pump will be estimated with 95% confidence
      intervals (CIs). With a cohort of 102 patients (34 in each of three study groups) we will
      have over 80% power to detect a 71% relative reduction (30% absolute difference) in
      transfusion rate among CABG patients using a MECC pump as compared to conventional pump
      patients assuming that 42% of patients undergoing CABG with conventional pump require a
      transfusion
