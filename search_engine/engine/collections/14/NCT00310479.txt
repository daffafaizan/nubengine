      cancer. We propose to test to see whether characteristic patterns of invivo 3T MRSI
      associated metabolites can be identified in correlation with clinically active tumor reserved
      on histopathologic analysis of resected specimens. We also plan to demonstrate that 3T MR
      spectra of prostate cancer will allow for more detailed metabolic assessment with higher
      sensitivity, specificity and accuracy and publish results established from MR spectra using
      1.5T MR units. Functional imaging (eg. molecular imaging such as this) is felt to be the
      clinical wave of the future for cancer imaging, and if successful, will assume a very major
      role in the detection, assessment, treatment planning and delivery of drugs, radiation, heat
      and novel therapeutics in the fight against prostate cancer.
