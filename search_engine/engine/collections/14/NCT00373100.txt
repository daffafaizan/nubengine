      status in developing and developed countries. There is a high prevalence of zinc deficiency
      in Uganda as documented by Bitarakwate et al.Two clinical studies have shown that zinc
      supplementation improves the outcome of severe pneumonia in children by reducing duration of
      hospital stay and complications related to pneumonia. However, there are conflicting results
      from some previous studies about its usefulness in patients with pneumonia.

      The objective of this study is to determine the effect of zinc supplement as adjunct therapy
      in the treatment of severe pneumonia in children less than five years admitted to Mulago
      hospital, Kampala, Uganda.

      This will be a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of zinc adjucnt therapy.
      Three hundred and twenty eight children with severe pneumonia will be randomised to receive
      either zinc (a daily dose of 20 mg for children more than one of age and 10mg for those less
      than one year or placebo once daily for seven days.

      The primary outcome will be Time taken to :normalisation of respiratory rate, temperature and
      oxygen saturation.

      Secondary outcome:Proportion of study children who will die during the follow up
      period,Proportion of children who develop drug adverse effects data will be analysed using
      Kaplan Meir survival curves.
