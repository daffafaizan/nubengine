      families and concerned significant others (CSOs). Research shows that CSOs of drug users have
      increased prevalence of illness, domestic violence, and problems in mood and functioning.
      Because CSOs are troubled by the negative effects of drug use on the drug user and
      themselves, they may be a social community that is particularly invested in learning ways to
      positively influence the drug user.

      We compare the benefits of the original treatment, Community Reinforcement and Family
      Training (CRAFT), with the Treatment Entry Training (TEnT) component of CRAFT to see if the
      TEnt is sufficient to produce the primary and most consistent outcome of CRAFT -- treatment
      entry of the drug user.
