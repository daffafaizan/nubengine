      delusions, hallucinations, and perceptual disturbances. A psychotic episode might occur in
      different psychiatric diagnoses, such as schizophrenia spectrum disorders and affective
      disorders (depression and bipolar).

      The outcome prediction of relapse rate of a psychotic episode within a certain time frame is
      difficult and depends on many factors. More and better predictors are required to improve the
      outcome prediction in order to adjust therapy and follow-up if patients suffer from this
      acute disease.

      Copeptin, a surrogate marker for vasopressin, has been proven helpful in the prediction of
      the outcome in serious somatic diseases such as stroke, myocardial infarction, and pneumonia.
      Additionally, a rise of copeptin due to psychological stress was shown.

      Some studies have shown an increase in vasopressin levels during acute psychosis, no study
      has been performed using copeptin.

      The aim of this study is to investigate the association of the neuroendocrine biomarker
      copeptin and the prediction of the onset of psychotic episode within one year.
