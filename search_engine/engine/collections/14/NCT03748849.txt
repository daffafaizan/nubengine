      suffering from chronic low back pain. This includes both sensitivity in the painful region
      but also in areas distant indicating widespread pain sensitivity. It is less clear whether
      this is normalized following a successful treatment intervention.

      This study is recruiting people with low back pain and healthy, age matched controls. At
      baseline, the following measurements are made:

        -  the sensitivity to pressure (at the low back and at the shoulder)

        -  the pain detection threshold and pain tolerance threshold at the lower legs

        -  the temporal summation of pain

        -  conditioned pain modulation

        -  Fear-avoidance beliefs

        -  Disability (Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire)

        -  The Orebro musculoskeletal pain questionnaire

      During their enrollment, the patients report their weekly pain electronically

      All quantitative sensory testing (QST) and questionnaire data are blind to the principal
      investigator until data collection has been finished

      After the baseline measurements, the patients are offered physiotherapy treatment. The
      treatment protocol (dosage and type of intervention) is designed based on individual needs
      following an assessment by a musculoskeletal physiotherapist. The number of sessions and time
      between treatment sessions depend on how the patients respond to the chosen intervention.
      Patients are discharged from treatment when:

        1. they have made sufficient recovery (their back pain is no longer a problem)

        2. the chosen intervention(s) have failed to affect their condition

        3. no more recovery is expected

      The quantitative sensory testing measurements are performed again after discharge
