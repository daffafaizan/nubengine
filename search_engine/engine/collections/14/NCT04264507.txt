      hours or days. According to KDIGO (kidney disease improving global outcomes) criteria: AKI is
      defined as any of the following: Increase in serum creatinine by 0.3mg/dL or more within 48
      hours or. Increase in serum creatinine to 1.5 times baseline or more within the last 7 days
      or. Urine output less than 0.5 mL/kg/h for 6 hours(1). Kidney Injury (AKI) affects over 13
      million people per year globally and results in 1.7 million deaths. Recent hospital studies
      in the developed world report AKI in 3.2-9.6% of admissions, with overall in-hospital
      mortality around 20%, and up to 50% in ICU patients.

      Early recognition of AKI is essential to ensure prompt and appropriate management, and to
      avoid progression to late stages of the disease (2) AKI requiring renal replacement therapy
      occurs in 5-6% of ICU patients, with an extremely high in hospital mortality rate of 60%.6 It
      is estimated that about 2 million people die of AKI every year. Those who survive AKI have a
      higher risk for later development of CKD(3). Epidemiology of AKI is understudied in
      developing countries so further studies are needed to estimate the burden of AKI among ICU
      patients.

      Few studies about the epidemiology of AKI in Egypt were done; Samar Abd ElHafeez e,tal 2017
      found in a multicenter study of over 500 consecutive patients admitted to ICUs in Alexandria
      Teaching Hospitals in Egypt, that about 40% of patients admitted to ICU had AKI at
      presentation, and a similar proportion of those who were AKI-free on admission developed AKI
      during their ICU stay (4) .

      Up to our knowledge, there are no sufficient data about the epidemiology of AKI in upper
      Egypt
