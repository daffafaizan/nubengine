      patients with solid and hematological malignancies excluding multiple myeloma (MM), and these
      patients received NPI-0051 once weekly for 3 weeks of every 4 weeks. Arm MM (twice-weekly
      doses of NPI-0052) consisted of patients with MM and other hematological malignancies, and
      these patients received NPI-0052 twice weekly for 2 weeks of every 3 weeks. All patients
      received NPI-0052 administered IV over approximately 1 to 120 minutes. Patients with MM (Arm
      MM) also received 20 mg dexamethasone per orally or IV on the day before and the day of
      NPI-0052 dosing.

      Patients were initially enrolled in dose-escalating cohorts to determine the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of NPI-0052. Once the RP2D was
      determined for each arm of the study, the RP2D was evaluated in the dose-expansion stage of
      the study.
