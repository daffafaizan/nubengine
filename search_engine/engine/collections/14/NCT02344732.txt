      would have beneficial effects on the healing of corneal epithelial wound in post-vitrectomy
      diabetic patients. It will be a prospective, randomised interventional clinical study
      conducted on diabetic patients indicated for vitrectomy. Rationale of this study is to see if
      systemic oxygen delivered via face mask will hasten the resolution of corneal epithelial
      defects, which may either be iatrogenic (surgically-induced intra-operatively to enable
      clearer visualisation for the surgeon) or spontaneous (due to corneal epithelial fragility
      which is commoner in diabetics)
