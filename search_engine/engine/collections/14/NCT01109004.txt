      survival (PFS) between the three treatment arms as a pairwise comparison. Mobilization
      therapy will not be specified for the study. Randomization to three treatment arms will be
      done prior to the first transplants. All patients will undergo a first autologous peripheral
      blood stem cell (PBSC) transplant with high-dose melphalan (200 mg/m^2 IV) given on Day -2.
      Upon recovery from the first transplant patients will receive either a second autologous PBSC
      transplant with the same conditioning regimen as the first transplant or consolidation
      therapy with RVD (lenalidomide 15 mg/day on Days 1-14, dexamethasone 40 mg on Days 1, 8 and
      15, and bortezomib 1.3mg/m^2 on Days 1, 4, 8 and 11 of every 21 day cycle, patients will
      receive four cycles) or maintenance with lenalidomide (15 mg daily). All patients will also
      receive maintenance lenalidomide which will start after the second transplant, after the
      first autologous transplant or after consolidation therapy depending on the treatment arm.
      Maintenance therapy with lenalidomide will start at 10 mg daily for three months and increase
      to 15 mg daily. The duration of maintenance will be three years in all treatment arms.
