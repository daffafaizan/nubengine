      treated with our current standard of care. There are an estimated 500,000 burns treated in
      the United States each year. Moreover, in the military environment, soldiers who suffer from
      extensive burn injuries on the battlefield may benefit from rapid treatments that result in
      complete closure and protection of the wounds. As such, there is a need for mobile platform
      technologies that allow fast treatment at the site where the injury occurred, or at the very
      least at the forward operating sites. This safety investigation of a human amnion membrane
      powder product for wound healing is a with-in patient-controlled study, enrolling 10 subjects
      undergoing donor skin graft harvest. The single-center study will include patients undergoing
      donor skin harvest such that two regions, of at least 25 cm2 and separated by at least a 5 cm
      gap, of donor site wounds in comparable skin locations, are available for covering with the
      amnion membrane product and the current institutional standard of care (SOC) covering. The
      proposed sterilized product is composed of lyophilized, gamma-irradiated powder made from
      amniotic membrane for topical application with the purpose of enhanced wound healing.

      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety of a human amnion membrane
      product intended for enhanced wound healing. The secondary objective is efficacy as evidenced
      by complete wound closure relative to standard of care (SOC) treatment in a similar wound on
      the same subject at donor sites created for skin grafts at 14 days and 28 days
      postoperatively.
