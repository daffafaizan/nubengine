      have CE mark, and are used within intended use.

      This study has been designed to be prospective randomized controlled with a single-arm
      cross-over in the continuation phase.

      Four hundred type 2 Multiple Daily Injections (MDI) treated patients will undergo a screening
      (run-in) phase of 8 weeks. The aim of the screening phase is to eliminate the study effect
      that might result in a decrease of HbA1c and to make sure that patients, who are failing
      current MDI therapy, are selected.

      After this screening phase, eligible patients will be randomised to receive either Continuous
      Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion (CSII) treatment or continue MDI treatment. The study phase is
      a 6-months phase with 2-arms parallel design.
