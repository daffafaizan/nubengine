    
      Osteoarthritis (OA), the most common form of arthritis, is a prevalent and debilitating
      disease without therapies that alter disease progress and is currently managed with
      symptom-modifying therapies that are only modestly effective. In spite of substantial
      progress in understanding the pathogenesis of OA, no effective disease modifying
      interventions have been established. Degenerative joint cartilage is a central feature of OA,
      yet joint cartilage has a limited capacity for repair. Results from animal research
      demonstrate that pulsed low intensity ultrasound (PLIUS) mechanically stimulates, and may
      promote, cartilage repair. This exploratory trial will investigate whether PLIUS is
      potentially effective as a disease and symptom modifying intervention in patients with early
      knee OA.
