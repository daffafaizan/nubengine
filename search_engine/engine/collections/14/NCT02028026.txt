      techniques that permit reliable measurement of Glu in humans (9) to examine whether
      Vilazodone and citalopram exert differential effects on Glutamatergic neurotransmission in
      the ACC of anxious unipolar depressed patients. Functional connectivity as measured by Blood
      Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) MRI will be assessed to determine the relationship between the
      change in connectivity and the change in Glu levels with treatment. We also propose to
      examine, in an exploratory fashion, the relative effect of the two drugs on BOLD activation
      in the insula cortex.
