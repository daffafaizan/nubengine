      of LED or Diode laser-activated bleaching applications on colour change, tooth sensitivity,
      gingival irritation and temperature variation with 35% hydrogen peroxide bleaching gel after
      9 months. Material and Methods: Thirty-five patients with anterior teeth without caries and
      no restoration will be included in this study. In a split-mouth design, a bleaching agent
      containing 35% HP (Whiteness HP, FGM) will be used, one side of each jaw will be activated by
      a diode laser (Epic X, Biolase) and the other side will be activated by an LED (Radii Plus,
      SDI) light source. During the bleaching treatments, the temperature variations will be
      recorded using a thermocouple (DT-3891G K type Thermometer datalogger, CEM Instruments) from
      the buccal surface of canine teeth. Tooth sensitivity will be assessed by Visual Analogue
      Scale (VAS) before the treatment and during, immediately, 48 hours, 1 week, 1, 6 and 9 months
      after. Color change will be evaluated by subjective (Vita Classic and Vita 3D Master
      Bleachguide) and objective methods (Vita Easy Shade, spectrophotometer) before the treatment
      and immediately, 48 hours, 1 week, 1, 6 and 9 months after. Color change (ΔE and ΔSGU) will
      be performed by analysis of variance in repeated measurements. Multiple comparisons will be
      evaluated by Bonferroni test. Temperature variation will be evaluated by t-test in dependent
      groups. Tooth sensitivity will be analyzed using Friedman test. Wilcoxon test will be used to
      compare two light sources (Diode Laser/ LED) in each time period (p< 0.05).
