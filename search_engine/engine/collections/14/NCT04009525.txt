      curative option for thalassemia major (TM). Previous study has predicted that more than 90%
      of TM patients can survive after allo-HSCT with a thalassemia-free survival (TFS) in around
      80% of them.The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of allo-HSCT in the
      treatment of thalassemia major.
