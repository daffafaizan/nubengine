      associated with a complex inflammatory response. This response is associated with
      post-traumatic complications such as; multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), bacterial
      pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), systemic inflammatory response
      syndrome (SIRS), and post traumatic pain (PTP). It is unknown whether early modulation of
      inflammatory cytokines is associated with improved patient outcomes, reduced narcotic
      requirements, and improved patient subjective pain after hospital discharge.

      Preliminary data has shown: (1) elevated blood cytokine concentrations during the acute phase
      of trauma are correlated with the development of fatal post-traumatic complications, (2) that
      early administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) resulted in decreased
      blood serum levels of IL-6, Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), improved pulmonary edema, and enhanced
      arterioles ability to vasoconstrict in response to hemorrhage in animal models, and (3) that
      the addition of the internal physiologic parameters (inflammatory cytokines) to New Injury
      Severity Score (NISS - a marker of the external anatomical insult) significantly improves the
      ability to predict hospital length of stay of trauma patients when compared to NISS alone.
      The investigator's group is the first to use an integrative approach that combines the
      external anatomic injury data with the internal physiologic response for accurate prediction
      of patient's clinical outcome. Therefore, if the investigators apply this same mindset to
      treatment, the investigators can improve the trauma patients' care by addressing both
      parameters as opposed to solely focusing on the external injury as done in the past. The
      ability to modify post-traumatic physiologic response via short-term administration of a
      NSAID may lead to improved patient outcome.

      Over the last decade, clinicians remain puzzled over the safety of NSAID administration after
      fracture in terms of bone union. In addition, given the current landscape for opioid epidemic
      in the United States, alternative non-opioid pain management during acute trauma has the
      potential to reduce opioid consumption and represents a pivotal component of multimodal
      analgesia strategy.
