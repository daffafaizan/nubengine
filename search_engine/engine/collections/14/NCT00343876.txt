    
      The objective of this trial is to assess the effects of combined therapy of clopidogrel and
      aspirin versus placebo and aspirin on CRP in patients with known CAD.

      Potential subjects already on stable aspirin and statin therapy will be randomized to
      clopidogrel vs. placebo in a I: 1 design. Participants will undergo study therapy for 3
      months. Various laboratory parameters, including serum plasma concentration of CRP, will be
      assessed throughout the study. The primary endpoint is the effect of study therapy on CRP.
