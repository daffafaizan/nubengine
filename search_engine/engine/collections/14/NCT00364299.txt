    
      Design: Prospective, randomized, controlled trial, with 2 groups: study (automated control of
      cuff pressure) and control (standard control of cuff pressure). Setting: Respiratory
      Intensive Care Unit (RICU). Subjects: Patients >18 yr, intubated and ventilated.
      Interventions and measurements: Study group (cuff pressure will be kept constant at 25 cmH2O
      with the automatic device) and control group (cuff pressure control every 8 h. at the same
      level using a manual pressure controller, according with standard routine); recording of
      clinical variables at admission and during RICU stay, and end-point variables (incidence of
      VAP, etiologic microorganisms, RICU and hospital stay, RICU and 60-d mortality. Expected
      results: Lower incidence of VAP in study group, compared with control group.
