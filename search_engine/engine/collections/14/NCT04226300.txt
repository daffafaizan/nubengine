      are useful for post-operative pain control and reducing opioid analgesics.(1-3) A recent
      meta-analysis of TAP blocks in adults demonstrated a reduction in post-operative opioid
      requirements, and improved pain scores.(2) Within the pediatric population, numerous other
      studies have confirmed the benefit of TAP blocks and their ability to lower pain scores,
      reduce opioid use and opioid-related side effects post-operatively.(4) While there have been
      many prospective randomized trials for ultrasound-guided TAP blocks (5-7), there has been
      limited evaluation of surgically-placed TAP blocks (8). There has been no published data
      evaluating or comparing surgically placed TAP blocks in pediatric patients undergoing
      laparoscopic procedures. placed TAP blocks in pediatrics have not been examined in patients
      undergoing laparoscopic procedures.(4) Our pilot study was designed as a proof of concept, to
      demonstrate that ultrasound images could be used to verify the distribution of local
      anesthetic after a laparoscopically-assisted TAP block. The aim of this study is to continue
      using ultrasound to verify the location of laparoscopic-assisted TAP blocks, and compare the
      post-operative outcomes (pain scores, opioid use, etc.) to those who receive
      ultrasound-guided TAP blocks. We plan to do this in a prospective, randomized and
      semi-blinded fashion.

      We hypothesize that (1) we will be able to accurately describe the location of the TAP block
      placed by both methods in more than 90% of cases; (2) laparoscopic-assisted TAP blocks will
      be as effective as ultrasound-guided TAP blocks in terms of managing/reducing post-operative
      pain scores and reducing the amount and frequency of postoperative opioid analgesia.
