      care for patients with melanoma. You will also receive a dose of ICG mixed with human serum
      albumin. This will be administered in four small injections immediately around your tumor or
      the tumor scar if it has already been removed. Pictures of the ICG solution will be taken
      with the NIR camera and the progression of the dye along the lymphatic channel from your
      tumor to the SLN will be monitored.

      As each lymph node is removed, pictures will be taken to see if the ICG dye has entered and
      colored that node. We will compare this technique with the results from the
      lymphoscintigraphy to measure accuracy.

      Patients will be followed for at least one hour post injection for adverse events. The
      patient will then be taken off of the study. The results from each intervention will
      subsequently analyzed.
