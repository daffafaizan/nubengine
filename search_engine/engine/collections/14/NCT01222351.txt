      is a multidisciplinary, epidemiological study of Alzheimer's disease and related
      neurodegenerative disorders. We will obtain positron emission tomography scans and
      simultaneous x-ray computed tomography scans using Florbetaben from Bayer on a selection of
      ongoing participants who will be selected on the basis of change in plasma levels of amyloid
      beta over time. Approximately 200 participants will receive scans beginning in 2009 and in
      the 2010-2012 assessment wave and then again in a 2014-2015 assessment wave. Our intention is
      to examine whether uptake of Florbetaben in the brain varies as a function of previous
      history of change in plasma levels of amyloid beta in order to validate plasma amyloid beta
      as a viable biomarker for late onset Alzheimer's disease.
