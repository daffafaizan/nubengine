      iron loss) and inflammation. The latter is known to interfere with iron metabolism, inducing
      iron storage instead of using it for hemoglobin synthesis. The discover of a new regulatory
      hormone of iron metabolism, hepcidin, may help us to better understand the link between
      inflammation and iron functional deficit. The aim of our study is to observe the variation of
      usual iron metabolism biological markers and of hepcidin, in order to define the better
      marker of iron loss in these clinical situations.
