      Patients with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) do not only
      suffer from physical symptoms but also from psychological distress and stress. In other
      chronic conditions, mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) are effective in reducing the
      latter. However, research on MBIs in COPD patients following exacerbations is scarce. Due to
      physical limitations and impaired mobility, digital MBIs seem particularly promising for
      these patients.

      Aim and research questions:

      Building on that, this pilot randomized controlled trial aims to examine a) the feasibility
      of a brief digital MBI in COPD patients following exacerbations and b) its effects on
      psychological distress and stress.

      Methods:

      30 COPD patients, hospitalized after an exacerbation, will be randomly assigned to the MBI or
      waitlist control group. Patients in the MBI condition will conduct one of 4 brief
      audio-guided mindfulness exercises (10-15min) daily for 8 weeks, delivered on their
      smartphones. Psychological and respiratory variables (e.g. subjective stress, dyspnoea) will
      be assessed before and after each exercise. Primary (psychological distress) and secondary
      outcomes (e.g. fatigue) will be measured at baseline, discharge, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and
      follow-up, including questionnaires and assessments of biological stress markers (hair
      cortisol, heart rate variability, electrodermal activity).
