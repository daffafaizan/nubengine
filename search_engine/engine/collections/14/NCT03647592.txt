    
      A retrospective study of 30 cases of advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
      with EGFR mutation positive treated with A+T was conducted to observe the efficacy and safety
      of A+T regimen in the real world. Exploratory research contents are as follows: 1.
      Consistency between tissue gene test (NGS) and plasma gene test (NGS) at the initial
      diagnosis; 2. Consistency between tissue gene test (NGS) and plasma gene test (NGS) at the
      progression of A + T treatment; 3. New drug resistance mechanism of A + T treatment; 4.
      Plasma dynamics during A + T treatment. Detection (the first efficacy evaluation and a blood
      sampling before imaging PD) exploration and imaging progress sequence; 5. Plasma large panel
      dynamic drive gene mutation spectrum analysis to build disease progression risk model.
