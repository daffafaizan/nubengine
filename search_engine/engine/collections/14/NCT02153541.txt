      hypothesis that topical auricular anesthesia of the vagus nerve decreases the need for the
      usage of rescue inhalers in moderate to severe asthma in adults.

      We anticipate that up to 50 patients will be enrolled in the trial. Particularly severe risks
      are not anticipated based on the prior investigational experience with this drug. This trial
      will be used to generate experience and data to support the design of a larger, crossover,
      comparator trial investigating the efficacy of antipyrine- benzocaine in reducing the need
      for rescue inhalers and hospital admissions in moderate to severe asthmatic adults.
