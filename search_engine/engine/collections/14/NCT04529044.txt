    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Assess objective response in study participants receiving lutetium Lu 177
      tetra-azacyclododecanetetra-acetic acid (dota) tyr3-octreotate (tate) (177Lu-DOTATATE)
      therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the rate of disease control following 177Lu-DOTATATE therapy. II. Evaluate duration
      of treatment response to 177Lu-DOTATATE. III. Assess progression-free survival (PFS). IV.
      Assess safety and tolerability of the 177Lu-DOTATATE therapy. V. Evaluate progression-free
      survival.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate changes in the number of circulating SSTR2+ breast cancer cells (including cancer
      stem cell sub-populations) following 177Lu-DOTATATE treatment.

      II. Assess changes in gene profile among SSTR2+ breast cancer cells following 177Lu-DOTATATE
      treatment.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive 177Lu-DOTATATE intravenously (IV) over 30-40 minutes during weeks 1, 8, 16,
      and 24 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 1
      year.
