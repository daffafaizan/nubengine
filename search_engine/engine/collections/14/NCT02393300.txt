      Patients in this project will be randomly divided into three groups , one group is a blank
      group and the rest two receive either the topical or the intravenous form of tranexamic acid
      during unilateral TKA(total knee arthroplasty).The total blood loss(TBL) will be calculated
      as the primary outcome for efficacy while Deep Vein Thrombosis、Pulmonary Embolism、Acute
      Myocardial Infarction 、 Acute Kidney Infarction and Cerebral Infarction events will be
      recorded to assess the safety of the tranexamic acid during a six-week follow-up for each
      patient.

      All surgery are under general anesthesia, through direct lateral approach with cementless
      prosthesis.For all patients, the drain tube will be clamped and closed completely for 2
      hours; then the clamp will be fully opened.
