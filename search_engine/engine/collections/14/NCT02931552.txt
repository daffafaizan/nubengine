      test the effects of the new adapted program, NA-II, in a 6-month RCT among 150 rural, low
      literacy Latinas with non-metastatic breast cancer. Primary outcomes will consist of quality
      of life and distress. In an ancillary study, the investigators will compare the intervention
      and wait-list control groups on biomarkers of stress (hair and saliva cortisol) and aging
      (telomere length from saliva). Finally, to facilitate statewide dissemination of Nuevo
      Amanecer-II (NA-II), the investigators will develop a guide to implementation for
      community-based organizations.

      The investigators will adapt NA-I to be appropriate for rural and low-literacy Latinas with
      breast cancer. Needed program adaptations will be identified through a formative evaluation
      consisting of semi-structured interviews with key informants (e.g., rural Latina breast
      cancer survivors, advocates, health care providers) and iterative consultations with
      community representatives in three rural areas with large Latino populations. Results will be
      applied by the study team and community advisors to adapt NA-I to create NA-II and create the
      implementation guide.

      The investigators will identify key individual, organizational, and community factors that
      facilitate implementation and support scalability and statewide dissemination through a
      process evaluation where the investigators will track key implementation activities and
      debrief program participants, interventionists, and advocates. Products will include NA-II
      interventionist and participant manuals and a guide to implementation for organizations
      seeking to replicate the program.
