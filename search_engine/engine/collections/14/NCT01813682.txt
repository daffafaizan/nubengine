      important to supply iron with infants of this group.

      90 preterm infants BW(birth weight) less than 2kg,entered neonatal intensive care unit(NICU)
      less than 72 hours and meet the Inclusion Criteria of this study will be Randomly divided
      into three groups, control group、 treatment group1 (200μg/kg/d,and the highest concentration
      of iron is ≤0.8g/100ml TPN)、treatment group2 （400μg/kg/d,and the highest concentration of
      iron is ≤0.8g/100ml TPN）. iron supplementation period for more than ten days. For three
      groups, complete blood counts, differential counts, and reticulocyte counts were measured
      weekly in samples obtained, serum iron, iron protein, total iron binding force were measured
      at baseline and after 2 weeks. Through comparative analysis of three groups, to find
      iron-fortified TPN whether affect anemia rate and iron storage in preterm. we also selected
      malondialdehyde (MDA)and 8-iso-prostaglandin F2α(8-iso-PGF2α) as our concerns about iron used
      in TPN induces oxidative stress index.

      Iron protein determination use radioimmunoassay method, serum iron and total iron binding
      force determination use chemical method, MDA and 8-iso-PGF2α determination use enzyme-linked
      immunosorbent assay method.
