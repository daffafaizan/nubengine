      therapy should be received or the method of adjuvant therapy are determined by the
      postoperative pathology. In the traditional opinion, the postoperative risk factors were
      divided into two groups: intermediate risk factors, including large tumor size, deep stromal
      invasion and lymphovascular space invasion, and high risk factors, including non-squamous
      cell carcinoma, marginal positive, parametric invasion and pelvic lymph node(LN) metastasis.
      Patients with intermediate risk factors should accepted adjuvant radiotherapy only and who
      with high risk factors should received adjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Cisplatin
      weekly(40mg/m2) was the standard regimen of concurrent chemotherapy. However, we
      retrospectively analyzed 801 cervical cancer patients with postoperative radiotherapy and
      found that distant metastasis was the main cause of current treatment failure(84.5%), which
      suggested the current regimen of chemotherapy was insufficient and might be strengthened in
      future.
