      Congestive heart failure (CHF) is a leading cause of morbidity, mortality, and
      hospitalization in women. The increase in mortality suggests that postmenopausal estrogen
      loss may alter the phenotypic expression of CHF. Because estrogen is a potent in vitro
      inhibitor of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNFa, IL-1B, IL-6), which are re-expressed by
      the failing myocardium in patients with CHF and are related to an adverse prognosis, the
      study postulates that estrogen replacement will improve the outcome of postmenopausal women
      with CHF.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      The randomized, double blind study was conducted in 166 postmenopausal women with congestive
      heart failure due to idiopathic (i.e.nonischemic) dilated cardiomyopathy and NYHA class II or
      III symptoms on either combined estrogen and progestin or placebo. Women maintained their
      then current congestive heart failure medications for six months. Three outcomes were
      measured: 1) Congestive heart failure severity/functional capacity quantified by maximum
      oxygen consumption during metabolic stress testing; 2) Left and right ventricular remodeling
      quantified by electron bean CT scan; 3) quality of life assessment by the Minnesota Living
      with Heart Failure and Kansas City cardiomyopathy questionnaires. In addition, measurements
      were made of pro-inflammatory markers, that had been demonstrated to be elevated in
      congestive heart failure to assess whether hormone replacement therapy reduced them.

      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the "End Date" entered in
      the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.
