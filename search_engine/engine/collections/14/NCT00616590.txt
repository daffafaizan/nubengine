        -  To assess the prevalence of insomnia, extent of sleep disturbance, and possible
           contributing factors to sleep disturbance in head and neck cancer patients undergoing
           chemoradiotherapy.

        -  To evaluate the relationships between insomnia and symptom burden, quality of life,
           mood, fatigue, and tumor/treatment variables in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients complete a demographic survey and a questionnaire packet comprising The
      Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, The Head and Neck Symptom Survey, Profile of Mood States,
      Suspected Causes of Insomnia Survey, and a Quality of Life Survey on day 1 of
      chemoradiotherapy to obtain baseline data on sleep quality, possible causes of sleep
      disruption, head and neck symptoms, mood state, fatigue, quality of life, and patient
      demographics. Questionnaires are administered weekly thereafter during therapy visits for up
      to 6-7 weeks and take 15-30 minutes to complete.

      Medical records are reviewed to obtain information regarding medications and tumor- and
      treatment-related variables.
