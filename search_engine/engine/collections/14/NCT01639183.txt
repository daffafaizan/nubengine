      primarily due to caregiver resistance in the provision of daily oral hygiene care. Fear of
      being bitten or assaulted by the resident as well as lack of time and discomfort with working
      in the mouth, are reasons cited for this resistance. It is also now recognized that
      inflammation in the mouth can raise overall inflammation within the body potentially leading
      to serious health consequences. Numerous studies involving periodic professional
      interventions as well as education and training of caregivers in oral care provision have not
      met with a great deal of success. Caregivers in some studies have indicated preference to
      power toothbrushes as they are bulkier and longer eliminating the need for insertion of
      fingers into the mouth and subsequently alleviating fears of being bitten. This study
      hypothesizes that caregiver utilization of a power toothbrush may increase their compliance
      with daily oral care provision and could potentially result in elimination of oral and
      systemic inflammation.
