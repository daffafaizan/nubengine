    
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety
      and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works
      in treating a specific disease, or in this case, the side effects from a standard treatment
      for Stem Cell Transplant side effect. "Investigational" means that the intervention is being
      studied.

      In this research study, the investigators are evaluating Enterade/Placebo plus standard
      supportive care for the treatment of the side effects caused by transplant. Enterade works by
      rehydrating the intestinal cells, thereby helping to restore normal bowel function. The
      ingredients in Enterade are generally recognized as safe by the Food and Drug Administration.
      This research study is hoping to learn if adding Enterade to the standard supportive care
      regimen for the participant transplant will help reduce the side effects from the transplant.
