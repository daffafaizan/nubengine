      therapies used and outcomes of the infants. The information collected is not specific to a
      disease or treatment. The data collected includes information on:

        -  Demographics of mother and infant

        -  Mother's health, labor and delivery

        -  Infant's health upon admission, procedures and interventions, and medical outcomes

      These data are used to: provide member centers with reporting for use in quality improvement;
      examine associations between baseline characteristics, treatments, and outcomes; and track
      trends in incidences of disease and effectiveness of therapies.
