      the uterine, ovarian and spiral arteries can help to explain tubal or unexplained infertility
      as a standard screening method. Patients in unexplained-tubal infertility groups were treated
      in our IVF clinic. Patients will be invited to the hospital according to the criteria of the
      study. Fertile patients will be selected according to the criteria for patients who have come
      for the annual smear control. The study hypothesis is that the resistance in ovarian, uterine
      and spiral artery doppler will be higher in cases with tubal and unexplained infertility as
      opposed to low resistance in fertile women.Ovarian, uterine and spiral artery pulsatility
      index (PI = (peak systolic velocity - end diastolic velocity) / time averaged velocity and
      resistance index ( RI= (peak systolic velocity - end diastolic velocity) / peak systolic
      velocity ) will measure with doppler ultrasonography in the mid-luteal phase ( 21th day).
      Measured values are to be compared.
