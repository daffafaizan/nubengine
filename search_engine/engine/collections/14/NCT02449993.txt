      cycles of doxorubicin 60 mg/m² plus pemetrexed 500 mg/m² on day 1 every 21 days followed by
      four cycles of docetaxel 100 mg/m² on day 1 every 21 days or four cycles of doxorubicin 60
      mg/m² plus cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m² on day 1 every 21 days followed by four cycles of
      docetaxel 100 mg/m² on day 1 every 21 days will be re-analyzed with the MammaTyper Kit. The
      Kit is an in-vitro molecular diagnostic test for molecular subtyping of breast cancers into
      Luminal A & B, HER2 and Triple negative. It allows quantitative detection of the RNA
      expression status of the genes for estrogen receptor (ESR1), PgR, HER2 and Ki-67 on the basis
      of their mRNA present in the samples. This prospective diagnostic study will investigate the
      subtyping-results of the MammaTyper™ analysis and will compare them to the subtyping of the
      former immunohistochemical analysis performed. Based on the MammaTyper™-subtypes the
      efficiency of the therapy regimen and the outcome will be re-evaluated from the patient data.
