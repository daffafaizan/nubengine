    
      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Women record diet intake for at least 1 cycle (28 days), then undergo a
      comprehensive nutritional assessment at least once during the follicular and luteal phases of
      the cycle.

      Men also record diet intake for at least 1 month and undergo indirect calorimetry and other
      studies.

      All patients receive a comprehensive analysis of diet and energy metabolism. Energy
      expenditure, resting metabolic rates, and basal metabolic rates are determined with indirect
      calorimetry, including measurements taken during the follicular and luteal phases of the
      cycle. Other testing includes hormone assays, serology for nutritional studies, and a urinary
      metabolite profile. Zinc, lead, and other metals are measured by atomic absorption
      spectroscopy.

      The diagnosis of acute intermittent porphyria is confirmed by erythrocyte porphobilinogen
      deaminase; urinary aminolevulinic acid, porphobilinogen, and porphyrins; and total fecal
      porphyrins.

      Patients hospitalized for acute attacks of porphyria during the study will receive standard
      treatment, including intravenous hematin and parenteral support.
