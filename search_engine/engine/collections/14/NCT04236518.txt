        -  Characterize the metabolic adaptations induced by animal or plant protein diets and
           their repercussions in terms of physiology and health.

        -  Characterize the medium-term metabolomic signatures induced by this shift in dietary
           protein sources

        -  Validate, in a human population, biomarkers of dietary animal or plant proteins,
           previously identified in pre-clinical studies.

      This clinical trial is open, monocentric, controlled, randomized, with a cross experimental
      design.

      20 men will follow for 4 weeks a controlled diet with a protein fraction constituted mainly
      from animal or vegetal sources. After a 2-week washout period, they will follow another 4
      week of controlled diet with predominantly animal or plant protein depending on 1st
      intervention period diet.

      At the end of each intervention period, a post-prandial exploration will be conducted with
      the administration of a high-fat, high-sugar meal and subsequent blood and urine sampling.

      The order in which participants will received the two diets will be randomized.
