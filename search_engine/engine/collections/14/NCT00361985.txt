      procedure for the treatment of morbid obesity. However, a common early complication of LYRGB
      is stricture at the gastrojejunal (GJ) anastomosis, occurring in 4% - 27% of patients,
      usually within the third post-operative month. This complication usually presents with
      progressive dysphagia leading to daily vomiting. Endoscopic balloon dilation is the treatment
      of choice for this complication, and multiple dilations are often required to provide
      complete resolution.

      The etiology of GJ anastomotic strictures is unknown and is probably multi-factorial. Some
      investigators hypothesize that ischemia or non-ischemia-related excessive scar formation is
      the cause of stricture. The method of construction of the anastomosis as well seems to have
      an impact, as circular stapled anastomoses may have higher rates of stricture than linear
      staplers or completely hand-sewn anastomoses. The route of the Roux limb (antecolic vs
      retrocolic) does not appear to affect this complication.

      Several investigators have demonstrated little acid production in the gastric bypass pouch.
      Despite this data, acid secretion has been hypothesized as a predominant factor in the
      development of GJ stricture. This hypothesis is supported in part by the frequent finding of
      ulcers at the site of stricture in up to 55% of patients. The purpose of this study is to
      determine whether suppressing acid production by administration of daily proton pump
      inhibitors in the early post-operative period will reduce GJ anastomosis stricture rate.
