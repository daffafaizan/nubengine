      to establish a large-scale observational cohort of ADPKD patients for the purpose of studying
      the pathogenesis, rate of disease progression, progression rate modifiers, disease stage
      specific morbidity, mortality, health economic issues and the predictive value of biomarkers
      in ADPKD. Overall 1,100 patients will be enrolled in 14 study sites across Europe and will be
      followed up for at least three years. The ADPKD reference center network across Europe and
      the observational cohort study will enable European ADPKD researchers to gain insight into
      the natural history, heterogeneity and associated complications of the disease as well as how
      it affects the lives of patients across Europe.
