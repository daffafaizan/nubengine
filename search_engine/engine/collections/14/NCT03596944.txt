    
      Adult patients (â‰¥ 18 years of age) with acute coronary syndrome which are diagnosed under
      ICD-10 coding of I24.9 were included in this study. The inclusion criteria are patients with
      primary diagnosis of I24.9 and with a complete record of prior medical and treatment history,
      electrocardiographic findings, cardiac marker results and outcomes. Participants were grouped
      into 2 groups - statin and non-statin based on prior history of statin use prior to ACS.
      Diagnosis of ACS was made based on clinical, electrocardiographic and cardiac marker findings
      found in the medical record.

      Data such as age, sex, ethnic, education, prior medical and treatment history,
      electrocardiographic and cardiac enzyme results as well as outcomes were collected from the
      patients' medical records. Outcomes of interest were defined as either recurrent myocardial
      infarction, cardiogenic shock, mortality or combinations of them as diagnosed in the medical
      records. GRACE and TIMI Scores are calculated to predict in hospital and future mortality
      rates.
