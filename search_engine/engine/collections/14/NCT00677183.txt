      changes of inflammation and fibrosis in the liver that are nearly identical to those induced
      by excessive alcohol intake, but in the absence of alcohol abuse. Nonalcoholic
      steatohepatitis occurs commonly children with additional comorbidities such as obesity and
      diabetes mellitus. Paralleling the increasing prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes in
      the pediatric population, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and especially its more
      severe histological form NASH, is expected to become one of the most common causes of
      end-stage liver disease in both children and young adults.

      Although no genome wide association studies have been conducted in association with NASH to
      date, individual candidate gene investigations have identified several genes associated with
      increase susceptibility to NASH in adults including the microsomal triglyceride transfer
      protein (MTP) which regulates the incorporation of triglycerides into apolipoprotein B and a
      key enzyme for the assembly and secretion of VLDL from hepatocytes, the manganese superoxide
      dismutase (MnSOD) gene which catalyzes the conversion of two molecules of superoxide anion, a
      highly unstable ROS, into hydrogen peroxide and oxygen more stable ROS, and lastly,
      phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEMT) which is required for hepatic secretion
      of triacylglycerol in very low density lipoproteins (VLDL).

      We propose the following aim:

      Aim 1: To document the frequency of specific genotypes, previously identified to be
      associated with adult-onset NASH, in a purely pediatric cohort.

      Aim 2: To investigate whether these genotypes are associated with increased susceptibility to
      NASH and increased occurrence of fibrosis in the cohort of pediatric subjects. Our hypothesis
      would be:

      A significantly higher proportion of the polymorphisms would exist in those subjects with
      NASH compared to controls.

      Aim 3: To investigate the presence of other polymorphisms or other biomarker that are
      indicative of pediatric NASH. Such that our secondary hypothesis would be:

      Specific polymorphisms or biomarkers will be identified that will indicate a higher
      probability of NASH.
