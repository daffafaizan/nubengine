      CTS were includes and randomized into three groups. Group A, patients received two-sessions
      of ultrasound-guided PIT with 10cc D5W (3 months interval); Group B, patients received
      one-session of ultrasound-guided PIT with 10cc D5W and 5cc normal saline separately (3 months
      interval); Group C (control group), patients received two-sessions of ultrasound-guided PIT
      with nerve hydrodissection with 10cc normal saline. The primary outcome is Boston Carpal
      Tunnel Syndrome Questionnaire (BCTQ) and secondary outcomes include visual analog scale
      (VAS), cross-sectional area (CSA) of the median nerve, nerve conduction velocity of the
      median nerve, and Global assessment of treatment. The evaluations were performed pretreatment
      as well as on the 1st, 3rd, 6th, 9th month and one year after first injection.
