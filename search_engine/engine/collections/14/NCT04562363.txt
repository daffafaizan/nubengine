      patients after median laparotomies in urgent surgery will be performed, with the
      identification of factors contributing to the development of postoperative ventral hernias.
      At the next stage, the investigators will search for the most reliable methods of suturing
      the white line of the abdomen, taking into account the risk of hernia formation, with their
      implementation in patients operated in an emergency through median laparotomic access in
      comparison with traditionally used methods. In conclusion, an algorithm will be developed for
      selecting the method of surgical prevention of postoperative ventral hernias, taking into
      account the risk of their development.
