      morphine or oxycodone may benefit from switching to another opioid, in this case methadone.
      Although the mechanism for such switch is not completely understood, evidence indicates that
      opioids with different chemical structures have different characteristics, not least in
      relation to new knowledge about genetic variation in opioid receptors. Another challenge is
      that there is much uncertainty regarding equianalgesic dose ratios for morphine and
      methadone. It seems that the higher the morphine doses, the relatively lower methadone doses
      are needed to substitute morphine. Furthermore, there is uncertainty to which switching
      procedures one should use, the most common ones are "stop and go" and a three days switch.
      Finally, it is reported that methadone may increase the QT interval of the ECG, and thus
      increase the risk for the ventricular arrhythmia Torsade de pointe. The aim of this
      randomized, open label, multicenter study is primarily to compare the switching procedures,
      but it will also provide more knowledge about equianalgesic dose ratios, the effect of
      methadone on the QT interval, genetical factors that may characterize patients needing opioid
      switch as well as their response to it, and finally if pharmacokinetic factors plays a role.
