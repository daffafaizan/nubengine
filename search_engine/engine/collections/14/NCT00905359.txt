    
      The NICE study is a Multicenter Prospective Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial to Evaluate
      the Effectiveness and Safety of the Aperius™ PercLID™System Versus Standalone Decompressive
      Surgery in Degenerative Lumbar Spinal Stenosis with Neurogenic Intermittent Claudication.

      DLSS patients suffering from NIC that would be candidates for surgical treatment without
      stabilization and/or fusion can be offered participation in the study. After randomization,
      patients will be treated with either the Aperius™ PercLID™ System or Standalone Decompressive
      Surgery (SDS). A sample size recalculation reduced the amount of patients to be enrolled from
      280 to 128 in both treatment group.

      The patient will undergo a study visit at screening / baseline and at 14 days, 6 weeks, 6, 12
      and 24 months after surgery. Safety data will be collected during surgery and throughout the
      24 months follow up. Procedural details will be collected during surgery and also duration of
      hospital stay will be collected. At screening / baseline and all follow up visits a physical
      examination will be performed, the use of pain medication will be documented and the subject
      will be asked to complete a pain VAS scale (back - leg - buttock / groin pain) and
      questionnaires (SF36 v2 and Zurich Claudication Questionnaire).

      Study subjects are required to undergo X-ray, CT and MRI and fluoroscopy procedures at
      specified time points during the study.
