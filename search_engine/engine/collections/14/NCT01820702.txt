      three campaigns at the Institute of Aerospace Medicine, Cologne, Germany.

      The subjects were quasi randomized alternatively by enrolment to undertake the different
      training interventions or to be in the control group during 5 days of immobilisation in 6°
      head down tilt position. The subjects were quasi randomized either to the one of the training
      programs or the non-training group depending on the arrival at the Institute of Aerospace
      Medicine.

      The study started November 01st, 2010 and was finished May 29th, 2011. The first campaign
      lasted from November 01st to November 21sh, 2010, the second campaign from January 10th to
      January 30th, 2011 and the third campaign from May 09th to May 29th, 2011.

      Each campaign comprised a 5 day adaptation-, a 5 day intervention phase in HDT bed rest, and
      a 5 day recovery phase (15 days in total) in-house at the Metabolic Ward of the Institute of
      Aerospace Medicine.

      Baseline Data were collected during the adaptation phase (BDC Baseline Data Collection) when
      subjects could move free inside the lab. The intervention was administered during the bed
      rest phase where the subjects had to lie in bed in 6° head down tilt (HDT Head Down Tilt)
      position and were not allowed to get up. Recumbency was to be adhered to at all times
      including all activities (hygienic procedures, leisure activities). The bed rest phase was
      followed by a recovery phase (R+).
