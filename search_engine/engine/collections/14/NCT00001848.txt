      lining (endometrium) is also outside the uterus. Endometriosis pain often returns after
      medical treatment is stopped. Surgical therapies have had varied success in reducing pain,
      with laparoscopic excision of implants one of the most effective methods. Raloxifene (Evista
      (Trademark), Lilly), has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in
      preventing bone loss in postmenopausal women. This compound has effects that are both similar
      to and different from those of the hormone estrogen. Unlike estrogen, raloxifene does not
      stimulate growth of the uterus or breast tissue in post-menopausal women. If raloxifene
      blocks estrogen action in the lining of the uterus (or endometrium) of reproductive age
      women, as it does in postmenopausal women, it may also limit growth of endometriosis and
      prevent the return of pain. This phase II randomized placebo-controlled study evaluates
      whether surgery followed by daily administration of raloxifene for six months reduces pain
      for a longer time than surgery alone.
