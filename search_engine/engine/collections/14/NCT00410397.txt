      treatment of low back pain (LBP). Under the heading of OMM, many different modalities exist
      to decrease a patient's somatic dysfunction. Among the most commonly used are high velocity
      (thrusting through an immobilized joint) and muscle energy (engaging a restrictive barrier
      using the patient's own strength).

      Although a very common complaint, there is no exact etiology for LBP. Many different theories
      exist, including postural disturbances, leg length discrepancies, and even genetic
      predispositions. A study in Spine finds that among those with chronic LBP there is a subgroup
      of people with reduced hip flexion, and concludes that hip motion should be considered in
      treatment of patients with LBP. Currently, there exists no research on the manipulation of
      hip flexors in the treatment of LBP. This study, therefore, will test the efficacy of OMM on
      the deep pelvic musculature as a way of decreasing LBP.
