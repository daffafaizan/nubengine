      Empowerment (EMERGE) Project, the study team will conduct a single-group study to examine the
      feasibility of assessing economic and sexual risk behaviors using text messages. The study
      team will enroll approximately 20 young adults, aged 18 to 24, who are African-American,
      homeless, out-of-school, and un/under-employed. Participants will complete a text-messaged
      survey each week for 5 weeks. The study team will collect information about the number of
      participants who respond to the weekly survey, the number of questions to which they respond
      in each survey, and the number of hours from sending a survey to participants to receiving
      their response. As an exploratory aim, participants will also receive 3 informational text
      messages each week for 5 weeks on HIV prevention and economic empowerment. The study team
      will obtain qualitative feedback from participants regarding text messages they most and
      least liked. The survey is not designed to evaluate the effectiveness of the text message
      intervention. The single-group study is anticipated to start in August 2017.
