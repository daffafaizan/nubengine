      joining the Inova biomarker study. If yes, the patient will be consented, blood will be drawn
      for the Inova biomarkers, and x-rays will be sent for sharp scoring. Patients may decline and
      will not be part of the Inova study. Patients who decline will continue to receive standard
      of care treatment henceforth.

      Patients in the Inova trial will receive a diagnosis from their doctor and are placed into
      separate cohorts based upon their diagnosis. The Inova biomarker results of each cohort will
      be cross-correlated with diagnoses, pre-screening tool results. Baseline disease activity and
      sharp scores will also be correlation variables.
