      (MTD) of GSL alpha-GAL that can be administered directly into the tumor lesion on two
      separate injections separated by 4-weeks. This trial will serve as the basis for future Phase
      II trials utilizing multiple injections of GSL alpha-GAL in refractory solid tumors.

      Additionally, in this study we will look for histologic evidence of an immune response
      against the injected melanoma lesions which matches that seen in mice. Our hypothesis for
      this study is that a second injection of GSL alpha-GAL into a melanoma lesion will not
      precipitate an allergic or autoimmune reaction, but will cause a histologically evident
      immune response to the tumor.
