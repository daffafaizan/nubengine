      prophylaxis for total hip or knee arthroplasty either with a single dose of teicoplanin or
      with multiple doses of other antibiotics according to the habits of the attending physicians
      aiming to evaluate any differences between these two different strategies of antimicrobial
      prophylaxis in the occurrence of surgical site infections
