      Attempts to use these lenses for reduction of high myopia have been shown to give rise to
      complications such as corneal staining and lens decentration. Thus, practitioners may choose
      a more conservative way for high myopic children, that is, offering partial reduction
      ortho-k. Partial reduction ortho-k is target for 4.00-5.00D reduction and the residual
      refractive errors will be corrected with single vision spectacles to allow good visual acuity
      in the daytime. Partial reduction ortho-k has been shown to slow axial elongation in high
      myopic children, however, the main disadvantage is that the children have to wear spectacles
      in the daytime to correct residual refraction.

      Euclid has recently designed a new lens, Euclid's Topaz, for high myopic children. It is
      currently commercially available to correct myopia for up to 10 D. However, evidence of its
      effectiveness for visual correction and slowing AL growth is lacking. While numerous studies
      have shown that orthokeratology is an effective clinical treatment to slow axial eye growth
      in children, the exact mechanism underlying this reduction in myopia progression associated
      with orthokeratology remains unclear.
