      Alliance (DBSA) for Aim 1. Aim 1 will measure characteristics of current DBSA members through
      cross-sectional surveys of demographics, clinical use history, and involvement in DBSA. 60
      new DBSA members who began attending in the past month will be enrolled for Aim 2. Aim 3 will
      consist of 100 matched controls of people who have never attended a DBSA meeting. Assessments
      will be completed at McLean Hospital, in which a study staff member will thoroughly explain
      the study to participants. If participants are eligible for Aim 2, study staff will receive
      written consent from the participant.
