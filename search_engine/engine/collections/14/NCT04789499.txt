      gray matter and decrease in quality of life. COVID-19 related olfactory dysfunction has
      already been shown to be correlated with depression and decreased quality of life, so finding
      an effective treatment is imperative.

      Intranasal and oral corticosteroids as well as olfactory training are currently used to treat
      post-viral OD; however they have demonstrated limited efficacy and there is no current gold
      standard of care. There is no current consensus on the pathogenesis of COVID-related anosmia;
      however evidence for post-viral olfactory dysfunction suggests sensory axonal regeneration
      and olfactory signaling may rely on elevated levels of secondary messengers cAMP and cGMP, a
      known effect of theophylline. In this phase II treatment trial, patients will be allocated
      1:1 to receive either intranasal theophylline irrigation or placebo for six weeks. Various
      smell surveys and scratch-and-sniff tests will be utilized to capture changes in smell
      ability.

      Due to COVID-19, this study will be conducted virtually, except for the first ten enrolled
      patients who will undergo one serum theophylline test. This study is limited to patients
      living in Missouri or Illinois.
