      adenomas into invasive cancer over years, it is important that these adenomas are completely
      resected.

      This will be a double-blind, prospective, randomized controlled trial. All eligible patients
      referred for a colonoscopy will be able to participate. There will be 2 treatment arms, one
      arm will be treated with a thin wire snare and the other with a thick wire snare. Patients
      will be randomised through a computer generated programme and blinded for the type of snare
      used. The treatment arm will be disclosed to the proceduralist after introduction of the
      colonoscope into the rectum. After resection of the polyp the defect will be carefully
      examined by the proceduralist. In case of suspicion of residual adenomatous tissue, a
      re-excision will be performed. If there's a protrusion noticeable at the resection site, this
      will be biopsied. Ultimately, the margins of the defect will be biopsied on either side for
      histological confirmation of complete removal.
