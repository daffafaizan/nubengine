      study conducted in Nepal and will be shipped to Karius, Redwood City, CA.

      The investigators will test whether the Karius test can detect Dengue Virus in plasma from
      those suspected cases and measure the performance of the Karius test against standard tests
      (PCR, ELISA test and neutralization assays) used to determine a final diagnosis of Dengue
      Fever.
