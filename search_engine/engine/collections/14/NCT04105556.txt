      perioperative period, was applied to children and their parents.

      Care was given when the child and his / her parents applied to the outpatient clinic for
      anesthesia consultation on the working day before the operation, and care was continued in
      the day surgery unit. On the 1st and 3rd days after discharge, the researcher provided
      tele-monitoring and consultancy services. In addition, communication with the parents was
      maintained at all times as needed. Care was terminated on the 10th day after discharge. The
      time of the study was approximately 12-14 days for each child and his / her parents.

      Nursing care consists of 3 types of comfort-oriented care interventions. These interventions;

        1. Standard maintenance interventions,

        2. Emotional focused comfort care interventions,

        3. Cognitive and functional comfort care interventions.
