      would get relapse. Vinorelbine(Navelbine) is a third-line treatment option for Hodgkin's
      disease(HD) after transplantation failed, while both HD and ALCL express CD30. When ALCL
      recurred, vinblastine monotherapy was used and the 5-year EFS up to 30%, 5-year OS up to 60%.
      In China vinblastine is unavailable. Vinorelbine is very similar to vinblastine in molecular
      formula, and is available in China. From November 2016 to March 2017, two patients with
      recurrent ALCL were recruited in the Department of Hematology and Oncology, Shanghai
      Children's Medical Center. They received vinorelbine monotherapy and achieved clinical
      remission (PET CR) at 8 weeks. One patient with bone marrow recurrence showed negative ALK /
      NPM by PCR . Based on this, the investigators will expand the sample to further investigate
      the therapeutic efficiency and safety of vinorelbine in children and adolescents with ALCL.
