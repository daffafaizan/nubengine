      better clinical characterization of Eustachian tube function in ears with intact TM's. These
      test will be done in a pressure-chamber and will use previously published and newly developed
      methods. Participation will require a minimum of 5 visits to the ENT Research Center, 1 for
      myringotomy (putting a small hole in the eardrum) and 4 for ETF testing. Hearing testing will
      be done at entry and exit; otoscopy (looking at the ears) and tympanometry (a test done with
      an earplug and varying pressures in the ear canal) are done at every visit.
