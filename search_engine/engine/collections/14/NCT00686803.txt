      commonly seen in emergency rooms and other urgent care settings. Current standards of care
      include intravenously administered drugs, which can be difficult to titrate and require
      ongoing monitoring. This study examines the effect of PL-3994 on patients with controlled
      hypertension who are receiving antihypertensive medications.
