      to fluoroscopy and reduces performance times for cervical medial branch blocks, larger
      studies documenting safety-related outcomes are lacking. In addition, although cervical
      medial branch blocks are an accepted tool to diagnose neck pain originating from the cervical
      facets, there are reports of long-lasting analgesic effects in a subset of patients,
      suggesting that these blocks may have long-term benefits. We therefore propose to
      prospectively examine the incidence of adverse events, as well as the clinical long-term
      effects of ultrasound-guided cervical medial branch blocks, in a cohort of pain clinic
      patients undergoing these procedures as part of their usual care.
