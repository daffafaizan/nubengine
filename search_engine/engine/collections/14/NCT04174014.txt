      assessed by transpulmonary pressure measurement to keep open up the lung. Physicians are lack
      of data at which pressure the most alveoli are recruited and if 40 cmH2O of pressure is
      really required for complete recruitment. By CT scan of chest and continuous EIT measurement
      rate of recruitment would be assessed.
