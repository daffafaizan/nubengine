    
      Background:

      -Malignant ascites or pleural effusions are often seen in patients with solid tumor

      malignancies.

      -Malignant ascites is proinflammatory with many cytokines present and acts to promote

      tumor cell growth.

      -The cellular composition of malignant ascites consists of lymphocytes, macrophages and

      monocytes.

      -Serum monocytes and lymphocytes play a role in the native host anti-tumor immune

      mediated mechanisms.

      -A paracentesis or thoracentesis is often done for symptomatic relief from the malignant

      fluid collection.

      Primary Objective:

      -To obtain blood samples and ascites and pleural effusion samples from patients with solid

      tumor malignancies, with the intent of performing translational studies related to cancer.

      Eligibility:

        -  Patients greater than or equal to 18 years of age.

        -  Diagnosis of malignant solid tumor.

        -  Patients must be able and willing to provide informed consent.

      Design:

      -We will collect approximately 200cc-5L ascites from patients that are undergoing a

      therapeutic paracentesis or thoracentesis. No thoracentesis or paracentesis will be

      performed solely for research purposes.

      -The fluid will be collected during the medical procedure and may be collected at more

      than one time point.

      -We will also collect 30ml of peripheral blood. This will be from patients who are being

      seen in follow up, consultation, or presenting for enrollment on a clinical trial.
