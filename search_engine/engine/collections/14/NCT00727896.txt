      adherence to Life Style Modification (LSM) and drugs will improve the compliance. SMS may be
      an effective and cheap tool of communication. Improved compliance is likely to result in
      better glycaemic control.

      Out of total number of 200, consecutive randomization of 100 patients each to SMS or usual
      care arms will be done. Patients in the SMS group will get SMS once in 3 days as a reminder.
      Patients will be reviewed at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months from the date of randomization

      Fasting and 2hr postprandial glucose and HbA1c will be tested during each visit.

      At baseline and at the end of the study, lipids, and renal function test will also be done. A
      validated questionnaire will be used to assess physical activity, diet habits, adherence to
      drug prescriptions and frequency of monitoring of blood glucose. . Body weight, blood
      pressure, biochemical variables, scores for diet and physical activity and compliance to
      drugs, will be compared using students 't' test or chi-square test as relevant.
