      screws through the iliosacral joint into the sacral ala or the body of the S1 vertebra.
      Correct positioning is technically demanding. Screw displacement may reduce the strength of
      fixation and lead to neurological complications.

      Secondary objectives of the study are to compare the fluoroscopy time, complications and
      surgery duration between the treatments.
