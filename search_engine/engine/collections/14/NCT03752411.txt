      physical environment inside the bottle. The participant will be asked to keep the medication
      in the bottle and to remove each pill immediately before taking it.

      The participant will not store medications in pill organizers, other pill bottles, pockets,
      purses, etc. The participant will keep a record of when the participant removes a pill from
      the bottle and takes it. Certain aspects of this study will be withheld from the participant
      to preserve the integrity of the study. This information will be revealed at the conclusion
      of the study.
