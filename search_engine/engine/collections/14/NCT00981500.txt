      improvement in insulin sensitivity and the resolution of type 2 diabetes after bariatric
      surgery has led to the hypothesis that bariatric surgery has specific beneficial effects on
      glucose homeostasis beyond weight loss alone. However, this hypothesis has never been
      adequately evaluated in human subjects. Therefore, the primary goal of this proposal is to
      provide a better understanding of the effect of bariatric surgery-induced weight loss on
      insulin action and pancreatic beta cell function.
