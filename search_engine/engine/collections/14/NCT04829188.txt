    
      This study implements an adaptive platform trial to compare effectiveness of different care
      models to prevent readmissions for patients hospitalized with sepsis or lower respiratory
      tract infection and discharged to home (with or without a short stay in a skilled nursing
      facility prior to going home): structured telephone support (STS); low-intensity remote
      patient monitoring (RPM-Low); and high-intensity remote patient monitoring (RPM-High). The
      remote patient monitoring models will be staffed by a physician or a nurse (Standard Team) or
      by a dedicated nurse-practitioner (NP)-led multidisciplinary team (Enhanced Team). Patients
      will be randomized to one of five arms: STS, RPM-Low + Standard Team, RPM-Low + Enhanced
      Team, RPM-High + Standard Team, and RPM-High + Enhanced Team. Using response adaptive
      randomization (RAR), interim outcome results will be used to modify the random allocation of
      patients to each study arm. The primary outcome is number of days spent at home within 90
      days after hospital discharge. Patient-reported functional status and quality of life data
      will be collected in addition to electronic health record (EHR) and claims-based data to
      measure health care utilization. Qualitative interviews with patients and providers will
      provide insight into the effectiveness of the implementation process.
