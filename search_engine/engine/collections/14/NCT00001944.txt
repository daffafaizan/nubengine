      Accumulating evidence indicates that in some malignancies P-glycoprotein can confer
      resistance, and that its reversal can improve therapeutic outcome. Clinical trials
      investigating P-glycoprotein antagonists have been hampered by the occurrence of
      unpredictable pharmacokinetic interactions, which have required dose reductions of the
      chemotherapeutic agents to avert excessive toxicity. XR9576 is a new P-glycoprotein
      antagonist that is more potent, has prolonged activity, and is potentially devoid of
      significant pharmacokinetic interactions. This phase I study seeks to identify the safety of
      XR9576 administration in combination with vinorelbine and determine the extent, if any, of a
      pharmacokinetic interaction between these two drugs. Clinical responses will also be
      determined.
