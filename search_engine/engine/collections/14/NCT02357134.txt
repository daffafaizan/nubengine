      I. Obtain preliminary estimates of the effect size of oxygen and high flow rate on exertional
      dyspnea (modified Borg Scale adjusted for work rate and baseline dyspnea).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the completion rate of a randomized controlled trial of exertional dyspnea in
      cancer patients.

      II. Obtain preliminary estimates of the effects of oxygen and flow rate on physiologic
      function (respiratory rate and oxygen saturation) and exercise capacity (work rate and
      exercise duration).

      OUTLINE: All patients undergo a baseline structured exercise session with air. Patients are
      then randomized to 1 of 4 treatments for a second session approximately 3 days later.

      ARM I: Patients receive high-flow oxygen via nasal prongs during a structured stationary
      bicycle exercise session.

      ARM II: Patients receive high-flow air via nasal prongs during a structured stationary
      bicycle exercise session.

      ARM III: Patients receive low-flow oxygen via a nasal cannula during a structured stationary
      bicycle exercise session.

      ARM IV: Patients receive low-flow air via a nasal cannula during structured stationary
      bicycle exercise session.
