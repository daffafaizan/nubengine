      concentration and motility, irrespective of the morphology of spermatozoa - treated with
      their female partner with assisted reproduction techniques (ISCI) will be included. In the
      double blind study male patients will be given astaxanthin with vitamin E (study group, 40
      patients) or placebo (control group, 40 patients) for three months prior to ART. In the study
      and the control group the quality of sperm (spermiogram), DNA fragmentation and mitochondrial
      membrane potential of semen before and after the dietary supplementation will be evaluated.
      In the ART procedure (ICSI) the fertilization rate, the quality of embryos, pregnancy rates
      and miscarriages rates in 1st trimester will be compared between the study and control group.
