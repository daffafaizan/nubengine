      be conducted. On the primary procedure visit, data collection will begin with the subjects
      having the investigational device, ECG sensors, and 1 or more pulse oximetry sensors placed
      on them for data collection and to monitor their safety for the duration of the study. A
      physician will place an arterial line in the radial artery. The Sensifree cNIBP system will
      be calibrated with an oscillometric and/or auscultatory blood pressure cuff measurement taken
      on the arm opposite the arterial line.

      A series of blood pressure changes will be induced, including various combinations of
      methods.
