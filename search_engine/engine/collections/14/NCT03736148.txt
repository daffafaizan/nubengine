      with the cervical spine in a neutral position. Slight ipsilateral side flexion and
      contralateral rotation were introduced until tension was perceived in the tissues at the
      contact point. A high-velocity, low-amplitude thrust manipulation was directed upward and
      medially in the direction of the subject's contralateral eye.

      The instrument-assisted manipulation was applied using a handheld Activator IV Adjusting
      Instrument. Contacts were made firm enough to prevent slipping of the rubber tip but not so
      firm as to load the spring, in consistence with customary clinical use of the instrument. The
      spring was then loaded by means of the instrument's trigger mechanism, and the impulse was
      delivered in an anterosuperior direction, over the posterolateral aspect of the vertebra on
      the right lamina-pedicle junction of C3.

      The sham manipulation to the right C3/C4 segment was administered using the same 'set-up' as
      for the manual manipulation; however, once the barrier was engaged, the head was
      re-positioned to neutral with no thrust applied. The control group individuals were
      positioned supine for the same twenty minutes as the other groups and they received no manual
      contact.
