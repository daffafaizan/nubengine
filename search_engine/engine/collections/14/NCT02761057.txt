    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To compare progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with metastatic papillary renal
      cell carcinoma (mPRCC) treated with sunitinib malate (sunitinib) to PFS in patients with
      mPRCC treated with MET kinase inhibitors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) response rate (RR;
      defined as the combined rate of confirmed and unconfirmed partial response [PR] and complete
      response [CR]) in patients with mPRCC treated with sunitinib to RR in patients treated with
      putative MET inhibitors.

      II. To compare overall survival (OS) in patients with mPRCC treated with sunitinib to OS in
      patients with mPRCC treated with putative MET inhibitors.

      III. To compare the safety profile of sunitinib and putative MET inhibitors in patients with
      mPRCC.

      TRANSLATIONAL OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the prognostic and predictive value of MET mutations, MET copy number or other
      markers of MET signaling in patients with mPRCC treated with putative MET inhibitors.

      II. To estimate the frequency of high oncometabolite levels in formalin-fixed,
      paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues of patients with advanced papillary renal cell carcinoma by
      liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and estimate progression free survival for
      those with and without high oncometabolite levels being treated.

      III. To correlate the mutational signature suggestive of a homologous recombination defect
      with high oncometabolite levels in patients with papillary renal cell carcinoma pRCC.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 treatment arms. As of 12/5/18, patients will only
      be randomized to Arm I or Arm II.

      ARM I: Patients receive sunitinib malate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28.

      ARM II: Patients receive cabozantinib s-malate PO QD on days 1-42.

      ARM III (CLOSED TO ACCRUAL 12/5/18): Patients receive crizotinib PO twice daily (BID) on days
      1-42.

      ARM IV (CLOSED TO ACCRUAL 12/5/18): Patients receive savolitinib PO QD on days 1-42.

      In all arms, cycles repeat every 42 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 3 years.
