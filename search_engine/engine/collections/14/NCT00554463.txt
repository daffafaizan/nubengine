      Primary

        -  To evaluate the safety and efficacy of filgrastim (G-CSF) in reducing grade 4
           neutropenia or grades 3-4 febrile neutropenia in patients with limited stage small cell
           lung cancer treated with radiotherapy and concurrent chemotherapy comprising cisplatin
           and etoposide.

      Secondary

        -  To evaluate the safety and efficacy of pegfilgrastim in reducing grade 4 neutropenia or
           grades 3-4 febrile neutropenia in patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy comprising
           cisplatin and etoposide.

        -  To estimate the incidence of dose modifications or treatment delays in patients treated
           with this regimen.

        -  To estimate the incidence of esophagitis, pneumonitis, and other non-hematological
           adverse events in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  To estimate the incidence of grade 4 thrombocytopenia in patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  To estimate the median and two-year rate of progression-free and overall survival of
           patients treated with this regimen.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 3 months for one year, every 6
      months for 2-3 years, and then annually for up to 5 years.
