      Infinitome, a program that utilizes data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) together
      with machine learning to analyze diffusion tensor and resting-state fMRI imaging data from
      remote sites. The foundation for this imaging tool is based upon the HCP atlas, which has
      also informed prior publications from our group, including the Connectomic Atlas of the Human
      Cerebrum (Baker, Burks, Briggs, Conner, et al. 2018). The Infinitome program creates a
      subject specific version of the Human Connectome Project Multimodal Parcellation (HCP-MMP1)
      atlas using diffusion tractography. Analytics are performed on both diffusion tensor imaging
      and rs-fMRI. Outlier detection using a tangent space connectivity matrix is performed by
      comparing results with a subset of 300 normal HCP subject fMRI samples to determine the range
      of normal correlations for each regions of interest in a large scale brain network which
      include:

        1. Locus coeruleus vs. Nucleus basalis of Meynert

        2. Locus coeruelus vs. Intralaminar nucleus of the thalamus

        3. Nucleus basalis of Meynert vs. Intralaminar nuclei of the thalamus

        4. FST in the vs. Area PH in the lateral occipital lobe

        5. Substantia nigra vs. Caudate nucleus Clinical Measures will be correlated with
           functional connectivity scores to identify relationship between clinical symptoms and
           large scale brain networks in DLB
