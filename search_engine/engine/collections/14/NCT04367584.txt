      Subjects with eligible criteria were included. Subjects were divided into subjects with
      inflammatory lesions and subjects with non inflammatory lesions.

      Physical examination consisted of assesment of AV severity (using Lehman criteria) and
      presence of pruritus based on visual analog scale. Clinical documetations were taken.

      Follicular content of four inflammatory lesions or four non inflammatory lesions were
      collected for microscopic examination with KOH solution and fungal culture examination (using
      CHROMagar Malassezia, Dextrose Saboraud agar (DSA), and Tween 60-esculin agar).

      The presence of Malassezia spp and its spore load in both groups were assesed and analyzed
      for its corelation with AV severity and presence of pruritus.
