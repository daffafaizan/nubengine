      fi rst time in Japan in 2001. The system has become established throughout the world for
      diagnostic and therapeutic small-bowel examinations, and it is now used universally in
      routine clinical work.

      Another balloon enteroscopy system was recently introduced in which only one balloon is
      attached at the tip of the overtube; the method is therefore known as SBE. SBE is a
      simplification of the double balloon method, and its value has already been confirmed for
      difficult colonoscopies. The question of whether similar results can be achieved with the
      single balloon method in the more complex situation of the small bowel has not yet been
      answered.
