    
      This is a Phase 3, 2-part, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group
      multicenter study of orally administered ivacaftor in subjects with cystic fibrosis (CF) 6 to
      11 years of age who have the G551D-CFTR mutation and a forced expiratory volume in 1 second
      (FEV1) between 90% and 105% predicted (using Knudson standards).

      Based on in vitro studies and pharmacologic, pharmacokinetic (PK), and safety profiles,
      ivacaftor was selected for clinical development as a possible treatment for patients with CF.
      Patients with the G551D mutation were the targeted population for this study because
      ivacaftor is a potentiator of the gating effect of the CFTR protein, and the most prevalent
      mutation with a gating defect in CF is the G551D mutation.

      This study was conducted in 2 parts. Part A was conducted to analyze the PK properties of
      ivacaftor and to determine the most appropriate dose to administer to subjects in Part B of
      this study. Part B explored the safety and efficacy of ivacaftor over long-term treatment in
      subjects 6 to 11 years of age.
