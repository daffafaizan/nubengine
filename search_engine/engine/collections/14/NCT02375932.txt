      complicated medical regimens. For these patients, diabetes management decisions and treatment
      goals must be addressed within the larger context of other competing health concerns. In
      parallel, clinical advances have led to a substantial increase in the number of tasks that
      primary care providers must perform during each visit. These twin trends present a formidable
      challenge to effective diabetes primary care. We hypothesize that among complex patients not
      meeting diabetes management goals, a web-based health IT tool to help patients explicitly
      prioritize all health issues (both related and unrelated to diabetes) and then submit these
      priorities directly into the electronic health record (EHR) for a scheduled visit with their
      primary care provider will result in more effective diabetes management over time. To test
      this hypothesis, we propose to design, implement, and evaluate in a randomized clinical trial
      a web-based tool linked to the EHR that will enable complex patients to easily define care
      priorities for their upcoming visit.
