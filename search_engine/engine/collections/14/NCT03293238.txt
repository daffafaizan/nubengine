      for intra-articular knee injections. Historically, a joint line (intercondylar) technique of
      injection at the medial or lateral joint line, reliant solely upon clinical palpation, has
      been the most popular approach among primary care and orthopedic providers. Newer approaches,
      making use of ultrasound visualization to accomplish access to the intercondylar recess and
      the anterolateral suprapatellar pouch, have gained in popularity. Because of uncertain
      accuracy with the traditional approach, this study is designed to determine if sonographic
      visualization combined with either of these two newer techniques improves accuracy and
      affects patient-oriented outcomes.
