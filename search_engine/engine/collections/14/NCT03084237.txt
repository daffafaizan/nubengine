    
      This is a Phase III, double-blind, randomized multicenter study to compare the efficacy and
      to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of HLX02 and European Union (EU)-sourced HerceptinÂ®
      in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive, recurrent or
      previously untreated metastatic breast cancer. Eligible patients will be assessed centrally
      for HER2 status and the presence of at least one measurable target lesion before
      randomization. Patients will undergo a tumor assessment for evaluation of response according
      to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) every 6 weeks up to
      24 weeks (regardless of the number of cycles actually given); thereafter, assessments will be
      done every 9 weeks (after Cycles 11, 14, and 17) or earlier in the case of clinical signs of
      progression.
