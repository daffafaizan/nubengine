    
      This is a phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, dose escalation
      and dose-expansion, study that will evaluate safety, PK, and POC-efficacy of IK-1001 in
      subjects undergoing on pump CABG surgery who are at an increased risk for I/R mediated tissue
      damage.

      Study subjects will undergo planned CABG surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. The study will
      be conducted in two parts. Part 1 of the study will involve the dose escalation to evaluate
      safety, PK, and preliminary efficacy of IK-1001. Up to 36 eligible subjects will be enrolled
      into the Part 1 portion and randomized to receive either placebo (n = 6) or IK-1001 (n = 30)
      at 6 dose escalating levels of 0.2, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.25, and 1.5 mg/kg/hr infusion for 6
      hours.

      The study drug administration will begin in the operating room after the induction of
      anesthesia and prior to the surgical incision.

      After safety, efficacy, and PK data have been evaluated in Part 1, the optimum dose will be
      determined and this dose will be expanded in Part 2. Initially up to 158 eligible subjects
      will be randomized to receive either IK-1001 or placebo at a 1:1 ratio. Part 2 aims to
      further establish safety, PK as well as POC efficacy.

      In the event that none of the 4 primary endpoints reach at least a 15% decline as compared
      with placebo, the Sponsor may decide to amend the protocol to explore a higher dose. After 6
      subjects have been dosed at this higher dose level, the data will be reviewed by the Sponsor
      or designee for safety and PK and the remaining subjects will then be enrolled. If the safety
      and PK data are favorable, the study will be completed at this higher dose level.
