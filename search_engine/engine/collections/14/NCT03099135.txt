      to 3 years to assess the long term durability of SVR achieved in one of the parent studies
      [phase 2 or 3 with AL-335 and Odalasvir (ODV) with or without Simeprevir (SMV]. In addition
      participants who failed to achieve an SVR in the parent study can be enrolled to assess the
      presence of resistance associated substitutions (RAS) and their persistance over time. It is
      expected that the vast majority of approximately 250 participants will enrolled in the study.
      Safety parameters and Liver disease status will be assessed in all participants over time.
