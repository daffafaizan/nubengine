        1. To evaluate the impact of Cómo tratar el estrés durante la quimioterapia on quality of
           life during chemotherapy relative to usual care only. Consistent with prior research,
           the investigators hypothesize that the intervention will result in better psychological
           and spiritual well-being and less anxiety, depression, and cancer-related distress.

        2. To investigate the mechanism by which Cómo tratar el estrés durante la quimioterapia
           improves quality of life during chemotherapy. Based on relevant theory and prior
           research, the investigators hypothesize that improvement in perceived self-efficacy in
           managing stress will explain beneficial effects of the intervention on quality of life
           outcomes.

        3. To examine whether communication and sociocultural factors associated with the
           acculturation process moderate the impact of Cómo tratar el estrés durante la
           quimioterapia on quality of life. Based on relevant theory and prior research, the
           investigators hypothesize that, among women who receive the intervention, those who have
           a stronger preference for communicating and receiving information in Spanish will
           benefit more.
