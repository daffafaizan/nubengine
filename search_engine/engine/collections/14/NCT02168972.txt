      ablation. Cardiac CT imaging, echocardiography and baseline 12-lead ECG will be performed
      pre-procedure for screening and health assessment. During the procedure the Globe catheter
      will be delivered via standard femoral vein access and transseptal puncture. Anatomical and
      electrophysiological mapping of the left atrium (LA) will be followed by RF ablation to
      achieve pulmonary vein isolation (PVI). Additional lesions will be created as deemed
      appropriate by the investigator. Intracardiac electrogram mapping will be used to confirm PVI
      during the procedure. Echocardiography will be performed at discharge to assess cardiac
      function. Electrocardiograms by 12-lead ECG and 7-day Holter monitoring will be recorded at
      discharge, and 3, 6 and 12 months after treatment. Follow-up assessments will be performed at
      discharge, 7 days, and 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after treatment, to track freedom from
      documented AF and adverse events. Subject-reported AF symptomology and quality of life will
      also be assessed during follow-up.
