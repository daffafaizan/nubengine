      factors include tumor differentiation and staging, along with patient gender, race, and
      socioeconomic status. The standard of care is radical chemoradiation with 5-fluorouracil and
      mitomycin C, with surgery reserved for salvage. Intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT)
      is a specialized radiotherapy technique that may be used for anal cancer. IMRT allows the
      radiation dose to conform to the three-dimensional shape of the target volume more than
      conventional two-dimensional techniques, and it may reduce treatment toxicities without
      compromising tumor control. At the Princess Margaret Hospital (PMH) since July 2007, IMRT for
      all treatment phases of radiotherapy has been implemented as standard treatment for patients
      with anal canal and perianal cancer.
