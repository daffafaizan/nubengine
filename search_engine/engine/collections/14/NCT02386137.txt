      patients who would not benefit from this treatment, thereby contributing to improved overall
      clinical outcomes. During ablathermy treatment lost of energy depend of tissue perfusion and
      thermic diffusion while energy laying depend of tissue absorption coefficient. Study these
      parameters before treatment could bring important information to the treatment difficulty and
      its efficacy. The investigators will study and compare fibroid perfusion with dynamic
      contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging and contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS). CEUS
      will be performed with contrast agent (SONOVUE). Thermic diffusion could be linked with
      fibroid stiffness. Fibroid stiffness will be quantified with velocity of shear wave measured
      by acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI). Tissue absorption coefficient is correlated with
      the architecture and the cellularity of the tissue so the investigators think that apparent
      diffusion coefficient (computed with diffusion weighted imaging) could be correlated with
      ablathermy efficiency and other intra procedural thermal parameters.
