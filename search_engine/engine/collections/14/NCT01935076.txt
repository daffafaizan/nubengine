      thought to modulate tissue development, proliferation, differentiation and function.
      Differential expression of certain placental miRNA's has been associated with preeclampsia.

      The fetal origins of adult disease hypothesis suggests that risk factors from intrauterine
      environmental exposures affect the fetus' development during sensitive periods, and increases
      the risk of specific diseases in adult life. Our aim is to understand factors that predispose
      fetuses to fetal overgrowth in utero, especially in women with obesity. The objective of the
      study is to identify miRNA which are differentially expressed in the placenta and cord blood
      of pregnancies that are affected by fetal macrosomia to determine factors that may predispose
      fetuses to fetal overgrowth.
