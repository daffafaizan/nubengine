      flexor carpi radialis approach for volar plating of distal radial fractures.

      From January 2011 to September 2012, 157 patients with distal radial fractures were allocated
      into group A (n=83) and B (n=74). Patients in group A were treated through a 1.5 to 2-cm long
      incision, and patients in group B were treated through the conventional flexor carpi radialis
      approach. All fractures were fixed with volar plates. Patients were assessed range of motion
      of the wrist, grip strength of the hand, and pronation strength of the wrist. Results were
      analyzed with the Statistical Package for Social Sciences 13.0. A P < 0.05 was statistically
      significant.
