      stage 2 (for patients younger than 45 years of age), 3 or 4 differentiated thyroid cancer.
      The primary objective is to assess progression free survival in this population. Sutent will
      be given orally at 37.5mg daily for two (2) year, or 26 cycles. Each treatment cycle will
      consist of 28 days. Upon treatment discontinuation, patients will be followed for survival.
      The frequency and type of survival follow-up assessments performed will be at the discretion
      of the treating physician.
