      I. Determine the antitumor activity of vorinostat (SAHA), in terms of objective response and
      progression rate, in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the safety and tolerability of this drug, in terms of toxicity profile, in these
      patients.

      II. Evaluate overall survival, progression-free survival, and survival rate at 12 months in
      patients treated with this drug.

      III. Correlate changes in biologic measurements with outcomes of patients treated with this
      drug.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral vorinostat (SAHA) twice daily on days 1-3, 8-10, 15-17, and 22-24.
      Courses repeat every 28 days for up to 52 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients may have the option of continuing treatment beyond 52 weeks
      at the discretion of the investigator.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed within 1 month and then
      approximately every 2 months thereafter.
