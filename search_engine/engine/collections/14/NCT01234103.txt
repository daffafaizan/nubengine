      participating in the experimental STI/UIP prevention intervention will: (a) have increased
      knowledge about the risk factors for and prevention of STIs, UIPs, alcohol and other
      substances, and intimate partner violence (IPV); (b) be more highly motivated to change risk
      behaviors associated with STIs and UIPs; (c) have higher levels of skills to prevent risk
      behaviors associated with STIs and UIPs and skills; (d) engage in more health promoting
      behaviors and fewer risk behaviors associated with STIs and UIPs, and (e) have fewer STIs and
      UIPs post-intervention compared with AIT solders who participate in a comparable control
      intervention focused on increasing healthy eating, maintaining physical fitness, and
      preventing fitness-related injuries.

      The overall goal of this research is to evaluate the effectiveness a cognitive-behavioral
      skills-building intervention to prevent risk for and acquisition of STIs and UIPs and will
      seek to reduce a number of their associated risk factors including, alcohol misuse, other
      substance use, IPV in AIT soldiers. Specifically, we will evaluate whether AIT soldiers who
      participate in the experimental intervention entitled, Staying Safe and in Control:
      Increasing Knowledge and Building Skills to Prevent Sexually Transmitted Infections and
      Unintended Pregnancies will reduce their risk for and acquisition of STIs, UIPs and their
      associated sexual and substance use behaviors compared with AIT soldiers who undergo the
      control intervention entitled, Fit You: Practical Tools for Healthy Eating, Physical Fitness,
      and Injury Prevention. This intervention will focus primarily on promoting healthy eating,
      maintaining physical fitness, and preventing work-related and exercise injury.
