      related mortality in HSCT patients. Interventions to improve GI microbial diversity could be
      beneficial to this patient population. Diets rich in prebiotics have been shown to increase
      gut microbial diversity and improve symptoms in other gastrointestinal diseases. Prebiotics
      are non-digestible carbohydrates that promote growth of commensal organisms in the gut by
      providing nutrition. Some examples are brown rice, green apples, and tomatoes. Our theory is
      that consuming a diet rich in prebiotics pre- and during the first 100 days following HSCT
      will help to reduce acute graft versus host disease (aGVHD) overall, and specifically acute
      GI GVHD, and clostridium difficile (C.Diff). Participants will be encouraged to eat at least
      2 servings of a prebiotic-rich food from time of admission for HSCT through 100 days
      following HSCT and will be clinically monitored, including for acute GVHD, acute GI GVHD and
      C.Diff. Stool samples will be collected from all participants about once every 4 weeks.
