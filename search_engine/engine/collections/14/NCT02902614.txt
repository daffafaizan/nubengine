      cell mass as it can decrease the quality of embryo and its structural composition. However,
      recommendation for collection from the trophectoderm (TE) side is indicated.

      Absence of differentiation during cleavage-stage or morula stage at day 3 and day 4
      respectively, will present the needful to focus a specific location for embryo biopsy during
      pre-blastocyst stages for embryo going to do genetic testing before implantation or embryo
      transfer.

      In articulation around the second polar body or the animal pole of embryo, collection of the
      cell from the vegetal pole in crospondence to avoide collection form the animal pole is to be
      compare the results of implantation for biopsy done using the animal pole side or the random
      non organized biosy procedure.
