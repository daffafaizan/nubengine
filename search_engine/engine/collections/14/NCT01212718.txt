      CRC with the presence of a reference lesion two-dimensional measurable and accessible for a
      biopsy.The biopsy was taken from the reference lesion either by surgery during primary tumor
      resection, by trans-cutaneous true-cut needle biopsy or by trans-anal approach. Intratumoral
      relative TS mRNA expression levels were determined using samples shipped in RNA-preserving
      solution or as glass slides after microdissection of tumor cells. An independent company
      stratified the patients according to ther relative TS mRNA expression level in TS low and TS
      high followed by randomization to receive either FUFA of Folfiri. Response to chemotherapy
      was evaluated and documented according to the RECIST criteria after every therapy cycle.
