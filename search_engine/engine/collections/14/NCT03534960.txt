      matching patient's peak flow, allows accurate delivery of the set FiO2 throughout the whole
      inspiratory phase.The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of hign-flow nasal
      therapy on pediatric hypercapnic respiratory failure by comparing with nasal continuous
      positive airway pressure
