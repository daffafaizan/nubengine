      of ischemic heart disease and new diagnosis (at transthoracic echocardiography) of left
      ventricular dilation.

      All patients will undergo coronary artery angiography. To be enrolled, it is necessary to
      have the absence of significant coronary artery stenosis (angiographic evaluation of the
      lesion >40%) in all the vessels (main and side branch).

      The Authors will proceed to perform the evaluation of the index of microvascular resistance
      (IMR). The target vessel will be the left anterior descending artery.

      An intracoronary pressure/temperature sensor-tipped guidewire will be used. Thermodilution
      curves will be obtained during maximal hyperemia. The IMR will be calculated from the ratio
      of the mean distal coronary pressure at maximal hyperemia to the inverse of mean hyperemic
      transit time.
