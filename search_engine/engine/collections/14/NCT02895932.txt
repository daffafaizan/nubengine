      problems with thinking and memory. Abnormal accumulation within in the brain of a protein
      called amyloid is felt to contribute to impaired thinking and memory in PD. Excessive
      accumulation of this protein is also involved in Alzheimer disease (AD) and may influence
      thinking and memory in otherwise healthy older people. Recent evidence suggests that changes
      in the amount of another brain chemical, serotonin, influences the amount of amyloid
      accumulating in the brains of people with PD and otherwise healthy older people. The purpose
      of this study is to determine if changes in brain serotonin affects the accumulation of
      amyloid in the brain. The investigators use brain imaging methods to measure the amount of
      serotonin and amyloid in the brain of individuals with PD and otherwise healthy older people.
      PD participants will undergo repeat brain imaging to assess amyloid accumulation 2 years
      after their first brain imaging session. All participants will undergo examinations to assess
      their motor function, and asked questions to assess their mood and thinking.
