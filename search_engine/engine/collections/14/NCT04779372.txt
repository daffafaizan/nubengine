      CBTI treatment before for chronic insomnia will be recruited and followed for 6 weeks.
      Participants will be random allocation into Group dCBT-I and Group Sleep Education, and then
      explore the clinical effectiveness of smartphone-based digital CBT-I therapy. We will collect

      employment, living and residential status, demographic data, smoking and alcohol consumption,
      body mass index (BMI); medical history and medication status and adverse reactions during
      treatment. Primary outcome is the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). Secondary outcomes include
      an online sleep diary measured information regarding: time in bed(TIB), total sleep time
      (TST), sleep efficiency (SE), total wake time(TWT); bracelet measured information regarding:
      total sleep time (TST), sleep latency(SL), sleep efficiency (SE), the times of wake from
      sleep(TWS), sleep quality score setting by bracelet; the 16-item Dysfunctional Beliefs and
      Attitudes about Sleep Scale (DBAS-16); Fatigue Severity Scale(FSS); Health-related Quality of
