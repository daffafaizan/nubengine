      annual toll of losses includes about 3 million stillbirths and 3.8 million neonatal deaths:
      half die on the first day of life.1,2 The top ten countries with highest neonatal death rate
      are India, Nigeria, Pakistan, China, DR Congo, Ethopia, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Afghanistan
      and Sudan. These countries encompass 67% and 63% of the global total with 1.5 million
      neonatal deaths and 1.77 million stillbirths.3 Pakistan is the country with the highest
      stillbirth rate of 43.1 stillbirths per 1000 total births when compared to a global estimate
      of 18.4 in 2015.4 The most common condition associated with stillbirth is SGA, conventionally
      defined as a fetus with birth weight below 10th centile of its gestational age.5,6 SGA
      accounts for 30% of total stillbirths, perinatal mortality being highest if remain undetected
      before birth or when the birth weight is below the 3rd centile.7,8 One of the key strategy to
      prevent stillbirth is prediction and recognition of growth restricted fetuses. Experts have
      reached to consensus to use 32 weeks as a cutoff to define early and late onset growth
      restriction.9 Early onset growth restricted fetuses have highl association with pre-eclampsia
      and angiogenic disbalance and can be predicted in about 90% of cases by incorporating
      maternal risk factors, uterine artery dopplers and angiogenic factors. Whereas late onset
      FGR, using SGA as a proxy, remains unpredicted even after combining maternal characteristics,
      risk factors, blood pressure records, second trimester biometry and uterine artery dopplers
      (43.3% DR for 10% false positive rate).10 Late onset SGA with high prevalence around 10% are
      associated with non-evident placental disease, resulting in clinical challenge in its
      detection and diagnosis. Late onset SGA if remains undetected are at increased risk of
      perinatal mortality (25-48% of non-anomalous stillbirths)5 and morbidity including fetal
      distress, acidosis and admissions in neonatal intensive unit.11,12 Adverse long-term health
      outcomes including type 2 diabetes, obesity and coronary heart disease are also associated
      with late onset SGA.13,14,15 Unfortunately, the burden of small for gestational age births is
      concentrated in South Asia, with prevalence of about 41.5%.16 To date, the research done in
      Pakistan on small for gestational age fetus is sparse. The limited data quotes the incidence
      of small for gestational age babies between 3-10% and accounts for 18% of stillbirths.17,18
      One of the key objectives of antenatal care aiming at improving neonatal outcomes includes
      recognition of risk factors, detection of growth restricted babies, longitudinal surveillance
      and deciding the best time to deliver them. Six national guidelines on SGA by authorized
      bodies of United Kingdom (RCOG)7, United States of America (ACOG)19, Ireland (Health service
      Executive)20, Canada (Society of Obstetrician and gynecologist of Canada)21, New Zealand (New
      Zealand Maternal Fetal medicine Network)22 and France (French College of Obstetrician and
      Gynecologist)23 have a general consensus on first trimester booking screening for risk
      factors of SGA and classifying woman into either high risk or low risk group. Risk factors
      for SGA, requiring increased surveillance include maternal age > 40 years, cocaine abuse,
      maternal or paternal SGA, previous history of SGA or still birth, chronic hypertension,
      diabetes with vascular disease, renal impairment, PAPPA < 0.4 mom, echogenic bowel and
      heaving bleeding similar to menses.24 All bodies except US recommends use of Aspirin from 16
      weeks onward in all woman categorized as High risk. There is unanimous agreement on
      surveillance with serial growth scans and umbilical artery dopplers. However, 4 national
      bodies (RCOG, Health service Executive of Ireland, French College of Obstetrician and
      Gynecologist & New Zealand Maternal Fetal medicine Network) recommends use of plotting EFW on
      customized charts whereas, ACOG & SOGC does not specify EFW charts.24 For low risk woman the
      antenatal screening practice comprises of fundal height measurements. All international
      guidelines recommend a tape measure for fundal height measurement. Three guidelines (RCOG,
      Health service Executive of Ireland and New Zealand Maternal Fetal medicine Network)7,20,22
      advocates serial plotting of fundal height measurements on customized charts whereas, two
      guidelines (ACOG & SOGC)19,21 recommends use of McDonalds rule and suspects suboptimal growth
      when the fundal height measurement is > 3cm less than the gestational age in weeks. A single
      RCT did not show any significant difference between palpation and fundal height measurements
      in detection of SGA.25 A meta-analysis published in 2013 concluded symphysiofundal height
      unsuitable as a primary screening method for detection of SGA and LBW, with 60% DR for SGA
      for a false positive rate of 15%. The meta analysis comprised of 46 mostly hospital-based
      studies, which may be a source of bias in concluding results. For prediction of LBW there was
      no statistical difference between the pooled sensitivity and specificity (p=0.15 and 0.96,
      respectively) of cohort verses case control studies and between prospective and retrospective
      studies for prediction of SGA. Whereas, for prediction of SGA there was also no statistical
      difference between the pooled sensitivity and specificity (p=0.26 and 0.65, respectively) of
      cohort verses case control studies and on the contrary the prospective studies decreased the
      pooled sensitivity (0.85 verses 0.89; p=0.00) in comparison to retrospective studies.26 A
      prospective cohort study concluded that by Incorporating a third trimester scan to fundal
      height measurements in low risk woman the detection rate for SGA can increase to 57%, whereas
      selective use detected only 20% of SGA.27 On the contrary, all national guidelines do not
      recommend routine third trimester scan for detection of SGA.7,19,20,21,22,23 The concept of
      customized or GROW charts by Gardosi et al is based on the principles: 1. physiological
      variables that impact fetal growth (maternal ethnicity, height, weight and parity) 2.
      Excluding pathological conditions like diabetes, hypertension and smoking.28 Use of GROW
      charts derived from uncomplicated pregnancies delineating estimated weight for a given
      gestation. Gardosi et al reported the likelihood of detecting SGA by using standardized
      fundal height measurement alone when plotted on a customized chart to 47.9% in contrary to
      29.2% with conventional symphysis-fundal height measurement without increasing the
      utilization of ultrasound scans.29 In 2013, the Perinatal institute of UK introduced Growth
      assessment Protocol (GAP). GAP training encompasses of (1) staff training supported by
      theoretical and practical e-learning modules, (2) clinical application of evidence based
      guidelines including risk assessment, investigation and surveillance of fetal growth (3)
      training and bringing accuracy in measuring and plotting fundal height on customized growth
      charts (4) serial auditing to record process and outcome indicators and (5) audit of missed
      cases to explore the reason of not being detected antenatally.30 This program has been
      associated with increased detection rate of SGA and reduction in perinatal mortality.31 Based
      on this evidence and Royal College of Obstetrician & Gynecologist recommendation, the GAP
      program has been implemented in 80% of hospital trusts across UK. Recently a 10-year
      population-based cohort study was conducted to evaluate effect of implementation of GAP
      program and reduction in stillbirths in UK. Data of 6,561,560 births from 133 units in
      England was analyzed and still birth rates were calculated and compared between non-GAP (39
      units or 29.3%), partial GAP (29 units or 21.8%) and Complete GAP (65 units or 48.9%)
      implementation units. There was an overall reduction in the stillbirth rate from 5.11/1000 to
      4.18/1000, with reduction in still birth rate among all the three groups. However, the cross
      sectional comparison between the two group showed a 9% lower still birth rate among GAP units
      along with greater fall in stillbirth rate (24%) when compared to the than the non-GAP
      units.32 GAP program when adopted outside UK, in The Royal women's Hospital, Melbourne,
      resulted in doubled detection rate of SGA from 21% to 41% without increase in false positive
      rate.33 Similarly, results of another non-randomized, quasi controlled, pre and posttest
      designed study found doubling (24.8% to 50.6%) in detection rate of SGA after plotting serial
      FH on customized charts as an intervention.34 A prospective observational study to determine
      the diagnostic effectiveness of customized charts for identification of fetal growth patterns
      concluded that serial SFH measurements has a positive likelihood ratio of 4.7 for the
      detection of SGA.35 To date, all the published research demonstrating the effectiveness of
      GAP program are non-randomized, prospective cohorts, pre and post implementation designed.
      Therefore, making it impossible to determine whether it's the diagnostic effectiveness of the
      customized chart alone or it's the GAP bundle comprising of staff education, training and
      change in protocol resulting in increased detection rate of SGA. It is comprehensively
      established that the best evidence is derived by RCT and so is highlighted in the Cochrane
      review36. To the best of investigators knowledge no randomized controlled trial has been
      published to compare the diagnostic effectiveness of serial standardized fundal height
      measurements on a customized chart with the conventional method. This study would also help
      us to establish the role customized charts as a screening tool for detection of SGA
      especially in low resourced countries. It can play a pivotal role, being in expensive,
      noninvasive for detection of SGA in developing countries with high perinatal morbidity and
      mortality.
