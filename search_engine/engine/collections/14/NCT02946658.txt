      time. Attempted therapy include smoking cessation, vaccinations, respiratory rehabilitation,
      and attempts of use of bronchodilators and steroids. Many resort to supplemental oxygen
      therapy, lung transplantation, and antibiotic supportive therapy during exacerbations.

      As of 2013, COPD involve approximately 5% pf the global populations (approximately 330
      million). Most commonly it occurs approximately equally between men/women and result in about
      3 million deaths per year. Estimates of economic costs are estimated to be more than 2.1
      trillion dollars in 2010.

      This study includes microcannula harvesting of subdermal adipose tissues, incubation,
      digestion and isolation of AD-cSVF. This stromal cellular pellet (without actual
      extracellular matrix or stromal elements) is then suspended in 500 cc sterile Normal Saline
      (NS) and deployed via peripheral intravenous route. Evaluations of safety issues are measured
      at intervals (both severe and non-severe categories) and by repeated pulmonary function
      studies.
