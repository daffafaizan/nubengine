      850 of each). In the original study, women were enrolled and interviewed while in the
      hospital for delivery, their blood was drawn, and anthropometric measurements were performed
      on their newborn male infants.

      The follow-up will be done primarily to determine the number of months that the mother breast
      feeds her child. Secondary endpoints will be infant infection as reported by the mother, and
      child growth as determined by measurement of height and weight and related measures (none in
      the genital region, as in the original study). Breast feeding duration, infections, and
      growth may be related to exposure to the DDT metabolite, DDE.

      The follow-up visits will be every three months from 6 to 18 months after birth, and study
      nurses will visit subjects in their home. For some subjects, there would be fewer follow-up
      visits, due to study scheduling or breastfeeding cessation.

      Mothers would be interviewed and mothers and children will undergo standard anthropometric
      assessments. This protocol does not call for collection of biologic specimens and poses
      minimal risk to subjects.
