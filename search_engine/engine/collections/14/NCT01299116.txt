      injectable contraception will be offered an opportunity to try LARC instead; the FDA-approved
      options include two types of intrauterine products and one type of subdermal contraceptive
      implant. Over a 24-month period, the experiences of LARC users will be compared to the
      experiences of those opting for their initial short-acting method. It is expected that 38% of
      the participants using short-acting methods will stop using them during the first year and be
      at risk of unintended pregnancy. In contrast, less than 20% of LARC users will want to have
      their contraceptive removed. Continuation rates will be measured and pregnancies will be
      tallied in the two groups to document any differences that emerge.
