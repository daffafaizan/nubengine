      progression-free survival of patients with metastatic kidney cancer treated with
      anti-angiogenic agents (Sunitinib or Pazopanib) in comparison with two untreated cohorts
      (localized or oligometastatic cancer).

      Prospective monocenter, open-label study

      In the frame of disease management blood samples will be collected at different times of
      follow-up regarding disease status (localized, oligometastatic and metastatic) and tissue
      samples will be collected for patients scheduled for surgery.
