      compression and burst fractures that are not indicated for surgical fixation. Currently,
      these patients are treated non-operatively through brace wear which is either custom made for
      the patient or is off-the-shelf pending location of the fracture and surgeon preference. All
      braces are through the currently contracted orthotics company. As they are non stocked in
      house, waiting for the brace requires the patients to remain on "strict spine precautions"
      (flat bed rest in a Miami J collar, no pillows behind the head, and logrolls for turning) for
      anywhere from 24-48 hours. No only is this incredibly uncomfortable for the patient, it is
      also extending their hospital stay for at least one day and, sometimes, up to three as they
      wait for the brace and have it adjusted to fit appropriately. The patient's all have to then
      wait to work with physical therapy and occupational therapy and, finally, have upright spine
      films taken in the brace. The braces tend to be very uncomfortably and constricting for
      patient's and significantly inhibit their daily lives. The investigators are proposing that
      these fractures can be treated without needing bracewear and will have equivalent to superior
      outcomes than results while wearing the brace.
