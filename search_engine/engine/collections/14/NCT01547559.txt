      gastroenterological lesions prevent patients get benefits from continuing taking NSAIDs. HP
      is another important factor that increase gastroenterological lesions. Both HP and NSAIDs
      increase risk of peptic ulcers, however, no exact relation between these two factors has been
      found. It is important to evaluate the protective effects of eradication of HP in
      NSAIDs-taking patients. In many countries ,PPI is recommended as maintain treatment in
      NSAIDs-taking patients to prevent gastroenterological lesions. A multicenter, open-label,
      randomized, parallel-group study is needed to prove the effects of Teprenone as a replacer of
      PPI in maintain treatment.On the other hand, Small-intestinal mucosal injuries induced by
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are common. However, there are still no
      effective and reliable interventions established. Geranylgeranylacetone (GGA) is a mucosal
      protective agent, so we develop an additional trail to clarify the discrepancies of GGA
      effects on NSAIDs-induced small-intestinal mucosal injuries.
