      symptoms is unclear. CO2 conversion to protons may play a key role in the mechanism for
      heartburn sensation. This is a prospective, randomized study that will help further explore
      the mechanism for heartburn sensation in GERD patients and can be a prelude for further
      studies examining the role of new class antireflux agents such as carbonic anhydrase
      inhibitors in the treatment of patients with heartburn.
