      Ticagrelor (standard recommended dose for ACS - 90 mg BID), did not experience any clinical
      or adverse event during this time period and are about to discontinue Ticagrelor. We intend
      to measure the platelet reactivity for each patient on 4 time points - prior to cessation of
      Ticagrelor (i.e. while still on DAPT) and 1,4 and 12 weeks post discontinuation of therapy.
      There will not be a control group.
