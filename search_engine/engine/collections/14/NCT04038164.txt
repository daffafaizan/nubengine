      and adolescents with FASD. The investigators conducted a randomized, rater-blinded,
      controlled pilot trial in a cohort of 33 children and adolescents with FASD. Participants
      were randomly assigned either to DAT group (n=17) or Treatment as Usual (TAU control group)
      (n=16). The investigators evaluated changes on social skills, internalized and externalized
      symptomatology and on severity of FASD symptoms at pre-treatment and post-treatment.
