      offered treatment using direct acting antiviral agents. The aim of the initiative, besides
      offering cure to patients, is to substantially reduce domestic transmission of HCV and
      thereby lower the incidence. Ultimately, with these intense efforts the long-term
      complications of chronic HCV infection could potentially be nearly eliminated. In Iceland,
      there is mandatory reporting of all new cases of hepatitis C to the State Epidemiologist.

      In the study, short term and long term outcomes of this initiative will be investigated. In
      an initial treatment phase which will last for up to three years, all patients diagnosed with
      hepatitis C in Iceland will be offered treatment with direct acting antiviral agents.
      Virological response rate and compliance will be monitored. Long term, the incidence of HCV
      infection acquired in Iceland will be monitored for up to 15 years, and the incidence rates
      of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma due to HCV will be monitored for up to 15 years.
