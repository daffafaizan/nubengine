      and versus maximum daily pedometer-recorded distance will be similarly studied. The aim of
      the study is also to search for variables associated with progression free survival. The
      relationships between pedometer data and self-reported dyspnea variation will be studied.
      Factorial analysis may be used to study the overall view of variable correlations and patient
      similarity/dissimilarity.
