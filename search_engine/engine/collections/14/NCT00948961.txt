    
      NY-ESO-1 is a protein that is often made by some types of tumor cells, but only made by a few
      types of normal cells. Because it is primarily made by cancer cells, the NY-ESO-1 protein is
      a promising target against which to stimulate an immune response that may destroy cancer
      cells. CDX-1401 is a cancer vaccine that is specially designed to create this type of immune
      response. To enhance the immune response, CDX-1401 will be given with 1 or 2 immune
      stimulants called Resiquimod and poly-ICLC (Hiltonol).

      This clinical trial includes Phase 1 and Phase 2 segments. During the Phase 1 segment, six
      groups of 6 to 24 patients will be treated with different dose levels of CDX-1401 in
      combination with either one or both of the immune stimulants (Resiquimod and/or poly-ICLC).
      This phase of the study will test the safety profile of the vaccine treatment, and will
      assess which dose to test in future studies. During the Phase 2 segment, 14 patients whose
      cancer tested positive for the NY-ESO-1 protein in laboratory testing, will receive the study
      treatment to determine if it has an effect on their cancer. All patients enrolled in either
      part of the study may continue to receive study treatment until their disease has progressed
      or until it is necessary to stop the treatment for safety or other reasons. In addition, all
      patients will be "followed" for 24 months after enrollment in order to collect survival
      information.
