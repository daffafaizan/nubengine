      of Cues (ROC), which is based on Schachter's Externality Theory. The ROC program targets two
      theorized mechanisms for overeating in Schachter's Theory; decreased sensitivity to
      appetitive cues and increased sensitivity to external food cues. Considering that BWL has
      merit for some people, but fails to facilitate maintenance, this study will compare ROC, BWL,
      ROC+BWL combined and an active comparator (AC). The investigators will recruit
      overweight/obese adults and will assess them at baseline, mid-treatment (month 6),
      post-treatment (month 12), mid-follow-up (month 18) and follow-up (month 24). Assessments
      will include body mass index (BMI), body composition, and binge eating over the course of
      treatment and follow-up. This study will contribute to the study of basic behavioral
      mechanisms and food intake, could provide a novel model for the treatment of obesity, and
      could inform clinical decision making regarding obesity treatment.
