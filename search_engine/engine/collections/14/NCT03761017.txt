      maximum tolerated/administered dose (MTD/MAD) of MGD019. Dose escalation will occur in a
      3+3+3 design in patients with advanced solid tumors of any histology. Once the MTD/MAD is
      determined, a Cohort Expansion Phase will be enrolled to further characterize safety and
      initial anti-tumor activity in patients with specific tumor types anticipated to be sensitive
      to dual checkpoint blockade.
