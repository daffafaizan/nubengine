      can be partly explained by the complexity of reeducation programs to implement and by
      organization issues. Moreover, to our knowledge, no study has demonstrated the benefit of
      such programs on secondary prevention of osteoporotic fractures, even though falls prevention
      is needed. Our objective is to demonstrate with a pilot study the feasibility of a falls
      secondary prevention program, based on a rheumatology (GHPSJ) and reeducation wards (HÃ´pital
      Sainte-Marie Paris : HSMP) collaboration. Considering the innovative nature of both this
      program and this collaboration, a feasibility study is preferable before conducting a larger
      multicentric study, evaluating locomoter benefits of this program in comparison with usual
      primary care.
