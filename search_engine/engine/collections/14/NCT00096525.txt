      Primary

        -  Determine the best response in patients with advanced or unresectable renal cell cancer
           treated with lenalidomide (CC-5013).

        -  Determine the time to disease progression in patients treated with this drug.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the safety of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

      Patients receive oral lenalidomide (CC-5013) once daily on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 30 days and then every 3 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-25 patients will be accrued for this study.
