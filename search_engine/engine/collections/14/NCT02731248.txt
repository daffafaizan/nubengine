      still presents an important clinical challenge. Most defects are amenable to intervention but
      timely diagnosis (ie, before presentation with cardiovascular collapse or death) is crucial.
      In high-income countries, examination and, increasingly, antenatal ultrasound have formed the
      basis of screening, but test accuracy of these procedures is variable and many babies with
      critical congenital heart defects are discharged before diagnosis. Pulse oximetry screening
      of newborn infants increases early detection of critical congenital heart disease and
      minimises the risk of circulatory collapse before surgery. This study provides an update on
      the implementation of pulse oximetry screening in Turkey
