      transient ischemic attack, myocardial infarction, unstable angina, percutaneous coronary
      angiography, thromboembolism, and death caused by cardiovascular disease.

      Secondary Outcomes: Platelet aggregation induced by collagen and arachidonic acid, serum
      thromboxane B2, urine 11-dehydrothromboxane B2, platelet thrombus formation under flow
      conditions (sub-study only at the National Cardiovascular Center)

      The primary objective of this study is to determine the markers for aspirin resistance. To
      achieve this objective, platelet aggregation, serum thromboxane B2, and urine
      11-dehydrothromboxane B2 are measured in patients receiving usual therapeutic doses of
      aspirin, who experienced acute coronary syndrome, cerebral infarction, or transient ischemic
      attack occurred in a period between the past 1 month and the past 2 years. This is a
      multi-center, prospective study.
