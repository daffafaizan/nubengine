      assessment and intervention tools. With the growing understanding of cognitive recovery
      following stroke, rehabilitation specialists are optimistic that appropriate rehabilitation
      interventions may optimize and enhance functional outcomes. The use of technology based
      assessments via video games may assist in a patient's cognitive recovery. Design and
      development of an evidence-based game approach will enhance the investigators understanding
      and usability of electronic tools to measure cognitive and sensorimotor abilities. There is
      no intervention only an assessment for usability.
