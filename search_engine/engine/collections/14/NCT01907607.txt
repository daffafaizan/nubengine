    
      Medical Conditions : Adult patients with Advanced Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors Refractory
      to Imatinib and Sunitinib

      Study design : Exploratory, one-arm, multicenter, phase II clinical trial based on two-stage
      Simon's design

      Main objective : To assess the antitumor activity of PD-0332991 in terms of non-progression
      at 16 weeks (after centralized review) in patients with documented disease progression while
      on therapy with imatinib and sunitinib for unresectable and/or metastatic GIST.

      Secondary objectives

        -  To assess the antitumor activity of PD-0332991 in terms of :

             -  Objective response rate (ORR) (as per RECIST v1.1 criteria)

             -  Progression-free survival (PFS) (as per RECIST v1.1 criteria)

             -  Overall survival

        -  To assess the safety of PD-0332991

      Study drug formulation: PD-0332991 is formulated as gelatin capsules of 100 mg and 25 mg
      respectively. PD-0332991 was administrated orally. PD-0332991 dosed on a flat scale of 125
      mg. PD-0332991 was administrated on a 21 days on / 7 days off dosing schedule. One cycle was
      considered to consist of 4 weeks of PD-0332991 administration.Patients were treated with
      PD-0332991 until progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity, death or discontinuation for
      any other reason.

      Tumor assessment and response assessed according to RECIST v1.1, with same type of exam in
      regard of baseline.

      All potential sites of tumor lesions (target and non-target lesions) assessed using MRI or CT
      Scan with IV contrast of the Thorax Abdomen and Pelvis using a 5mm slice thickness with a
      contiguous reconstruction algorithm (a PET scan is not acceptable for radiological
      evaluation).

      Evaluation were assessed:

        -  at baseline within 21 days before the first dose of PD-0332991

        -  at D(28) of Cycle 1, at D(28) of Cycle 2 then every 8 weeks until month six and then
           every 12 weeks until disease progression or starting other treatment.

      Response regarding the first endpoint was assessed by central radiology review. Whenever the
      criteria of response are met (Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR)), the
      appropriate imaging tests were repeated at least four weeks later in order to confirm the
      response.

      The decision regarding patient management remained with the local investigator.

      optionnal: Fresh tumor biopsies FFPE (Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded) at screening and at
      Day 21 of Cycle 1 are encouraged to be collected. Once collected, the samples may be profiled
      by IHC, and array gene expression analysis
