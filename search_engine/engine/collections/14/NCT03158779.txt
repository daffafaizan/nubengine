    
      The aim of this prospective mono-institutional phase II study is to assess the efficacy and
      safety of sequentially integrated treatment of FOLFIRINOX or Gemcitabine-Abraxane and SBRT
      with a total dose of 54 Gy in 6 fractions of 9 Gy /fractions in patients with locally
      unresectable pancreatic cancer.

      Primary endpoint is to evaluate overall survival (OS); the overall survival time will be
      calculated from the start of chemotherapy to death. Secondary end points are to evaluate
      acute and late toxicities, freedom from local progression (FFLP) and progression
      free-survival (PFS). Acute and late toxicities will be scored according to the NCI Common
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v3.0. Local progression will be defined
      according to RECIST criteria. Time to toxicity and time to local or distant progression will
      be defined from the start of chemotherapy.

      Technical success will be defined as the ability to implant at least 2 fiducials in the tumor
      area. Migration will be defined as a change in inter-fiducial distance. Clinical success will
      be defined as the ability to guide the application of SBRT by using the fiducials. Any
      adverse event will be recorded (acute pancreatitis, clinically relevant upper GI bleeding
      requiring blood transfusion, abscesses in the area of the fiducials, sepsis).
