    
      Part 1 will evaluate the pharmacokinetics of single doses of 4 test formulations of LEO 32731
      compared with a reference formulation. Part 2 will evaluate the effect of food on the
      pharmacokinetics of selected test formulations of LEO 32731. Part 3 will evaluate the
      tolerability and safety of selected test formulations of LEO 32731 after multiple dosing.

      Based on data from Part 1, up to 3 formulations will be taken forward to Part 2. If none of
      the formulations are considered appropriate to take forward to Part 2, the trial will stop
      after Part 1. Similarly, based on data from Part 2, up to 2 formulations will be taken
      forward to Part 3. If none of the formulations are considered appropriate to take forward to
      Part 3, the trial will stop after Part 2.
