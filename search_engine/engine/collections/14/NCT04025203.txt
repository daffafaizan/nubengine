    
      The present randomized clinical trial will perform a comparison of the pain reduction effects
      produced by the application of a non invasive and non pharmacological median nerve neural
      mobilization (physiotherapy treatment), to those effects produced by an oral ibuprofen
      arginine pharmacological treatment, an oral gabapentin pharmacological treatment and the lack
      of treatment in subjects diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome. Additionally, effects over
      the functionality of the affected upper limb will be evaluated and compared. Subjects will be
      invited to participate and randomly allocated to 4 different groups.
