      scores (UPDRS) or improved memory/fluency cognitive testing, there are gaps in knowledge of
      the time course and mechanisms of reported outcomes. Furthermore, only a standard ketogenic
      diet was studied while there are variations such as MCT oil supplementation shown to increase
      keto-induction, and other adaptations may improve tolerability and micronutrient content. It
      is the goal of this proposed inpatient metabolic study to address the initial question of
      effect size and time course of ketosis. If suggestive of benefit in PD, this pilot study may
      lead to a subsequent larger study of long-term feasibility and effects on disease biomarkers
      and disease progression, which might also compare alternate diets of interest in PD such as
      Mediterranean diet. Thus, a pilot feasibility study is proposed, targeting retention rate
      >80% and adherence in the outpatient setting. Recruitment of 32 participants is based upon
      power analysis of secondary outcome, testing the Timed Up & Go mobility test that has
      reported validity in fall prediction, additionally plotting continuous and serially repeated
      direct/indirect ketosis measurements and motor as well as non-motor symptoms / exploratory
      disease biomarkers. It is hypothesized that, compared to a non-ketogenic healthy diet
      (low-fat diet), ketogenic diet supplemented by MCT oil (MCT-KD) will improve mobility tested
      by Timed Up & Go (TUG), as well as akinesia, tremor, and memory/executive function tasks, and
      will reduce motor and nonmotor fluctuations within the acute period of keto-induction and
      early ketogenic timepoints due to improved mitochondrial function and neurotransmitter
      synthesis.

      The primary objective is to test the hypothesis that nutritional ketosis (NK) supplemented by
      MCT oil in a PD cohort (MCT-KD) is feasible for a duration of three weeks. The secondary
      objective is to show that NK improves PD symptomatology in cognition (improved attention,
      recall, and executive function), mobility (TUG), and motor function (bradykinesia, akinesia
      and tremor) to a greater extent than a standard, low fat diet (LFD) within three weeks.
