      complications rate is even higher. One of the commons complications is incisional hernia,
      reaching up to 40%- 50% of cases in High risk groups.

      Prophylactic mesh use has been proved to be useful preventing midline laparotomy in elective
      surgery. Despite this, there is not enough data to recommend its use in emergency surgery.

      Aim of the study is to investigate if use of an algorithm of informed decision for use of
      prophylactic mesh in emergency midline laparotomy reduces incisional hernia incidence.

      Prospective cohort study of all consecutive midline laparotomy performed at our emergency
      surgery department. Compare correct application of algorithm outcomes versus non correct
      application.
