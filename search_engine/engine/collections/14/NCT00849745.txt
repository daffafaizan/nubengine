        -  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE): SLE can involve virtually any organ system, but most
           commonly involves various combinations of arthritis, dermatitis, glomerulonephritis,
           central nervous system manifestations and hematologic complications. Although the
           overall five and ten-year survival rates in SLE are 86% and 80%, respectively, these
           rates are reduced to 60% and 50%, respectively, in patients with poor prognosis SLE
           (proliferative glomerulonephritis with chronic changes, elevated serum creatinine,
           nephrotic syndrome, anemia, low serum C3, inadequate response to treatment).

        -  Systemic sclerosis (SSc): SSc is a condition divided into two forms (diffuse and
           limited) characterized by excessive and often relentless fibrosis in skin and internal
           organs. Visceral involvement can manifest as esophageal hypomotility, interstitial lung
           disease, pulmonary hypertension and renal failure. There is no satisfactory treatment
           for systemic sclerosis (SSc), which in its diffuse form has a 5-year mortality of 40%,
           similar to many malignancies. In clinical trials, alpha-interferon did not demonstrate a
           clinically significant effect and low dose methotrexate showed conflicting results.
