    
      Patients treated with Maxillofacial Prosthesis have loss of maxillary and/or mandibular
      substances (oral-nasal or oral-sinusal communication, removal of the soft palate, removal of
      part of the lower jaw). These losses are mainly due to the surgical consequences of cancers
      of the upper aerodigestive tract, trauma or sequelae of labio-palate clefts. Depending on the
      etiology of substance loss, there are 3 main therapeutics: surgical approach, radiotherapy
      and chemotherapy. The effects of these treatments are functional, aesthetic and
      psychological. The functions impacted are chewing, phonation, ventilation and swallowing.

      Few data are available on quality of life of these patients and its association with some of
      their socio-demographic, medical and clinical characteristics (drug use, type of
      maxillo-mandibular loss of substance, disorder(s) associated with substance loss, ...).

      This study investigates the socio-demographic, medical and quality of life characteristics of
      Maxillofacial Prosthesis consultation's patients (Department of Dentistry, GHPS) and the
      potential associations between quality of life and some of these characteristics.
