      moderate venom effect. Potential subjects will receive CroFab antivenom or placebo. The trial
      is conducted by emergency room doctors, toxicologists, or surgeons at hospitals in regions
      where copperhead bites are common. After blinded treatment and discharge, the subject returns
      to the clinic for follow-up assessments at day 3, 7, 14, and 28 after snake bite. The subject
      will also be called by telephone for follow-up assessments on day 10, 17, and 24 after snake
      bite. The purpose of this study is to compare recovery in copperhead snake bite patients
      treated with antivenom vs placebo (no active drug) as measured by the Patient Specific
      Functional Scale (PSFS) at Day 14 follow-up.The primary efficacy endpoint of this study was
      achieved. Treatment with CroFab® demonstrated measurable and significant improvement (less
      disability) over placebo: in the mITT population, the LS mean total score on the PSFS at Day
      14 follow-up and treatment showed less disability in patients randomized to receive CroFab®
      than those receiving placebo.
