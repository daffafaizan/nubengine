      world. At present, surgery is the first choice and the most effective way to treat it. Based
      on the case review, the investigators found that the recovery rate of perioperative liver
      function was correlated with survival. Therefore, it is of great clinical significance to
      improve the recovery rate of postoperative liver function. Gut microbiota participate in many
      physiological activities of human body, such as metabolic regulation, immune homeostasis and
      hormone regulation. However, gut microbiota imbalance, excessive growth of pathogenic
      microorganisms and changes in intestinal mucosal permeability lead to intestinal bacterial
      ectopia and bacterial metabolites entering the liver through enterohepatic circulation. The
      continuous inflammatory stimulation aggravate the progress of liver disease. Therefore, it is
      helpful to explore the influence of gut microbiota on postoperative liver function recovery
      and find out the different microbiota, in order to improve the postoperative liver function
      recovery rate, shorten the perioperative hospital stay and prolong the survival of patients.

      According to the recovery level of liver function on the fifth day after the operation, liver
      resection patients on HCC were divided into the recovery group and the recovery delay group
      which comparing on the time point of before the surgery and five days after the surgery. The
      patients on benign liver disease were used as a control. The investigators attempt to
      identify the differential microbiota and validate this finding in a mouse hepatectomy model.
