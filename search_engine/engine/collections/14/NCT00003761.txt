      vaccinia DF3/MUC1 vaccine (rV-DF3/MUC1) in patients with metastatic breast cancer. II.
      Determine the maximum tolerated dose of rV-DF3/MUC1, based on cellular and humoral immunity,
      in these patients. III. Determine whether vaccination with rV-DF3/MUC1 is associated with
      antitumor activity in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open label, dose escalation study. Patients receive recombinant vaccinia
      DF3/MUC1 vaccine (rV-DF3/MUC1) intradermally. Treatment repeats every month for 3 courses in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of at least 6 patients
      receive escalating doses of rV-DF3/MUC1 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or the highest
      dose level to be tested is reached. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2
      of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity. Patients are followed monthly for 6 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 16-28 patients will be accrued for this study within 1-2 years.
