      current stimulation (tDCS) in improving executive function across neuropsychiatric
      populations known to have deficits in this cognitive domain. The investigators will select 8
      relevant diagnostic categories: traumatic brain injury, major depressive disorder, bipolar
      disorder, schizophrenia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, borderline personality
      disorder and substance use disorder. The study will also include a cohort of healthy controls
      for comparison.
