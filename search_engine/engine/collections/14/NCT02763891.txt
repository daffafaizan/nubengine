      effective option to improve trunk muscles activation and to facilitate functional balance and
      mobility control in Parkinson's disease (PD). To evaluate this hypothesis, subjects will be
      randomized into control group or intervention group. Intervention group will receive
      30-minute session of body suspension and tilting exercises on the Chordata equipment (PI:
      0804871-1 and BR 10 2012 009901-2) twice a week for eight weeks, while the control group will
      receive passive muscle stretching and maintained their usual routine during the same period.
      Both groups will be assessed at baseline and immediately after the intervention protocol.
      Finally, a follow-up evaluation will be performed 8 weeks after the protocol ending (to
      verify possible long-lasting effects of this exercise protocol).
