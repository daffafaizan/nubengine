      unresectable disease, and the condition is often not diagnosed until the cancer is relatively
      advanced. The standard first-line treatment for patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer
      is gemcitabine monotherapy. Unfortunately many of these patients fail to derive benefit from
      this treatment. No clinical or molecular marker has been established to predict benefit from
      gemcitabine therapy, so patients are treated empirically until evidence of disease
      progression or worsening performance status.

      The potential for human equilibrative nucleoside transporter-1 (hENT1) expression to predict
      survival in gemcitabine-treated patients has been studied, and data suggest that patients
      with low levels of tumor cell hENT1 expression derive less benefit from gemcitabine treatment
      than patients with high levels of tumor cell hENT1 expression. These data support the
      hypothesis to be tested in this study that patients with pancreatic tumors expressing low
      levels of hENT1 will derive minimal benefit from gemcitabine, but will receive benefit from
      CO-1.01 (gemcitabine elaidate) which enters tumor cells in a hENT1-independent fashion.
