    
      All residents of a household will be invited to participate. After study enrollment,
      participants will complete a questionnaire to collect data on the demographics and health
      status of the subjects and the poultry kept at the household. A 3-ml blood sample will be
      obtained from each subject for serological testing.

      Field nurses or physicians will visit each household biweekly (October through March) or
      weekly (April through September) to determine if any subject has influenza-like illness
      (ILI), defined according to Centers for Disease Control (CDC) criteria as having measured
      fever of ≥38ºC. and cough and/or sore throat. Subjects with confirmed ILI (index case) will
      provide two nasal swabs for a point-of-care rapid influenza A test and PCR. For those who
      test positive for influenza A by rapid test or PCR on nasal swab (day 1), two 3-ml blood
      samples will be obtained. In addition, nasal washes, throat swabs, and blood samples will be
      obtained from all household contacts.

      Cloacal swabs will also be collected from the poultry in the household on day 1.

      The index case and household contacts will be re-sampled by nasal wash and throat swab on
      days 3, 6, 9 and 14 post initial diagnosis data, and an additional 3-ml blood sample will be
      obtained on day 14 for serological testing.

      Household contacts who report ILI symptoms during follow-up visits to the index case will
      then be followed with the same follow-up regimen as the original index case.

      At annual follow-up and final visits, questionnaire data will be updated if needed, and a
      3-ml blood sample will be obtained from each subject for serological testing.
