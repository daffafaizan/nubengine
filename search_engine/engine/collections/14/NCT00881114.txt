    
      Treatment-naive patients with locally advanced, non-metastatic (Stage III to IVB) squamous
      cell carcinoma of the head and neck who are candidates for concurrent chemoradiotherapy as
      primary therapy with curative intent will be enrolled. Patients will be genotyped for
      variations at four SNP loci in 3 genes involved in DNA nucleotide excision repair (ERCC1,
      ERCC2, and XRCC1). Patients with 3 to 8 variants will receive cisplatin, while patients with
      2 or fewer variants will receive cetuximab.
