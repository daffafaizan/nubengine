    
      This is a Phase II study in 240 ED patients, which consists of 3 part: 1) a 4-week run-in
      period without any ED treatment; 2)randomization to 8 weeks of treatment with TPN171H or
      placebo; and 3) a 1-week follow-up period for continued adverse event monitoring.

      The effects of TPN171H on ED will be evaluated using the IIEF-EF and SEP diaries. The IIEF-EF
      will be administered at baseline and at 4-week intervals following initiation of treatment,
      meanwhile the SEP diary will be completed by patients after each sexual attempt throughout
      the study.
