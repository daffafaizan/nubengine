      mainly from therapeutic exercise, but there continues to be an important documentary gap and

      The myofascial approach is presented as an effective tool for the treatment of different
      pathologies, mainly musculoskeletal. However, few are the studies that relate it to
      psychological variables and specifically to improve anxiety levels.

      The myofascial approach is proposed as a fast and low-cost tool for the management of
      clinical anxiety.
