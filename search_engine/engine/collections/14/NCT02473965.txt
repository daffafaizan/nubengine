      Maintenance Phase.

      In the Run-in Phase, subjects will receive a total of 3 doses of IGIV-C (1 loading dose of 2
      g/kg and 2 maintenance doses of 1 g/kg) while maintaining a stable dose of corticosteroids.

      In the CS Tapering/IGIV-C Maintenance Phase, subjects will continue 1 g/kg IGIV-C and begin a
      prescribed CS tapering regimen where the CS dose is decreased every 3 weeks.

      Approximately 60 subjects are planned to be enrolled in the study across multiple centers in
      North America and Europe. The total duration of study participation for each subject is up to
      45 weeks.
