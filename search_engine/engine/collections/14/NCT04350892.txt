      host of neuronal responses that maintain energy balance; such regulatory mechanisms make it
      difficult to maintain diet-induced weight loss. The goal is to understand how these central
      regulatory mechanisms are circumvented following surgical alterations in the gut in subjects
      after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and vertical sleeve gastrectomy (SG) compared to
      carefully matched diet- induced weight loss controls who achieve weight loss on a low calorie
      liquid diet. Surgery participants will be patients who have already chosen to have a
      bariatric surgery procedure with their doctor. Diet participants will be provided with the
      low calorie liquid diet for approximately 3 months and will be monitored weekly throughout
      the study.

      Surgery participants will be studied at 3 time-points:

        1. Before the intervention

        2. After surgery at 10-15% weight loss

        3. At 12 months after surgery

      Low calorie diet participants will be studied at 2 time-points:

        1. Before intervention

        2. At 10-15% weight loss (approximately 12 weeks on the diet)

      At each time-point subjects will have a lumbar puncture (spinal tap) for cerebrospinal fluid
      (CSF) sampling and blood will be collected in the fasting state and in response to a liquid
      meal challenge. Body weight, waist and hip circumference will be measured.
