      neuromuscular function. Thus, it relieves muscle spasm, and breaks pain-spasm chain by
      blocking polisynaptic reflexes in the brain and medulla spinalis. It does not affect
      monosynaptic reflexes.

      Phenyramidol has a very high analgesic effect than aspirin and close to codeine. It used in
      the treatment of acute and chronic human musculoskeletal system pains as muscle relaxant and
      analgesic.

      Pharmacokinetics Phenyramidol reaches maximum plasma concentration in an hour (0.25-1) after
      absorption from gastrointestinal tract. It is widely distributed in skeletal muscles and
      involved in circulatory system very slowly.

      Studies have shown that cytochrome P450 enzymes are effective in phenyramidol metabolism. It
      is conjugated with glucuronic acid in the liver and it is excreted as glucuronide conjugates
      from the urinary tract. The drug is eliminated from the bile and the bacterial glucuronidase
      enzymes make the glucuronide conjugate of phenyramidol free. The drug enters enterohepatic
      circulation and is excreted by faeces. Its elimination half-life is 1-2 hours.

      Indications Phenyramidol is indicated in the symptomatic treatment of acute painful muscle
      spasms associated with musculoskeletal system.
