    
      The study is planned based on a two-stage design that allows early termination for lack of
      efficacy. A safety run-in phase will be included comprising the first 6 patients at minimum
      to ensure that the combination of nivolumab plus ipilimumab and SBRT is safe. Then, the
      investigators will determine whether the combination of nivolumab plus ipilimumab and SBRT
      yields a clinically compelling antitumor activity measured as objective response rate (ORR),
      and evaluate other endpoints including Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), duration of
      response (DOR), progression free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and local control of
      irradiated sites.

      There is no previous experience with SBRT used concurrently with nivolumab and ipilimumab in
      this study population. Therefore, to ensure that the combination is safe, the first six
      patients will be treated and observed for toxicity for 6 weeks after radiation before
      continuing with further accrual. Therefore, six patients will be enrolled at the proposed
      dose of nivolumab and ipilimumab in combination with SBRT. If 4 out of the first 6 patients
      experience Grade 3/4 toxicity or a lower grade toxicity requiring immune suppressive therapy
      during the safety run-in observation period (defined as the first 4-cycles, 12 weeks),
      enrollment will cease and the study will be halted until further safety analysis of the
      combination regimen can be performed. If less than 4 out of the first 6 patients experience
      Grade 3/4 toxicities or require steroids, the investigators will proceed with additional
      accrual with this regimen.
