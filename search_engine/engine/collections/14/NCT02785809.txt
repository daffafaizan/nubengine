      Hormonal contraception is widely used among women worldwide; 50-89% of all women in the
      Western countries use oral contraception at some point in their lives. Oral contraceptives
      (OC) suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis through a negative feedback of ethinyl
      estradiol and progestins and thereby potentially influence the markers of ovarian reserve due
      to a suppressed release of gonadotropins, which will impair the growth of antral follicles.

      Methods and Materials:

      Participants for this studies will be included through the Fertility Assessment and
      Counseling Clinic, Rigshospitalet, Herlev- and Hvidovre Hospital.

      Inclusion criteria: Use of oral contraception (for study 3 at least during the last three
      years).

      Exclusion criteria: Known infertility, known thyroid disease.

      Aims:

      Study 3: Investigate the ovarian reserve markers after discontinuation of OC over a period of
      three months in women with a history of long-term OC use. The women will be followed with
      serial ultrasounds and blood samples and will complete a menstrual calendar.
