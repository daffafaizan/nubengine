      uses a regression-based predictive modeling system (PMS) to calculate operative and
      anesthetic time length. The investigators hypothesize that compared to the traditional
      scheduling system (TSS) that calculate operative length using historic means, case allocation
      in an operating room using the PMS will improve scheduling precision, increase operative
      volume and increase Operative Suite (OS) personnel satisfaction, without having adverse
      impact on patient outcomes. The investigators will evaluate this hypothesis using a
      randomized block design in two operating rooms of a single surgical specialty for a total of
      100 operative days per arm.
