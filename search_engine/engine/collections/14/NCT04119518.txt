      the middle-aged population.

      The particular interest of this project is given to the diagnosis and treatment of so-called
      nocturnal hypertension. Unfortunately, current monitoring practice relies on the use of
      occlusive pneumatic cuffs inflated around the arm to assess BP. Based on oscillometric
      technique, occlusive cuffs perform intermittent BP measurements every 20 minutes, thus
      providing only a limited view of the BP regulation landscape. In addition, oscillometric
      measurement performs a full occlusion of the measured arm inducing awakening reactions, and
      leading to non-representative overestimated BP values. The non-occlusive measurement of BP is
      thus an unsolved problem of modern medicine.

      The aim of the NAMBP (Night Ambulatory Monitoring of Blood Pressure) project is to develop,
      implement and test in clinical trials a first-ever non-occlusive BP sensor to be used during
      sleep.

      A novel technology for the non-occlusive measurement of BP from photoplethysmographic
      (optical) signals, known as Pulse Wave Analysis (PWA), has been investigated for the past
      decade by the Centre Suisse d'Electronique et de Microtechnique (CSEM, Neuch√¢tel,
      Switzerland). The herein proposed system - the CSEM Pulse Watch - consists in a single sensor
      (watch-like device) attached at the wrist that measures photoplethysmographic waveforms
      induced by the pulsatility of the skin arteries of the wrist. These waveforms are then
      post-processed via PWA: The system will detect features in the measured waveforms that
      correlate, through the phenomenon of wave reflections, to the underlying BP of the patient.
