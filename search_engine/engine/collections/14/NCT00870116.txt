      techniques in radiotherapy.

      SBRT is the very precise delivery of high-powered radiation to small target volumes, using
      multiple low-intensity beams. Extremely precise patient positioning and target location is
      essential for accurate treatment delivery.

      Several studies have shown a benefit of SBRT in terms of local control and progression-free
      survival, in particular for the treatment of cerebral metastases of limited number and size.

      The development of this technique is recent. The number of treatment sessions is low: 1 to 4.

      But the patient is exposed to a major risk of toxicity in several organs: the bronchi, the
      lungs, large vessels, the oesophagus and the spinal-cord.

      Pulmonary SBRT imposes strict rules and the use of specific equipment.

      Extra-cranial SBRT can be realized using either:

        -  Conventional linear-accelerator equipped SBRT,

        -  Cyberknife SBRT.

           3 groups of treatment will be evaluated in this study:

        -  SBRT by cyberknife,

        -  SBRT by linear accelerator,

        -  Conformational radiotherapy (free breathing or breath holding).
