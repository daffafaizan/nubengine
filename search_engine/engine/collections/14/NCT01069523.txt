      Disorder (ADHD). After baseline assessment confirms the presence of ADHD, children will have
      an Event related potential (ERP) (a type of electroencephalogram [EEG]) study. After the
      baseline EEG, children will be randomized to either placebo or GXR for a 4-week, parallel
      groups trial. During this trial, dosing will be flexibly adjusted according to patient
      response or presence of side effects. The dosage will range from 1-4 mg. At the end of the
      four week trial, a follow up ERP study will be obtained. Our hypotheses are: A) GXR will be
      superior to placebo at reducing symptoms of ADHD as measured by standardized clinical
      diagnostic tools by week 3 of treatment. B) Compared to placebo and pretreatment measures,
      GXR at week 4 of treatment will increase the amplitude of the right frontal N200 and
      frontal-central P300, and such changes will correlate with clinical response.
