      due to their prevalence and potentially devastating reproductive consequences, including
      pelvic inflammatory disease, infertility, and ectopic pregnancy. The goal of this study is to
      evaluate the risk factors for adverse outcomes following genital tract infection with
      Chlamydia trachomatis and to evaluate whether or not the presence of C. trachomatis in the
      rectum act as a reservoir for infection. Our target population will be adolescent females age
      11-21 evaluated at the ACH Adolescent Center who are undergoing pelvic examinations or urine
      screening for sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Laboratory specimens obtained will
      include cervical and rectal swabs, urine and blood specimens, as well as, chart review and
      comprehensive subject interviews in the initial data collection with follow-up evaluations at
      3, 6, 12, 24 and 36 months for qualifying subjects
