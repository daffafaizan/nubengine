      myelogenous leukemia patients ,the most of who could have a complete cytogenetic response, a
      large majority of patients could not come to a complete molecular response that is
      undetectable in breakpoint cluster region-Abelson chimeric oncogene transcripts. According to
      some previous researches, pioglitazone may target leukemia stem cells and induce them into
      cell cycle making them exit from quiescent undivided states. Subsequently, pioglitazone may
      gradually erode leukemia stem cells leading to undetectable minimal residual disease. Thus
      the investigators expect to assess the safety and efficiency of pioglitazone in combination
      with imatinib mesylate in clinical trials. Maybe the combination therapy induce more patients
      in a detectable molecular response into a deeper molecular response. Furthermore,
      pioglitazone may be extensively adapted into the treatment of chronic phase chronic
      myelogenous leukemia patients as a common protocol.
