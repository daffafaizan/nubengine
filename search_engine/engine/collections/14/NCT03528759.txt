      capsule, bile insolubility, the indeterminate sensitivity Or resistance to optochin after
      incubation in Carbon dioxide (5%), while sensitivity to it after incubation in ambient air
      Streptococcus . pseudopneumoniae was firstly described in sputum samples of patients with
      lower respiratory tract infection, particularly those with Chronic Obstructive
      PulmonaryDiseases pseudopneumoniae is usually misidentified in our laboratories as we usually
      rely on optochin sensitivity testing with 5% Carbon dioxide detection of Streptococcus.
      pneumoniae and miss the incubation in ambient air which is the key point for identification
      of Streptococcus. pseudopneumoniae. Biochemical reactions are usually used to differentiate
      typical pneumoniae from Streptococc Streptococcus . pseudopneumoniae and other related
      Streptococci; several molecular techniques have also been used There are several polymerase
      chain reaction based assays that target specific pneumococcal virulence factors for the
      typical Streptococc Streptococcus . pneumoniae, such as autolysin A which is the major
      pneumococcal autolysin and the capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis gene A which is a
      conservedpneumococcal capsular polysaccharide gene , also aliB-like ORF2 (a gene that usually
      found in the capsular region of non-capsulated pneumococci; these genetic markers have been
      used to differentiate S. pneumoniae from other related species.
