      whether HPV vaccination can play a potential protective role. This research focuses on men
      who have sex with men (MSM) who are at notably elevated risk of anal cancer, and seeks to
      characterize their beliefs about anal and oral cancer, knowledge about the etiological role
      of HPV infection in these cancers, as well as their knowledge of HPV vaccination and anal Pap
      smears. We will also study heterosexual men.
