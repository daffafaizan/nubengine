      square-wave bolus that is evenly delivered over several hours as programmed by the patient.
      The aim of this study is to compare post-prandial glycaemic excursions following a
      high-protein meal after administration of insulin by normal vs dual-wave bolus. During this
      prospective, cross-over, repeated measures study, pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes,
      treated with insulin pump therapy will be evaluated using the self-blood glucose measurements
      following standardized high-protein meal and two types of boluses (normal or dual-wave). The
      required insulin dose will be calculated based on patient's insulin-exchange ratio. A
      high-protein meal will be given on two subsequent breakfasts and comparisons will be made
      between normal and dual-wave insulin bolus delivery. Prolonged post-prandial glycaemic
      excursions will be identified using the CGMS.
