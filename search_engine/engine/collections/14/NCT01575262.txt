      a novel physical activity tracking system with web-based monitoring and nudge initiatives.
      The tracking system used Near-Field Communication (NFC) technology and a "loyalty card" (PAL
      Card) which contained a passive Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tag. Sensors were
      placed along footpaths in the outdoor environment, in the gym and exercise studio, and
      participants scanned their PAL card at the sensor when doing physical activity (e.g.
      walking). A transaction (card ID, sensor ID, and timestamp) was recorded and sent via SMS to
      a secure data centre. Participants logged onto a personal account on the study website
      (www.palcard.co.uk) and received real-time feedback on various aspects of their physical
      activity including minutes, distance and calories expended.
