      history of high bacteria counts on their upper back, meeting the inclusion criteria.

      Antimicrobial efficacy will be measured by determining the mean number of Colony Forming
      Units (CFUs) per square centimetre (cm²) of skin prior to treatment (baseline measurement),
      following preparation with 70% isopropyl alcohol, and following post treatment samples.

      The goal of this study is to demonstrate that IV Clear™ is as effective as or better than
      Tegaderm™ CHG dressing in preventing regrowth of cutaneous microbial flora on test subjects.
