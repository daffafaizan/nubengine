      transplantation, as the vecuronium is eliminated principally by the liver. Furthermore, the
      requirements may be different according to the phase of surgery. The requirements may by
      further reduced during anhepatic phase of liver transplantation. And the requirements may be
      increased as the graft functions during neohepatic phase.

      We also postulated that the requirements may be different according to the preoperative
      hepatic function during preanhepatic phase, and according to the graft to recipient body
      weight ratio (GRWR) during neohepatic phase.

      Therefore, we are trying to investigate the difference of vecuronium requirements according
      to the phase of surgery, MELD score, GRWR.
