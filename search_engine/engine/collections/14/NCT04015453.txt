      shown that postoperative scarring, especially in cosmetically sensitive areas, may negatively
      affect patient quality of life and social interactions. The impact of surgical scarring is
      magnified in Mohs micrographic surgery, for which the large proportion of treated lesions are
      in highly visible areas, such as the head, face, and neck. Clinicians often underestimate the
      significance of scarring in patients' daily activities. Patients desire quick healing
      surgical scars in order to reintegrate into their normal social routines. Anecdotal evidence
      suggests that scars that heal well early in the post-operative period will achieve better
      results in the late postoperative period. Determining a model of early and late surgical scar
      evolution, as rated by patients, physicians, and third-party observers may; 1. Identify gaps
      between physician and patient evaluations; 2. Assist clinicians in effectively evaluating and
      counseling patients regarding their post-operative scar appearance.
