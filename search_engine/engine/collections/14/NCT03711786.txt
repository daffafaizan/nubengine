      non-communicable diseases (NCD) clinics in Malawi. Clinics will be randomized 1:1 to one of
      two implementation strategies: a basic strategy involving an internal coordinator, and an
      enhanced strategy combining the internal coordinator with an external quality assurance
      monitoring and supervision team. From each clinic, 116 patients with elevated depressive
      symptoms (defined as a Patient Health Questionnaire score >= 5) will be enrolled into an
      observational cohort, for a total sample of 1,160 patients over a two-year period; follow-up
      will extend an additional 12 months. The investigators will assess key implementation and
      effectiveness outcomes comparing the two implementation strategies. The investigators will
      also assess clinic characteristics that may influence uptake and fidelity.
