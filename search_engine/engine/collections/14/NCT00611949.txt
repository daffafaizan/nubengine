      of a synthetic geranium oil provide analgesic relief, with the objective of identifying and
      purifying the active substance. This is not a hypothesis-generating trial, nor is it
      confirming a hypothesis. The trial uses human volunteers in an efficacy-directed
      decomposition of a complex mixture.

      Patients with a diagnosis of neuralgia or neuropathy who respond to geranium oil will test
      two vials of components of a synthetic geranium oil for application to the maximally painful
      area in succession. They will treat their condition in the clinic and fill out a patient
      diary on separate days. The primary objective is the patient opinion of which vial has
      greatest analgesic efficacy. Efficacy will be measured primarily by reduction in pain
      intensity summed over the first two hours, compared with the pain intensity during the 30
      minutes preceding application.

      Following the comparison of the first two vials, the vial judged efficacious will be
      decomposed into two further vials and the patients will repeat the evaluation described
      above. At least eight pair-wise comparisons will be required to determine and confirm which
      of the 100+ ingredients of a synthetic geranium oil are analgesic, provided there is only one
      such ingredient.
