      receptor antibodies with one antibody administered by itself for 1 hour before the second
      antibody infusion is started. II. Determine the pharmacokinetics of monoclonal antibodies
      E2.3 and A27.15.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalating study. Patients receive antitransferrin antibody A27.15 IV
      over 4 hours. One hour after the initiation of the A27.15 infusion, infusion of antibody E2-3
      is added by IV piggy back. In the absence of antimouse antibodies and toxic effects,
      treatment continues once every 4 weeks in patients achieving minimal, partial, or complete
      remission. Treatment ceases in patients experiencing stable or progressive disease. In the
      absence of dose limiting toxicity in the first 3 patients treated, subsequent cohorts of 6
      patients each receive escalating doses of antitransferrin antibodies E2.3 and A27.15 on the
      same dose schedule. If dose limiting toxicity occurs in 2 of 6 patients at a given dose
      level, then dose escalation ceases and the next lower dose is declared the MTD. Patients are
      followed for 3 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: This study will accrue 18-27 patients within 2 years.
