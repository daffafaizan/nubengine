      Lung Carcinoma (NSCLC) population, with a Performance Status (PS) â‰¥ 2 (median survival of
      approximately 3 months) piloting iteratively (before each decision to continue treatment) a
      process consisting of an evaluation framework (30 items to be answered by the oncologist with
      the patient), consolidating:

        1. clinical parameters;

        2. doctors' expectations regarding the continuation of anticancer treatment;

        3. patient expectations and preferences;

        4. the possibility of referring the patient to a supportive care specialist and
           strengthening home care.

      The process triggers a dialogue between the patient and the oncologist, based on facts and
      seeks objectivity, ultimately allowing a shared decision.

      In this prospective comparative study, the rate of systemic oncological treatment during the
      last month of life will be measured consecutively, over a period of usual management,
      followed by a period of systematic application of a process of optimization of the medical
      decision.
