      uninterrupted progression of the operation. Any interruptions to the normal workflow of the
      procedure threatens to cause distraction which in the least can lengthen the operative time
      leading to increased hospital operating costs and exposing the patient to unnecessary excess
      anesthesia and associated risks. At worst, interruptions can cause errors in judgment and/or
      technique resulting in injury to the patient.

      Interruptions in the operating room can take many forms, from conversations to equipment
      malfunction. The goal of this study is to focus on one particular type of interruption unique
      to laparoscopic surgery - lens cleaning. It is quite common during the course of the
      procedure for the laparoscopic scope lens to become obscured by bodily fluids or steam from
      cautery devices. This necessitates having to remove the camera from the patient, cleaning it
      outside of the body, applying de-fog solution, reinserting it into the body, and having to
      reacquire the original camera position and image. This can be quite dangerous particularly in
      the middle of operative step, such as when there is ongoing bleeding, or when there are sharp
      or hot instruments within the body. Pilot data from own group demonstrates that the camera
      may have to be cleaned up to 20 times during a case adding upwards of 10-15 minutes to an
      operation.
