      within the local community; 2) establish a protocol for long-term surveillance of falls for
      older adult chiropractic patients; 3) explore dose-response patterns to chiropractic care by
      comparing Berg Balance Scale scores at 12 months from baseline in three groups of older
      adults with impaired balance.
