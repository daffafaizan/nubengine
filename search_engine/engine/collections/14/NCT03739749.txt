    
      Patients with irreparable rotator cuff tears who meet the eligibility criteria will be
      enrolled in the study and undergo arthroscopic superior capsular reconstruction using one of
      the following types of graft: fascia lata autograft, fascia lata allograft, Achilles tendon
      allograft, bovine pericardium xenograft, swine dermal xenograft, or collagen graft.

      All patients will be assessed clinically, radiologically and with an MRI preoperatively and
      at the 6-months and at the 2-years postoperative evaluations. The range of motion (ROM),
      shoulder abduction strength, Constant (CS), simple shoulder test (SST) and subjective
      shoulder value (SSV) scores will be compared from preoperative to 6 months postoperative;
      from 6 months postoperative to 2 years postoperative (paired-samples t-test, two-tailed) in
      each group (allotment to groups is performed according to the type of graft used: fascia lata
      autograft, fascia lata allograft, Achilles tendon allograft, bovine pericardium xenograft,
      swine dermal xenograft, or collagen graft). The differences in ROM, shoulder abduction
      strength, CS, SST and SSV scores from preoperative to 6 months postoperative and from 6
      months postoperative to 2 years postoperative will be compared between groups. All continuous
      variables will be compared between the group of patients with graft tears and the group
      without graft tears (Mann-Whitney U test). All categorical variables and outcome results will
      be compared between groups (Fisher's exact test). A significant difference will be defined as
      P<0.05.
