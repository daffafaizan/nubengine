      index could be helpful in detecting this pain in ICU patients. Remifentanil is a
      morphinomimetic product with short half life that could be interesting for short nociceptive
      stimuli, as bronchoalveolar lavage.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of remifentanil infusion on bispectral
      index (BIS) variations during bronchoalveolar lavage.

      It is a prospective, double blind study, versus placebo on 40 sedated and critically ill
      patients.

      The hypothesis is that BIS can study analgesia in sedated patient.
