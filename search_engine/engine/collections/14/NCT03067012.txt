      T1N0 stage and preoperative body mass index (BMI) ≥ 32.5 kg/m2 or ≥ 27.5 kg/m2 with
      co-morbidities between September 2015 and July 2016.

      The primary endpoint was the incidence of micronutrients' deficiency (iron, folate, vitamin
      B12) at postoperative 1 year and secondary endpoints were anemia incidence, BMI change and
      remission rates of co-morbidities.
