      on the diaphragmatic mobility and thickness. Obesity, especially morbid, triggers changes in
      the respiratory system, which can affect the work activities and daily life of individuals
      with this multifactorial syndrome. These functional changes in mechanical ventilation may be
      linked to weakness and poor respiratory muscle strength, so by promoting rehabilitation of
      these muscles can minimize the losses that come with obesity
