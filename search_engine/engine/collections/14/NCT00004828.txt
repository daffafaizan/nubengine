      Initially, patients are randomized to receive either 1 of 3 different dosages of liothyronine
      or placebo after undergoing the Fontan procedure. If no unacceptable toxicity is observed in
      this group, a third dose level of liothyronine is added to the randomization. A total of 7
      patients are enrolled at each dose level. All randomized study drugs are administered by
      continuous infusion over 1 hour after surgery.

      Cardiac function is assessed 5 days after surgery.
