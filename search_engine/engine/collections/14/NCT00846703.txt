        1. In the induction phase, the agent of dexamethasone 6 mg/m2 is used instead of prednisone
           after prednisone prophase.

        2. The phase "CAM" is 2 weeks for SR patients and 4 weeks for IR and HR
           patients,respectively.

        3. Both the SR and IR treatments involve the protocol mM /M (8 weeks) in the phase of
           consolidation. However, the folinic acid rescue starts at 36 hours instead of 42 hours.
           The type of HR enters the block treatment the same with the BFM protocol.

        4. There is not randomized study in delayed intensification. The GD-2008 ALL protocol uses
           the same protocol II with the BFM study.

        5. The randomized study focus on the phase of maintenance. The maintenance A is the same
           with the BFM protocol, while the maintenance B consists of 6mp/MTX and VCR/
           dexamethasone. The cycle is 8 weeks: VCR at d1, Dexamethasone at d2 to d7, 6mp from d8
           to d56, and MTX at d9,d16, d23, d30, d37,d44,d51.

        6. The GD-2008 ALL protocol for HR patients use the re-blocks and protocol II phases.
