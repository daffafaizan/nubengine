      Both models are approved for use by the FDA, and are routinely used for airway management
      during general anesthesia. Three main features distinguish the laryngeal mask airway Supreme
      from the original LMA: i) a curved rigid airway tube, ii) provision for a gastric drain tube,
      and iii) a larger mask for improved fit and airway seal.

      The aim of this randomized prospective study is to compare two types of the laryngeal mask
      airway: the laryngeal mask airway Unique and the laryngeal mask airway Supreme, in pediatric
      patients without the use of neuromuscular blockade. Based on the design features listed
      above, we hypothesize that the airway leak pressures with the LMA Supreme will be superior to
      the LMA Unique. Airway leak pressures will be measured by recording the circuit pressure at
      which equilibrium is reached. The ease of placement, fiberoptic grade of laryngeal view,
      feasibility of use, and complications (airway related, gastric insufflation, trauma) will
      also be assessed.
