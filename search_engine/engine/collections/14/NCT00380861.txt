    
      The primary objective of this study is to determine whether the passive, non-weight-bearing
      flexion is superior with the posterior-stabilized PFC® Sigma™ RP-F compared to the
      posterior-stabilized PFC® Sigma™ RP in bilateral Subjects receiving both implants and if this
      difference is a function of implant design.
