    
      Severe, fulminating acute liver failure is a rare but serious disease. The overall prognosis
      has improved in recent years thanks to advances in medical management and liver
      transplantation.

      However, the epidemiology of this disease in France, the survival with or without liver
      transplantation of these patients and the factors that can influence this survival are not
      well known.

      The main objective is to determine the medical fate (transplanted or not and living or
      deceased), of patients with Severe, fulminating acute liver failure in the public hospitals
      of paris (APHP).

      The data will come from the APHP Health Data Warehouse
