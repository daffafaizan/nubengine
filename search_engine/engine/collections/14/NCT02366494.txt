           The study team will collect blood samples from patients with systemic disease
           pretreatment (at enrollment), three months post-treatment and at the time of progression
           of disease (or at two years post-ADT for patients still in remission at that time point)
           and then perform next-generation sequencing using serum exosomal RNAs derived from these
           patients.

           The investigators plan to identify exosomal RNAs signatures that change between
           pretreatment (at enrollment) and during treatment (at three months) and further explore
           the effect of these changes on disease response. The investigators also plan to compare
           exosomal RNA levels between patients relapse within the first two years versus those in
           remission at two years. Among patients with progression, the investigators plan to
           compare exosomal RNA signatures at progression of disease to signatures at pretreatment
           and during treatment.

        2. Validate exosomal RNA markers that predict response to ADT by real-time RT-PCR.

      Secondary objectives: Selected RNAs, identified through the above process will be validated
      using real-time RT-PCR assay to test reproducibility of RNA sequencing results. The
      investigators expect to select and validate approximate five RNA markers that predict
      duration of response to ADT.
