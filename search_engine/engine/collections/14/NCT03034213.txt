      also have their limitations. Potential complications associated with prosthetic mesh for
      hernia repairs include: adverse reactions to the mesh, mesh erosion, stricture formation,
      adhesions resulting in bowel obstruction, enterocutaneous fistulas, injuries to nearby
      organs, nerves or blood vessels, infection, chronic pain and hernia recurrence. Potential
      complications associated with biological mesh include: adverse inflammatory response, laxity,
      eventration, and recurrent herniation. This study is a two-arm, randomized, controlled trial
      comparing separation of components repair with retrorectus Gentrixâ„¢ Surgical Matrix versus
      biological or prosthetic mesh for open ventral hernia repair.
