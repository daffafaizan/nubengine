      began the Health Disparities Collaborative (HDC) to improve chronic disease management in
      community health centers (HC) nationwide. The HDC incorporates rapid quality improvement
      (QI), a chronic care model, and best practices. This study determines if the HDC improves
      diabetes care and whether more intensive interventions with additional learning sessions for
      health centers, provider training in behavioral change, and patient empowerment materials
      enhance care further.
