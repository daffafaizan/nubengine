      submitted to SARME using the Hyrax expansion appliance were evaluated. Patients were
      distributed into two groups: Group Without Retention (GSC) n = 15; and Group With Retention
      (GCC) n = 15. In the GCC group, a Transpalatal Arch (TPA) was installed for retention soon
      after removal of the expander. The dental casts were scanned using a Vivid 9i 3D laser
      scanner (Konica Minolta, Wayne, NJ). The plaster models were performed preoperatively (T1), 4
      months after the expander was removed (T2), and 10 months after the end of the expansion
      (T3). The distances measured were Inter-Cusps of Premolars and Molars (Inter-Cusp PM)
      (Inter-Cusp M), Inter-Cervicals of Premolars and Molars (Inter-Cervical PM) (Inter-Cervical
      M), Inter-WALA edges of Premolars and Molars (PM Inter-BW) (BW Inter-M), palatal height at
      the molar, and palatal area and volume at T1, T2, and T3.
