    
      This is a non-randomized, open-label, pilot Phase II study of metronomic chemotherapy plus
      Avastin in chemo na√Øve subjects with advanced non-squamous, non-small cell carcinoma of the
      lung. The primary endpoint of this study is to assess the overall progression-free survival.

      Subjects will be treated with metronomic chemotherapy with paclitaxel and gemcitabine weekly
      for 3 out of 4 weeks, and Avastin will be administered every 2 weeks. Treatment with
      metronomic chemotherapy will be expressed as a 4-week cycle. Tumor response to treatment will
      be evaluated every 8 weeks.

      Treatment with metronomic chemotherapy and Avastin will continue for a total of 6 cycles
      unless there is evidence of disease progression, intolerable toxicity, or withdrawal of
      consent. Maintenance therapy with Avastin will then continue until disease progression,
      intolerable toxicity or withdrawal of consent.

      Potential biologic parameters to monitor anti-tumor activity of metronomic chemotherapy will
      be evaluated in 10 subjects. These biomarkers include: sequential determination of blood
      levels of VEGF, VEGFR2, thrombospondin-1, E-selectin, ICAM-1, and circulating endothelial
      cells and endothelial precursor cells.
