      increasing control of HIV infection and viral replication, ultimate control of HIV infection
      will require the development of effective HIV-specific immunity in HIV infected individuals.

      This trial will evaluate the use of the ALVAC vCP1452 vaccine in combination with IL-2 to
      increase HIV-specific immune responses in HIV infected patients. ALVAC vCP1452 vaccine is a
      recombinant canarypox HIV vaccine that is administered as a monthly intramuscular injection.
      The IL-2 is self administered as a daily subcutaneous injection at a low, non-toxic dose (2
      million units).

      Participants in this study are randomized to receive either ALVAC and IL-2 or placebo for the
      first 3 months of the study. During this time, participants will continue on their current
      antiretroviral medications and have monthly study visits. Study visits will include a brief
      medical interview and physical exam, administration of the vaccine, and blood tests. At the
      end of 3 months, participants will discontinue both their study medications (IL-2 and ALVAC
      or placebo) and their antiretroviral medications. This Diagnostic Treatment Interruption
      (DTI) will continue for a minimum of 3 months. During the DTI, participants will have weekly
      study visits in which viral and lymphocyte dynamics are monitored.
