        1. Improve delivery and documentation of smoking cessation advice and assistance to
           socially and economically disadvantaged patients using an AAC approach integrated into
           the EHR.

        2. Test the effect of combining the TMCP with AAC on process, Quitline referral and smoking
           outcomes.

        3. Examine the narratives of subgroups of individuals to better understand the referral
           experience and identify ways to improve it.

      The investigative research team will conduct a randomized trial to implement these strategies
      with 8 clinics serving more than 25,000 patients who smoke. The investigators use a stepped
      wedge design to first implement the AAC system change intervention and then to implement the
      TMCP in 8 clinics that are randomly assigned to a time point (step) for receiving the TMCP
      intervention. The investigators will collect data via patient survey, EHR and Quitline. The
      investigators also will conduct in-depth interviews with sub-groups of patients to inform
      ways to improve the referral process. With mounting demand for systems-based solutions for
      providing tobacco cessation assistance, it is urgent to understand how to use a systems
      approach like the AAC in a way that attends to the patient experience. The findings from this
      study will be useful to clinicians, patients, healthcare systems, and health insurance plans.
