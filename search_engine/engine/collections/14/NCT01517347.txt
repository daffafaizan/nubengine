    
      Standard risk patients over 15 years old(except Ph+ ALL, AML t(8;21) and T-ALL) undergone
      unmanipulated blood and marrow transplantation following day 60 post-transplantation were
      randomized into treated group (with low dose IL-2 treatment) or controlled group (without any
      intervention post-transplantation). The end points were safety and clinical and immunologic
      response.Following time is 24 months.

      Primary Outcome Measures:

      *To determine the feasibility and efficacy of administering an 6 course of subcutaneous IL-2
      in this patient population. [ Time Frame: 2 years ]

      Secondary Outcome Measures:

      *To assess the immunologic impact of ultra-low dose subcutaneous IL-2 in patients after
      transplantation [ Time Frame: 2 years ] Estimated Enrollment:360 Study Start Date:Jan 2012
      Estimated Study Completion Date:Jan 2016

      Intervention Details Description:

      *Drug: Interleukin-2 Dose will vary depending upon when participant enters the trial: Given
      as a daily injection under the skin for 8 weeks.

      Detailed Description:

        -  Patients receive low dose interleukin-2(Daily 1×106 IU per square meter of body-surface
           area) on days 60 after unmanipulated blood and marrow transplantation. Interleukin-2
           treatment repeats every 14 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
           unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Participants will be seen periodically while they are receiving IL-2. Physical exams and
           blood tests will be performed weekly for the first two weeks and then every other week
           until the completion of 6 course therapy.
