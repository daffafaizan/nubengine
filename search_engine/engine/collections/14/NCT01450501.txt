      Prospective observational survey

      Domain:

      Patients with an abdominal aneurysm or central vascular reconstruction in an endemic area
      after an outbreak of acute Q-fever.

      Data collection:

      In Jeroen Bosch Hospital and Bernhoven Hospital all patients with an aneurysm or central
      vascular reconstruction will be screened for Q-fever. Other hospitals in Holland will only
      check for Q-fever, if they suspect a patient of having an infected aneurysm or prosthesis.

      A patient with chronic Q-fever will enter a multidisciplinary follow-up program. First, a
      PET/CT-scan will be provided (question; signs of an infected aneurysm/prosthesis)and chronic
      Q-fever endocarditis will be excluded. The patients will initially be treated with
      doxycycline 2 dd 100mg and plaquenil 200mg 3dd for at least 18 months. A 3-monthly follow-up
      will start, in which bloodsample, ultrasounds and PET/CTscan will be performed. Data will be
      collected in SPSS for analyses.
