      I. To determine the overall response rate (ORR) based on National Cancer Institute-Working
      Group (NCI-WG) criteria in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or the Cheson criteria in small
      lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the time to first cytotoxic treatment (TFCT), progression free survival
      (PFS), and overall survival (OS) using this regimen.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive curcumin orally (PO) daily on days 1-28 and cholecalciferol PO daily on days
      8-28 of course 1 and days 1-28 of subsequent courses. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up
      to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients
      achieving partial response or better may receive treatment for a total of 2 years.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days and then every 3-6
      months for 2 years.
