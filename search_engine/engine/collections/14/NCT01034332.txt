      chemo-responsive esophageal cancer patients who are highly treatable by definitive CCRT.in
      order to test this hypothesis, we thus propose this phase II clinical study to verify the
      role of "response to one-cycle induction chemotherapy"in the prediction of pathologic
      complete response rate to CCRT and tje outcomes for patients with loco-regional esophageal
      cancer.
