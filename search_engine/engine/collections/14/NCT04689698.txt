      The weight-bearing lunge test (WBLT) was used to evaluate the change in the ankle joint's
      range of motion. A simple forward bend test - the Thomayer test - was used to evaluate the
      therapy's effect on the Superficial fascial backline described by Myers. Both tests are
      non-invasive. Both tests can be used to evaluate the outcome of a given therapy objectively.
      Both tests are elementary to perform and highly standardized and commonly used in similar
      research.

      After completing the entrance tests, the tissue flossing method is applied to each proband.
      The treatment alone does not typically last more than 20 minutes for any proband. As part of
      the tissue flossing treatment, both lower limbs of the proband will be treated. The "tissue
      flossing" method will be applied according to the authors' standard recommendations first to
      the plantar fascia area, then to the ankle joint. Finally, the last treated structure will be
      the area of fascia cruris. The duration of each application does not exceed 2 minutes. The
      order of individual applications is determined in advance as follows: right and then left
      plantar fascia, right and then left ankle joint and right and then left fascia cruris. Each
      application will be supplemented by the standard manual treatment or supplemented by the
      proband's active movement. After a total of 6 treatments, the therapeutic unit will be
      finished, and each proband will be re-examined using the same tests as before the treatment.
      If a given proband experiences any undesirable complications during the application of the
      "tissue flossing" method or applying the given method to the proband is subjectively
      unpleasant, the given treatment will be finished immediately.
