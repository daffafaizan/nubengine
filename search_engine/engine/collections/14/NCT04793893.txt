      The method used in Eye Hospital is treatment with implantation of human fresh corneal
      lenticule (min. -1.50D) taken from myopic patients in post - LASIK patients with residual
      refractive error (min. +1.0D).

      The flap of LASIK is lifted, cleaned and then the lenticule is gently inserted. The lenticule
      is positioned according the K2 values when astigmatism residual refractive error is present.
      In cases where astigmatism is not present the lenticule is positioned in central position
      under the flap.
