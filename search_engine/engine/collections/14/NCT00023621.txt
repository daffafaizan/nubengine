        -  Determine whether celecoxib prevents the development of basal cell carcinoma in patients
           with basal cell nevus syndrome.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients
      are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral celecoxib twice daily.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo twice daily. Treatment continues for 2 years in
           the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients (30 per arm) will be accrued for this study.
