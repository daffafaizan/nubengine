      diseases. Although good progress has been made in the prevention and treatment of side
      effects associated with transplantation, poor graft function (PGF) remains an important
      complication that occurs in 5-27% of patients, and is associated with considerable morbidity
      and mortality related to infections or hemorrhagic complications. Treatment of PGF usually
      involves the prescription of hematopoietic growth factors such as granulocyte
      colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), or repeat transplantation, but these methods are
      associated with short-term effect and a significant risk of graft-versus-host disease（GVHD）
      development, respectively.

      Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a form of multipotent adult stem cells that can be isolated
      from bone marrow (BM), adipose tissue, and cord blood. Clinical applications of human MSCs
      are evolving rapidly with goals of improving hematopoietic engraftment, preventing and
      treating graft-versus-host disease after allo-HSCT and so on. However, the efficacy of
      treatment of PGF that develops after allo-HSCT using expanded BM-derived MSCs from a
      third-party donor is rarely reported. If such treatment could be shown to be effective and
      safe, BM-derived MSCs could potentially be used as an universal donor material. This would
      have a major impact because the generation of donor-specific MSCs is time-consuming, costly,
      and often impractical if the clinical status of a patient is urgent.

      In the present study, the investigators will prospectively evaluate the efficacy and safety
      of ex-vivo-expanded BM-derived MSCs from third-party donors in treating patients with PGF
      after allo-HSCT.
