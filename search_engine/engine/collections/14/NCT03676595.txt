      phase), with no exercise in the subsequent 6 weeks (control phase), whereas participants in
      Group B received no IVGB intervention in the first 6 weeks (control phase), followed by 6
      weeks of IVGB intervention (intervention phase). The IVGB intervention protocol consisted of
      30-minute training sessions comprising four tasks designed to focus on lower limb strength,
      balance, and coordination training. Balance assessments consisted of both subjective and
      objective measures, including the Modified Falls Efficacy Scale (MFES), Time Up and Go (TUG)
      test, Berg Balance Scale (BBS), and Unipedal Stance Test (UST). For all participants, these
      tests were conducted at weeks 0, 6, and 12 of the experiment.
