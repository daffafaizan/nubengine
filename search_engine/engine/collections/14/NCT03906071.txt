    
      Sitravatinib (MGCD516) is an orally-available, small molecule inhibitor of a closely related
      spectrum of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) including MET, TAM (Tyro3, AXL, MERTK) family,
      VEGFR family, PDGFR family, KIT, FLT3, TRK family, RET, DDR2, and selected EPH family
      members. Nivolumab is a human IgG monoclonal antibody that binds to the PD-1 receptor and
      selectively blocks the interaction with its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby releasing PD-1
      pathway mediated inhibition of the immune response, including anti-tumor immune response.
      RTKs have been implicated in mediating an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, which has
      emerged as a potential resistance mechanism to checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Inhibition of
      these RTKs by sitravatinib may augment anti-tumor immune response and improve outcomes by
      overcoming resistance to checkpoint inhibitor therapy.
