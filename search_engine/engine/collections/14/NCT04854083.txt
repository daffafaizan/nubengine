      of semaglutide 1.34 mg/ml vs. normal dieting by randomizing the patients with both T2DM and
      overweight/obesity (BMI ≥27) (n=50, aged ≥18 to < 65 years) to two groups: both groups
      participate in a similar lifestyle treatment to induce weight loss, but one group gets an
      add-on of semaglutide 1.34mg/ml while the other is treated with placebo. Additionally, a
      reference group of healthy normal weight non-diabetic individuals (BMI ≤ 25 kg/m2, n=25, aged
      ≥18 to < 65 years) are included as controls at the initiation of the study.
