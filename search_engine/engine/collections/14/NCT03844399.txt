      ablation or biopsy procedure who are well enough to provide consent. Patients will be imaged
      during the ablation procedure according to the standard of care, and subsequent analysis will
      commence following the acquisition. The devices being used are all property of the LHSC
      health network that have been licensed for clinical use through Health Canada. In addition,
      3D ultrasound only differs from conventional 2D ultrasound in that the ultrasound transducer
      is mounted on a special assembly that moves the transducer in precise, stepped movements
      while a succession of 2D images are collected by the computer. Special software written
      specifically for 3D ultrasound precisely aligns these 2D images into a 3-dimensional volume,
      allowing the area in question to be viewed in different planes. The clinical 2D an d3D
      ultrasound images will be checked against the pre- and post- procedure CT images to make sure
      the tumours were completely removed.
