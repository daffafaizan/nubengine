      clinically confirmed EGFR mutation positive. They were divided into two groups (group A and
      group C according to if accepted NK therapy) in accordance with the principles of randomized.
      The rest 50 patients which were EGFR mutation negative were also divided into two groups
      (group B and group D) in accordance with the principles of randomized to be paired
      respectively with group A and group C. Comparison of lymphocyte number, serum tumor related
      biomarkers, circulating Tumor Cell (CTC), KPS and survival curves was carried out before
      after NK cell immunotherapy. The safety and short-term effects were evaluated followed by the
      median PDA, response rate assessment.
