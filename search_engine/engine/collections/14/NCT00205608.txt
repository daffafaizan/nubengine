      and behaviour, including attention, perception, thought processes, emotion and volition.
      Schizophrenia is a brain disease particularly involving decrement in gray matter as has been
      supported by findings from many imaging studies. The pathophysiology of these gray matter
      changes has not been clarified. Microglia activation is the consequence of virtually all
      conditions associated with neuronal injury. When activated following neuronal damage,
      microglia show a marked increase in the expression of peripheral type benzodiazepine binding
      sites which are particularly abundant on cells of the mononuclear macrophage.

      (R)-PK11195 [1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-methyl-N-1(1-methylpropyl]-3 isoquinolinecarboxamide) is a
      highly selective ligand for the peripheral benzodiazepine binding site. (R)-PK11195, labelled
      with the positron emitter carbon-11, can be used to monitor the peripheral type
      benzodiazepine receptors using Positron Emission Tomography (PET). At the Vrije Universiteit
      Medical Centre (R)-[11C]PK11195 is used for studying microglia activation in-vivo in patients
      with traumatic brain damage, minimal cognitive impairment and Alzheimer disease.

      The objective of this study is to determine whether and to what extent microglia activation
      occurs in schizophrenia. Ten patients with schizophrenia will be recruited and 10 controls,
      matched for age and gender. This is an open study. The study consists of one PET scan, which
      will be performed at the Clinical PET Centre of the Vrije Universiteit Medical Centre. All
      subjects will also get a MRI scan, which will be performed at the department of Radiology,
      University Medical Centre Utrecht.
