      antitumor activity in patients with resistance to approved second-generation tyrosine kinase
      inhibitors (TKI), dasatinib and nilotinib, including patients with the T315I mutation of the
      BCR-ABL gene (BCR-ABL). This Phase 1 study, taken together with the strong preclinical data
      that characterize ponatinib, provides the rationale for moving to a pivotal phase 2 trial of
      this agent in a population of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and Ph+ Acute
      Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) who are resistant or intolerant to prior TKI therapy and in
      those patients with the T315I mutation.

      PACE is a multi-center, international, phase 2, uncontrolled, open-label trial of oral
      ponatinib in patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) disease. The study enrolled
      449 patients. Participants assigned to 1 of 6 cohorts in accordance with disease group and
      received:

        -  Ponatinib 45 mg

      This multi-center trial is conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this study
      is 96 months after last dose of study drug treatment.
