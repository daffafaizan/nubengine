    
      The project will be realized in 2 phases.

      - The first phase of the project will consist of a sociological survey conducted with
      caregivers and patients in the care sectors participating in the study. This component
      sociological research will be carried out on the basis of in-depth interviews with caregivers
      (nurses and nursing assistants) from the departments concerned by research and patients. The
      expected sample, subject to data saturation, is 40 caregivers and 20 patients. These in-depth
      and non-directive interviews will be carried out by a sociologist and will aim to explore the
      way in which healthcare professionals see their activity professional, the relationship they
      maintain with the various members of the healthcare team, their perceptions of the body,
      privacy and hygiene of patients, but also to explore the representations of caregivers of the
      preoperative shower and of the relationship with caregivers during phases of explanation,
      possible help with the shower, and control of cleanliness cutaneous. These interviews will
      identify the representations of caregivers and patients with the aim of establishing a
      procedure for caregivers to improve care of the preoperative shower. In view of the
      statements of patients and caregivers concerning preparing for the preoperative shower and
      checking skin cleanliness during the Survey exploratory, it appears necessary to improve and
      formalize the protocol. Investigation will thus establish a base of knowledge necessary to
      establish a care procedure giving an account of the roles of each person, caregivers and
      patients.
