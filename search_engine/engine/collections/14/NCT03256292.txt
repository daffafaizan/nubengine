    
      Background: There are studies on long-term testosterone replacement in older adults with
      hypogonadism showing benefits on body composition, sexual function and mood but not on
      testosterone replacement therapy in combination with lifestyle change (diet-induced weight
      loss and exercise) in the specific population of older adults with both obesity and
      hypogonadism.

      Purpose: To determine if long-term lifestyle change and testosterone replacement therapy with
      associated improvement in physical and metabolic health can be maintained in obese older
      adults .

      Design: Overweight/obese older veteran patients with obesity and hypogonadism who are being
      followed at the endocrine clinic while receiving standard of care consisting of diet and
      exercise counseling (for healthy lifestyle change) and testosterone replacement therapy will
      be recruited for testing of physical, metabolic, cognitive/mood, quality of life, and body
      composition testing.
