      pravastatin 40mg a day, administered for 12 consecutive weeks to subjects with schizophrenia
      to examine pravastatin's effects on lowering cholesterol levels and inflammatory markers, and
      improving cognition. The study will be conducted at the Freedom Trail Clinic and will use the
      Massachusetts General Hospital Clinical Research Center. The innovative approach of using
      pravastatin to not only decrease cholesterol levels, but to decrease inflammation and improve
      cognition in patients with schizophrenia is promising and may lead to a different approach to
      treatment in this population.
