      placebo-controlled, masked, clinical trial designed to compare the benefits of base-in prism
      for patients with convergence insufficiency (CI).

      The goals of this clinical trial are:

        -  To compare the effectiveness of Base-in prism and Placebo eyeglasses for the treatment
           of CI in children

        -  To study the long-term effect of these treatments for CI

        -  To identify factors that may be associated with successful treatment of CI with base-in
           prism
