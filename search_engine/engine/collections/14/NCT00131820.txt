      school-aged children, is more prevalent in urban areas, may last for several weeks and can
      lead to serious complications. Management of this disease is further complicated by the
      emergence of multi-drug resistant strains. Vaccination of high risk populations is considered
      the most promising strategy for the control of typhoid fever. The Vi polysaccharide vaccine
      has been targeted for accelerated introduction into public health programs due to the
      following reasons: it has been shown to have consistent efficacy results even in areas of
      high typhoid incidence, is given as a single dose, lacks patent protection and requires less
      strict cold chain requirements. A cluster-randomized trial involving the Vi polysaccharide
      vaccine and an active control (Hepatitis A) was designed to determine the logistic
      feasibility of providing Vi vaccine under actual programmatic conditions among school
      students in Hue City. The vaccines used in this study are internationally produced and
      locally licensed.

      Secondary objectives of this trial are:

        -  To estimate the cost-effectiveness (cost of illness, willingness to pay, vaccine
           delivery costs, private vaccine costs, etc) of Vi vaccination

        -  To determine the effectiveness of the Vi polysaccharide vaccine following routine
           administration of a 1-dose schedule to school students (aged >=6 years)

        -  To determine the safety and immunogenicity of the Vi vaccine

        -  To study typhoid risk factors among students

      A nested, prospective matched case-control study is included in the trial in order to study
      typhoid risk factors among children in Hue City.
