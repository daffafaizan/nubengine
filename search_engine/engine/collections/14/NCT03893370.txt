      the treatment area via a radial head catheter in a small, accurately directed spray.
      Cryotherapy with the RejuvenAir® System is designed to induce a regenerative endobronchial
      tissue effect by: 1) destroying via cryotherapy the abnormal surface epithelium that has
      become overgrown with mucin producing goblet cells, 2) thus allowing normal bronchial
      epithelium with a regrowth of ciliated epithelial cells that will facilitate the removal of
      mucins from the bronchial airways and 3) lead to a reduction in chronic inflammation and its
      accompanying mucosal swelling with resultant increase in the treated airway diameter. This
      reversal of inflamed epithelium may also lessen systemic inflammation.
