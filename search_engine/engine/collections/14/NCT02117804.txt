      be screened within 24 hours of hospital admission using the Early Screen for Discharge
      Planning (ESDP). The ESDP is a four-item screening tool used to determine on admission which
      patients are likely to have complex discharge plans and could benefit from early engagement
      of discharge planning personnel. The ESDP yields a total score, and those with a score of 10
      or greater are considered to have a "high score" and likely to have a complex discharge plan.
      Those with a score of 9 or below have a "low score". The ESDP screen has been proven to be
      valid in large academic medical centers. This study will determine if the screen performs
      with the same validity in a small community hospital.
