      therapy with tamoxifen alone vs. tamoxifen plus octreotide long-acting release formulation in
      postmenopausal women with stage I/II/III breast cancer. II. Compare the toxicity and quality
      of life associated with each treatment regimen. III. Compare the effects of each treatment
      regimen on insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) physiology, and study the relationship
      between IGF-I physiology and outcome.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified by participating institution,
      when and whether they receive adjuvant chemotherapy, axillary lymph node status, and hormone
      receptor status. All patients are randomized within 12 weeks of definitive surgery. Patients
      receiving adjuvant chemotherapy prior to protocol treatment are randomized within 6 weeks
      after the last dose of chemotherapy. One group of patients receives daily oral tamoxifen,
      while a second group receives daily oral tamoxifen plus octreotide (long-acting release
      formulation) by monthly depot injection. Treatment in both groups continues for 5 years or
      until disease recurrence or development of a second malignancy. Patients are followed monthly
      for 4 months, every 4 months for 3 years, and every 6 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 850 patients will be entered over 4.2 years in this multicenter
      study.
