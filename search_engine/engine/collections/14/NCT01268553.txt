      transitioning patients with PAH from intravenous or subcutaneous prostacyclin analogs to
      inhaled treprostinil using a defined protocol. Twenty-one patients from three PH specialty
      referral centers will be enrolled in this 12-week, prospective, open-label study. If subjects
      meet inclusion and exclusion criteria, they will be switched from intravenous or subcutaneous
      prostacyclin analogs to inhaled treprostinil according to a defined transition protocol.

      Background Parenteral prostacyclin analogs improve exercise capacity and survival in patients
      with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), however practical issues can limit their
      tolerability in some patients. The prostacyclin analogue treprostinil has been shown to
      improve exercise capacity and signs/symptoms of PAH, while delivered via four 2-3 minute
      inhalation periods per day. In addition, there is extensive worldwide experience with the
      subcutaneous and intravenous forms of treprostinil, with documented safety, efficacy, and
      tolerability.

      Prior published studies have examined the feasibility of prostacyclin transitions, including
      transition from intravenous epoprostenol to non-parenteral PAH treatments, from subcutaneous
      to intravenous treprostinil, and from intravenous prostanoids to subcutaneous treprostinil.

      There is currently no published experience examining the safety, tolerability and feasibility
      of transitioning patients from parenteral prostanoids to inhaled treprostinil.
