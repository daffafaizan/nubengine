      transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) alone, peripheral nerve stimulation
      (PNS)alone, tDCS + PNS or sham tDCS + sham PNS, in patients with moderate to severe upper
      limb weakness, in a cross-over design. The working hypothesis of this proof-of-principle
      study is that either tDCS or PNS will enhance effects of functional electrical stimulation
      (FES) to a greater extent than placebo tDCS and PNS, and that the combination of tDCS and PNS
      will further improve motor outcomes than either tDCS or PNS alone.

      The interventions will consist of outpatient motor training of the paretic wrist with FES in
      four experimental sessions separated by two weeks. In each session, either active tDCS + sham
      PNS, active PNS + sham tDCS,active tDCS + active PNS or sham tDCS + sham PNS will be applied.
      PNS will be applied for 2 hours and tDCS will be applied in the last 20 minutes before
      completion of PNS. The order of the sessions will be randomized across patients. Before the
      first session, patients will be familiarized with the FES device.
