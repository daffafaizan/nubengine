      self-help smartphone-based lifestyle medicine for reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms in
      Chinese population. Prior to all study procedures, eligible participants will be required to
      complete an online informed consent (with telephone support). With an estimation of 30%
      withdrawal, around 124 eligible participants will be randomly assigned to either
      smartphone-based lifestyle medicine (LM group) or the waitlist control group (WL group) in a
      ratio of 1:1.
