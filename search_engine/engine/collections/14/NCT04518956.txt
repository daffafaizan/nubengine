      than 74% of all maxillofacial fractures.

      To compare between the effect of shockwave therapy and low-intensity pulsed ultrasound on
      healing process of fresh mandibular fractures.

      A total of 21 patients; aged between 20-40 years, who have mandibular fracture were selected
      for this study from the outpatient clinic of the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Department,
      Faculty of Dentistry, Alexandria University. In this study all patients were subjected to
      closed reduction and intermaxillary fixation. This will be followed by shockwave therapy in
      seven patients as a study group and by low-intensity pulsed ultrasound in seven patients as
      study group. Seven patients will receive neither and will constitute the control group.
