      three conditions (B-fit, education only, wait-list). Outcome measures will be administered at
      baseline, post-treatment and at a one-year follow-up. Participants will also be asked to wear
      an actigraph for 7 days at baseline, post intervention and follow-up. One or two clinicians
      will lead the intervention groups, which will each have 8-12 group members. Both the B-Fit
      and education control conditions will meet 2 hours per week for 7 weeks. Participants in both
      conditions will receive identical educational materials provided in the form of weekly
      learning packets and presented to the group by the study clinician(s). At the first meeting,
      group members will be presented with an overview of the brain, cognitive aging, mild
      cognitive impairment, and dementia. Each subsequent group meeting will cover a specific
      topic. The topics will be presented to all groups in the following order: cognitive
      engagement, exercise and cardiovascular risk factors, nutrition, social engagement, sleep and
      stress reduction, and compensatory strategy use. The control condition will include
      presentation of the educational materials followed by expanded discussion about the materials
      among group members. In contrast, each meeting of the B-Fit intervention will follow a highly
      structured format. The format is designed to aid participants in identifying and setting
      realistic and valuable individualized brain health goals and in obtaining group support
      through problem-solving, modeling and encouragement.
