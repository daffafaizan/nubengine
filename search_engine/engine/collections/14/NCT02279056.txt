      insomnia in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and co-morbid insomnia. 180 patients
      are randomized to either receive the self-help book (90 patients) or sleep hygiene advice (90
      patients). Patients fill out questionnaires about sleep and health both at baseline and after
      three months. Furthermore, CPAP compliance and OSA severity will be evaluated after three
      months of CPAP use. The aim is to evaluate whether the self-help book will improve sleep
      parameters and CPAP compliance.
