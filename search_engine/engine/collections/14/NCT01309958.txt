      caries treatment and a patient questionnaire of satisfaction with non-invasive caries
      treatment).

      Phase 2 - field tested the patient brochure

      Phase 3 - pilot tested the patient brochure, quantifying patient satisfaction with
      non-invasive caries treatments and a feasibility study that will inform the design of a
      clinical trial in dental practices envisioned for a later study.
