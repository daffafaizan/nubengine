      which operates at multiple levels of an urban food system (policy, wholesaler, corner stores,
      carryout, household, individual; in Baltimore, MD), and will improve the healthy food supply
      chain to increase affordability, availability, purchasing and consumption of healthy foods
      within low-income minority neighborhoods. Our research will include stakeholders/ partners at
      different levels, e.g., the policy, wholesaler, retailer, adult caregiver, and individual
      child levels, and then develop, implement, and assess a two year multi-level systems-based
      child obesity prevention strategy targeting minority and low-income children (predominantly
      AA). Thirty low-income, predominantly AA geographic zones will be identified ("healthy eating
      zones"). Half of these zones will be randomized to intervention, while the other half will be
      control. Within each intervention zone we will work with 3-5 small food stores and prepared
      food sources to increase access to healthy foods through wholesaler discounts, display point
      of purchase promotional materials, and provide nutrition and food preparation education
      targeting youth and caregivers. We will work with local policymakers to institutionalize and
      sustain these changes.

      The project will evaluate the impact of the program on: a) healthy food pricing and
      availability, b) low income African American adult food purchasing and preparation, and c)
      low-income African American youth diet, and associated psychosocial factors.
