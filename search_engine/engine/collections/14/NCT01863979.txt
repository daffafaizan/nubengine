      health care campus between 1.1.2007 and 31.11.2011 with the primary diagnosis with Acute
      Atrial Fibrillation and were 18 years old or older at the time of diagnosis, will be included
      in this historical prospective study.

      Patients' demographic data, medical history, permanent medications, laboratory studies,
      electrocardiographic and echocardiographic reports will be collected from the radiologic
      information system; a computed medical registry.

      complications, especially thromboembolism.
