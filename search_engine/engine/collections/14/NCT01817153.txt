    
      Two primary end points, considered as reflecting vasoreactivity will be assessed :

        1. Flow-mediated dilation (FMD) of the brachial artery, measured by ultrasound imaging,
           expressed in mm or in percentage, will be calculated from artery diameters measured
           before and after a vascular occlusion test (cuff around arm or forearm).

        2. recovery slope of thenar oxygen saturation (StO2), assessed by near infrared
           spectroscopy (NIRS), expressed in %/second, will be recorded after the vascular
           occlusion test.

      The two primary end points (FMD and recovery slope of StO2)will be assessed at the following
      timepoints :

        -  baseline (before first injection of placebo or hydrocortison)

        -  2 hours after first injection of placebo or hydrocortison

        -  2 hours after second injection of placebo or hydrocortison (i.e. 8 hours after first
           injection)

        -  4 to 6 hours after third injection

        -  4 to 6 hours after fourth injection (optional)
