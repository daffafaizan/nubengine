        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of SU5416 when combined with neoadjuvant
           radiotherapy in patients with stage IB or IIA soft tissue sarcoma.

        -  Determine the antiangiogenic effects of SU5416 in these patients.

        -  Determine any synergistic antiangiogenic effect of SU5416 with radiotherapy in these
           patients.

        -  Compare the disease-free survival, local recurrence, distant metastases, and overall
           survival rates in patients treated with neoadjuvant radiotherapy with or without SU5416.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I dose-escalation study of SU5416 followed by a phase II randomized
      study.

      Phase I:

        -  Patients undergo radiotherapy once daily, 5 days a week, for 5 weeks. Patients also
           receive SU5416 IV over 1 hour twice weekly beginning on week 1 and continuing until 2
           days before surgery.

        -  Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of SU5416 until the maximum tolerated
           dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3
           or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Phase II:

        -  Once the MTD has been determined, additional patients are accrued and then randomized to
           receive either treatment as in phase I at the MTD vs preoperative radiotherapy alone.

      All patients undergo surgical resection 70-80 days after beginning therapy. Patients with
      positive surgical margins receive additional radiotherapy daily for 8 days and SU5416 IV over
      1 hour on days 2, 4, and 9.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 18 patients will be accrued for phase I of this study within
      1 year. Approximately 28 patients will be accrued for phase II of this study.
