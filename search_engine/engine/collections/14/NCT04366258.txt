      the forehead can change blood flow in the brains of people with depression. Near infrared
      energy is like light but is not visible to the human eye. This research study will compare
      near infrared exposure with a placebo or sham procedure. The sham procedure will look and
      feel just like the near infrared procedure but won't include near infrared exposure.
