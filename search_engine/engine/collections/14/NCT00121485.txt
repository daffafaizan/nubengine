    
      The HeartMate II is a high speed, electric, axial flow, rotary blood pump. The pump drains
      blood from the left ventricular apex via a rigid inlet cannula and ejects into the aortic
      root via an outflow cannula joined to the aorta with an end to side anastomosis. Power and
      control of the pump are delivered through a percutaneous cable from the pump to the belt-worn
      System Driver.

      The Destination Therapy trial is a prospective, randomized, unblinded, non-inferiority
      evaluation of the HeartMate II LVAS, compared to the HeartMate XVE.
