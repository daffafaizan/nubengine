    
      This multicenter, randomized, open-label trial consisted of 4 dose-adjustment regimens for
      paricalcitol injection (initial doses and dose adjustment ranges were 2 ± 1 µg, 2 ± 2 µg, 4 ±
      1 µg, and 4 ± 2 µg) and 1 maxacalcitol regimen (initial dose and dose adjustment range was 5
      µg ± 2.5 µg or 10 µg ± 2.5 µg) as a reference group. Subjects who met the inclusion criteria
      were randomized equally to 1 of the treatment groups with iPTH values at screening (< 500
      pg/mL or ≥ 500 pg/mL) as a dynamic allocation factor. Study drugs were administered 3 times
      weekly (every other day) from the venous end of the hemodialysis circuit just before
      completion of the dialysis session. The initial doses were continued for 2 weeks, followed by
      dose adjustments (increase, maintenance, decrease, suspension, or resumption) by 1 µg or 2 µg
      units for the paricalcitol groups and by 2.5 µg units for the maxacalcitol group based on
      iPTH, calcium (adjusted), and phosphorus values every 2 weeks.

      Subjects in the paricalcitol groups were to be suspended from treatment if their iPTH value
      decreased to < 60 pg/mL in accordance with the guidelines proposed by the Japanese Society of
      Dialysis Therapy for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in chronic dialysis
      patients (control goal value of 60-180 pg/mL for iPTH). The dose adjustment criteria based on
      iPTH values for the maxacalcitol group were set according to the prescribing information for
      maxacalcitol (suspended when iPTH decreased to ≤ 150 pg/mL).
