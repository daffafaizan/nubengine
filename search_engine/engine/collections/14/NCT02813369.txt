    
      The overall research goal for this study is to provide additional data to characterize the
      safety of naloxegol in the indicated population, grouped by cancer or non-cancer, and within
      at-risk vulnerable non-cancer populations identified in the naloxegol risk management plan
      (RMP) by describing type and frequency of identified and potential risks (including bowel
      perforation, acute MI, stroke, CV-specific mortality, all-cause mortality, hypertension,
      opioid withdrawal, abdominal pain, diarrhea, syncope, and change in pain severity) in
      patients ≥18 years of age who were treated with opioids chronically and subsequently treated
      with naloxegol in routine post-authorization use.

      The primary objective of the study is to assess the incidence risk of bowel perforation,
      acute MI, stroke, all-cause mortality, and hypertension in patients treated with naloxegol
      (Naloxegol Inception Cohort, (NIC)), grouped by cancer or non cancer, a Concurrent Reference
      Cohort (CRC) by cancer or non-cancer, and by pre-specified non-cancer sub-populations that
      include patients aged ≥65 years, pregnant patients, patients with prior CV, patients with
      prior renal or hepatic impairment, patients with concurrent methadone use, and patients with
      concurrent use of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A inhibitors/inducer or P-glycoprotein (Pgp)
      modulators.

      An exploratory objective of the study is to assess the incidence risk of CV-specific
      mortality, opioid withdrawal, abdominal pain, diarrhea, syncope, and change in pain severity
      in patients treated with naloxegol (NIC) grouped by cancer and non cancer, a CRC grouped by
      cancer or non cancer, and by pre-specified non-cancer sub-populations that include patients
      aged ≥65 years, pregnant patients, patients with prior cardiovascular risk, patients with
      prior renal or hepatic impairment, patients with concurrent methadone use, and patients with
      concurrent use of CYP3A inhibitors/inducer or Pgp modulators.
