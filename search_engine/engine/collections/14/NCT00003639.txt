      dexamethasone with or without idarubicin in patients with stage II-IV low grade non-Hodgkin's
      lymphoma. II. Assess the additional value of a period of consolidation/maintenance treatment
      utilizing low dose interferon alfa or standard dose interferon alfa versus no further
      treatment in relationship to the duration of event-free survival in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open label, controlled, multicenter study. Patients are
      randomized into one of two arms for induction chemotherapy. Arm I: Patients receive oral
      chlorambucil three times daily for 3 consecutive days, oral idarubicin daily for 3
      consecutive days, and oral dexamethasone twice daily for 5 consecutive days every 21 days.
      Arm II: Patients receive oral chlorambucil three times daily for 3 consecutive days and oral
      dexamethasone twice daily for 5 consecutive days every 21 days. Treatment for both arms
      continues for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      After 6 courses of chemotherapy, patients are reassessed. If they have achieved maximal
      complete response or good partial response, patients are randomized into one of three arms.
      Arm I: Patients receive no further treatment until disease progresses. Arm II: Patients
      receive low dose interferon alfa subcutaneously three times per week for a maximum of 3 years
      in the absence of disease progression. Arm III: Patients receive standard dose interferon
      alfa subcutaneously three times a week for a maximum of 3 years in the absence of disease
      progression. Patients are followed every 8-12 weeks for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: There will be 200 patients accrued into this study with approximately 150
      patients entering the second phase of this study.
