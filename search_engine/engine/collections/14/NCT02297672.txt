      partial breast radiotherapy using PBSI and prospectively followed for 5 years. The primary
      aims is to evaluate implant quality according to recognized dosimetric parameters. Secondary
      aims include elaboration of approaches to different technical scenarios imposed by variation
      in seroma size, shape and location within the breast (expanding the technical manual to
      include recommended approaches to implants in different sectors of the breast and in
      different size breasts), incorporation of the use of live 3D ultrasound in the procedure (as
      opposed to current use of 2D US), assessment of patient acceptance and quality of life,
      physician assessment of cosmesis, assessment of toxicity, and recording of cost to the
      patient and health care system compared to alternate forms of breast radiotherapy.
