        -  Determine the change in proliferation in benign breast epithelial cells as measured by
           Ki-67/MIB-1 in premenopausal women at high risk for estrogen receptor-negative breast
           cancer treated with celecoxib.

        -  Determine the feasibility of this regimen by dropout rate of these patients during 12
           months of treatment and compliance.

        -  Determine the proportion of these women likely to express cyclooxygenase-2 protein
           (COX-2) in at least 10% of benign ductal epithelial cells.

        -  Compare the success rate of obtaining adequate ductal epithelial cells by random
           periareolar fine needle aspiration (FNA) and ductal lavage in these patients before vs
           after 12 months of a prevention intervention.

        -  Assess pain associated with FNA and ductal lavage in these women.

        -  Correlate, if possible, serum proteomics pattern with cytologic assessment and
           mammographic density at baseline and at 12 months in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral celecoxib twice daily. Treatment continues for 12 months in the absence
      of clinical evidence of cancer confirmed by biopsy or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are assessed at baseline and at 12 months for mammographic breast density, serum
      hormone levels, and serum IGF-1/IGFBP-3. Patients undergo ductal lavage or fine needle
      aspiration for assessment of supernatant proteomics and breast biomarkers.

      Patients are followed at 2 weeks and then annually for 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 110 patients will be accrued for this study within 10-14
      months.
