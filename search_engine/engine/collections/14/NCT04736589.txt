      metastatic breast cancer patients with abnormal activation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway after
      progression on trastuzumab are enrolled and randomized to receive the treatment of Inetetamab
      plus Rapamycin plus chemotherapy or Pyrotinib plus chemotherapy.The study aimed to access the
      efficacy and safety of Inetetamab combined with Rapamycin and chemotherapy in HER2-positive
      metastatic breast cancer patients with abnormal activation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway after
      progression on trastuzumab. The primary end point is Progressive-free Survival (PFS). The
      secondary end points are Overall Response Rate (ORR),Overall Survival (OS),Clinical Benefit
      Rate (CBR) and safety.
