    
      Healthy volunteers recruited among subjects who underwent a routine ophthalmologic evaluation
      or among students and workers both at our clinic, will undergo a series of 5 DCT to evaluate
      eventual differences among the measurements.

      A diurnal IOP curve performed though GAT, composed of 3 measurements (9am, noon, 4pm) will be
      taken 1 to 7 days before the DCT.

      At the end of the DCT measurements a last GAT will be taken to control eventual IOP changes
      versus previous GAT values obtained through the diurnal curve.

      After 3 weeks observers will contact patients to record eventual adverse events. If examiners
      consider it as necessary, a safety ophthalmological evaluation will then be performed.
