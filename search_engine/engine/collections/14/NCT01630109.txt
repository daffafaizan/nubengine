      beyond the reach of any endoscope and to an extent never before possible. It involves the
      ingestion of a small pill camera approximately the size of a large vitamin. 8 hours of images
      are transmitted to a sensor worn around the patient's waist. At the conclusion of the test,
      these images are downloaded to a computer for physician review. Meanwhile, the PillCamâ„¢
      passes naturally through the digestive system and does not require retrieval.

      Many of these pill capsule studies are incomplete due to failure of the pill capsule to reach
      the colon. Metoclopramide (brand name Reglan) is an anti-emetic that also has known
      pro-motility effects in the GI tract. The thought behind this study is that metoclopramide
      will increase the rate of passage of the pill capsule through the GI tract allowing a higher
      completion rate of the pill capsule studies.

      Patients scheduled for pill capsule endoscopy will be approached on the morning of their
      procedure to inform them of the research study. After proper consent is obtained the patient
      will receive either 5 mg Metoclopramide, 10 mg Metoclopramide, or a placebo pill 30 minutes
      prior to their pill capsule study. The pill capsule camera records 8 hours worth of data. The
      patient will return at the conclusion of their study to turn in their recorder. The ordering
      gastroenterologist will then read the study. Information regarding pill capsule completion
      (pill capsule goes through the ileocecal valve), gastric transit time, and small bowel
      transit time will then be recorded and analyzed.
