      safety and probable benefit of the Berlin Heart EXCOR® Pediatric Ventricular Assist Device
      [EXCOR® Pediatric]. The study will compare the EXCOR® Pediatric with a historical control
      population supported with extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) as a bridge to cardiac
      transplantation in children.
