      unsuitable for target therapy or immunotherapy. This study is to include patients evaluated
      as effective or stable disease after first-line chemotherapy or progressed after second-line
      chemotherapy to evaluate the efficacy and safety of receiving radiotherapy combined with
      recombined human granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor(rhGM-CSF).
