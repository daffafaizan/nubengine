      problems. Problem gambling, or compulsive gambling, is a progressive addiction characterized
      by a preoccupation with gambling, a need to bet more money more frequently, restlessness or
      irritability when attempting to stop, and gambling more to make up for losses. This study
      will compare four different combinations and durations of motivational enhancement therapy
      (MET), cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and brief advice treatments for gambling versus a
      non-intervention condition to determine which is most effective in reducing problem gambling.

      This open-label study will last a total of 9 months. Participants will be randomly assigned
      to one of four groups. Group 1 will have no intervention and will be instructed to call if
      they experience any gambling problems. Group 2 will receive 5 minutes of education on the
      hazards of heavy gambling. In addition, they will receive a 1-page brochure on problem
      gambling and its consequences. Group 3 will receive a 1-hour session of MET focused on
      increasing commitment to change by raising awareness of personal consequences of gambling.
      Group 4 will receive the same MET session as Group 3, as well as three 1-hour sessions of CBT
      focused on identifying specific social and mood cues associated with gambling. Treatment will
      end at Week 4. Participants will have two follow-up sessions held over the phone at Week 6
      and again 9 months after enrollment. Gambling behavior, employment status, alcohol and drug
      use, psychiatric problems, and family problems will be assessed.
