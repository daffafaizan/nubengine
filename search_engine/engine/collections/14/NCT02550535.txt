    
      This is a Phase I/II trial to determine safety, clinical efficacy and feasibility of a
      gene-modified WT1 TCR therapy. Following provision of informed consent, each subject will
      undergo screening assessments, including HLA-A*0201 screening (if not already documented) and
      a bone marrow aspirate/biopsy (BMA) to determine subject eligibility for the trial.

      Subjects will undergo leukapheresis within 14 days of screening.

      Once successful manufacture of the WT1 TCR-transduced T cells has been confirmed by the
      Sponsor, each subject will be administered a lymphodepletive conditioning regimen for five
      days consisting of fludarabine x 5 days 30mg/m2 intravenous (i.v.) and methylprednisolone x 1
      day 500 mg i.v. Upon completion of the conditioning regimen, subjects will receive an
      infusion of WT1 TCR-transduced T cells of â‰¤2 x 107/kg, followed by daily IL-2 subcutaneous
      injections (1 x 106 units/m2 subcutaneous (s.c.) od) for 5 days.

      If an IWG response has not been reported (one or more criteria met) at 3 months post-infusion
      then, if agreed by both the Investigator and Sponsor, the subject will be offered to have a
      repeat infusion of WT1 TCR-transduced T cells.

      Following infusion, subjects will enter an intensive period of out-patient follow-up to
      observe them for any acute complications and toxicities. Subjects will then be followed
      monthly in the clinic for the first 6 months for routine safety and clinical evaluations,
      including disease response evaluations. All subjects will be followed-up for a minimum of 12
      months.
