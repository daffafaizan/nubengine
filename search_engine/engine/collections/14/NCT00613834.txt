    
      We intend to conduct a randomized, blinded, and placebo- controlled clinical trial at Oregon
      Health and Science University and Planned Parenthood of the Columbia Willamette to determine
      if intrauterine lidocaine infusion will decrease the amount of pain subjects experience
      during and after Essure transcervical tubal sterilization.

      We plan to enroll women who have selected Essure as their method of tubal sterilization who
      will be randomized to one of two groups on the days of their procedures. Subjects in Group 1,
      the treatment group, will receive a standard paracervical block with lidocaine intrauterine
      infusion and subjects in Group 2, the control group, will receive a standard paracervical
      block with saline intrauterine infusion. The subjects will be asked to rate their pain on a
      100 mm Visual Analog Scale (VAS) at five points during the procedure and once thirty minutes
      following the procedure. Subjects will also be asked to rate their overall satisfaction with
      their care prior to leaving the recovery room.
