      cardiac failure in diabetic subjects in the absence of underlying coronary artery disease.
      Diabetes is also thought to contribute to earlier stage cardiac systolic dysfunction and/or
      to isolated diastolic dysfunction, in excess of underlying coronary artery disease and
      hypertension. More globally, it is recognized that subjects with type 2 diabetes have more
      extensive cardiovascular disease and a worse outcome for a similar level of disease than
      non-diabetic subjects. Despite this epidemiological evidence, the biological programming
      underpinning the myriad presentations of the diabetic heart' are poorly characterized in
      humans.

      Proteomics has emerged as an unbiased technology that enables the measurement of large
      numbers of steady-state protein levels. The potential to identify a diabetes associated
      proteomic signature in the heart would be a novel approach to identify putative biological
      programs altered by the diabetic state.

      A portion of the right atrial appendage is removed to insert the cardiac bypass machine
      cannula in certain cardiothoracic procedures. This tissue is usually discarded, however, we
      propose that it could be employed to examine whether otherwise similar subjects with and
      without diabetes have distinct atrial proteomic signatures. This pilot study may provide
      insight into potential biological pathways that orchestrate the worse cardiac prognosis in
      type 2 diabetic versus non diabetic control subjects.
