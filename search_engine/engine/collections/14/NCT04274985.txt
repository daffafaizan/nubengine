      pain intensity from midlevel to severe. This was seen at the end of the intervention or work
      related activities in the quarter of individuals. Therefore, the correct diagnosis of TMD is
      very important to reduce the economic cost. Fonseca Anamnestic Index (FAI) is an easy and
      understandable questionnaire. This questionnaire consists of 10 questions that provide a
      versatile evaluation of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) in the head and neck, whether there
      is pain during chewing, the presence of parafunctional habits, range of motion, joint sounds,
      malocclusion, and emotional stresses. The participants give one of the answers to the
      questions "Yes = 10 points, Sometimes = 5 points, No = 0 points". As a result of the total of
      the points, the participants are evaluated as "TMD-None = 0-15 points, Mild-TMD = 20-40
      points, Moderate TMD = 45-60 points, Severe-TMD = 100 points". The aim of this study was to
      evaluate the validity and reliability of the Turkish version of FAI. The study of validity
      and reliability is planned with 50 individuals with TMD. The sociodemographic characteristics
      of the individuals will be questioned by the investigators and then the patients will be
      evaluated with FAI, Craniofacial Pain and Disability Inventory (CF-PDI), Neck Disability
      Index (NDI), Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (TSK), Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS), Headache
      Impact Test-6 (HIT-6), Jaw Functional Limitation Scale (JFLS) (Turkish version) and Visual
      Analogue Scale (VAS). The test-retest will be re-administered by face-to-face interview
      technique after 1 week. The results will be analyzed using the SPSS version 22.0 computer
      package program.
