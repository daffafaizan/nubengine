      specialty mental health clinics based upon their lived experiences. Peer Specialist delivered
      interventions have been shown to improve patient activation in multiple studies. In August
      2014, the White House issued an Executive Action mandating that 25 VA medical centers pilot
      the deployment of Peer Specialists in their Patient Aligned Care Teams (PACTs). This project
      expands upon this nationally mandated Peer Specialist pilot with the integration of a cluster
      randomized implementation trial. This quality improvement project will evaluate the impact of
      facilitated implementation vs. standard implementation to support on the deployment of Peer
      Specialists in PACTs.

      The 25 sites will be divided into three cohorts (n=8,8,9). Each cohort will begin over three
      successive six-month blocks beginning in early 2016. Within each cohort, sites will be
      randomized to receive either facilitated or standard implementation. Facilitated
      Implementation sites will receive one year of support based on the i-PARIHS implementation
      model which includes training, implementation planning, ongoing external facilitation,
      feedback and consultation. Standard Implementation sites will receive written guidance and
      limited consultation by the investigators' team. The investigators will compare the groups on
      1) the percent of their target population that actually received PS services; 2) ratings on
      PS workload productivity including ; 3) Peer Implementation and Services scores; 4)
      assessment of Veteran's change over time on the outcome variables of satisfaction,
      activation, and functioning ; 5) qualitative analysis of how well PSs were deployed and their
      impact.
