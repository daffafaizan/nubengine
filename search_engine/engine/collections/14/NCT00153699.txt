      There were case reports of acute angle closure glaucoma (AACG) associated with its use. AACG
      is particularly common in Asians because of a higher prevalence of narrow angle., we test the
      hypothesis whether topiramate narrows the angles which may render them more likely to suffer
      from AACG.
