      uterus, most commonly over the ovaries, fallopian tubes, bladder, recto-sigmoid colon and the
      uterine myometrium.Endometriosis affects 5%-15% of women in the reproductive age causing
      pelvic or abdominal pain, infertility and occasionally rectal bleeding (if involving the
      bowel). Deep endometriosis is mostly defined as a single endometrial nodule, usually larger
      than 1 cm which is located in the vesico-uterine fold or close to the distal 20 cm of the
      large bowel. Those lesions usually infiltrate at least 5 mm into the tissue involved. The
      gold standard of diagnosis is histological proven endometriosis, usually obtained during
      explorative laparoscopy. Other imaging tests that aid in the diagnosis are trans-vaginal or
      trans-rectal sonography (TRUS), MRI & CT. Current guidelines recommends that laparoscopy with
      histology should be done to diagnose endometriosis. Negative (normal) laparoscopy is highly
      accurate in excluding endometriosis, but a positive laparoscopy (i.e. with macroscopic
      findings) without biopsy has a limited value. In practice, many clinicians refrain from
      taking biopsies due-to the risk of bowel surgery, particularly on an un-prepared bowel.
      Probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy (pCLE) has been used as a GI tract endoscopy
      additive tool in recent years, providing in-vivo cellular-level imaging, a concept known as
      "optical biopsy". considering the rectal bleeding that occurs in patients suffering from
      bowel endometriosis, usually with a normal mucosa seen at standard endoscopy (personal data),
      we hypothesized that there might be histological architectural changes in the vessels or the
      mucosa/sub mucosa in bowel endometriosis.
