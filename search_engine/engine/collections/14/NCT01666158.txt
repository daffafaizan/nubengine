    
      A randomized controlled study in patients undergoing esophageal resection for cancer to
      determine the impact of multimodal prehabilitation on functional exercise capacity and
      postoperative pulmonary complications. Patients who accept to be enrolled in the study will
      be randomized to receive either a standard nutritional intervention (including supplements as
      needed) as per current institution policy or standard nutritional intervention (including
      supplements as needed) combined with a physical exercise program before and after surgery.

      Specific aims

      The aims of this research project are the following:

        1. To determine the extent in which a multimodal prehabilitation regimen optimizes
           functional recovery in patients suffering from esophageal cancer and the incidence of
           postoperative pulmonary complications.

        2. To understand further which measures of immediate surgical recovery are sensitive to
           prehabilitation interventions, and predict change in later outcome measures.
