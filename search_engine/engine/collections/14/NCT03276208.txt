      reduce tobacco consumption. Massage therapy may not be sufficient as a stand-alone approach,
      and may be better suited partnered with a cessation approach that targets another mechanism
      of addiction, craving. Therefore, participants (N=60) will be enrolled in the Craving to
      QuitÂ® tobacco cessation program, designed by researchers at Yale, which employs a
      mindfulness-based approach to train participants to recognize and bring cravings into their
      conscious awareness. Each mother will be randomly assigned to a bi-weekly massage
      intervention (n=30) or control (n=30) group. Participants in the intervention group will
      receive two prenatal massages a week for a three-week period.
