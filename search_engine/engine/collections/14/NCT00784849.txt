      methylene blue). On the day of surgery, the patient receives a single injection of the
      experimental radioactive dye after anesthesia. The injection will be in the location around
      the breast tumor. The surgeon makes a small cut in the armpit on the side of the cancer and
      is able to locate the lymh nodes that collect drainage from the cancerous area by detecting
      lymph nodes with higher radioactivity using a hand-held detector (a Geiger counter-like
      device) and/or visually identifying lymph nodes stained blue by the dye. These lymph nodes
      are then removed and analyzed by pathologists for the presence of cancer.
