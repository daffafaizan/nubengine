    
      40 people with Multiple Sclerosis, who routinely use ambulatory assistive devices and have
      fallen at least once in the past year, will be randomized into two groups. One group will
      receive a 6-week training program in the use of their assistive device; the other group will
      be wait-listed, and may choose to receive the training after their participation in the study
      is completed. All participants will receive mobility assessments at baseline, 6-8 weeks
      later, and 3 months after that. All participants will record their falls on falls calendars.
      Participants in the training group will receive MRI scans to assess neural connectivity at
      baseline and after completion of the training program.

      The purpose of the study is to determine whether participation in the training program
      reduces falls and increases functional mobility when compared to the wait-listed group, and
      also to determine whether any change in neural connectivity, as assessed by MRI scans, is
      seen in those who participate in the training.
