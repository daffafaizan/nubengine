    
      In accordance with a split-mouth design, 50 patients will be received at least one pair of
      restorations, restored with a nanofill resin composite (Filtek Ultimate [FU]) and with a bulk
      fill resin composite (Tetric EvoCeram Bulk Fill [TB]). Each restorative resin will be used
      with its respective adhesive system according to the manufacturers' instructions. A total of
      104 class II restorations will be placed by two operators. The restorations will be blindly
      evaluated by two examiners at baseline and at 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, 6-, 7- and 8- year using
      modified US Public Health Service Ryge criteria. The comparison of the two restorative
      materials for each category will be performed with the chi-square test (a=0.05). The baseline
      scores will be compared with those at the recall visits using the Cochran Q-test.
