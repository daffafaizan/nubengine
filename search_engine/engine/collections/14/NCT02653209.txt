    
      The study is a phase 4 randomised double-blind crossover study of a DPP4 inhibitor, SGLT2
      inhibitor and thiazolidinedione as third line therapy in patients with Type 2 diabetes who
      have suboptimal glycaemic control on dual therapy with metformin and a sulphonylurea.

      600 patients aged 30-80 who have been on stable doses of 2 classes of therapy (not including
      the trial IMPs or GLP1-agonist) for at least 3 months with HbA1c >58mmol/mol (7.5%) will
      receive three double-blinded third-line non-injectable therapies. On recruitment into the
      study participants will have underlying pathophysiology assessed in a mixed-meal tolerance
      test (MMTT) and samples will be collected for baseline analysis and storage for future
      biomarker analysis and discovery. Participants will then receive 16 weeks of each
      over-encapsulated blinded therapy in random order.

      At the end of each treatment period, fasting blood will be taken to measure glycaemic
      response (HbA1c), fasting glucose and insulin concentrations trough drug levels and to
      confirm continued eligibility. Weight, blood pressure and. data about patient experience will
      also be collected including perceived side effects, preparedness to remain on therapy,
      psychological health and health related quality of life.

      At the end of the study, patient treatment preference will be recorded after feeding back to
      the patient for each of the 3 therapies their HbA1c, weight change, frequency of
      hypoglycaemias, any patient reported side effects and the patient's verdict on each therapy
      will be recorded. Each participant will be asked which treatments they would take long term
      and the reason for their preference.
