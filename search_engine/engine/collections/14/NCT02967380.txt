      I. To determine whether Gadavist® (gadobutrol) is consistent with Magnevist® (gadopentetate
      dimeglumine) or Multihance (gadobenate dimeglumine) in the preoperative grading of gliomas
      utilizing DCE MRI.

      II. To determine whether Gadavist® is consistent with Magnevist® or Multihance in identifying
      the number of cerebral metastases from a primary cancer elsewhere in the body using
      T1-weighted post contrast MRI.

      III. To determine if Gadavist® is consistent with Magnevist® or Multihance in identifying
      multiple sclerosis (MS) plaques using T1-weighted post contrast MRI.

      IV. To determine if Gadavist® produces similar MR perfusion/permeability values of MS lesions
      as Magnevist® or Multihance.

      V. Descriptive analysis to present the different rating patterns of Gadavist® versus
      Magnevist® or Multihance in differentiating therapeutic necrosis from recurrent tumor in
      gliomas utilizing DCE MRI.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive standard of care gadopentetate dimeglumine intravenously (IV) twice within 5
      minutes or gadobenate dimeglumine IV twice within 5 minutes and then undergo DCE-MRI on day
      1. Patients also receive gadobutrol IV twice within 5 minutes and then undergo DCE-MRI over
      approximately 30 minutes on day 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 7 days.
