      manifestations, there are consistent reports that persons with ASD exhibit significantly
      poorer oral health epidemiological profile when compared to their neurotypical counterparts.
      In addition to that, it has been reported that persons with ASD to substantial extent have a
      special health care needs and are almost twice as likely to have unmet oral health care needs
      as their typically developing peers regardless socioeconomic and cultural background. All
      these oral health related problems might arise because of ASD related challenging behaviors
      such as communication limitations, personal neglect, self-injurious behaviors, dietary
      habits, effects of medications, resistance to receiving dental care, hyposensitivity to pain,
      and possible avoidance of social contact. Frequently overlooked but very important reason is
      the lack of oral care providers who are willing to serve this population. As a results, oral
      health problems and unmet oral health needs transfer from childhood to adult period in
      persons with ASD.The broad, long-term objective of the investigator's proposed research is to
      describe the oral health status, oral health related behaviors, oral care delivery pattern,
      limitations of routine dental treatment and requirements for use general anaesthesia for oral
      health care of patients with ASD. Oral health status, pattern of oral health care delivery,
      dental treatment needs met in routine dental treatment and general anaesthesia will be
      analysed retrospectively on 52 participants with diagnosed ASD who were treated and monitored
      at the Paediatric Dentistry Department, Dental Clinic of Vojvodina, Faculty of Medicine,
      University of Novi Sad during 5 years (2013-2018) observation period. Conditions assessed
      will include, dental caries, missed teeth, filled teeth (DMFT index), restorations, bruxism,
      delayed eruption/missing teeth, oral infection, injuries, general health status, dental
      treatment acceptance (Frankle scale), dental treatment attendance, routine dental treatment
      and general anaesthesia dental treatment assessment.
