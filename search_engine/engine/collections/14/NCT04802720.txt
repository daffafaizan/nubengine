    
      CBT-C and ERT-C are each 8-session, individual, caregivers-directed interventions delivered
      by a trained study therapist listed on the face page and facilitated by a manualized workbook
      with between-session practice exercises. To accommodate caregivers and reduce compliance
      issues with attendance of sessions, the 8 sessions are to be completed within 8 to 16 weeks
      from initiation of the first session. Each session is 60 minutes in length and will be audio
      recorded. Specific modules and intervention components are described below. To accommodate as
      many caregivers as possible and in response to the restrictions placed on caregivers
      currently in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, sessions will be offered via
      telepsychiatry (using WebEx or Zoom).
