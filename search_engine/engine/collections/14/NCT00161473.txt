      environmental/ interpersonal factors, it is also likely that behaviorally relevant
      neurobiologic abnormalities lower the threshold for the expression of such behavior in
      Alzheimer's disease. Because of the success prazosin has had in the treatment of
      Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, it is thought that it could be used similarly with disruptive
      agitation. Originally designed to evaluate Alzheimer's disease patients in nursing homes, the
      study now includes outpatients. It is a 9-week placebo-controlled trial.
