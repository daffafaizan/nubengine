      (March 16 to May 11, 2020) decided by the Swiss Federal Government. Among the Swiss
      population, certain groups were identified as vulnerable subjects by the Federal Office of
      Public Health. This study focuses on the perceived impact of this period on health care and
      health status in a specific vulnerable group: patients under long term noninvasive
      ventilation (respiratory support) at home for chronic respiratory failure.

      The objective is to determine, in a specific vulnerable group, how the confinement related to
      the COVID-19 pandemic affected health care and health status, as perceived by the patients.

      The primary outcome is a questionnaire focusing on practical health care issues regarding
      respiratory support, health status and perception of the COVID-19 issue:

        -  Symptom score (related to noninvasive ventilation: NIV)

        -  Thymic disturbances (score of anxiety and depression)

        -  Compliance to treatment (assessed via tele-monitoring: routine procedure)

      It is a non-interventional questionnaire-based observational study of patients followed by
      the Division of Pulmonology of Geneva University Hospitals with home NIV, aged above 18 years
      of age and in a stable clinical condition.
