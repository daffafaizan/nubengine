      antiemetics that takes advantage of palonosetron's long elimination half-life (40 hours). In
      this study, patients will receive ondansetron 8mg and dexamethasone 10mg intravenously 30
      minutes prior to myeloablative preparative chemotherapy until the last day of chemotherapy.
      On the final day of chemotherapy, palonosetron 0.25mg and dexamethasone 10mg will be
      administered intravenously 30 minutes prior to the chemotherapy. If the chemotherapy regimen
      is only 1 day of the chemotherapy then only palonosetron and dexamethasone will be
      administered 30 minutes prior to chemotherapy. Dexamethasone 8mg once daily will be given
      orally for 2 days following chemotherapy. The investigators hypothesize that this antiemetic
      schedule will significantly reduce the delayed CINV compared to historical controls
