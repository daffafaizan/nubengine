      (SBRT), is a relatively recent advance in radiotherapy which allows high doses of radiation
      to be transmitted to focused areas (typically malignancies), allowing higher rates of
      tumoricidal activity, generally lower complications, and greater convenience for patients
      since it can be delivered in 1 to just a few sessions. As the radiation is administered from
      multiple directions according to stereotactic planning, high doses can be delivered to the
      tissues with rapid fall-off to relatively low doses in even nearby, surrounding normal
      tissues. This technique was initially applied to brain tumors- an application which over the
      years has met with great success. More recently, it has been applied with substantial success
      and is gaining increasing acceptance as a primary mode of therapy for stage I lung
      malignancies, and malignancies in multiple other body areas.

      In the lung, the rate of pneumonitis resulting from SABR is far lower than the rates incurred
      by conventional external beam radiotherapy. In conventional external beam radiotherapy
      reported pneumonitis rates range from 13-37% (7), depending on dose and field size. Reported
      rates of symptomatic pneumonitis after lung SABR are significantly lower and generally are
      ~5% (8). SABR does, however, typically leave a scar in the area of lung that has been treated
      (9). Importantly, there appears to be contraction of surrounding lung parenchyma into this
      scar resulting in an effect that is essentially a "lung volume reduction." One often sees
      clear loss of lung volume following any form of lung radiotherapy. With SABR, this "volume
      reduction" is achieved with a far lower risk of morbidity - in particular, less risk of
      pneumonitis.
