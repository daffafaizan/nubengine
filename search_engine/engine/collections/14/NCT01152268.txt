      design interventions for increasing fertility preservation among adolescent males newly
      diagnosed with cancer. Specifically, this study aims to investigate psychological,
      demographic, developmental, parent/guardian, provider, and medical factors predictive of
      sperm banking outcomes among at-risk adolescents with cancer. Once these factors have been
      identified, the study will develop a novel Profiling and Referral Tool. This instrument will
      ultimately serve as an intervention for both healthcare providers and families through the
      facilitation of appropriate referrals, and tailored interventions for decreasing barriers to
      sperm banking. Finally, the feasibility of the Profiling and Referral tool will be evaluated
      based on provider and family report.
