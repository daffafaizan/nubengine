      play a critical role in their children's development and are responsible for the environment
      in which they grow up. Past research shows that the personal characteristics of successful
      children consistently correlate to parental influences and behavior. Thus, the theoretical
      foundation in the Legacy study is that parents can positively influence their child's
      development. Also, parents are more likely to maintain positive parenting behaviors if they
      are part of a community greater than themselves. Legacy intervention activities are designed
      to enhance sensitive and responsive parenting, parent/child interaction, and promote a sense
      of community. Other activities include verbal and cognitive stimulation through parent and
      parent/child group meetings, visits to the home, and participation in community events.
      Legacy has both a pilot phase and a main study phase. There are 180 intervention and 120
      comparison families in the main study phase and 60 of each in the pilot phase at each study
      site, Miami and Los Angeles. The 720 participating families are those whose children, on
      average, would be expected to fall below national norms on a range of developmental outcomes.
      Process, cost, and short- and long-term outcome data are being collected.

      Comparison group: In addition to the current standard of care, the comparison families
      receive regular comprehensive child development and maternal assessments at 6 months, 1 yr, 2
      yr, 3 yr, 4 yr, and 5 yr.
