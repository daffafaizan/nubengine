      the wrist extensor muscles. The prevalence of LE is 1%-3% in both men and women, and it is
      highest in individuals aged >40 years. Pain and tenderness over the lateral epicondyle of the
      humerus at the origin of the common extensor tendon are the main characteristics. Different
      conservative treatment methods have been used for treating LE; however, no standard protocol
      has been documented in the literature. Physiotherapy programs have focused on relieving pain,
      controlling inflammation, and increasing muscle strength and endurance. The use of eccentric
      strengthening programs has been supported by current research. Eccentric exercises have been
      demonstrated to reduce pain and increase function in patients with LE. Recently,
      neuromobilization techniques have been employed in treating musculoskeletal problems and
      various compression syndromes. These techniques aimed to provide nerve gliding via joint
      movements wherein a therapist extends the nerve length in one joint while shortening the same
      in the adjacent joint. This tensioning technique increases the distance between each end of
      the nerve, and this neural elongation ability significantly decreases in patients with LE.
      Neuromobilization techniques have been also proposed to modulate central sensitization and
      peripheral pain mechanisms in musculoskeletal disorders. Given that central sensitization
      plays an important role in the increased nociceptive reflex and hyperalgesia in LE, inducing
      hypoalgesia via neuromobilization techniques may provide pain relief in the long term.
