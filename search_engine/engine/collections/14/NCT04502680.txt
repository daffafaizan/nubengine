      poor overall survival. This study explores the role of maintenance treatment with eribulin
      following standard adjuvant chemotherapy in TNBC. Patients will be randomized to receive
      eribulin mesylate maintenance treatment or observation after standard adjuvant chemotherapy.

      The primary objective is to evaluate the disease free survival (DFS). The secondary objective
      is to evaluate the overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR) and the safety of
      eribulin mesylate maintenance treatment.
