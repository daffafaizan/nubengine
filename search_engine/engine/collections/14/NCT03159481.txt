    
      Aim 1: To evaluate the efficacy of a culturally relevant, health promotion-based intervention
      to increase rates of glaucoma medication adherence among AA patients with glaucoma as
      compared to usual care.

      Aim 2: To longitudinally examine the associations between medical, demographic, cultural,
      socioeconomic, and ocular factors and objective medication adherence rates among AA's with
      glaucoma in the usual care only group. This aim will explore what factors are associated with
      glaucoma medication adherence, as defined by objective adherence measures, during usual care.
      This information will facilitate hypothesis generation and testing for future studies.

      Aim 3: To longitudinally examine the associations between medical, demographic, cultural,
      socioeconomic, and ocular factors and objective medication adherence rates among AA's with
      glaucoma in the treatment arm (those receiving the treatment intervention). This aim will
      explore what patient-related factors are more or less likely to relate to the effectiveness
      of the intervention as defined by objective adherence. This information is useful for
      understanding which patients may ultimately most responsive to the intervention.
