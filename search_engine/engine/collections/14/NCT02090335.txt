      disproportionately greater rates of medical comorbidity and disability associated with high
      rates of obesity, sedentary lifestyle, metabolic syndrome, and poor dietary habits. Despite
      greater costs and adverse outcomes associated with the combination of mental illness and poor
      physical health, little attention has been paid to the development of health promotion
      interventions designed to address the needs of the high-risk group of people with SMI. This
      study is testing an innovative approach to reducing these problems and developing a program
      that will potentially have a downstream effect on early mortality for the vulnerable
      population of people with SMI.
