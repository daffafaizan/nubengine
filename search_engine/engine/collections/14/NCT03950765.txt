      Intervention (EMI) designed the reduce the distress associated with negative emotion among
      individuals at risk for suicide that pairs content from a smartphone with a wearable
      physiological monitor. Participants will be 25 suicidal adult inpatients who will complete
      three brief therapy sessions with a study therapist and then complete exercises associated
      with the study for the duration of the inpatient period and for 28 days after they leave the
      hospital. During the time they are in the study, participants will be asked to install on
      their smartphone a mobile application to deliver the therapeutic content and will wear a
      physiological monitoring device on their wrist (Empatica Embrace) which will monitor
      objective signals of physiological distress (e.g., skin conductance).
