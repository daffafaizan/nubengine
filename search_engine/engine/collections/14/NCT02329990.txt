    
      A double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial of 63 adults aged 18 to 45 years with a
      body mass index (BMI) of 25 kg/m2 or higher and normal kidney function at the American
      University of Beirut. Participants were randomly assigned to the placebo or phosphorus group
      where daily placebo or phosphorus supplements were ingested with three main meals (breakfast,
      lunch, and dinner) for a period of 12 weeks. Primary outcomes were changes in anthropometric
      measures, blood metabolites (including lipid profile, glucose, and insulin), and subjective
      appetite scores.
