      cause major life-long disability. Afflicting mostly young people at an age when they are most
      active both in their private and professional life, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
      represents an important public health problem affecting both the patients education, working
      abilities, social life and quality of life. Previously a disease predominantly of the West,
      there is now a marked increase in the incidence of IBD in Hong Kong. The cause of this
      dramatic increase over the last decade is unknown. Genetic factors, environmental factors and
      the gut bacteria may play a role in disease development. This study aims to explore the
      factors that may be contributing to, or causing, the rise of IBD in Hong Kong. The
      investigators propose to study the gut bacteria in Chinese patients with IBD compared with
      non-IBD patients, and healthy relatives of IBD patients. IBD patients will be prospectively
      recruited, blood samples will be obtained for serology and genotyping, stool samples and
      biopsies will be collected during routine colonoscopy for microbiota analysis. Bloods, stool
      and tissue gut microbiota from non-IBD patients will be collected for comparison. Studying
      gut microbiota, genetics and environmental factors in populations with changing incidence of
      IBD offers the greatest hope of identifying potentially important causative factors for
      disease.
