      chemotherapeutic regimens for colorectal cancer such as FOLFOX or FOLFIRI. In these studies
      the addition of bevacizumab has been safe and has not resulted in significantly increased
      toxicity. Our proposed regimen has the advantage of being easily administered in the
      outpatient setting, with potential for enhanced activity and needs to be evaluated in a
      clinical trial.

      The patterns of care for CRC have shifted, IFL previously the standard of care, is now proven
      to be an inferior regimen compared to FOLFOX4. (8) The recent FDA approval in February 2004
      of bevacizumab for first line therapy, which states that bevacizumab is an approved agent in
      combination with a 5-FU regimen, gives no clear guidelines as to the "best regimen". This is
      an issue that needs to be evaluated rapidly in clinical trials, and it is clear that a
      combination of 5-FU or capecitabine with oxaliplatin and bevacizumab is one of the most
      active and well-tolerated regimens. The optimum sequence, schedule and doses needs to
      determined in clinical trials.
