      Culturally-Tailored Novel Technology (IMPACT), the investigators will pilot the feasibility
      and acceptability of a culturally-tailored, multi-behavior lifestyle intervention using a
      novel technology for 14-20 AI, HL, and White KT recipients. Because of KT recipients' varied
      stability immediately post-transplant, and the need to individually monitor their
      post-transplant immunosuppression regimen, a critical component of IMPACT will be an
      individually-tailored exercise and diet plan with a physical therapist/exercise physiologist
      and a registered dietitian nutritionist, who will work closely with the post-transplant team
      to carefully monitor patient stability. IMPACT will combine a personalized assessment of the
      patient's food preferences and access to exercise resources within their environment (based
      on a standard list of factors developed by the nutrition and rehabilitation experts) along
      with clinical specifications from the transplant team. The study is innovative because it
      addresses previous limitations, while adapting the intervention to meet the needs of the
      culturally-diverse ESKD population. The final innovation of the IMPACT Pilot is the use of
      the Twistle Patient Engagement Platform to follow-up with participants between their
      scheduled appointments, ensure adherence to the intervention, collect all questionnaire data,
      and enhance participant retention.
