      will develop two modes of eHealth education. Education mode 1 (control) is comprised of
      participants educated using CHR's current traditional face-to-face delivery method, with
      printed materials and written log journals. These participants will be trained to use the
      University's web portal if they elect to access internet-based diabetes information. This
      allows for the tracking of the type and amounts of diabetes information accessed by
      participants. Education mode 2 (static interface) participants will be educated using
      digitized forms of the traditional materials provided by CHR as well as an electronic log
      journal (e-journal) where participants will record their diabetes-related outcomes and
      behavioural information. Education mode 2 will be assessed and approved by CHR. Education
      mode 3 (dynamic interface) participants will be educated using the digitized traditional
      materials from education mode 2 as well as an enhanced dynamic e-journal (visualization of
      blood glucose and alerts). In addition, this mode will provide informative disease-related
      internet sites and diabetes news and articles vetted by the medical team. Participants and
      health professionals will then be able to electronically discuss the content and quality of
      this information (discussion board). New sites and articles will be added on an ongoing
      basis. Participants will also have access to a chat room that will encourage information
      sharing with other education mode 3 participants and health professionals at CHR. Education
      mode 3 will be assessed and approved by CHR.
