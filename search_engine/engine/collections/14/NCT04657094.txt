      I. Assess the efficacy of acalabrutinib in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients with
      relapsed or refractory autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate acalabrutinib's ability to induce short term and sustained hemoglobin response.

      II. Assess the toxicity of acalabrutinib. III. Evaluate efficacy of acalabrutinib in CLL.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Assess the effect of acalabrutinib on T-cell functionality in an autoimmune disorder.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive acalabrutinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Treatment repeats
      every 28 days for up to 12 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Treatment with acalabrutinib may be continued beyond 12 cycles for a maximum of 36
      cycles if, in the opinion of the treating physician, the patient might benefit from ongoing
      therapy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and at least every 4
      months for up to 12 months.
