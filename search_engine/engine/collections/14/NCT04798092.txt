    
      Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a disorder of one or more of the parathyroid glands.
      The parathyroid gland(s) becomes overactive and secretes excess amounts of parathyroid
      hormone (PTH). As a result, the blood calcium rises to a level that is higher than normal.
      PHPT is associated with several other metabolic complications as osteoporosis, kidney stones,
      hypertension, insulin resistance, cardiac calcifications, cardiac arrhythmias, and kidney
      failure. Renal function deterioration over time has also been reported. However, the role of
      parathyroidectomy on renal function remains controversial in patients with PHPT. In some
      studies, surgical cure of PHPT has been shown to halt renal function deterioration in
      patients with coexisting renal disease. On the other hand, other studies showed no
      significant impact of parathyroidectomy on renal function. Consequently, the goal of this
      study was to evaluate renal function before and after parathyroidectomy in a large cohort of
      patients with pHPT.
