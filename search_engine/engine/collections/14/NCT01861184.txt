      Overall research aim

      To analyse pneumococcal carriage rates in patients hospitalised with LRTI.

      Primary endpoint

      Rate of pneumococcal carriage in patients hospitalised with LRTI and age matched controls.

      Secondary endpoints

        1. Density of pneumococcal carriage in patients hospitalised with LRTI and age matched
           controls

        2. Alterations of T cell function (Th1, Th17, T regs) in LRTI patients and age matched
           controls (versus younger adults as part of our existing 'P4' study).

      Study design Patients hospitalised with LRTI between November 2012 and April 2014 will be
      approached within 72 hours of admission.

      Patients recruited into the study will consist of those hospitalised with LRTI and a control
      group of age matched patients (within +/- 10 years) hospitalised for reasons other than
      respiratory infection.
