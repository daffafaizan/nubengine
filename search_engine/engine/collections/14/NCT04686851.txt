      interventions on prognosis in the older frail cancer patient in a Randomized Clinical Trial
      design.

      Patients screened frail with the Geriatric 8 screening tool, aged 70 or more, and found
      eligible for oncologic treatment, will be included. We plan to enrol a total of 322 cancer
      patients for 12 months. Participants will be allocated randomly to either interventional or
      control group.

      Participants in the interventional group will be offered a Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment
      and intervention at the start-up of cancer treatment. The Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment
      will be an add on to standardized cancer treatment offered at the Oncologic Outpatient Clinic
      at Odense University Hospital.

      Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment will be performed by a team consisting of a doctor, nurse
      and physiotherapist. If needed, referral to a dietician or an occupational therapist for
      further evaluation will be made. The health issues are assessed using validated tests based
      on a Danish version of the Geriatric Core Dataset (G-CODE). Follow-up on Comprehensive
      Geriatric Assessment is scheduled for one month after initial evaluation.

      The randomized groups will be compared with respect to primary and secondary endpoints.
