      disease is increasing year by year, seriously affecting people's quality of life. The
      systematic treatment of psoriasis in modern medicine is limited of wide application due to
      the adverse reactions of different degrees and the high economic cost.

      Chinese Medicine (CM) has unique advantages in treatment of psoriasis. On the basis of CM
      principle--"Blood Differentiation and Treatment" in psoriasis and the combination of clinical
      experience, Chinese famous professor Wanzhang Qin proposed the "New Blood Syndrome Theory" in
      psoriasis--the psoriasis based in blood, with blood heat first, and blood stasis throughout
      the whole process of psoriasis. This study will form a systematic report on the diagnosis and
      treatment of psoriasis with the New Blood Syndrome Theory; theoretically verified by
      prospective cohort studies, a theoretical system of the New Blood Syndrome Theory for
      psoriasis will be constructed.

      Objectives of this study are to establish a multi-center clinical registration platform, to
      form the real world evidence of New Blood Syndrome Theory intervention in psoriasis, and to
      evaluate the therapeutic advantages of New Blood Syndrome Theory therapy in the clinical
      effective and recurrence rate of psoriasis vulgaris.
