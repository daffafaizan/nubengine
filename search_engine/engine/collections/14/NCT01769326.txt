      at home after stroke. This study involves research because it will test two experimental
      devices, the MusicGlove and the Resonating Arm Exerciser (RAE), compared to conventional hand
      and arm exercises. The MusicGlove is a glove that measures finger movements and allows its
      user to play a musical computer game using those movements. The RAE is a lever that attaches
      to a manual wheelchair with elastic bands and can be pushed back and forth to exercise the
      arm.
