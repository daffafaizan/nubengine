      drug-eluting stent, simple balloon dilatation, CABG) is still not defined. The most used
      option nowadays is the implantation of a drug-eluting stent (DES). However, this procedure
      implies application of a double metal layer in the vessel wall, which is linked to delayed
      healing. Furthermore there might be a higher risk of malapposition of both struts of the bare
      metal and the newly implanted drug-eluting stents. These phenomenon's might give rise to an
      increased risk of stent thrombosis in this patient population. Recently, drug-eluting
      balloons (DEB) were proposed as a new treatment strategy for bare metal stent restenosis. The
      initial results of this technique look promising.

      Aim: To compare healing processes after treatment of BMS ISR with balloon dilatation using
      DEB versus implantation of DES.

      Methods: 50 patients with BMS restenosis (SVG and bifurcation lesions will be excluded) will
      be randomized into two treatment groups: SeQuent Please drug-eluting balloon dilatation
      (group I) versus implantation of an everolimus-eluting Xience V stent (group II). At 9
      months, a control angiography with OCT pullback of the treated segment is planned.
