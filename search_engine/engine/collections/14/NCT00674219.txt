      medications for the treatment of OCD. In an open-label trial of riluzole, a glutamate release
      inhibitor, seven of 13 adult patients with OCD improved, and five were categorized as
      treatment responders. Another open trial found riluzole to be effective for four of six
      children with treatment-refractory OCD. N-acetylcysteine, an agent that likely attenuates
      glutamate neurotransmission, was effective as an augmentation in one patient with OCD. Two
      case reports described memantine treatment of OCD. Poyurovsky et al. reported improvement
      with memantine augmentation in one patient with treatment resistant OCD, while Pasquini and
      Biondi noted improvement in one OCD patient with checking compulsions but not in one with
      contamination obsessions. There have been no controlled or open-label trials of memantine in
      OCD reported thus far.

      Few studies have examined the efficacy of anti-glutamatergic agents in GAD. In an open-label
      trial of riluzole treatment in 18 patients with GAD, twelve patients responded and eight
      achieved remission. A double-blind, controlled study found that LY354740, a metabotropic
      glutamate receptor 2/3 (mGlu2/3) agonist, was significantly more effective than placebo for
      GAD. No studies of memantine in GAD have been reported thus far. We hypothesized that
      treatment with memantine would result in significant symptom reduction in both OCD and GAD.
