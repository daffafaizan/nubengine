    
      This is an exploratory, national, unicentric, open study, to be conducted at the Instituto de
      Ensino e Pesquisa do Hospital Sírio Libanês, aiming to determine a method of prospective
      measurement of autonomic responses resulting from exposure to LEEF modulated at specific
      frequencies and with sequential exposure (frequency to frequency) in healthy individuals and
      patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma , followed by new exposure with a new set of
      specific frequencies determined by mathematical method.

      This study aims to create a method for non-invasive diagnosis of biofeedback effect exposure
      to LEEF modulated to specific frequencies in individuals exposed to hepatocellular carcinoma
      -specific frequencies in increasing sequential manner, frequency to frequency in patients
      with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma and healthy individuals.

      Patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma will be exposed to specific LEEF-modulated
      frequencies (3 to 10 Hz difference) to identify the optimal frequency associated with greater
      response to the biofeedback effect in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.

      Patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma will be exposed to modulated LEEF at a new
      set of specific frequencies determined by mathematical method to identify biofeedback effect
      in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.

      This study does not propose to study a therapeutic procedure. For this reason, no
      evolutionary clinical data will be analyzed during and after study intervention.

      This study will be conducted in an outpatient setting and is expected to last 24 months.
