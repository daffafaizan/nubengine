      the time of hospital admission and the availability of an blood type compatible product.
      300mL plasma units of COVID-19 convalescent patients will be utilized for transfusion. During
      a period of 14 days, the patient will be eligible to receive up to 10 units of plasma, to be
      completed with 4 hours as per institutional transfusion standard operating procedures.
      Transfusion by apheresis (plasma exchange) may be employed to reduce the risk of volume
      overload. The number of units to be used will be determined by the study team based on
      protocol inclusion and exclusion criteria, and clinical evaluation of the patient's severity
      and response.

      Subjects will be followed for at least 60 days or up to 3 months following initial
      transfusion for adverse event monitoring and data collection.
