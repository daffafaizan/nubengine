      Baseline 1 (BL1) in a 1:2 ratio to receive:

        -  I1: HAART or

        -  I2: Enfuvirtide (90 mg twice a day) + HAART.

      Participants who achieved viral suppression < 50 copies/mL by week 24, confirmed by week 28
      or earlier, qualified to enter the Maintenance Phase which started at Baseline 2 (BL2), four
      weeks after confirmation of response. The Maintenance Phase consisted of three treatment
      groups:

        -  M1: HAART continued (patients from I1)

      Patients on ENF+HAART (I2) were re-randomized (at a 1:1 ratio) at BL2 to:

        -  M2: Enfuvirtide stopped and HAART continued

        -  M3: Enfuvirtide + HAART continued.

      The duration of the Maintenance Phase was from BL2 up to 48 weeks after BL1. BL2 could start
      at the earliest at Week 12 and at the latest Week 32.
