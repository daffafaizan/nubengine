      throughout the trial. Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive filorexant or
      placebo for a 6-week treatment period. Following completion of the treatment period,
      participants will enter a 2-week double-blind run-out period. During the run-out period,
      participants who received placebo in the 6-week treatment period will continue to receive
      placebo and participants who received filorexant in the 6-week treatment period will be
      randomized to receive either filorexant or placebo in a 1:1 ratio.
