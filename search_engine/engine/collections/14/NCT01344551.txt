    
      This is a randomised controlled double blind cross over study investigating the acute effects
      of high flavanol (495mg) compared to low flavanol (23mg)cocoa drink on cognitive function in
      a healthy older adult population (n=60). The primary outcome measure of this study is to
      determine the effects of the flavanol intervention on cognitive measures of executive
      function and attention and the secondary measures of blood pressure and to determine whether
      any observed effects are paralleled by plasma flavanol levels.
