      'previvors' (people with HCS that do not yet have a cancer diagnosis). This will enable
      prediction of cancer onset so that patients and their doctors can make decisions to treat or
      prevent the cancers. HCS patients will be recruited from across Canada to provide blood
      samples before and after cancer diagnosis. In parallel, there will be development of a
      circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) -based test to detect early stage cancer and evaluation on the
      cost-effectiveness and feasibility of integrating such screening protocols into routine
      clinical care. In concert, consultation with patients and health care providers will occur to
      create recommendations for use within clinical care.
