      and morphology of resistance arteries, and to look for their mechanistic basis. We expect
      that HRT with estrogens or in combination with MPA may benefit the function of resistance
      arteries and may preserve the morphological integrity of endothelial cells by regulatory
      actions on the cytoskeleton.
