      Normally such pain is controlled when subjects receive repeated doses of opioid analgesics.
      However, opioid therapy is commonly associated with side effects such as nausea, vomiting,
      sedation, constipation, addiction, tolerance, and respiratory depression. CG5503, a newly
      synthesized drug with an immediate release (IR) formulation, also acts as a centrally acting
      pain reliever but has a dual mode of action. The aim of this trial is to investigate the
      effectiveness (level of pain control) and safety (side effects) of CG5503 IR 75mg compared
      with no drug (placebo) or one dose of morphine (an opioid commonly used to treat
      post-surgical pain). This trial is a randomized, double-blind (neither investigator nor
      patient will know which treatment was received), active- and placebo-controlled,
      parallel-group, multicenter trial to evaluate the treatment of acute pain after bunionectomy.
      The trial will include a blinded 72 hour inpatient phase immediately following bunionectomy,
      during which subjects will be treated with either 75-mg CG5503 IR, a placebo, or 30-mg
      morphine, and pain relief will be periodically assessed. Assessments of pain relief include
      the pain intensity numeric rating scale (PI), pain relief numeric rating scale (PAR), and
      patient global impression of change scale (PGIC). Safety evaluations include monitoring of
      adverse events, physical examinations, and clinical laboratory tests. Venous blood samples
      will be collected for the determination of serum concentrations of CG5503 and morphine. The
      alternative trial hypothesis is that at least 1 dose strength of CG5503 will be different
      from placebo in controlling pain at 48 hours.
