      recommended levels of sleep (7-8 hours) in a crossover designed study requiring adults to
      maintain each prescribed sleep duration for one week. Ambulatory brachial and central aortic
      blood pressure will be measured during sleep, while cerebrovascular reactivity, carotid
      artery hemodynamics (e.g., flow pulsatility), aortic pulse wave reflections, cognitive
      function, and peripheral vasodilatory function will be measured before and after each sleep
      protocol. A secondary objective of this study is to understand whether aerobic exercise can
      improve vascular function under conditions of different sleep durations. This information
      will shed light upon the impact of sleep parameters on exercise-induced improvements in
      vascular function.
