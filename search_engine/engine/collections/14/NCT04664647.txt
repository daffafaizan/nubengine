      electrophysiological examination and neuroimaging findings of patients with CCPD. And we will
      detect antibodies to aquaporin 4(AQP4), myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG),
      neurofascin-155 (Nfasc155), neurofascin-186 (Nfasc186), and myelin-associated glycoprotein
      (MAG) in patients with CCPD.
