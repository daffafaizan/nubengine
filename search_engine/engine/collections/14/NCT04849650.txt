    
      This will be an open-label, non-randomised, pharmacokinetic study in

        -  6 adult subjects with severe renal impairment and end-stage renal disease (i.e., eGFR <
           30 mL/min/1.73 m2) without dialysis.

        -  6 matched healthy subjects (control group).

      Each subject will be given a single dose of 10 mg IV Amisulpride, followed by a single dose
      of 10 mg oral Amisulpride given 24 hours later.

      Subjects will be admitted to the clinic on Day -1. Dosing will start the following day (Day
      1). Serial blood samples will be taken during Days 1-3 to assess the pharmacokinetics of
      Amisulpride. Subjects will remain in clinic over the duration of the study and will be
      discharged when the final blood sample is drawn on Day 3.

      The tolerability /safety of Amisulpride will be assessed by clinical chemistry and
      haematology assessments, vital signs, electrocardiograms (ECG), physical examination and
      adverse event reporting.
