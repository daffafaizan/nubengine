      effectiveness of inpatient palliative consultative services (IPCS) and to test the
      incremental effectiveness and costs of a simple, scalable method to increase IPCS utilization
      among properly selected patients. The REDAPS trial will also compare the effectiveness of
      different palliative care team structures and services and identify patient subgroups most
      likely to benefit from IPCS. To achieve these goals, the investigators will conduct a
      clinical trial at 11 Ascension Health hospitals using the same electronic health record.
      Participating hospitals first contribute a minimum of 4 months of data under the control
      paradigm (opt-in model), where physicians must identify patients who may benefit from
      palliative care consultation and actively order such services. Then, using a stepped-wedge
      design, the hospitals are randomly assigned to begin the intervention in intervals spaced
      approximately 2.7 months apart. During the intervention, patients meeting consensus criteria
      for eligibility for palliative care consultation are identified by the electronic health
      record, a consultation is ordered by default, physicians may cancel the order after being
      alerted to it, and patients or family members may decline such services. By the end of the
      trial, all hospitals will have utilized the intervention paradigm of palliative care
      consultation for at least 4 months. The REDAPS trial will compare outcomes (clinical,
      economic, and process measures) before and after implementation within hospitals, as well as
      comparisons among hospitals at given time points.
