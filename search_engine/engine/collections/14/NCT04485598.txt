      ischemic stroke and TIA patients across china. The purpose of this study is to determine the
      monogenic disorders incidence of Chinese early-onset stroke patients. We plan to
      consecutively enroll more than 500 patients with early-onset stroke(in the 18- to 45-year age
      range) admitted in stroke units within 7 days after symptoms onset in participating centers.
      Patients fulfilling all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be
      referred for targeted sequencing using 'cerebrovascular disease panel'. When one or multiple
      pathogenic or possible pathogenic exonic mutations are found, a Sanger Sequencing (SS) on
      somatic DNA from peripheral blood leukocyte of the index case and affected relatives will be
      performed for the screening of the same mutations. And the sporadic patient's mutations will
      be checked by SS in the unaffected family members. By analyzing the sequencing results, we
      intend to identify monogenic causes causing early-onset stroke and develop clinical
      algorithms that might assist the clinician in deciding in which early-onset stroke patients
      testing for monogenic causes of stroke.
