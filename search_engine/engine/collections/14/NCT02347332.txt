    
      This study was designed to compare the OS of VFL plus MTX versus MTX alone in patients with
      SCCHN who had failed platinum-based chemotherapy.

      The trial was designed in accordance with current standards used routinely in oncology phase
      III trials and used established methods of assessment. The RECIST (version 1.1) and NCI CTCAE
      (version 3.0) guidelines are internationally recognised methods for assessing efficacy and
      tolerance, respectively.

      The patient population was appropriate for this type of phase III study and included adult
      patients with recurrent and/or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity,
      oropharynx, hypopharynx or larynx, who had received prior chemotherapy regimens with
      documented progression. This population of patients was considered appropriate to meet the
      study objectives.

      Recent preliminary phase I results of the VFL plus MTX combination in SCCHN, reported in a
      clinical review, showed encouraging antitumour activity and an acceptable safety profile A
      number of chemotherapy agents have been reported as having single-agent activity in SCCHN.
      However, reliable evidence of efficacy in the second-line setting is lacking, and there is
      currently no established standard of care. MTX used alone as the reference regimen at a dose
      of 40 mg/m2/week can be considered as the best available evidence-based option. Also, other
      trials using this comparator have demonstrated that it is generally accepted as a reasonable
      choice, and is often used in general practice.

      The efficacy and safety assessments employed in this study are standard measures routinely
      used in studies of this type
