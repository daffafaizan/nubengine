      surgery(BCS) with lymph node dissection and with or without following by radiotherapy(RT).
      (Morrow,2004). Results of BCTs demonstrate high rates of local tumor control with
      satisfactory cosmetic results. (Morrow,2004) Nowadays, the local treatment of breast cancer
      has slowly accepted from radical mastectomy with lymph node dissection to (BCT) in the last
      100 years. (Morrow,2004) After surgical intervention for breast cancer carcinoma, the most
      frequent morbilities are lymphedema of the unilateral upper extremity and shoulder
      dysfunction. (Wingate L,1985; Grube, 2004)From the perspective of the Institute of
      Medicine's(IOM), the outcome measures shifts from the impairment-based measures to functional
      limitation measures. (Jette AM,1995) Base on the third element in Donabedian's framework of
      quality of physical therapy care, the determination of outcomes in terms of death, morbidity,
      disability, or quality of life. (Jette AM,1995)Although shoulder active range-of-motion
      exercises could start at the day right after any type or level of lymph node dissections for
      breast cancer patients, (Staradub VL, 2004;Wingate L,1985) in my literature review results,
      no functional evaluation questionnaires that was sensitive enough to detect the disabilities
      resulting from lymph node dissections at post BCS 2 days. So we revise 8 disability items
      from SPADI into Chinese to develop a simple self-completion questionnaire for the assessment
      of restriction in daily activities resulting from breast conservative surgery.

      The purpose of this study was to validate the score obtained from this questionnaire by
      testing restriction of shoulder active flexion and abduction on examination at post BCS 2
      days correlates with disability score.
