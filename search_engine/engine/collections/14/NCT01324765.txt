      intervention (TARGET) and those receiving a similar amount of supportive intervention (SGT).
      We will assess the efficacy of treatment by determining if those receiving the TARGET skills
      training show an improvement in functionality, as compared to those receiving only supportive
      intervention. We will measure this by analyzing PTSD symptoms, psychological distress,
      psychosocial functioning, and social/legal adjustment and services using structured
      interviews, self-report questionnaires and qualitative questions. Questionnaires are listed
      below in the outcome measure's section. We will collect follow-up data on program
      participants who successfully finish the program at York. For those offenders who discharge
      into the community directly from York, we will collect follow-up data on program participants
      through CDOC Parole or Probation records. Statistically we anticipate a medium effect size
      difference between the treatment conditions.
