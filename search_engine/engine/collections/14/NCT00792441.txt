      lung complications and standard weaning protocols are not successful in a number of patients.
      The strength of the inspiratory muscles is important factors in the success of weaning.
      Although, the inspiratory muscles are trained by manipulating the ventilator sensitivity and
      made of ventilation in the traditional protocol, the muscle function might not improved
      sufficiently to sustain independent and spontaneous breathing. Consequently, specific
      inspiratory muscle training is indicated and has been studied in patient with weaning
      failure. However, there is little evidence available and no firm conclusion can be drown.
      Therefore, the purpose of this study is to determine whether specific IMT training using the
      local made loaded threshold IMT device can improve lung function and accelerate the weaning
      process.
