      the effects of lemon essential oil on test anxiety are extremely limited. In this study, the
      effect of a different aromatherapy application on reducing test anxiety was tried to be
      determined by using lemon essential oil. It is envisaged to provide an alternative
      aromatherapy application to students and educators to reduce test anxiety through the results
      obtained in the study.
