      maintenance therapy represents the current standard in clinical VCA. Our protocol is
      different from the existing conventional drug treatments used in MEG allotransplantation in
      that it combines donor bone marrow infusion with an immunosuppression sparing protocol. The
      primary goal of this pilot clinical trial is to determine the feasibility of using allogeneic
      penile tissue to repair/replace irreversibly damaged external genitalia. Enrolled and
      transplanted subjects will be followed for their lifetime as a transplant patient.
