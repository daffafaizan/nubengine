      combination with trastuzumab and paclitaxel in a randomized, placebo-controlled, neo-adjuvant
      study in women diagnosed with primary breast cancer >1.5 cm (by US or MRI) with centrally
      confirmed HER2 overexpression or amplification, who have not previously undergone treatment
      for invasive breast cancer.

      Prior to the initiation of paclitaxel, there was a 6-week "biologic window" with trastuzumab
      plus BKM120 or placebo only. The study was conducted separately in two cohorts (PIK3CA
      mutated and PI3K3CA wild-type) using a two-stage approach. Within each cohort patients were
      randomized into one of the following treatment arms:

      Arm 1: BKM120 plus trastuzumab for 6 weeks followed by BKM120 and trastuzumab plus weekly
      paclitaxel for an additional 12 weeks.

      Arm 2: BKM120 placebo plus trastuzumab for 6 weeks followed by BKM120 placebo plus
      trastuzumab plus weekly paclitaxel for an additional 12 weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients were to have undergone definitive surgery.
