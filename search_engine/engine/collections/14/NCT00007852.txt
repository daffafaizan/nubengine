      refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with rituximab and high-dose carmustine,
      etoposide, cytarabine and melphalan followed by autologous bone marrow or peripheral blood
      stem cell transplantation. II. Determine the toxicity profile of this regimen in these
      patients. III. Compare the levels of soluble CD20 antigen and rituximab blood levels with
      patient outcomes in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive two doses of rituximab IV over 3-4 hours 1 week apart. Stem cells
      from the peripheral blood or bone marrow are collected at least 1 week after the second dose
      of rituximab. Following stem cell collection, patients receive a third dose of rituximab IV
      as above between days -10 and -6. Patients then receive high-dose chemotherapy consisting of
      carmustine IV on day -6, etoposide IV twice daily and cytarabine IV on days -5 to -2, and
      melphalan IV on day -1. On day 0 patients undergo autologous bone marrow or peripheral blood
      stem cell transplantation. After transplantation, patients receive a fourth dose of rituximab
      as above at approximately day 30, and then weekly over 4 weeks at approximately 6 months in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed at 1 year
      and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 23-40 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.
