      management of patients with acute respiratory failure. It allows reaching a high flow air up
      to 60 liters / min via a nasal cannula with a humidification and warming of the air
      administered. It has a number of physiological effects such as wash out of anatomical dead
      space, generation of a small PEEP and high inspired fraction of oxygen which enhances
      compliance and reduces inspiratory efforts.

      NIV is the corner stone in the treatment of severe COPD exacerbation. Nevertheless, prolonged
      application of the facial mask expose to local complications and intolerance which can be a
      cause of failure, so reducing the duration of exposure to this procedure is important.

      The role of HFNC in supplementing NIV effect during hypercapnic respiratory failure has not
      been assessed. Much of the data available on HFNC are about hypoxemic respiratory failure.

      Because of its physiological effects, it can be hypothesized that HFNC in addition to NIV can
      shorten its duration by facilitating carbon dioxide clearance.
