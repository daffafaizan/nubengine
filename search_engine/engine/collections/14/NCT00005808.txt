      I. Determine the optimal dosage with the least toxicity of lutetium texaphyrin as well as the
      length of time following its systemic injection that provides the maximum differential in
      drug uptake between the target dysplastic squamous cells and normal squamous epithelium when
      given to patients with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN).

      II. Determine, by histomorphometry, the photodynamic light dose that demonstrates the
      greatest treatment selectivity between normal cervical epithelium and CIN with the least
      amount of cervical pain and necrosis.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of lutetium texaphyrin (part 1) followed by a
      dose-escalation study of light fluence (part 2).

      Part 1: Patients receive lutetium texaphyrin IV over 5-20 minutes. Patients undergo in vivo
      tissue assessment by spectrometer at 0, 1, 3, 5, 12, and 24 hours and loop electrical
      excision procedure (LEEP) at 24 hours after lutetium texaphyrin infusion.

      Part 2: Patients receive lutetium texaphyrin IV over 5-20 minutes. A laser delivers 730 nm of
      light to the cervix for 4, 8, or 16 minutes. Patients undergo LEEP at 4, 8, or 12 hours after
      exposure of the cervix to the light source.

      Cohorts of 9 patients receive escalating doses of lutetium texaphyrin (part 1) and then light
      fluence (part 2) until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of each is determined. The MTD is
      defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 9 patients experience dose-limiting
      toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 48 hours, weekly for 1 month, and then at 4 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 54 patients will be accrued for this study.
