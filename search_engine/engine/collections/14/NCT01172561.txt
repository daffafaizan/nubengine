      the proportion of Appalachian women, age 18 and older, who receive Pap smears at appropriate
      intervals and return for follow-up care when necessary. The project was implemented in
      Appalachian Ohio, a mainly rural and underserved area with a population comprised of 1.5
      million adults, aged 18 and older, and used community-based participatory research (CBPR) and
      community relationships already established in the area by Center investigators.
