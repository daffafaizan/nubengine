      cardiac surgery. But CPB itself is associated with a series of problems of organs, such as
      hyperglycemia induced by neuroendocrine stress. The research showed that hyperglycemia
      induced by stress would cause a worsened hospital outcome for patients undergoing cardiac
      surgery. Intraoperative and postoperative glucose control is beneficial for patients.

      It has been for more than 40 year since the first application of glucose - insulin -
      potassium (GIK) in cardiac surgery but the clinical application of GIK shows controversial
      results. The beginning time of application and the ratio of glucose and insulin may be the
      key reasons for the controversy. In our pilot trial of 40 valve replacement cases, we found
      that perioperative treatment of GIK with an insulin-glucose ratio of 1:3 showed beneficial
      effects during heart surgery. Therefore, the investigators are planning to continue to test
      this modified GIK regimen for more heart surgery patients and determine whether GIK may have
      cardioprotective effects on patients undergoing CPB surgery.

      Myocardial biopsies for biological mechanism analysis will be performed prior to CPB, 15 min
      after aortic cross clamp application and 15 min after reperfusion only in a small cohort.
      Myocardial biopsies will be snap frozen or fixed.
