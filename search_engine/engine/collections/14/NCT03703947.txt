    
      BIOMArCS-AAA is an observational, multicenter study. Patients with an abdominal aortic
      aneurysm (AAA) will be recruited through the vascular surgery outpatient clinic of Erasmus MC
      and Maasstad Ziekenhuis, the Netherlands. The prospective, longitudinal part of the study
      will include an arm with 120 AAA watchful waiting patients and an arm with 120 AAA patients
      undergoing endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR), both with a 24-month follow-up period.
      Clinical data collection, and blood sampling will be conducted at baseline, at 1 month after
      EVAR and at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months for all patients. CT will be conducted at baseline and 12
      and 24 months, plus at 1 month in the EVAR patients. Quality of life and depression
      questionnaires will be performed at baseline, at 12 and 24 months of follow-up in all
      patients, and at 1 month only in EVAR patients. Additionally, a cross-sectional study will be
      performed in 200 patients treated for AAA with EVAR in the past years. In these patients,
      clinical data collection, blood sampling, ultrasound and CT will be performed at their next
      regular outpatient clinic visit.
