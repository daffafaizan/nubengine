      approach involving early surgical intervention and long-term weight-bearing walking training
      in SCI patients clinically defined as complete or AIS-A. The surgical intervention involves
      the intradural decompression (via durotomy), and, in some cases, intraspinal decompression
      (via myelotomy). In addition, the investigators had developed a weight-bearing walking
      training program named "Kunming Locomotion Training Program (KLTP)" to train the patient to
      walk actively for a duration of 6 hours per day, 6 days per week for a minimum of 6 months
      (6-6-6 KLTP). The investigators reasoned that early surgical intradural and/or intraspinal
      decompression would release the intraspinal pressure and, therefore, spare surrounding
      tissues that would otherwise degenerate during the course of secondary injury. The
      investigators further reasoned that long-term weight-bearing walking training would "retrain"
      the residual spinal pathways facilitating recovery of locomotor function, and that a
      combination of the two would result in even greater functional recoveries.
