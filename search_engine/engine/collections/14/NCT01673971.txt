      clinical presentation is variable, and some hemangiomas have the potential to cause
      disfiguring and even lifethreatening complications. While there is no FDA approved treatment
      for IH, certain medications have been shown to be effective in shrinking the growths.
      Unfortunately, there is no objective tool to monitor IH or to guide treatment. Such a tool
      would improve the management of these patients. A new handheld wireless device uses diffuse
      optical imaging (DOI) technology to measure blood flow characteristics.

      The device has been used in studies to assess patients with breast cancer. Optical tomography
      has also been increasingly used to assess neurological function and pathology in newborn
      infants.

      The goal of the investigators' study is to assess the utility of DOI for characterizing and
      monitoring IH. Fifteen IH will be assessed at three points in time as part of this study,
      comprising two groups: 'Natural History' and 'Treatment'. DOI measurements will be correlated
      with clinical findings and existing ultrasound measurements of the IH.
