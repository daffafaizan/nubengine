      adults with DIPG in the context of a molecularly based treatment strategy, compared to
      historical controls (COG ACNS0126). Secondary objectives were to determine the safety and
      potential morbidity associated with biopsy of classic DIPGs based on imaging and clinical
      history as well as ability to perform biologic analyses on the biopsy material obtained to
      guide therapy. At study entry, a MRI-guided frameless or frame-based stereotactic biopsy will
      be performed approaching the pontine termentum through a trans-cerebellar or trans-frontal
      route. The exact biopsy location will be determined by the treating neurosurgeon at the
      designated participating site with the goal of minimizing procedural risk. Treatment directed
      based on tumor biopsy results requires classification of patients into 1 of 4 potential
      cohorts: O^6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation status (negative
      versus positive) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) overexpression status (negative
      versus positive).
