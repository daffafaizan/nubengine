      gel, administered vaginally by approximately 2900 sexually active women at high risk for
      sexually transmitted HIV. Approximately 2600 women aged 18-30 years old will be enrolled to
      achieve the required number of endpoints to show an effect on HIV-1 infection, while up to
      300 additional women aged 31-40 years old will be enrolled to collect more safety information
      in this age group.

      This is an event driven study that plans to randomize seronegative women. Participants will
      be randomized to a 1:1 ratio to receive 1% tenofovir gel or placebo gel. Each will be asked
      to insert a dose of the assigned study product within 12 hours prior to a coital event and
      another dose as soon as possible within 12 hours after a coital event. Participants will be
      advised to use only two doses of gel in a 24 hour period.

      All women will be evaluated for the rates of adverse events and the rate of HIV
      seroconversion. In addition, the study will evaluate several secondary endpoints that bear
      directly on potential risks and benefits of vaginal tenofovir gel use.
