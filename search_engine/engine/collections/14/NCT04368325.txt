      compared their outcome data with a group of participants with normal or high creatinine
      levels (control group, N=61). Low creatinine was defined as values of ≤40 μmol/L. Demographic
      data, type of admission (medical vs. surgical), hemoglobin values, CRP, and ventilator days
      were compared. A statistical analysis was performed using chi square and T-test.
