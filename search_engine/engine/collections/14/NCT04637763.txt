    
      This clinical trial is a first-in-human, Phase 1, multicenter, open-label evaluation of
      safety and emerging efficacy of CB-010 in adults with relapsed/refractory B cell non-Hodgkin
      lymphoma. The study is conducted in two parts: Part A is dose escalation following a 3 + 3
      design, with sequential, prespecified, increasing doses. Part B is the expansion portion
      where patients will receive CB-010 at the dose determined in Part A.
