      established oncologic principles are guaranteed [1-4].

      Apart from the well-known advantages of minimally invasive surgery (shorter hospital stays,
      lower pain levels, faster return of bowel functions and rapid return to normal daily
      activities) reductions in operative morbidity and mortality have been reported together with
      oncologic outcomes which are similar to those of open surgery [5-7].

      However, reported conversion rates to open surgery are highly variable (7% - 30%) as is the
      impact of conversion on oncologic outcomes [8-10]). The objectives of this study were to
      identify the risk factors associated with conversion and to assess their impact on operative
      morbidity and mortality and long-term oncologic outcomes.
