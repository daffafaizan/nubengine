      contrast enhancement of the mucosa) versus standard high-definition white light for the
      detection of conventional adenomas and sessile serrated adenomas/polyps. Recent studies have
      indicated that colonoscopy is more effective in preventing cancer in the left side of the
      colon than the right side of the colon. The reasons for this difference may be partly
      biologic, in that a special group of polyps known as sessile serrated adenomas/polyps (SSA)
      are located primarily proximal to the splenic flexure. Sessile serrated adenomas/polyps share
      molecular features with a group of cancers that occur primarily in the proximal colon. These
      molecular features include CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) and microsatellite
      instability. These lesions are endoscopically subtle in that they are often flat, have the
      same color as the surrounding mucosa, and are hard to differentiate from normal mucosa.
      Recent studies have shown that image enhanced endoscopy can highlight the appearance of these
      lesions. This study will test whether i-scan increases the detection of conventional adenomas
      and sessile serrated adenomas/polyps in a randomized controlled trial.
