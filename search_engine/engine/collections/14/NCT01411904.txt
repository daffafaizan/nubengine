      oncologists to predict patient outcome and to monitor the efficacy of therapy which is
      critical to improving care. MRD can be used to identify high risk patients who cannot be
      identified by conventional high risk features, a presence of < 0.1% MRD has been shown to be
      one of the best predictors of 5-year remission, with 70% of patients with â‰¥ 0.1% relapsing.
      In addition to providing predictions of relapse, MRD has been shown to provide a sensitive
      measure of early treatment response, an independent predictor of good outcome. While the
      presence of MRD is indicative of patient outcome, the detection of the presence of MRD
      provides an opportunity to modify treatment and potentially increase survival. Studies are
      currently underway to use MRD detection in modifying chemotherapeutic treatment and timing of
      stem cell transplant in leukemia patients. Development of a low cost and easily accessible
      MRD detector has the potential to expand the number of patients for which MRD testing is
      available. Expansion of the patient population is a necessary step to large scale testing of
      MRD detection as both a predictive factor of patient outcome and as a potential modifier of
      patient treatment. It is expected that increased MRD testing would lead to improved
      prediction of patient outcomes and increased sensitivity of testing of treatment response.
      MRD testing in the general patient population could be used to test treatment response and
      allow oncologists to modify treatment regiments leading to reduced patient mortality and
      improved medical outcomes.
