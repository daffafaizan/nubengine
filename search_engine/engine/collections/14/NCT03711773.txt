      in the United States. It's estimated roughly 1 million total joint replacements are being
      performed each year. Studies have suggested that for patients with knee pain that have high
      BMIs, low strength, and/or have not participated in conservative measures, a low-impact
      exercise plan when paired with diet counseling and behavioral health classes can improve
      patient reported outcomes scores in both pain and function. This study seeks to build upon
      this research and will provide low-impact exercise plans that will be paired with standard of
      care dietician and behavioral health interventions in order to offer patients a full-scope
      approach to battling osteoarthritis pain, especially for those with high BMIs, low strength,
      and/or for patients that have not attempted conservative therapy in the past. We will include
      patients with knee, hip, and ankle pain.
