      induced motor complications. The beneficial effects of STN stimulation on motor disability
      and quality of life have been proved. However, the mean delay before neurosurgery is
      currently 14 years after diagnosis, when medical treatment no longer controls PD symptoms and
      quality of life is already severely impaired.

      Aim of this study is to prospectively assess the effects of bilateral STN stimulation on
      motor signs, psychological and psychiatric aspects and quality of life in a group of 20
      patients with PD who underwent surgery after 5 years from the onset of the disease. These
      results will be compared with those of a group of 20 patients with a PD history from more
      than 10 years.

      The two groups of patients will be evaluated at baseline and after 3 and 12 months from DBS
      implant; at each visit neurological and motor examinations were assessed and dedicated
      neuropsychological and psychiatric tests will be performed.

      Neurosurgery may be considered superior to medical treatment alone even in mild to moderate
      PD of 10 years duration, rather than a last resort in very advanced stages of the disease.
      Thanks to this study we could compare motor outcomes and cognitive aspects between DBS
      patients with a short and with long history of disease
