      milrinone and oral sildenafil) and group M (received only intravenous milrinone). Demographic
      data, patient's clinical data and different intraoperative times were recorded. In 1st
      postoperative 24 hours, we recorded; hemodynamic parameters [mean pulmonary arterial pressure
      (MPAP), mean systemic arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate, central venous pressure]. We
      calculated MPAP/MAP and inotropic score. The incidence of pulmonary hypertensive crisis, side
      effects of studied drugs and complications related to pulmonary artery catheter were
      recorded.
