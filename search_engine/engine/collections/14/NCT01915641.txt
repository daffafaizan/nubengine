    
      inclusion criteria :

        -  COPD : FEV1/FVC < 70%, no response to bronchodilator (FEV1 change <12% and <200ml)

        -  OSA : AHI > 15/h, obstructive type predominant

      exclusion criteria :

        -  any malignancy

        -  pregnancy

        -  claustrophobia

        -  age<18

      primary outcome : exercise capacity (walking distance (meter), measured by incremental
      shuttle walking test)

      Method : For those fit in criteria. CPAP titration will be performed to determine the optimal
      pressure Baseline measurement : incremental shuttle walking test, urine catecholamine, heart
      rate variability, muscle power and other baseline characteristics Randomized those patients
      to group A and group B group A : CPAP treatment with optimal pressure for 1 month, repeat
      measurement change CPAP treatment to sham pressure 5cm H2O for 1 month, repeat measurement
      group B : CPAP treatment with sham pressure for 1 month, repeat measurement change CPAP
      treatment with optimal pressure for 1 month, repeat measurement
