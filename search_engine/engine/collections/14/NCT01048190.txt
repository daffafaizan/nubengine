      micro-carrier culture in 550 liter bioreactors. The virus suspension was harvested
      ,ultra-concentrated, purified and inactivated with formalin. Three formulations A,B,C of
      Sabin IPV were used, the DAg contents for A were type1 45,type2 64,type3 67.5 DU /0.5ml/per
      dose; for B 30,32,45 DU/0.5ml/per dose; for C 15,16,22.5 DU/0.5ml/per dose.

      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo control phase 1 clinical trial. Total 130
      individuals were selected ,including adults (n=20), children(n= 20) and infants(n= 90).
      Adults were randomized to two groups A1(n=10) and A2(n=10).Group A1 received one dose of B
      ,one month later group A2 received one dose of A for safety observation. Children were
      randomized to two groups C1(n=10) and C2(n=10) and followed the same vaccination and safety
      observation procedures as adults. Infants were randomly allocated to three groups I-1,I-2,I-3
      for safety and immunogenicity study. Group I-1 were vaccinated with three doses of C(n=15) or
      placebo (n=15) on day 0,30,60,serum samples were collected before and 30 days after dose 3
      for detecting neutralization antibody. The same procedures were followed by GroupI-2 for B
      and group I-3 for A as groupI-1 with 30 days intermission.
