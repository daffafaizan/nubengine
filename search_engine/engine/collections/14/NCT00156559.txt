      Phase: IV

      Population: 16 generally healthy premature infants born at < 29 weeks' gestation, < 16 months
      old from the Rochester area 16 generally healthy full-term infants born at >/= 37 weeks'
      gestation, < 16 months old from the Rochester area

      Number of Sites: University of Rochester

      Study Duration: 1.5 - 8.5 months

      Description of Agent or Intervention:

      Subjects will make 2 study visits. The first, at 15 months of age, will coincide with a
      routine well child visit. Subjects will have 2 mL of blood drawn at the time of their
      routine, 15-month MMR, varicella, and pneumococcal conjugate immunizations. At a second study
      visit 4-6 weeks later, another 2 mL of blood will be drawn.

      Objectives:

      Primary: We propose to measure the immunogenicity of routinely administered varicella and
      mumps-measles-rubella vaccines in relatively healthy, 12-to-15 month-old children born at <29
      weeks gestation (premature), when compared to that in full-term infants.

      Measles titers will be measured by neutralization assay. Mumps and rubella titers will be
      measured by enzyme-linked florescent immunoassay. Varicella titers will be measured by enzyme
      linked immunosorbent assay.

      Safety will be assessed by parental recall of vaccine-related adverse events and by active,
      prospective collection of blood-draw-associated adverse events.

      Schematic of Study Design:

      Subjects will be approached at 9-12 months of age for inclusion, and will consent at this
      time or at Visit 1

      Visit 1 (15 mos):

      Preterm N = 16, Full term N = 16, 2 ml blood draw

      Routine MMR, varicella vaccines administered by primary pediatrician per standard of care (at
      Visit 1)

      Visit 2 (16 mos):

      Preterm N = 16, Full term N = 16, 2 ml blood draw

      Varicella, mumps, measles and rubella vaccine titers measured by ELISA
