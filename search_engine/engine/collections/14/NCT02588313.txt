    
      Aim of the study is to investigate long-term effects of CarelessTM, a Mangifera indica fruit
      powder on microcirculation and endothelial function after supplementation of 4 weeks. Effects
      will be investigated with 100mg and 300mg CarelessTM and compared to placebo.

      To describe targeted parameter, cutaneous microcirculation will be measured at 1 mm depth as
      well as flow mediated endothelial function at the beginning and end of supplementation, each.
      Furthermore, the parameters will be determined postprandially 1 hour after glucose loading.
      Additionally the influence on the glucose metabolism, as well as on body weight and body fat
      will be documented.
