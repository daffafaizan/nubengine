      meal can increase fat utilization and shift between-meal snack choices. While the benefits of
      high-protein diets are well known, little is known about the optimal amount of protein that
      should be eaten at each meal. Most Americans eat little protein at breakfast and lunch and
      most of their protein at the evening meal. Current guidelines for protein are based on body
      weight; however, recent evidence indicates that absolute amounts of protein at each meal are
      needed to maintain metabolically active fat-free mass. This suggests that a more even protein
      consumption pattern across daily meals may positively influence energy metabolism. In
      addition, recent evidence indicates that protein may reduce activity in the food reward areas
      of the brain. This suggests that protein may influence between-meal snacking by decreasing
      the relative reinforcing value (RRV) of highly rewarding snack foods. The RRV of a food is an
      empirical measure of its motivating value and energy-dense foods are highly reinforcing,
      especially for obese individuals. This study will be the first to investigate the role of the
      daily distribution of protein intake on energy metabolism and modifying snacking behavior.
