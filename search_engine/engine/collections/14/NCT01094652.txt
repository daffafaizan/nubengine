      (>/=5 servings) or similar foods made with refined grains each day for six weeks. Based on
      treatment group, subjects will be provided either whole grain or refined grain foods and
      snacks. They will be instructed on how to use these foods to replace other foods already
      contained in the diet. Stool, blood, and saliva samples will be obtained at baseline and at
      study end to examine the microbiota and markers of digestive and immune health. Daily records
      will be maintained by the students to assess bowel habits and compliance. It is anticipated
      that whole grains will increase stool bulk resulting in increased stool frequency and softer
      stools. Additionally, fermentation of the fiber within the colon will alter the microbiota
      profile. Because the majority of the immune system resides within the gastrointestinal tract,
      improved balance of the intestinal microbiota may prime the immune system thus contributing
      to improved immune defense.
