    
      We will perform a prospective, randomized, double-blind clinical trial with parallel
      assignment.

      Obese women (delivery BMI 30 or more) who agree to participation will be randomly designated
      to receive either 25 mcg po q 4 hour (control) misoprosol versus 50 mcg po q 4 hours. Our
      primary outcome will be the rate of successful induction. Secondary outcomes will include
      ability to achieve a Bishop score greater than 7, time to active labor, and safety data
      including rate of tachysystole, non-reassuring fetal status, NICU admission.
