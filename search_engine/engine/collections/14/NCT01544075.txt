      intensive pain neurophysiology education (PNE) is able to increase pain thresholds and
      improve pain behavior and pain-free movement performance in patients with CWAD. However these
      results have not been confirmed in a randomized controlled trial.

      In addition, it has been emphasized that PNE is not a standalone treatment and that future
      research should examine PNE in combination with other treatment modalities. Another treatment
      modality that challenges people's beliefs and barriers is psychological inoculation (PI).
      However, it has not yet been examined if PI could be a useful component in the rehabilitation
      of chronic pain patients.
