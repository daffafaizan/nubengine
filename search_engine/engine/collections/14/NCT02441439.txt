      It is acceptable to prescribe oral iron supplements. However, gastrointestinal side effects
      are very common and those lead to patient's intolerance as well as low patient's compliance.
      In those cases, as well as in severe anemia it is recommended to give iron sucrose. This drug
      is administered intravenously is effective to treat iron deficiency anemia with a minimal
      adverse effect profile. The two methods of giving iron sucrose is (1) to give I.V 200 mg iron
      sucrose 2-3 times/week or (2) to give I.V 500 mg iron sucrose once a week In the present
      study we aim to compare between the efficacy of those 2 protocols.
