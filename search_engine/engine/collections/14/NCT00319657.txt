      completely from immunosuppressive drugs while maintaining normal function of HLA-matched
      living related donor kidney transplants. Fifteen participants will be conditioned with total
      lymphoid irradiation (TLI) and rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG), and given an infusion of
      donor "mobilized" blood mononuclear cells prior to transplantation.

      This is a single-center, open-label study in adult renal transplant patients. Fifteen
      patients will receive TLI, ATG, and an infusion of CD34+ selected G-CSF mobilized blood cells
      combined with a fixed number (1x10^6) of CD3+ T cells from the same mobilized blood cell
      source. Patients will receive a one-month course of mycophenolate mofetil and a six to 12
      month tapering course of cyclosporine that will be discontinued at six months. At serial
      timepoints (1) graft function will be monitored, (2) chimerism will be measured in recipient
      white blood cell subsets, (3) mixed lymphocyte response (MLR) assays of peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells against donor and third party cells will be performed, and (4) protocol
      biopsies of the graft will be obtained. An attempt will be made to discontinue cyclosporine
      at six months if (1) chimerism is detectable for at least 180 days after CD34+ and CD3+ cell
      infusion, (2) there is stable graft function without clinical rejection episodes, and (3)
      there is lack of histologic rejection on protocol biopsies. In the proposed study, patients
      will be given a target dose of 8-10x10^6 CD34+ cells/kg and 1x10^6 CD3+ cells/kg because
      sustained chimerism may be necessary for sustained tolerance to the graft.
