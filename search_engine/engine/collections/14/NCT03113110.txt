      immunosuppressive therapy and PTDM, under standard antidiabetic therapy (exogenous insulin
      <40 IU). The sample size is based on a calculation assuming non-inferiority of empagliflozin
      monotherapy in comparison to previous insulin therapy, with respect to the primary endpoint:
      2-hour blood glucose (2-h BG) during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) immediately prior
      and 1 month after the start of empagliflozin monotherapy. The null hypothesis will be
      accepted if the average change in 2-h BG from the first to the second OGTT exceeds 30 mg/dL
      (empagliflozin will be inferior). Secondary endpoints comprise the average change in insulin
      secretory capacity and insulin sensitivity, derived from the first to the second OGTT, the
      average change in HbA1c at 3 months and at 1 year, compared to baseline, changes in body
      weight, fluid overload (determined by bioimpedance spectroscopy) and blood pressure. Safety
      endpoints include clinically concerning hyperglycemia after discontinuation of exogenous
      insulin, ketoacidosis, urinary tract infections and genital infections, worsening of renal
      function, hypoglycemia, hospitalizations, cardiovascular events and death. The effect of
      empagliflozin on the renin-angiotensin system is part of an OeNB-funded project in
      non-transplanted patients and will be included in the analyses of the present study.
