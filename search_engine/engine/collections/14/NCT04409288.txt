      preference for apalutamide versus enzalutamide in 146 male patients with recurrent or
      metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer The primary outcome is patient preference, which
      serves as an indicator covering different aspects of treatment-related effects, and this
      would be most important in a patient's perspective. The quality of life, psychological and
      cognitive changes following apalutamide and enzalutamide in a comprehensive manner will be
      investigated.

      Patient will receive two 12-weeks treatment periods with a 5-week wash-out period between the
      treatment periods. Patients will receive Apalutamide and Enzulutamide sequentially. Patient,
      physician and caregiver preferences will be assessed at the end of the second treatment
      period. Other secondary outcomes on health-related quality of life measures, psychological
      assessment scores and cognitive assessment scores shall be assessed before and the end of
      first treatment and second treatment period.
