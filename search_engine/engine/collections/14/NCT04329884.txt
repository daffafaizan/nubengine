      using cooled radiofrequency ablation (CRFA) for the treatment of osteoarthritis (OA) hip pain
      and function compared with standard of care intra-articular steroid injections. This study
      also aims to determine if CRFA is more effective at decreasing hip pain from OA after
      treatment and improving hip function in terms of range of motion and walking mobility when
      compared to corticosteroid hip injections. The primary outcome of interest is a decrease in
      visual analog scale (VAS) pain as reported following treatment with either a hip injection or
      following RFA treatment for patients who are not candidates for total hip arthroplasty (THA).
      Secondary objectives include physical performance at each follow-up time point including
      range of motion and 50 ft walk test, Hip disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS)
      and PROMIS questionnaires at each follow-up time point, patient satisfaction at 24 weeks
      after treatment, and the number of subjects requesting additional treatment for hip pain
      during the follow-up period.

      The assessments will be conducted by comparing patients with pain from hip OA who get CRFA
      treatment versus patients who get a hip corticosteroid injection. The research hypothesis is
      that CRFA will lead to a greater reduction in pain up to 24 weeks +/- 2 weeks following
      treatment compared to a hip corticosteroid injection. This may result in patients having
      greater relief of their hip pain which may improve joint function and quality of life with
      the availability of a new alternative to treat hip OA.
