      performing brachial cuff based on analysis of a suprasystolic pulse wave.

      The study aim to test the feasibility of ambulatory pulse wave analysis every twenty minute
      (the fraction of missed measurements)and the reprodicility of pulse wave velocity and central
      augmentation index in type 2 diabetic patients. In addition we will explore the relation
      between diurnal variation of brachial blood pressure, central blood pressure and pulse wave
      velocity.

      20 type 2 diabetic patients will have 24h ambulatory blood pressure performed twice with an
      interval of one week.
