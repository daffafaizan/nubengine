      current (past month) use of smokeless tobacco (ST). ST use has been associated with oral and
      extra-oral cancer as well as cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease. To date, no
      pharmacotherapies have been shown to increase long-term (≥ 6 months) abstinence rates in ST
      users. Novel pharmacotherapies that decrease withdrawal symptoms and nicotine
      self-administration need to be tested in ST users. Varenicline (Chantix™, Pfizer) is a novel
      selective nicotinic receptor partial agonist with specificity for the α4β2 nicotine
      acetylcholine receptor that has demonstrated remarkable efficacy for increasing long-term
      tobacco abstinence rates in cigarette smokers. The novel mechanism of action of varenicline
      potentially circumvents the limitations of using nicotine replacement therapy or bupropion
      pharmacotherapy in ST users. The overall goal of this line of research is to develop
      effective pharmacologic treatments for ST users to increase long-term (≥ 6 months) abstinence
      rates. The central hypothesis of this application is that varenicline is efficacious for the
      treatment of ST users. To evaluate this hypothesis, we will conduct a pilot study to obtain
      preliminary estimates of efficacy of 12-weeks of varenicline for increasing the prolonged and
      point prevalence tobacco abstinence rates at 12 weeks (end-of-treatment) in ST users. We will
      also evaluate the effect of varenicline on nicotine withdrawal symptoms and tobacco craving.
      If the results are promising, we will plan for a multicenter, randomized, double-blinded,
      placebo-controlled clinical trial with the Oregon Research Institute in Eugene, OR, to
      investigate the efficacy of varenicline to increase long-term (≥ 6 months) abstinence rates
      in ST users.
