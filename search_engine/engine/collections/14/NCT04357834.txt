      its healthcare providers and the resource demands for intensive care units (ICUs). To support
      effective care despite large case numbers, hospital operations urgently need improved
      decision support in early identification of patients at risk of an acute COVID-19
      deterioration that requires ICU.

      The investigators aim at developing a wearable-based ICU algorithm for inpatients contracted
      with SARS-CoV-2. Inpatients on the general ward with suspicion of COVID-19 or with confirmed
      SARS-CoV-2 infection will be included. The participant will be equipped with a smartwatch and
      wear the device throughout the hospital stay until the patient (1) is discharged home, (2) is
      transferred to the ICU, or (3) palliative care is initiated. The smartwatch collects several
      physiological parameters (e.g. heart rate, heart rate variability, respiration rate, oxygen
      saturation). The collected data will be used to develop an ICU prediction algorithm to detect
      patients at risk of an acute COVID-19 deterioration that requires ICU.
