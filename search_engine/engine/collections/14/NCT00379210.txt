      and adverse health symptoms in a varied subject population. MMT has been described as "paying
      attention in a particular way." Although attention is a key component of meditation, little
      is known about the cognitive and neural changes within the human attention system that result
      from MMT. In this study, we examine the effects of MMT on the human attention system using
      neurobehavioral measures. Here MMT comprises participation in a
      Mindfulness-Based-Stress-Reduction (MBSR) course, while the comparison group participates in
      a nutrition education course, both 8 weeks long. We compare the performance and neural
      activity of these groups both before and after participation in the course.
