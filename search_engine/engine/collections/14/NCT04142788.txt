      of MRA if they are administered patiromer to treat or prevent hyperkalaemia.

      Potential participants with worsening heart failure will be identified by their care teams
      and asked to participate in a research registry. If eligible, registry participants will be
      asked to take part in the RELIEHF randomised trial.

      The randomised trial will investigate whether patiromer allows patients with worsening heart
      failure to be titrated to higher doses of MRA (predominantly spironolactone). Participants
      assigned to patiromer may be titrated to 200mg/day spironolactone or the highest licensed
      dose of eplerenone (50mg/day). Participants who are not assigned to patiromer should have
      titration to guideline-recommended doses of MRA attempted.

      The registry and trial will take place in about 100 secondary care sites across the UK. At
      the end of the trial, participants will be followed through their electronic medical records
      via record linkage for up to 10 years
