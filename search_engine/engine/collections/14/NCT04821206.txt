      registry will provide reliable data on the use of JAKi in LA, as will be a prospective study
      involving carefully selected rheumatologists and centers. Soon, a good number of copies of
      original JAKi will be available in LA, and it is important to keep track of the safety and
      effectiveness of this drugs in the real world.

      The primary objective of the registry is to prospectively study the comparative safety and
      comparative effectiveness of approved Jak Inhibitors treatment for RA-PsA-SpA in a cohort of
      patients and theirs controls cared for by rheumatologists across Latin Am√©rica (LA).

      The registry will be a cohort study where cases will be patients with RA, PsA and SpA
      initiating any approved JAK inhibitor. To have an active control group, patients with RA, PsA
      o SpA initiating any other disease modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) (biologic or not
      biologic) will also be included in the registry.

      It will be a Web based registry, where the investigators will include data related to the
      cases and controls. Data collected will include, demographics, disease characteristics,
      disease activity, past and current medications, comorbidities. At each visit adherence with
      the medications, adverse events, changes in medications, disease activity and disability will
      be assessed.Patients will be followed up at three months intervals, after inclusion in the
      registry and thereafter every 6 months during the next three years. Adverse events could be
      included at any time between visits if the investigator is notified.
