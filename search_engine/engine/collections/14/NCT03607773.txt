      by improving coping skills. The investigator predicts that it will reduce perceived stress as
      well as stress markers in the blood, thus increasing overall QOL for newly diagnosed PwMS.

      In this study, the investigator will randomly assign newly diagnosed PwMS to either MBI or
      standard treatment. The investigator administers the MBI under the format of the Mindfulness
      Ambassador Council (MAC), which was developed by the non-profit organization, Mindfulness
      Without Borders (MWB, www.mindfulnesswithoutborders.org). This intervention will consist of
      group meetings led by a mindfulness coach once a week for an hour over 10 weeks. We will
      include in the study PwMS that have been diagnosed with RRMS within the last year. We will
      assess measures of coping, mood symptoms and QOL before the intervention, after 10 weeks (or
      equivalent time for the standard treatment group) and then again 6 months later, to ensure
      any benefit continues over time.

      First and foremost, PwMS will benefit from this type of research. This project could lead to
      a non-pharmacological, cost-effective intervention to help cope with the uncertainty that
      comes with an MS diagnosis as well as improves mood symptoms, psychosocial functioning and
      QOL, currently and over the long-term.

      Sharing the results of this study will be a priority for us. We will present our results at
      national and international meetings as well as submit for journal publication. We will share
      our findings with other health care practitioners and with the lay public through community
      presentations and possible media releases.
