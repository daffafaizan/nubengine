      the treatment group (ChiNing decoction orally) and control group (recombinant human epidermal
      growth factor rhEGF spray on oral mucosal surface ) at different time points before and after
      radiotherapy, to evaluate the radiotherapy of acute radiation oral mucosa reaction (RTOG
      grade), quality of life score (EORTCQLQ-H&N35 scale), oral pain (VAS score) and patient body
      weight changes of the two groups. At the same timeï¼Œthis study takes cast-off cells of oral
      mucosal to observe the microscopic characteristics of oral mucosa, and uses the ELISA method
      to detect IL-6 and TNF- alpha content in the saliva before and after radiotherapy.
