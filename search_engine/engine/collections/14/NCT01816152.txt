      used for short-term (4 weeks). Outcome measures include sleep measures (actigraphy), and
      questionnaires probing behavior and mood in those who have been diagnosed with Alzheimer's
      disease and related dementia. After a 4-week washout period, a placebo control inactive light
      will be used for another 4 weeks.
