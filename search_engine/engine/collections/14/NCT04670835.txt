      Center organization to improve population accessibility. Regarding the performance targets
      requested by the French government (MARCUS report:
      http://www.urgences113.fr/marcus/Rapport_MARCUS3.pdf), the virtualization of inbound call
      distribution could improve EMCC service quality indicators.

      The Virtualization is a process that consists of centralizing calls from different
      territories before distributing them to the centers concerned according to their
      availability. The objective through this process is to improve the population' access to the
      EMCC by reducing waits time. And on the other hand, to optimize the activity rate of
      dispatchers and physicians.
