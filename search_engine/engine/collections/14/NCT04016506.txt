      adolescents who have had a pancreatic trauma and who are being followed in Belgian hospitals.

      Through this study, the investigators hope to be able to understand:

        1. The epidemiology of pancreatic trauma in Belgium. How these traumas occur (accident,
           fall,...).

        2. Pancreatic trauma management in Belgian hospitals according to severity grade.

        3. Short- and medium-term complications associated with the trauma

        4. Long-term complications of trauma on growth and on the endocrine and exocrine function
           of the pancreas.

      On the basis of all the information collected, the investigators hope to be able to provide
      indicators on the epidemiology of pancreatic trauma in children, short-term risks as well as
      nutritional and functional risks, taking into account the initial management of the patient.
