    
      This is a randomized (participants are assigned to treatment groups by chance), double-blind
      (participants and study personnel know what study agents are given), placebo-controlled (a
      placebo is a treatment identical in appearance to CNTO 1959 but does not contain active
      drug), single-dose study. The study will include 24 participants: 4 groups of at least 6
      participants each. If it is decided that additional data are needed to define the safety and
      tolerability of CNTO 1959, an additional group may be enrolled. A given dose level may be
      repeated in newly enrolled participants, or a lower or intermediate dose may be administered
      based on preliminary data. The total duration of participation will be approximately 30
      weeks, which includes a screening period of up to 6 weeks before the administration of study
      agent. Participant safety will be monitored. Ascending doses of 10, 30, 100, and 300 mg dose
      of CNTO 1959 and placebo will be administered as single SC injections; however, 2 SC
      injections may be required for the 300 mg dose level. Dosing will be performed for 24 weeks.
