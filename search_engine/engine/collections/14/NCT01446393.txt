      characteristics of the peripheral arteries (lower and upper limbs) . a secondary objective
      will be to determine the arterial calcification using CT-scan as a useful tools for the
      diagnosis and the follow-up of this disease. Data will be collected from a cohort of patients
      PXE monitored in our Health and Research PXE center at the University Hospital of Angers. The
      structural and functional variables of the distal arteries (radial and tibialis arteries)
      will be studied using high-resolution echography. Scoring of the arterial calcium load will
      be determined by helicoidal CT-scan in the lower limb arteries. These variables will be
      compared to matched (gender and age) controls without PXE.
