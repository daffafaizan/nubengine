    
      The EMINENT study is a prospective, multi-center study confirming the superior effectiveness
      of the ELUVIA stent versus Self-Expanding Bare Nitinol Stents in the treatment of lesions
      30-210 mm long located in the femoropopliteal arteries in subjects with symptoms classified
      as Rutherford categories 2-4.

      The study is a 2:1 randomized (ELUVIA vs Self-Expanding Bare Nitinol Stents), controlled,
      single-blind, superiority trial (RCT).

      The objective of the study is to confirm the superior effectiveness of the ELUVIA
      Drug-Eluting Vascular Stent System (ELUVIA Stent) for treating Superficial Femoral Artery
      (SFA) and/or Proximal Popliteal Artery (PPA) lesions up to 210 mm in length when compared
      against bare metal stents, and collect additional data including health economics data.
