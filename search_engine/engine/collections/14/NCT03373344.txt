      with MS in a double blind placebo controlled randomized clinical trial RCT). We will utilize
      an intervention which has been successfully used in other populations, including
      Schizophrenia and Traumatic Brain Injury. Our pilot data shows that this intervention is
      effective in individuals with MS, as well.

      All participants will undergo a baseline evaluation assessing emotional processing abilities,
      cognitive functioning, and psychological functioning. Participants will then be randomized
      into two groups. During the treatment phase, the experimental group will receive the proposed
      intervention while the control group will receive a "placebo" treatment. Neuropsychological
      assessment will be repeated at the end of the intervention.
