    
      This double-blind study will evaluate the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of morphine or
      gabapentin derived from gabapentin enacarbil (GEn) after administration of morphine and GEn
      alone and in combination as well as the tolerability of morphine administered with GEn. The
      dose of GEn will be 600 mg administered with food. Morphine/morphine placebo will be
      administered 2 hours prior to GEn/GEn placebo in the fasted state. A 60 mg dose of a
      controlled release formulation of morphine will be given. Blood samples for evaluation of
      gabapentin, morphine and morphine-6-glucuronide will be collected. The pharmacodynamic effect
      of co-administering both treatments will be assessed using visual analog scales for
      somnolence/sedation, dizziness and nausea.
