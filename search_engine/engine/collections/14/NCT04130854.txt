    
      A phase II randomized trial 3:2 with continuous safety assessment for at least 6 patients. An
      interim analysis after 30 patients have completed treatment and there will be early stopping
      criteria for futility or efficacy. The null hypothesis is that pCR is 20% and to reject the
      null hypothesis we aim to show a 52% pCR rate using a 5% one sided type 1 error boundary with
      80% power. At interim analysis if the test statistic is greater than 2.236 then the trial
      will be stopped for efficacy with rejection of the null hypothesis. If the test statistic is
      less than or equal to 0.488 then we will accept the null hypothesis and consider stopping the
      trial early
