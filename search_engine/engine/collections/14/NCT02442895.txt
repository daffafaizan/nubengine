    
      347 IVF cycles (236 patients) analyzed for a retrospective study to evaluate the correlation
      between the biomarkers of ovarian reserve (antral follicles count, antimullerian hormone,
      basal follicle stimulating hormone) and number of oocytes and mature oocytes (MII) retrieved
      during the pick up. For the stimulation were used three different protocols: long luteal,
      antagonist with daily administration of gonadotropins and antagonist with depot
      administration of gonadotropins.
