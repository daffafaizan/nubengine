      most common cancer worldwide. Ramucirumab (Cyramza®), a monoclonal antibody, is approved as a
      single agent and in combination with paclitaxel as a treatment for patients with metastatic
      gastric or GE junction adenocarcinoma whose cancer has progressed after prior chemotherapy.
      Nab-paclitaxel (Abraxane®) is an albumin-based formulation of paclitaxel which was developed
      to improve the therapeutic index and reduce toxicity. Nab-paclitaxel is approved in over 40
      countries/regions for treatment of various metastatic cancers including breast cancer,
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and pancreatic cancer. In this Phase II study, the
      investigators propose to combine the less toxic nab-paclitaxel to increase tumor uptake of
      the drug and improve efficacy while minimizing side effects. The biological rationale of
      using this combination is that ramucirumab will inhibit tumor angiogenesis and nab-paclitaxel
      will induce apoptosis of the rapidly dividing tumor cell.
