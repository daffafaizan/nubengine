    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine if a 1-year low-fat fish oil (omega-3 fatty acid) supplemented diet results in
      decreased prostate cancer Decipher score as compared to a control group in men on active
      surveillance.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the effect of a low-fat (LF)/fish oil (FO) intervention on prostate biopsy tissue
      markers of progression, prostate biopsy pathologic features (Gleason grade, tumor volume ),
      prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and long-term clinical outcomes (clinical progression,
      prostate cancer therapies).

      II. Evaluate potential surrogate biomarkers of proliferation (red blood cell [RBC] membrane
      fatty acid analyses, ex-vivo bioassay).

      III. Determine if a correlation exists between free fatty acid receptor 4 (GPR120) levels and
      progression markers in response to the LF/FO intervention.

      IV. Evaluate effect of the intervention on the National Comprehension Cancer Network (NCCN)
      risk group V. Evaluate compliance with a 1-year + 2 year extension LF/FO intervention. VI.
      Evaluate safety of a 1-year + 2-year extension LF/FO intervention.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms. ARM I: Patients receive no intervention.

      ARM II: Patients receive dietary counseling with a research dietitian weekly for 1 month and
      then monthly for 11 months. Patients are given guidelines with recommended meals to follow a
      high omega-3, low omega-6 diet comprising 20% kilocalories (Kcal) from fat, 15% Kcal from
      protein, and 65% Kcal from carbohydrates for 1 year. Patients also receive 4 fish oil
      capsules per day orally (PO) for 1 year.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up yearly for 15 years.
