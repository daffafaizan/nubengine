      commonly subclassified into two broad subgroups according to their site of origin: pancreatic
      NETs are thought to arise from the endocrine cells of the pancreas, whereas NETs of other
      sites such as the lungs or gastrointestinal tract are often referred to as carcinoid tumors.
      While histologically similar, carcinoid tumors and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors have
      demonstrated different response rates in prior phase II studies of antitumor agents. Because
      of these differences, we will perform the current study using two cohorts of patients (30
      with carcinoid and 30 with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors). The statistical design,
      however, is the same for both cohorts. With 30 patients in each cohort, this study has 80%
      power assuming type I error of 6% to differentiate a >/=17% objective response rate from a
      </=5% objective response rate using a single stage design. The proposed regimen would be
      promising in either cohort if at least 4 of 30 patients achieve an objective response.
