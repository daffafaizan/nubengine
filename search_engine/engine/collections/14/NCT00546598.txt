    
      This two-phased study on hip arthroplasty consists of a clinical follow-up phase and a
      clinical outcomes phase.

      The DURALOC® Option Ceramic-on-Ceramic Hip Prosthesis System consists of:

        1. a modular ceramic bearing insert that secures to a titanium metal alloy DURALOC® Option
           Acetabular Shell via a taper locking mechanism; and

        2. a ceramic femoral head that is attached to a conventional femoral stem to complete the
           total hip prosthesis device configuration.
