    
      This randomized, observer-blind, multicenter, Phase 2 study will be conducted at multiple
      sites across the United States and Canada.

      The influenza strain composition of the Quadrivalent VLP Vaccine used in this study includes
      2 influenza A virus strains (A/California/7/2009 [H1N1] and A/Switzerland/9715293/2013
      [H3N2]) and 2 influenza B virus strains (B/Phuket/3073/2013 [Yamagata lineage] and
      B/Brisbane/60/2008 [Victoria lineage]), based on the 2015-2016 recommended World Health
      Organization (WHO) strains for vaccination in the Northern hemisphere.

      Approximately 900 healthy subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to 1 of 3 parallel
      treatment groups. Subjects in each group will be stratified into 2 age strata: 18 to 49 years
      and 50 to 64 years in a 2:1 ratio.

      Subjects will receive one intramuscular (IM) injection of their assigned vaccine:

        -  15 µg/strain of Quadrivalent VLP Vaccine, or

        -  30 µg/strain of Quadrivalent VLP Vaccine, or

        -  15 µg/strain of the licensed and commercially available quadrivalent vaccine FluLaval®
           Tetra.

      Subjects will participate in this study for approximately 8 months, during which 5 visits
      will be scheduled, and phone contact will be made on Day 1, Day 8, and every 2 months
      thereafter for up to 6 months post-Day 21 visit (Day 201). Safety laboratory assessments will
      be performed at Screening, on Day 3 and within 48 hours of Day 3 results availability, for
      grade 3 or grade 4 abnormalities or if deemed necessary by the investigator or early
      termination.
