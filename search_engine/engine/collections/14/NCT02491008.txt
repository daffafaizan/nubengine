      Thyroid hormone is a key regulatory hormone for other physiological systems, including the
      skeleton. Previous studies have suggested that SCTD may be associated with deleterious
      skeletal effects. However, controversy persists on the clinical relevance of SCTD as well as
      on optimal thresholds for treatment. Available data have substantial limitations: 1) limited
      prospective data are available to assess the associations between SCTD and non-cardiovascular
      outcomes, such as fractures 2) lack of data from large RCTs to investigate the
      pathophysiological mechanisms of associations.

      Objective

      To examine, within a large RCT of elderly participants with subclinical hypothyroidism (the
      TRUST trial), the impact of thyroxine therapy on the association between SCTD and skeletal
      fragility, bone mineral density (BMD), bone loss and metabolism, and the risk of fractures.

      Methods

      The existing trial infrastructure (TRUST thyroid trial-Euresearch FP7,clinicaltrials.gov ID:
      NCT01660126) will be utilized to collect biospecimens from the 145 Swiss participants with
      persistent subclinical hypothyroidism randomized to either thyroxine or placebo in Bern and
      in Lausanne. The assessment is performed by means of dual energy X ray absorptiometry (DXA)
      and peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pqCT) as a novel bone imaging technique at
      baseline, and at 1 year of follow-up. In parallel, bone turnover markers in the blood plasma
      will be measured at baseline and at 1 year of follow-up.
