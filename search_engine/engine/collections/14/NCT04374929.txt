      investigational StealthTrac Temporary Pacing Lead placed and evaluated. Following StealthTrac
      Lead insertion, each subject will receive (1) one of three (3) study treatments intended to
      stabilize pacing capture thresholds and pacing impedance over time or receive no treatment.
      The three treatments are (1) Negative Pressure Wound Therapy, (2) Anti-Inflammatory
      Glucocorticoid and (3) increased electrode spacing achieved by the use of two inserted
      StealthTrac Leads. During the placement procedure, diagnostic echocardiograms will be
      performed to detect any new pericardial effusions. Once inserted, the StealthTrac Lead will
      be used to deliver high rate pacing (160 to 220 BPM) in clinically appropriate Subjects, to
      demonstrate suitability for use in transcatheter procedures that require brief periods of
      temporary pacing. Lead positions will be documented using fluoroscopic images before the
      Subject leaves the procedure room. On the following two days after the procedure, electrical
      performance will be evaluated in multiple postures and appropriate pacing and sensing will be
      confirmed during activity using ECG Holter monitor recordings. Subjects will also be asked
      patient-centric questions about their experience with the StealthTrac Lead throughout the
      study period. Evaluations will continue for a minimum of two (2) and a maximum of seven (7)
      days after the index procedure. Prior to StealthTrac Lead removal, an X-Ray will be taken to
      document the final lead position. A final follow-up will be performed 25-30 days after
      removal to identify any latent adverse events before the Subject exits the study.
