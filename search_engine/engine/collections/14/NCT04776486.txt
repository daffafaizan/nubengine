    
      Single center study in ICU patients with augmented renal clearance comparing glomerular
      filtration rate (GFR) as measured by iohexol plasma clearance to that measured by creatinine
      clearance. Primary objective is to compare the GFR estimates made by iohexol plasma clearance
      (as reference method) and creatinine clearance using Bland-Altman method.

      Secondary objective are to compare GFR as measured by iohexol plasma clearance to that
      calculated with the most commonly used renal clearance estimating formulas (Cockcroft and
      Gault, MDRD and CKD-EPI ), evaluate clinical determinant of the observed differences and
      evaluate determinants of extracellular volume.
