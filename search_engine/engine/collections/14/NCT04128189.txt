    
      Herpes Zoster (HZ) is a common complication of kidney transplant because of the immune
      suppressive drugs necessary to prepare the recipient for the transplanted organ and to
      protect it from rejection. The use of the live vaccine, Zostavax, in transplant recipients is
      contraindicated due to their impaired immune status. This study is being done to determine
      vaccine responses to the FDA approved shingles vaccine, Shingrix, in patients with chronic
      renal failure eligible for kidney transplant. Persistence of immune responses after kidney
      transplantation, and immunologic advantage of a third dose of Shingrix to renal transplant
      recipients will be assessed. Additionally, safety, tolerability, and occurrence of HZ will be
      evaluated. 60 participants will be enrolled from the renal transplant services at University
      of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus.
