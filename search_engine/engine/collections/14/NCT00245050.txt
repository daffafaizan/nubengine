      Primary

        -  Compare the efficacy of pyridoxine vs placebo in preventing palmar-plantar
           erythrodysesthesia (PPE) in patients receiving doxorubicin HCl liposome for recurrent
           ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cavity cancer, metastatic breast cancer, or
           advanced endometrial cancer.

        -  Compare quality of life in patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind study. Patients are stratified according to
      cancer type (ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cavity cancer vs breast cancer vs
      endometrial cancer). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive doxorubicin HCl liposome IV 40mg/m2 over 1 hour on day 1 and
           oral pyridoxine 100 mg twice daily on days 1-28.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive doxorubicin HCl liposome IV 40mg/m2 over 1 hour on day 1 and
           oral placebo 100 mg twice daily on days 1-28.

      In both arms, treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients who develop grade 2-3 palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia despite dose reduction of
      doxorubicin HCl liposome are unblinded and removed from the study (for patients in arm I) OR
      receive oral pyridoxine twice daily beginning day 1 of the next planned therapy (for patients
      in arm II).

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and after every third course of therapy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 6 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients will be accrued for this study.
