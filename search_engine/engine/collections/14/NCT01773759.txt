    
      Specific Aim 1 will describe Utah state and local government activities to ensure compliance
      of child care programs with state immunization requirements and identify government's
      barriers to ensuring compliance.

      Specific Aim 2 will describe child care program staffs' knowledge, attitudes, and activities
      related to ensuring that all children are up-to-date for required immunizations and identify
      program barriers to ensuring up-to-date status.

      Specific Aim 3 will evaluate at least 3 strategies to ensure that all children enrolled in
      child care programs are up-to-date for required immunizations. Aims 1 and 2 will guide the
      design of these strategies. Specific strategies proposed for Aim 3 are to: 1) design and
      pilot test an intervention to increase child care program use of the Utah State Immunization
      Information System (USIIS), 2) design an online immunization education module and conduct a
      pilot randomized controlled trial to determine whether use of the module changes child care
      providers' knowledge, attitudes, and activities and increases the proportion of children who
      are up-to-date for required immunizations; and 3) conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial
      to determine whether a quality improvement intervention implemented in child care programs
      increases the proportion of children who are up-to-date for required immunizations.
