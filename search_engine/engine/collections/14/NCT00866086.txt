      Primary

        -  To evaluate comfort associated with the existing screw-based abdominal compression
           device and the new automated abdominal compression device in patients with lung tumors
           undergoing stereotactic body radiotherapy.

      Secondary

        -  To evaluate tumor motion in patients using these devices.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients undergo fluoroscopic assessment of tumor motion with a screw-based abdominal
      compression device. Patients then undergo non-contrast 4D-CT imaging with the screw-based
      abdominal compression device followed by contrast 4D-CT imaging with an automated abdominal
      compression device.

      Immediately after stereotactic body radiotherapy simulation, patients complete a
      questionnaire to assess the overall level of comfort of each abdominal-compression device.
