      focused therapy comprising of 6 sessions within three months after a self-harm episode. The
      adapted therapy/training will be delivered by therapists/trained counselors at the hospital.
      Sessions will be offered weekly in the first two weeks and than fortnightly and will last 50
      minutes. During each session the therapists will assess the risk of suicide and will liaise
      with the research supervisor and patient's treating clinician.

      The areas covered by the manual which has been adapted include an evaluation of the self-harm
      attempt, crisis skills, problem solving, and basic cognitive techniques to manage emotions
      and negative thinking and relapse prevention strategies. The treatment will be structured
      around patient's current problems with the relevant sections of the manual helping the
      patient to deal with specific problems leading to the self-harm act. Between the sessions the
      manual can be used for homework tasks by the patient.
