        -  Compare the change in bone mineral density in patients with prostate cancer who are
           receiving androgen-ablation therapy treated with calcium and cholecalciferol with or
           without conjugated estrogens and with or without risedronate.

        -  Compare the toxicity of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Compare the changes in bone markers in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare hot flashes in patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients
      are stratified according to duration of therapy with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone
      agonists (no more than 30 days vs 31 to 150 days vs 151 to 365 days vs more than 365 days).
      Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral calcium, oral cholecalciferol, oral risedronate placebo,
           and oral estrogen placebo daily.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral calcium, oral cholecalciferol, oral risedronate, and oral
           estrogen placebo daily.

        -  Arm III: Patients receive oral calcium, oral cholecalciferol, low-dose oral conjugated
           estrogens, and oral risedronate placebo daily.

        -  Arm IV: Patients receive oral calcium, oral cholecalciferol, low-dose oral conjugated
           estrogens, and oral risedronate daily.

      Treatment in all arms continues for 2 years.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, monthly for 6 months, and then at 1 and 2 years.

      Bone mineral density is assessed at baseline, 6 months, and 1 and 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 282 patients (70 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 14 months.
