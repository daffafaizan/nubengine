      immunosuppressive strategies have led to a 1-year patient and graft survival of more than
      90%. This high survival rate urges medical specialists to pay increasing attention to the
      long-term side effects of immunosuppressive medication, such as virus-associated cancers. An
      example of an oncogenic virus is the high risk Human Papillomavirus (hrHPV) which is related
      to (pre)malignancies of the anogenital tract e.g. cervix, vulva and anus. These malignancies
      are among the most common malignancies in renal transplant recipients (RTRs). The incidence
      of hrHPV-related cervical and vulvar malignancies is increased up to a 100-fold in RTRs
      compared to the general population. There is limited literature on the exact behaviour of HPV
      infection related anogenital (pre)malignancies in RTRs. A part of these (pre)malignancies are
      probably already present at the time of transplantation while others develop in the years
      after transplantation. With gynaecological examination the investigators can diagnose
      anogenital (pre)malignancies before transplantation so treatment, if necessary, can commence
      before transplantation. Knowledge about HPV status before and after transplantation gives
      insight in the natural course of the HPV infection in this group of patients and with this
      information the investigators can determine the value of vaccination in patients waiting for
      renal transplantation in the future.
