    
      OBJECTIVE:

      To determine whether targeting inflammation using salsalate compared with placebo reduces
      progression of noncalcified coronary artery plaque.

      DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS:

      In the Targeting Inflammation Using Salsalate in Cardiovascular Disease (TINSAL-CVD) trial
      participants were randomly assigned to 30 months of salsalate or placebo in addition to
      standard, guideline-based therapies. Randomization was computerized and centrally allocated,
      with patients, health care professionals, and researchers masked to treatment assignment.
      Participants were overweight and obese statin-using patients with established, stable
      coronary heart disease.

      INTERVENTIONS:

      Salsalate (3.5 g/d) or placebo orally over 30 months.

      MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES:

      The primary outcome was progression of noncalcified coronary artery plaque assessed by
      multidetector computed tomographic angiography. Secondary outcomes were other measures of
      safety and efficacy.
