      physical activity and social engagement among community dwelling older adults. The
      investigators asked participants in the social engagement group to use the WeRun function in
      WeChat to track their daily walking steps and to compare their performance with their group
      members for 4 weeks. To encourage social engagement among their group members, the daily
      walking steps were calculated and the participant who has the highest step count in the group
      will be indicated each day.Those in the control group will only use the WeRun function in
      WeChat to track their own walking steps.

      The investigators expected that the participants in the social contact group will walk more
      often and report more social activities than those in the control group, who will not compete
      with their peers in daily walking. To test these predictions, daily walking steps and the
      total walking steps per week were obtained and compared across groups. The nature and the
      extent of change was analyzed over the four weeks. Exercise self-efficacy was measured using
      a measure based on Bandura's model. Social engagement was measured using the short Lubben
      Social Network Scale, a self report measure of social engagement on a 12-item scale, and
      physical activity was measured using International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), a
      self-report measure of physical activity on a 12-item scale.
