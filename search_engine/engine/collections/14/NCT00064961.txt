      gain, overweight, and obesity. Postcessation weight gain has been attributed to increased
      food intake, which in turn, has been ascribed to a selective increase in high-sugar and other
      high-carbohydrate foods with a high-fat content. This study compares the relative
      effectiveness, for postmenopausal Caucasian and African American women, of following an
      empirically validated smoking cessation program with either 1) a group cessation maintenance
      program with standard exercise advice and food pyramid instructions for healthy eating or 2)
      an individually tailored, dietary-control, exercise, weight-management and
      cessation-maintenance program. Effectiveness is assessed by weight change from baseline to
      postcessation months 6, 12, and 20.

      The second aim is to assess overall fat and other specific macronutrient intake (sugar,
      complex carbohydrates, and protein) and total caloric intake with the use of a novel
      macronutrient self-selection paradigm in Caucasian and African-American postmenopausal women
      at baseline prior to smoking cessation, after being abstinent for one week, and again at 6,
      12, and 20 months postcessation.

      The third aim is to assess whether there is differential responsiveness on the above measures
      in postmenopausal Caucasian vs. African-American women.
