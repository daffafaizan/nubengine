    
      This is a first-in-human, Phase 1, open-label, multicenter, dose escalation and efficacy
      study designed to determine the safety and tolerability of repeated intratumoral injections
      of mRNA-2416 alone (Arm A) and in combination with intravenously administered durvalumab (Arm
      B) in participants with advanced relapsed/refractory solid tumor malignancies or lymphoma and
      to assess the ORR of mRNA-2416 alone and in combination with durvalumab in ovarian cancer
      based on RECIST v1.1. The study includes 2 treatment arms (mRNA-2416 monotherapy [Arm A],and
      mRNA-2416 + durvalumab [Arm B]), each arm of the study consists of a Dose Escalation period
      in non-visceral lesions followed by a Dose Confirmation period in visceral lesions and an
      Expansion period in participants with ovarian cancer at the MTD/RDE as determined by the Dose
      Escalation period. Once the expected maximum tolerated dose/recommended dose for expansion
      (MTD/RDE) has been cleared in Dose Escalation for Arm A, Dose Escalation for Arm B will begin
      with mRNA-2416 at 1 dose level lower than the Arm A MTD/RDE.

      Following completion of 6 cycles of mRNA-2416 + durvalumab (Arm B), participants may continue
      with durvalumab alone until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or 24 months of
      treatment (total), whichever is sooner.
