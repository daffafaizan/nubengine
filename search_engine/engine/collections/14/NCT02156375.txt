    
      This is a multicenter (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a medical
      research study), randomized (study drug is assigned by chance), parallel (a clinical trial
      comparing the response in two or more groups of participants receiving different treatments),
      open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention) single-dose,
      inpatient/outpatient study in healthy participants. The study consists of following periods:
      Screening (within 28 days before study drug administration), inpatient period (Day 1 to 4)
      and outpatient period (up to Day 141). Eligible participants will be randomly assigned in a
      1:1 ratio to either 1 of 2 treatment groups (that is, Ustekinumab 90 mg/mL or Ustekinumab 5
      mg/mL) and will receive treatment on Day 1. The PK comparability of 2 different formulations
      of ustekinumab, diluted in saline, will be evaluated primarily. Participants' safety will be
      monitored throughout the study.
