    
      This is an open-label study in healthy volunteers to evaluate the safety, tolerability and
      pharmacokinetics of four formulations of LY03009 (F1, F2, F3, F4) after a single
      intramuscular injection.

      Approximately 40 healthy subjects are planned to be enrolled in this study and assigned to
      four cohorts (F1, F2, F3, F4) sequentially, 10 subjects per group at a fixed dose of 112 mg
      for F1~F3 and 224 mg for F4. Each subject will receive only one dose in this study.
