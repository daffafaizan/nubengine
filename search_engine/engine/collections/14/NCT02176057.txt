      24 communities in western Nepal following a mass antibiotic distribution program. It is
      unknown if repeated treatments should continue or can be stopped thereby minimizing side
      effects and the high cost of medicine distribution. The investigators plan to randomize
      individuals to two groups to study the effects of a mass antibiotic distribution program: 1)
      treatment of antibiotics and 2) delayed treatment of antibiotics (after 4-6 months).
