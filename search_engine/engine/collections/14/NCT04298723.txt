      with atrial fibrillation and status post intracranial bleeding. Patients with ICH were
      usually excluded from the large NOAC trials and were also not representatively included in
      the large Watchman device trials. On the other hand, registries show that there is a
      significant proportion of patients with status post ICH that were implanted with a LAA
      closure device in clinical routine, and also there are those patients treated with NOAC due
      to their high stroke risk, despite the risk of recurrent ICH.

      Both therapies, NOAC and LAA closure are effective in preventing stroke in patients with AF
      at high risk for stroke. Also, for both therapies there is evidence for prevention of
      bleedings, especially intracranial bleeding events.

      Patients within the LAA closure group will have the chance after successful closure of the
      LAA to quit oral anticoagulation medication and therefore reduce their lifetime risk for
      bleeding and recurrent bleeding. Patients in the NOAC group are provided with an excellent
      protection against stroke and a significant reduced bleeding risk compared to Vitamin K
      antagonist therapy.

      The trial will help to develop data and hopefully guidelines for management of patients with
      AF and status post intracranial bleedings. It may help to give physicians data to therapy
      patients post ICH adequately and help to reduce mortality rates in those patients.
