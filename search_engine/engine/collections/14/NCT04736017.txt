    
      The study is a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled cross-over trial to assess the
      efficacy of auditory slow-wave sleep (SWS) enhancement in PD patients with subjective
      excessive daytime sleepiness and patients with amnestic MCI. The screening phase includes
      entry questionnaires about inclusion/exclusion criteria, sleep quality, chronotype, and
      handedness, and 1-3 screening nights at home with the TSB Axo, to allow for stimulation
      optimization. One of the screening nights will be extended to screen for sleep apnea and
      periodic limb movements during sleep using an ambulatory recording device. Upon final
      inclusion, 24 PD and 24 MCI patients will be enrolled in the study for an overall period of
      6-8 weeks (not including screening phase). Patients will receive 2 weeks of auditory SWS
      enhancement and 2 weeks of sham stimulation (only device application, no tones played) in a
      counter-balanced cross-over design, with a 2-4 week washout period during cross-over. Study
      visits will be performed immediately before and after each intervention period, i.e. before
      and after 2 weeks of auditory stimulation or sham stimulation, respectively. Study visits
      will include standardized clinical examinations, symptom questionnaires, biofluid sampling
      (optional lumbar puncture [LP] after intervention, blood sampling before and after
      intervention) and screening for adverse events by a study physician. Study visits will take
      place at the Department of Neurology, University Hospital Zurich.
