      conducted in multiple sites), non-randomized (patients are not assigned by chance to
      treatment groups), Phase 2b study. Up to 75 patients with MCD will be eligible for the study,
      the majority of whom will be on active therapy with siltuximab at the time of enrollment.
      Patients will be either siltuximab-naive or have not progressed on siltuximab in the opinion
      of the investigator. Duration of disease control and survival will be assessed. Data
      collection for patients who discontinue treatment will be limited to survival, occurrence of
      malignancies, and subsequent therapies for MCD, which will be assessed twice per year until
      the patient has been lost to follow up or has withdrawn consent for the study, whichever
      occurs first. An interim analysis will be conducted (no later than 2 years after the start of
      enrollment) to further evaluate the benefit and safety of long-term treatment with siltuximab
      in patients with MCD. A data will occur at 6 years after the start of enrollment and for
      those patients remaining on treatment after the data cutoff, data collection will be limited
      to pregnancies and serious adverse events (SAEs), including information on study agent
      administration and concomitant medications associated with an SAE. Safety evaluations for
      adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, and physical examination will be
      performed throughout the study. The end of study is the date of the last assessment for the
      last patient.
