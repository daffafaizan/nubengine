      The CVRx BAROSTIM THERAPY in Resistant Hypertension Registry will be performed with subjects
      who have been recently implanted with the BAROSTIM NEO System in accordance with CE-Mark
      approved criteria for resistant hypertension. Subjects must be enrolled within 30 days from
      implant. Up to 500 subjects will be enrolled at up to 50 sites. Data should be obtained from
      standard of care measurements taken prior to implant, at enrollment/baseline, and at 3, 6,
      and 12 months after the device was implanted. After 12 months, data may be obtained in six
      month intervals for up to three years after implant, at which time each subject will be
      exited from the registry.

      Eligibility:

      Subjects must sign an Ethics Committee (EC) approved informed consent form for the registry
      to participate.

      Subjects can be included in the Hypertension Registry if they were implanted in the past 30
      days and meet the CE-Mark approved indications and contraindications for the BAROSTIM NEO
