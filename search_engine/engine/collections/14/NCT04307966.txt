      learning curriculum, environmental support, and activity-based constituents that aimed to
      increase student knowledge and skills, and to engage parents. Trained educators delivered
      lessons about HIV and obesity to all Grade 6 students at 5 government-run schools. The
      classroom curriculum for students required delivery of a five-hour face-to-face intervention
      delivered weekly through 10 30-minute lessons. Students were asked to communicate their
      learnings to their parents at home. Parents were requested to read through the lesson in a
      workbook and to sign acknowledgement that they had read the content. The workbook contained
      shared student-parent homework activities that took approximately 30 minutes per week.
