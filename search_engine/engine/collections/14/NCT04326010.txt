      The primary objective of this study is to characterize survivorship of the Echo Bi-Metric
      Microplasty stem in unilateral or bilateral primary total hip arthroplasty at 5 years
      postoperative.

      Secondary Objectives

      Safety will be evaluated by monitoring the frequency and incidence of adverse events over
      time to 10 years postoperative.

      Clinical, functional, radiographic, and quality of life outcomes will be assessed over time
      to 7 years postoperative. Clinical Outcomes will be measured using the Harris Hip Score and
      Physical Exam form. Radiographs will be reviewed to assess alignment, radiolucencies and
      other radiographic parameters. Health status and functional ability will be measured using
      the EQ-5D-3L and the UCLA Activity score.
