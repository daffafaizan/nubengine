      instruction "to forget" is given at the end of learning the first list (To Be Forgotten
      (TBF)), following a simulation of a computer bug. Therefore a second list is presented to be
      learned and remembered (To Be Remembered (TBR)). A recognition task is performed at the end.
      The action verbs had to be encoded using four conditions: action performed, mimed, imagined
      action, action with a contextual word, reading the action verb only. 48 schizophrenic
      patients were included in this study. Patients were randomized to have 10 participants per
      condition. 48 controls matched by age, gender, laterality and education are also included and
      randomized in the same modality. This study aims to show that the encoding of sensory-motor
      components, more than providing a context could improve the inhibitory capacities but also
      memory in schizophrenia, and possibly be used in remediation cognitive.
