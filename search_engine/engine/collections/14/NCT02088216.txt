      efficacy and safety of N-acetylcysteine on the risk of exacerbations in bronchiectasis
      patients.

      Methods: A prospective, randomized, controlled trial was conducted between April 1, 2014 and
      December 31, 2016 in five general hospitals in Shandong Province, China. Adult bronchiectasis
      patients with at last two exacerbations in the past year were potentially eligible. Patients
      were randomly assigned to receive oral N-acetylcysteine (600 mg, twice daily, 12 months) or
      on-demand treatment.

      Results: A total of 161 patients were eligible for randomization (81 to the N-acetylcysteine
      group and 80 to the control group). During the 12-month follow-up, the incidence of
      exacerbations in the N-acetylcysteine group was significantly lower than that in the control
      group (1.31 vs. 1.98 exacerbations per patient-year; risk ratio, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.17-0.66; P =
      0.0011). The median number of exacerbations in the N-acetylcysteine group was 1 (0.5-2),
      compared with 2 (1-2) in the control group (U=-2.95, P = 0.003). No severe adverse events
      were reported in the intervention group.

      Conclusion: The long-term use of N-acetylcysteine is able to reduce the risk of exacerbations
      for bronchiectasis patients.
