        -  To identify microRNAs that behave as oncogenes or as tumor suppressor genes in B-lineage
           acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in vitro and in vivo.

        -  To examine if single microRNA or signatures of microRNA correspond to different clinical
           outcomes in cytogenetically distinct B-ALL groups.

      OUTLINE: RNA from archived samples are analyzed for microRNA expression profile in vitro and
      in vivo.
