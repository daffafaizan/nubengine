    
      Study Design: This is a Phase I open label study to evaluate safety, tolerability, and immune
      response of a 6-plasmid multiclade HIV-1 DNA vaccine, VRC-HIVDNA016-00-VP. The hypothesis is
      that this regimen will be safe for human administration and elicit immune responses to HIV-1
      clade B Gag, Pol and Nef proteins, as well as clades A, B and C Env proteins. The primary
      objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability in humans of the investigational vaccine
      and secondary objectives are to evaluate the immunogenicity of the vaccine as measured by
      intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) in the 4 weeks after the second or third dose of
      vaccine and the social impact of participating in an HIV-1 vaccine trial.

      Product Description: VRC-HIVDNA016-00-VP is composed of 6 closed, circular DNA plasmids that
      are each 16.67 percent (by weight) of the vaccine. Each of the 6 plasmids in this vaccine
      expresses a single gene product. Plasmids VRC 4401, VRC 4409 and VRC 4404 are designed to
      express clade B HIV-1 Gag, Pol and Nef, respectively. VRC 5736, VRC 5737, and VRC 5738 are
      designed to express HIV-1 Env glycoprotein from clade A, clade B, and clade C, respectively.
      Vaccine vials will be supplied at 4 mg/mL. Each DNA vaccination will be 1 mL of vaccine
      administered intramuscularly (in deltoid muscle) using the Biojector 2000 Needle-Free
      Injection Management System.

      Subjects: Healthy adult volunteers (18 to 44 years old) will be enrolled.

      Study Plan: Fifteen volunteers will be enrolled, as shown in the schema:

      Name of Vaccine: VRC-HIVDNA016-00-VP

      Number of Subjects: 15

      Vaccine Injection Schedule: (at least 21 days between injections)

      Day 0: 4 mg

      Day 28 plus or minus 7: 4 mg

      Day 56 plus or minus 7: 4 mg

      Study Duration: 32 weeks clinical follow-up for each participant.

      Study Endpoints: The primary endpoint is safety of the regimen; secondary endpoints are

      cellular immune responses as measured by ICS within the first 4 weeks after the second and

      third doses and social impact at Week 32. Exploratory analyses will include HIV-specific

      antibody assays, ICS or other immunological assays at intervals between Day 0 and Week 32.
