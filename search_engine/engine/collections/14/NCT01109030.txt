      certain anti inflammatory and neuro-protective effects. In recent years it has been proposed
      that Ppar-gamma agonists may have effects on mood and cognition. In animal studies and in one
      human case report as well as a pilot study on human subjects these drugs improved symptoms of
      depression. A randomized controlled and double blind design will provide further evidence for
      the efficacy of these drugs in major depressive disorder.
