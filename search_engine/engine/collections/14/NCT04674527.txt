        -  Elemene, isolated from the Chinese medicinal herb Curcuma wenyujin, was shown to exhibit
           antitumor activity in human and murine tumor cells in vitro and in vivo

        -  The study shows that the methodological quality of RCTs of Elemene injectable emulsion
           against malignant tumors was low. Therefore, the effect of Elemene injectable emulsion
           being used in clinical settings needs to be confirmed by further RCTs

      Objectives

        -  To evaluate the safety of Elemene injectable emulsion to treat Refractory Glioblastoma
           with TMZ

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of Elemene injectable emulsion to treat Refractory Glioblastoma
