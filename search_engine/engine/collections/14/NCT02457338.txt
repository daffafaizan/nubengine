      Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis for the first 21 days of life in healthy term
      breastfed infants delivered via C-section or vaginal delivery on gut bacteria composition
      during, 1 week, and 1 month after supplementation compared with matched-control term infants
      receiving standard care. The investigators' specific aim is to compare the fecal microbiota
      (total B. infantis, total Bifidobacterium, total bacteria and composition of microbiota)
      between the supplement and control groups.
