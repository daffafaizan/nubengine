      management in patients undergoing chemotherapy. The investigators will accrue 120 adult
      cancer subjects undergoing chemotherapy in a initial efficacy study to determine the
      effectiveness of three different aromatherapies (ginger, lavender, or orange) on
      chemotherapy-related symptoms (nausea, vomiting, pain, anxiety, sleep difficulties, fatigue,
      and lack of appetite) compared to placebo (i.e., jojoba). All subjects will be randomized to
      one of the four arms for symptom management during three different chemotherapy cycles. The
      investigators will examine the incidence and severity of the seven symptoms at each
      chemotherapy cycle. The preliminary data from this study will elucidate the relationships
      between certain aromatherapies and specific symptom relief, which can be further evaluated in
      a larger confirmatory study of subjects undergoing chemotherapy or other types of cancer
      treatment. This study will provide clinical evidence regarding the incorporation of
      aromatherapy into cancer patient care.
