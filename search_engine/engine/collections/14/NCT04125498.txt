      in Europe of 25%, in North America of 32.3% and in South America of 40.5%.

      The incidence of intra-abdominal adhesions in women undergoing to repeated caesarean sections
      is constantly increasing.

      Labor and surgical time are significantly longer in patients with adhesions compared to
      patients without adhesions.

      Furthermore, it has been estimated that about 10% of patients undergoing cesarean section
      experience chronic pain.

      Despite of the big impact on the quality of life of patients and high cost for public health,
      treatments for adhesions are mostly surgical.

      The identification of non-surgical treatments that aim to reduce cicatricial adhesions'
      formation is essential to decrease hospitalization times and associated complications.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of osteopathic treatment and
      self-massage on scars in women who underwent to a cesarean section. The main aim is to assess
      whether there is a change in the number, size and vascularization of of cesarean section
      adhesionsthrough Superb Microvascular Imaging (SMI).
