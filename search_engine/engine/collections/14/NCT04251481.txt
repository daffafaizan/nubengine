      ms) to determine an optimal diffusion time for treatment response assessment when only one
      diffusion time needs to be used, particularly in routine clinical studies. Furthermore, the
      data with multiple diffusion times will also be used to measure the water exchange time of
      cancer cells. Exchange time has been studied using Dynamic Contrast Enhanced (DCE) MRI by
      multiple groups including ours, and has been suggested as a marker of (ii) cellular
      metabolism that regulates the ATP-dependent ion channels co-transporting water molecules. The
      study will measure with dMRI, without using a contrast agent. The investigators also
      demonstrated that Intra-Voxel Incoherent Motion (IVIM) MRI metrics (pseudo diffusivity, Dp;
      perfusion fraction, fp), from multiple b-values at a fixed diffusion time, can be used to
      assess the perfusion status of tumor and they are also associated with tumor interstitial
      fluid pressure. The IVIM effect has been observed in various cancer types (33-39) and animal
      tumor models. The product fp*Dp - a quantity including both blood volume and velocity
      information - is considered as a parameter analogous to (iii) perfusion flow .
