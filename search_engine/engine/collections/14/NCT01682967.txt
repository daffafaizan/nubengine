    
      Parturients who have received epidural analgesia during labour would be included in this
      study and these would comprise of:

        1. patients without clinical symptoms of postdural puncture headache

        2. patients with clinical symptoms of postdural puncture headache

      In addition, a control group of parturients who have not received an epidural analgesia would
      constitute the control group.

      All patients would have audiometry (oto-acoustic emission - OAE, and auditory steady state
      response - ASSR) done following diagnosis of PDPH. Subsequently, the patients would be
      observed for 24 h to assess whether the headache resolves spontaneously. A new audiometry
      would be done at this stage. Those patients with substantial evidence of PDPH at this stage
      would receive an epidural blood patch (EBP) and a new audiometric assessment would be made
      after 4 h and 24 h to assess whether any audiometric deficit has resolved or not. All
      patients would have a similar measurement of hearing after 3 months when it is believed that
      most patients have returned to normal hearing. In addition to audiometric analysis, patients
      would be asked to fill out a detailed PDPH questionnaire at the same time periods.

      All measurements would be compared with patients who have received an EDA but without PDPH
      and those who have not received an EDA.
