      Caucasians. severe structural alterations in the airways and parenchyma, such as
      bronchiectasis, mucus plugging, air trapping and infiltrations. These in turn result in focal
      or heterogeneous abnormalities in regional lung ventilation. End-stage lung disease remains
      the main cause of morbidity and mortality in CF patients. Currently, new targeted CFTR
      correctors and potentiators are under trial. The quantitative assessment of structural and
      functional alterations in the lung is of great importance for the phenotyping and follow-up
      of CF patients, and for the assessment of targeted therapeutic interventions. Computed
      tomography (CT) is considered as the technology of choice for lung imaging in CF. However, CT
      requires exposure to significant ionizing radiation, which is a major concern in the
      pediatric population because children are more radiosensitive than adults and there is an
      increased risk of radiation-induced cancer from the cumulative dose related to repeated CT
      investigations. Recent improvements in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technology offer a
      non-ionizing alternative to CT for imaging the lung parenchyma. The goal of this study is to
      assess the feasibility of measuring the changes in proton density in the lung parenchyma with
      inflation and deflation during the respiratory cycle, using ultrashort echo time (UTE) pulse
      sequence MRI, in healthy adult volunteers. If the regional changes in proton density in the
      lung parenchyma during the respiratory cycle prove to be measurable in healthy volunteers,
      then MRI can be used to quantify regional lung ventilation. This would offer a unique
      non-invasive, radiation- and contrast media-free alternative to CT for phenotyping and
      follow-up of CF patients.
