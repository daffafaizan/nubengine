    
      Children who arrive at the emergency unit with an unstable both-bone midshaft forearm
      fracture will be asked to join the trial.

      If the fracture will be unstable during reposition in the operating room, a randomization
      between 1 or 2 ESIN will be done.

      The aftertreatment will be the same for both groups: above elbow plaster for 3 weeks.
      Outpatient clinic visits till a follow-up of 9 months. During these visits we will
      investigate: consolidation and dislocation on X-ray, function of both arms, complaints in
      daily living and complications.
