      I. Abnormal fluciclovine F18 ([18F] fluciclovine) uptake on visual assessment will differ by
      the type of metastatic lesion present (blastic, lytic, marrow, mixed).

      II. Maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) and mean standardized uptake value (SUVmean)
      on (18F) fluciclovine-positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) imaging
      will differ by the type of metastatic lesion present (blastic, lytic, marrow, mixed).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine if a 25% or greater reduction in average (ave)SUVmax or aveSUVmean on (18F)
      fluciclovine-PET/CT imaging after completion of all radiation therapy will be predictive of
      increased time to biochemical failure.

      II. Determine the correlation between the number of lesions, their visual uptake, and
      semi-quantitative uptake on technetium tc-99m medronate (99mTc-MDP) bone scintigraphy and
      (18F) fluciclovine- PET/CT at baseline.

      III. Determine the correlation between the number of lesions, their visual uptake, and
      semi-quantitative uptake on 99mTc-MDP bone scintigraphy and (18F) fluciclovine- PET/CT after
      3 and 6 cycles of treatment.

      OUTLINE: This is a companion imaging study to Institutional Review Board (IRB) #102312 (A
      Phase 2 Study of Radium-223 and Radiotherapy in Hormone-Naive Men with Oligometastatic
      Prostate Cancer to Bone).

      Patients receive fluciclovine F18 intravenously (IV) over 30 seconds and undergo PET/CT scan
      over 60 minutes at baseline, 3 months and at approximately 6 months of radium-223 therapy.

      After completion of diagnostic testing, patients are followed for 2 years.
