      infants and young children in different populations. Non-nutritive sucking is regarded as a
      normal part of development, and early studies of its prevalence generally found that 70-90%
      of children had some history of a non-nutritive sucking habit. Like these early studies, most
      recent studies have used retrospective methods to assess the prevalence of non-nutritive
      sucking habits.

      Prolonged duration of non-nutritive sucking behaviors may have consequences in regard to the
      developing orofacial structures and occlusion. Little is known as to why some children have
      sucking habits beyond the first 2 to 3 years of life.

      Prevalence of NNSH and associated factors in Egyptian children might be different.
