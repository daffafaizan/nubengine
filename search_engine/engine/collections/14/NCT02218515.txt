    
      The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of enamel matrix derivatives (EMD) either
      alone or combined with autogenous bone graft (ABG) applied to intrabony defects in chronic
      periodontitis patients on clinical/radiographic parameters and gingival crevicular fluid
      (GCF) transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) level and, to compare with open flap debridement
      (OFD). A total of 30 deep intrabony defects in 12 patients were randomly treated with EMD+ABG
      (Combination group), EMD alone (EMD group) or OFD (Control group). Clinical parameters
      including plaque index, gingival index, bleeding on probing, probing depth, relative
      attachment level and recession were recorded at baseline and 6 months post-surgery. Intrabony
      defect fill percentage was calculated on the standardized radiographs. TGF-β1 level was
      evaluated in GCF just before surgery and 7, 14, 30, 90, 180 days after surgery using ELISA.
