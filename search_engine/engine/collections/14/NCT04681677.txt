      recurrent GBM is to expand upon the favorable preliminary results in feasibility, safety and
      efficacy outcomes obtained at the European Medical Center Study Group (EMC Study Group). The
      rationale to add Bevacizumab as a systemic treatment is to target radio-resistant and highly
      tumorigenic cancer stem cells as well as to benefit from its radioprotective effects, i.e.
      reducing risk of radiation necrosis. Lastly, using Bevacizumab as a systemic therapy will
      enable the comparison of the results to the historic control arm, the EBRT arm of RTOG 1205.
