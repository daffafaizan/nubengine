      treatments are effective for overweight, and bariatric surgery is consequently an
      increasingly important option. Although these procedures produce significantly more weight
      change than psychosocial treatments, post-operative weight losses vary widely, about 20% of
      patients clearly experience suboptimal weight loss, and a notable subset of these patients
      demonstrate substantial weight regain. Further, 20-30% report persistence of disturbed
      eating, depression or anxiety, or impaired health related quality of life. Adherence, or "the
      extent to which a person's behavior coincides with medical or health advice," contributes to
      variable weight and psychosocial outcomes, as well as failure to follow dietary guidelines,
      each of which negatively impacts weight loss.

      The present study, utilizing "Noom Coach for Bariatric Health", offers a unique opportunity
      to overcome obstacles to providing empirically supported treatments and to improve standard
      interventions utilized in bariatric surgery programs; however, rigorous research on apps is
      limited, and high-quality, adequately powered, randomized controlled trials with large
      samples are required. The project will therefore test a combined smartphone app and health
      coaching system to improve adherence and behavioral outcomes for patients receiving bariatric
      surgery.
