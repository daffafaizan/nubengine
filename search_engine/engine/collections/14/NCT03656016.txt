      normal pressure hydrocephalus, cystic cerebrospinal fluid collections, Chiari malformation,
      syringomyelic cyst and arachnoid cyst that can change the cerebrospinal fluid dynamics.

      Rapid advances in imaging techniques have remarkably improved the diagnosis and treatment of
      these disorders.

      Phase contrast magnetic resonance imaging is a rapid, simple and non-invasive technique which
      is sensitive to even small cerebrospinal fluid flows, and can be used to evaluate
      cerebrospinal fluid flow both qualitatively and quantitatively. Cine phase contrast magnetic
      resonance images show cerebrospinal fluid flow in a dynamic, more easily appreciable, and in
      a more pleasing manner, allowing the delineation of obstruction, if present, along the
      portions of cerebrospinal fluid pathway where obstruction is common.

      Phase contrast magnetic resonance imaging can be used to discriminate between communicating
      hydrocephalus and non-communicating hydrocephalus, to localize the level of obstruction in
      obstructive hydrocephalus, to determine whether arachnoid cysts communicate with the
      subarachnoid space, to differentiate between arachnoid cysts and subarachnoid space, to
      discriminate between syringomyelia and cystic myelomalacia, and to evaluate flow patterns of
      posterior fossa cystic malformations.

      This imaging method can also provide significant information in pre-operative evaluation of
      Chiari 1 malformation and post-operative follow-up of patients with neuroendoscopic third
      ventriculostomy and ventriculoperitoneal shunt.

      The application of cine phase contrast magnetic resonance imaging technique in patients with
      normal pressure hydrocephalus holds great promise for improvement of the diagnosis,
      especially in those cases where the differentiation from atrophy on clinical and conventional
      radiological basis is difficult.
