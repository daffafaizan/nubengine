    
      The primary objective is to develop a biobank, tissue microarrays (TMAs) and full face
      sections, which will be used to identify candidate/ novel biomarkers prognostic for disease
      relapse and predictive for endocrine and/or chemotherapy resistance.

      The secondary objectives are:

        -  To validate emerging signatures/biomarkers identified.

        -  To develop new assays for the breast cancer clinic.
