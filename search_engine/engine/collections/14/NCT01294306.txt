      I. To evaluate the efficacy (with the primary endpoint of disease control at 12 weeks) and
      tolerability of the combination of MK2206 plus erlotinib (erlotinib hydrochloride) in
      previously erlotinib-treated patients with recurrent or progressive advanced non-small cell
      lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors are either epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutated
      or EGFR wild-type.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine progression-free survival of previously erlotinib-treated patients with NSCLC
      who are treated with MK2206 plus erlotinib. II. To determine the overall survival of
      previously erlotinib-treated patients with NSCLC who are treated with MK2206 plus erlotinib.

      III. To assess the toxicity experienced by previously erlotinib-treated patients with NSCLC
      treated with MK2206 plus erlotinib. IV. To perform correlative analysis of tumor biomarkers
      to assess, in a preliminary manner, the association between tumor mutations and/or
      abnormalities and clinical outcome of previously erlotinib-treated patients with NSCLC
      treated with MK2206 plus erlotinib.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive Akt inhibitor MK2206 orally (PO) every other day (QOD) of a 28-day course,
      and erlotinib hydrochloride PO once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 12 weeks for one year and
      then annually thereafter.
