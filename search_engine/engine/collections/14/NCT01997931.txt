      of therapy. Assessing the appropriate dose of sedative and analgesic drugs can be difficult
      due to the severity of the patient's illness, inability of the patient to communicate,
      multiple procedures and transports for investigations and the subjectivity of clinical
      sedation assessment tools. Poorly assessed and managed levels of sedation can result in over
      sedation, extended ventilation time and a potentially extended ICU stay.

      The BIS monitor is derived from the electroencephalogram and provides a numeric value that
      represents a measure of cerebral activity. Such an objective measure of the patient's level
      of sedation may provide a useful tool that will enable nurses to titrate sedation more
      accurately in an attempt to provide the optimal level of sedation for all ICU patients.

      The study will be conducted in the Intensive Care Unit at the Alfred Hospital. This study is
      designed as a prospective randomised control trial with parallel design. This means that
      participants' will be randomly allocated into either one of two groups - an intervention or
      control group. Participant's randomised to the intervention group will receive BIS
      monitoring. The control group will receive standard ICU sedation assessment and management.

      To determine if BIS monitoring is useful in ICU, information will be collected by auditing
      patient charts and determining the average amounts of sedation medication for each nursing
      shift. In addition, the years of critical care experience and critical care qualification
      will be recorded for each nurse managing patients recruited to the study.
