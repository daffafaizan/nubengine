      vascular tissue and both are vasodilators. However, there has been no direct comparison of
      vasodilative effect between sevoflurane and desflurane in vivo in humans. Peripheral
      perfusion index derived from photoplethysmographic waveform reflects peripheral vasomotor
      tone. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to compare the peripheral perfusion index
      values produced by sevoflurane and desflurane at equipotent concentration in patients
      undergoing single-agent inhalation anesthesia.
