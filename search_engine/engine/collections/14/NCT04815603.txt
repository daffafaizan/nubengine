    
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter, double- blind study of BGE-117
      administered PO in participants â‰¥ 65 years of age for the treatment of unexplained anemia in
      aging (UAA). UAA is a diagnosis of anemia where a definitive cause for the anemia cannot be
      found despite standard investigations. This study's planned size is 160 evaluable subjects
      (80 subjects randomized to BGE-117 and 80 subjects randomized to placebo).

      After signing informed consent, participants will be screened for study eligibility.
      Screening will include full physical examination, vital signs, safety and study-related
      laboratory evaluation, ophthalmic exam, ECG, vascular doppler ultrasound, and clinical
      outcome assessment. Two-screening visits are required at least 7 days apart for laboratory
      assessments. If confirmed that the participant qualifies for this protocol according to
      listed inclusion and exclusion criteria, participants will be randomized to BGE-117 or
      placebo, PO, once per day, for a treatment period duration of approximately 12 weeks. Dose
      adjustments for study medication during the treatment period are made according to a dosing
      algorithm to achieve and maintain hemoglobin (Hb) within the target range (12.0-13.0 g/dL).
      Study procedures and assessments are performed at various timepoints during the treatment
      period per the schedule outlined in the study protocol. Participants will undergo follow-up
      assessments for approximately 4 weeks after administration of the last dose.
