    
      To pilot a randomized clinical trial (RCT) of a transition adherence club (TCAC) versus
      traditional care, among ex-inmates receiving antiretroviral therapy in South Africa, to study
      feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness using mixed methods.

      Investigators will pilot an RCT of the TCAC compared to traditional care among
      inmates/ex-inmates measuring transition in care, six-month viral load suppression, and
      follow-up of participants. Feasibility will be assessed by process measures. Acceptability
      will be assessed using in-depth interviews among 36 participants and 10 staff. Effectiveness
      will be assessed by a difference in proportions in-care with an undetectable viral load at 6
      months and difference in bonding social capital and care satisfaction between arms.
