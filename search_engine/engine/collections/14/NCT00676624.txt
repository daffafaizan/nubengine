      semi-quantification evaluation of the inflammation, fundoscopy incl. picture, and
      angiography.

      The biopsies taken from the patient are in the routine program are patients tested for
      intraocular infections with Herpes Simplex Virus, Cytomegalovirus, Varicella Zoster virus,
      Epstein-Barr virus and toxoplasma with PCR and serology on serum. Test for others infections
      like Candida spp. and Toxocare are done if clini-cally indicated. Other test includes
      cytopathological test of the corpus vitreum for cancer cells and serological test for
      Syphilis.

      Beside the above mentioned test will we in this study test for:

      Infections with Leptospira, Bartonella, Brucella, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Leptospira,
      Toxocare, Borrelia, HIV.

      We will use unspecific molecular test for Bacteria under a special setup to avoid DNA
      contamination. Culture of Leptospira will be done on urine samples.
