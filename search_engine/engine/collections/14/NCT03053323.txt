      depression who are pregnant or trying to conceive to learn to exercise, eat well, and live a
      healthy lifestyle. They are interested in examining if this therapy-based program can
      positively impact eating and exercising habits and see if the treatment is enjoyable. All
      participants will receive this intervention.
