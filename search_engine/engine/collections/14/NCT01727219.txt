      depression in stable COPD patients. Stable COPD patients will be enrolled from the tertiary
      hospitals. All patients will undergo lung function tests. The Korean versions of the CAT
      (COPD assessment test) and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) will be used to assess COPD
      symptoms and depressive disorder, respectively.

      We will compare the depresssion frequency among GOLD classifications of airway limitation and
      among the four CAT groups. And. we will also investigate which items of the CAT are the
      strongest indicators of depression.
