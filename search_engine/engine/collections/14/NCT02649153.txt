      with intermediate and advanced disease. Despite its well-demonstrated clinical safety and
      efficacy in many patients, it is associated with postoperative morbidity and mortality. One
      complication after hepatectomy is delayed resumption of gastrointestinal function, known as
      postoperative ileus. This can decrease patient comfort and increase morbidity and mortality,
      prolonging hospital stay and raising healthcare costs. While postoperative ileus usually
      resolves within approximately 3 days, it can last longer in some cases as a condition termed
      postoperative paralytic ileus. Postoperative use of opioid-based analgesics can increase
      incidence of postoperative ileus.

      No drugs or interventions to prevent or treat postoperative ileus have been approved by the
      China Drug Administration or the US Food and Drug Administration. Several studies show that
      chewing gum, a new and simple modality, can accelerate complication-free recovery of
      gastrointestinal function following gastrointestinal surgery and obstetrical-gynecological
      surgery. This raises the question whether postoperative smoked plum, or chewing gum can
      reduce risk of postoperative ileus following hepatectomy. To examine this question, we
      conducted a randomized controlled trial to compare incidence of postoperative ileus and
      length of hospital stay in HCC patients who received smoked plum, chewing gum or no
      intervention following hepatectomy.
