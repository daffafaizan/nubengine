      collect the data of recipients or donated organs as following: physiological and biochemical
      indexes, machine perfusion parameters, and the other factors effected on renal transplant
      outcomes. A Cox proportional hazards model and multiple linear regression analysis will be
      applied to examine the correlation among the univariate and multivariate. Based on the above
      analysis to improve the new scoring system, Lifeport work platform evaluation system and
      donor kidney quality evaluation system. Then, a multi-center clinical trial will be started
      to improve and verify the new scoring system. Finally, a donor kidney evaluation APP will be
      developed based on the scoring system and the database of clinical trials. An applicaiotion
      (APP) will be popularized the national transplant surgeons.
