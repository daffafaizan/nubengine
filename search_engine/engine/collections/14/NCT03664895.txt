        1. Inclusion criteria

             -  Premenopausal

             -  ER+

             -  Planned tamoxifen(TMX)

             -  No planned ovary function suppression(OFS)

             -  Regardless of ChemoTx

             -  Mammography(MMG) density check via Volpara*(=Baseline MMG density, BaMD) (*Volpara=
                software to check MMG density)

        2. Check MMG Density via Volpara After 1yr TMX (At1yrMD) Check menopausal status after 1yr
           TMX(Menstruation episode or FSH <30)

        3. MMG Density Reduction(MDR =BaMD-AtMD ) at 1yr

        4. MDR ≥5% -> Keep go on TMX MDR <5% -> 1:1 randomization -> Keep go on TMX vs OFS add on
           to TMX

        5. Analysis : 5yr MDR (1'endpoint), 5yr DFS(2'endpoint), 5yr OS

        6. Calculation of patients' number In previous study(<Kim et al. Breast Can Res 2012>) MDR
           (Mammography Density Reduction) was found in about 50% of all patients who received
           endocrine therapy.

      Expected

        -  MDR in "TMX only" cohort -> 6 ± 7%

        -  MDR in "OFS add on to TMX" -> 10 ± 7%

             -  after 1yr, Significance level 5%, average MDR 4% difference, 80% power, 10% dropout
                rate => 1:1 randomization Number = 112(56:56) Total number = 224
