      carried out in 50 healthy university students, both genders. In random order the participants
      will be investigated during stressful-period (prior to an exam) and a non-stressful (control
      period) period. Each participant will take part in all together four visits, two in the
      stressful period and two visits in the non-stressful period.

      STATISTICAL ANALYSES Analysis of the primary outcome (food choices) will be based on an
      ANCOVA-type linear mixed model with the intervention and allocation order as the fixed effect
      and person as the random effect. Analysis will be performed using the software R, SAS, STATA
      or SPSS. Analyses, data processing and writing of the article are expected to extend over the
      study period and a year beyond.
