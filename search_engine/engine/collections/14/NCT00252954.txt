    
      Study design: Randomized double-blind cross-over study of levetiracetam (Keppra) against
      corresponding placebo with a 1 week baseline period followed by 2 x 5 weeks treatment periods
      separated by a 1 week wash-out period.

      Methodology: Levetiracetam and corresponding placebo is gradually increased during two weeks
      from 500 mg x 2 daily to 1500 mg x 2 daily (1000 mg x 2 daily is allowed if 1500 mg x 2 is
      not tolerated), and kept on that dose for three weeks.

      The study will be monitored by the GCP units of Aarhus and Copenhagen University.
