      patients to perceive they are in an upright position when in fact they are positioned towards
      their affected side. These patients use their unaffected limbs to 'push' themselves away from
      their unaffected side in an attempt to correct their perceived postural alignment. PS is a
      common disorder and can affect 16% of stroke patients.

      Patients with PS have shown to take longer to improve in rehabilitation than non-PS patients
      and tend to stay in hospital for longer.

      Galvanic Vestibular Stimulation (GVS) involves passing a small electrical current behind the
      ear to stimulate the vestibular system to in-turn cause the head and body to move.
