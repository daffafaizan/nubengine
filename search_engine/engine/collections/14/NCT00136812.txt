      care control condition (on-unit NRT with self-help brochure) in producing biochemically
      verified abstinence from cigarettes at 3-, 6-, 12-, and 18-months follow up. Additionally,
      intervention participants will exhibit greater stage progression, commitment to abstinence,
      and delay in relapse to smoking following hospital discharge, factors predictive of future
      success with quitting smoking. Smoking cessation treatments have been shown to be highly
      cost-effective with the general population of smokers, and cost is likely to be a
      consideration in efforts to incorporate additional services into an inpatient psychiatric
      setting. Therefore, a secondary specific aim is to model the cost-effectiveness of the
      smoking cessation intervention. Intervention efficacy will be examined in a university-based
      psychiatric inpatient unit. A smaller pilot study will examine translation of the
      intervention to a county hospital serving a more diversified patient population.
