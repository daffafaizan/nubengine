      reduction in size of the hippocampal part of the brain predict a person's conversion from MCI
      to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Increases in tangle-related abnormal tau proteins, specifically
      P-tau231, also appear to be related.

      This study will collect neuropsychological data, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from volunteer participants to measure the relationship between
      changes in brain volume, CSF levels, and memory performance.

      From the data researchers hope to develop an early diagnostic test for AD.

      The study will include 170 participants between the ages of 60 and 80 years, some normal,
      some with MCI, some with mild AD, and some with frontotemporal dementia. After initial
      screening of volunteers, the researchers will give participants a complete baseline exam and
      24-month follow-up exams over a period of five years.
