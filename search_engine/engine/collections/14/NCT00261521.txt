      is a long-term, double-blind, parallel-group, multicenter study to determine the efficacy and
      safety of administering epoetin alfa to treat anemia (patients in Group 1) or partially treat
      anemia (patients in Group 2) in order to reduce the risk of heart failure in chronic renal
      failure patients on early dialysis and to improve their quality of life. Efficacy of epoetin
      alfa will be determined by comparing between Group 1 and Group 2 the heart structure (changes
      in left ventricle volume and mass viewed on echocardiograms), development of heart failure,
      correlation between changes in heart structure and hemoglobin level, a 6-minute walking test,
      and by 2 quality of life measures-a quality of life questionnaire and a fatigue
      questionnaire. Safety data associated with elevation of hemoglobin will be collected and
      monitored throughout the study: hemoglobin-related adverse events include thrombovascular
      events, seizures, and hypertension. Development of antibodies to erythropoetin over long-term
      treatment also will be assessed by serum samples gathered over the course of the study. The
      hypothesis of this study is that earlier and longer-term anemia intervention in patients
      without symptomatic heart disease or heart architecture distortions may conserve heart
      function and improve their quality of life, and that the intervention will be well tolerated
      by the patients. Patients not on epoetin alfa at start: epoetin alfa (50 IU/kg), 3 times per
      week with increases every 4 weeks at either 25 IU/kg or up to 25% of previous dose to reach
      target hemoglobin (Hb), then dose maintained. Patients on or switched to epoetin alfa at
      start are titrated to maintain target Hb.
