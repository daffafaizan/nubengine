      a DNA vaccine encoding human PAP, with GM-CSF as a vaccine adjuvant, in subjects with stage
      D0 prostate cancer. In addition, to determine whether PAP-specific IFNÐ£-secreting CD8+ T
      cells can be augmented in subjects with stage D0 prostate cancer by means of immunization
      with a plasmid DNA vaccine encoding PAP.

      This is a phase I design where patients will receive the vaccine pTVG-HP with rhGM-CSF
      administered i.d. biweekly for 6 total doses. There will be three escalating dose cohorts.
      The dosing cohort considered to be the maximum tolerated dose level will be expanded up to a
      total of 16 patients.
