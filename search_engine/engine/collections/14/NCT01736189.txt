      Most participants received 40 mg of adalimumab every other week during the study. Two
      participants started at 40 mg of adalimumab every other week, and increased to 80 mg every
      other week. A few participants had a different dose regimen: 40 mg every three weeks for 3
      participants; 40 mg every four weeks for 1 participant; and 40 mg every other week with a
      switch to 50 mg every three weeks for 4 subjects.
