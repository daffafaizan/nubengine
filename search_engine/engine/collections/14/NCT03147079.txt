      women assigned to antenatal care in Sweden have overweight (BMI≥25) or obesity (BMI≥30).
      Obesity is associated with adverse perinatal outcomes, the risks increase with increasing BMI
      and excessive gestational weight gain (GWG) further increases the risks of adverse pregnancy
      outcomes. Lifestyle intervention can help pregnant women with obesity to limit their GWG.
      This study evaluated whether a low-budget antenatal lifestyle intervention programme, with
      emphasis on nutrition and physical activity, influenced GWG and maternal and perinatal
      outcomes for pregnant women with obesity. The study also evaluated which specific components
      of the intervention that had effect.
