      influences on recurrent hernia formation. Patients with recurrent abdominal hernias will be
      compared with normal control subjects. The study endpoints will compare tissue collagen I/III
      ratios between the groups. It will also use gene chip technology to identify potential
      differences in gene expression between the two groups, followed by confirmation of the
      differential expression using RT-PCR.

      Patients will be enrolled from the surgical clinic population. If they consent to the study,
      both the hernia group and the control group will have 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.1 cm3 pieces of skin and
      fascia collected at the time of their surgery. A small piece of tissue will be used for
      immunofluorescene to study collagen I/III ratios. RNA will be extracted from the rest of the
      tissue for the genetic studies.
