      to prepare patients to make more informed decisions and satisfying decisions that match their
      preferences and values. With greater understanding of the risks and benefits of the treatment
      options patients may make a more informed choice.

      Decision aids - delivered online, on paper, or on video - increase patient participation in
      the decision-making process,1 and can result in a decrease in discretionary surgery for knee
      osteoarthritis, herniated disk, and benign prostatic hypertrophy.2-4 They also reduce
      decisional conflict. Relatively few studies have investigated the influence of decision aids
      in orthopedic or hand surgery. Decision aids might affect decisional conflict, satisfaction,
      and outcomes in hand surgery where many treatments are discretionary and address quality of
      life.

      Utilizing the Ottawa Decision Support Framework- an evidence-based, practical theory used to
      guide the development of decision aids - and the International Patient Decision Aid Standards
      criteria the investigators developed a decision aid for trapeziometacarpal arthritis.
