      lean body mass, fatigue, exercise tolerance, functional capacity, and total body weight in
      cancer patients with anemia related fatigue.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo progressive resistance training (PRT) consisting of 3 sets of 8
      repetitions of concentric (lifting) and eccentric (lowering) exercises over 4-6 seconds each
      using bench press, arm pull, knee extension, knee flexion, and double leg press followed by
      1-2 minutes of rest between sets. Patients undergo warm up and cool down periods over 10
      minutes prior to and following PRT. Patients perform PRT 3 times a week for 12 weeks.
      Patients also receive epoetin alfa subcutaneously once weekly over 4-12 weeks in the absence
      of unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study over 15 months.
