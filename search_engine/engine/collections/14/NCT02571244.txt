      post-discharge follow up for at least a month are more likely to quit smoking than those who
      didn't receive any intervention. The current challenge is to know the best way to support
      post-discharge quit attempts in the Brazilian context. Objective: The aim of this study was
      to compare the feasibility and effectiveness of motivational interview (MI) plus Personalized
      text messages (TM) and usual care for support smoking cessation among post-discharge
      patients. Methods: All patients admitted to the University Hospital of Juiz de Fora
      (HU/UFJF), between 06/2015 to 01/2016, were asked about the cigarettes consumption in the
      last 30 days. Smokers patients received brief interventions and nicotine replacement therapy
      during the hospitalization. After hospitalization discharge smokers were allocated into a
      intervention or control arm. The intervention group received a singular MI session by phone
      and mobile phone TM twice a day during eight or fifteen days. The control group received only
      usual care available inside the hospital. Results: At the first and third months, after
      randomization, the patients were contacted for smoke abstinence assessment.
