      patients with a suspected rheumatologic disorder. The Intervention is the use of Diagnostic
      Decision Support Software (DDSS) already available as a Boston Children's Hospital resource.

        -  Main objective: To assess if the use of the DDSS by trainees and nurse practitioners can
           improve their diagnostic performance in developing a differential diagnosis and plan in
           real clinical use. (Studies have shown in prior research that the use of the DDSS does
           so for case vignettes, lowering diagnostic errors of trainees by 75%). The study will
           compare how closely the differential diagnosis and plan of the trainees and nurse
           practitioners approximate those of their senior Pediatric Rheumatology attending
           physician colleagues.

        -  Secondary objective: To assess how frequently the differential diagnosis of the trainees
           and nurse practitioners includes the definitive diagnosis by doing a manual chart review
           weeks after the visit. (Studies have shown in prior research that if the definitive
           diagnosis is in the initial differential diagnosis, the right tests get ordered, and
           diagnostic errors are avoided.)

      The design is a parallel one, comparing subjects (trainees and nurse practitioners) using the
      DDSS (Intervention Arm) to subjects who do not use the DDSS (Control Arm). In both study
      arms, subjects may use all other traditional resources. Arm assignment will be by patient
      case rather than trainee / nurse practitioner to reduce variation due to each subject's
      different capabilities (years of training and familiarity with pediatric rheumatology).
