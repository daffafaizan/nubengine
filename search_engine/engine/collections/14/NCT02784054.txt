      radiotherapy. Also, late sequelae such as endocrinopathy or cognitive problem are unavoidable
      especially with craniospinal irradiation. In this study, high dose chemotherapy and reduced
      dose of radiotherapy will be used to improve survival and minimize the late sequelae in the
      patients with intracranial NGGCT.
