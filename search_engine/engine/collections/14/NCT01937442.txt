      thalidomide-containing therapy or are newly diagnosed. The study will consist of a screening
      phase, a baseline phase, a PK phase with a 5-day period of thalidomide treatment (200
      mg/day), and an end-of-study evaluation on Day 6. Subjects will have frequent blood samples
      drawn for PK assessments on Days 5 and 6 in an inpatient setting.
