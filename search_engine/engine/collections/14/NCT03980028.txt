    
      Primary objective :

      To demonstrate that ultra-radical surgery with multiple visceral resections and high tumor
      burden prior to surgery independently reduces the survival of patients with advanced ovarian
      cancer treated with complete cytoreductive surgery.

      Secondary objectives:

        1. Demonstrate that, in patients with advanced ovarian cancer (FIGO stage IIIC-IVB) treated
           by complete cytoreduction surgery, the high tumor load before surgery decreases
           survival. / Evaluate whether there is a sub-group of patients at risk for whom the high
           tumor burden prior to surgery reduces survival.

        2. Demonstrate that, in patients with advanced ovarian cancer (FIGO stage IIIC-IVB) treated
           by complete cytoreduction surgery, the extension of carcinomatosis to the upper abdomen
           reduces the chances of survival. / Assess whether there is a subgroup of patients at
           risk for whom the extension of carcinomatosis to the upper abdomen reduces survival.

        3. Demonstrate that, in patients with advanced ovarian cancer (FIGO Stage IIIC-IVB) treated
           by complete cytoreduction surgery, invasion of the celiac lymph nodes reduces survival
           rates. / Assess whether there is a subset of patients at risk where the invasion of the
           celiac lymph nodes reduces survival.

        4. Demonstrate that, in patients with advanced ovarian cancer (FIGO stage IIIC-IVB) treated
           with complete cytoreduction surgery, combination with surgical procedures reduces
           survival. / Evaluate whether there is a sub-group of at-risk patients for whom the
           combination of surgical procedures with ultra-radical surgery reduces survival.
