      outcomes in LBW infants using a randomized controlled trial. Infants currently being treated
      in the KMC or neonatal wards of the participating hospitals will be screened for eligibility
      by study nurses. After obtaining parental consent, infants will be randomly assigned with a
      1:1 ratio to KMC with and without the BEMPU® bracelet.

      A standardized questionnaire will be administered to each mother to collect information on
      socio-demographic characteristics and contact information. As is the standard of care, all
      mothers regardless of study arm will be taught how to provide KMC, how to monitor the
      infant's condition and recognize dangerous clinical signs during KMC and will be supported by
      a nurse during initial attempts at practicing KMC.

      Mothers of infants randomly allocated to the intervention arm will be taught to use the
      bracelet. The meaning of the audiovisual alarm will be explained as well as the measures to
      be taken if the device indicates any sign of hypothermia. There will not be any additional
      training beyond that pertaining to the BEMPU® bracelet. The study nurse will then place the
      BEMPU® bracelet on the wrist of the infant. Infants in the intervention arm will wear the
      bracelet for up to 28 days post-discharge.

      After discharge, participants in both the intervention and control arms will receive two
      study visits; one at 7 days post discharge and one at 28 days post-discharge. During each
      visit, infants will receive a physical examination to collect weight, length, head
      circumference and axillary temperature, and additional data will be collected on history of
      illnesses, care-seeking and treatment, KMC and feeding practices, and frequency of use of the
      bracelet (if applicable).
