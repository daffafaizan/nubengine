    
      Patients will be randomized using a list of computer generated random sample into two groups:

      Group 1: Couples who will undergo endometrial sampling in the luteal phase of the cycle
      preceding ovulation induction by clomiphene citrate.

      Group 2: Couples who will undergo ovulation induction with clomiphene citrate. The drug
      chosen for ovulation induction in both groups will be clomephine citrate.

      Timing and technique of endometrial sampling:

      Timing: from day 15 to day 24 of the cycle preceding ovulation induction cycle. Technique:
      this will be done using the pipelle method (Williams et al., 2008).

      The procedure is as follows:

        1. Vaginal speculum to expose the uterine cervix then sterilization by saline.

        2. The piston positioned at the extreme distal end of the sheath then the Pipelle is
           inserted gently through the cervical canal into the cavity of the uterus.

        3. While holding the sheath in position with one hand, the other hand rapidly pulls the
           piston firmly and without interruption.

        4. A negative pressure within the sheath will draw the tissue into the curette opening at
           the distal end of the sheath and captures the separated tissue within its lumen.
