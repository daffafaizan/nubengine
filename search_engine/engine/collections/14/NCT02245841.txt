      most commonly affecting the skin and musculoskeletal system. Amyopathic dermatomyositis is a
      subtype of dermatomyositis that affects only the skin and lacks the characteristic muscle
      involvement. Treatment of these conditions, in particular the cutaneous manifestations, is
      challenging and currently no universally effective single treatment exists. Many patients
      have cutaneous manifestations that are refractory to numerous medications.

      H.P. Acthar gel (adrenocorticotropic hormone gel) received FDA approval for treatment of a
      variety of diseases, including dermatomyositis, in 1952. Despite this there is a paucity of
      clinical data concerning the efficacy of H.P. Acthar gel for treating dermatomyositis.
      Recently a small, retrospective case series describing significant improvement in both
      cutaneous and musculoskeletal symptoms in 5 patients with refractory dermatomyositis treated
      with H.P. Acthar gel was reported and has resulted in renewed interest in use of this
      medication in dermatomyositis patient (reference below). The proposed efficacy of H.P. Acthar
      gel has been attributed to its unique ability to induce production of endogenous cortisol,
      corticosterone, aldosterone, and to bind melanocortin receptors on lymphocytes and other
      cells to modulate immunologic responses.
