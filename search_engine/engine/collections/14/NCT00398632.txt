    
      In this study, subjects suffering from depression or dysthymia and experiencing
      treatment-emergent sexual dysfunction from an SSRI are switched from their SSRI to duloxetine
      to determine whether or not they experience improved sexual function and equal or improved
      antidepressant response. Study subjects are assigned to receive open label duloxetine for 12
      weeks at either 60mg per day or 120mg per day after discontinuing their current
      antidepressant
