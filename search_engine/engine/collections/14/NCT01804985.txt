      which will open shortly. This will incorporate a de-escalation and stopping strategy for
      patients who achieve excellent responses after at least 3 years of treatment with a tyrosine
      kinase inhibitor (TKI).

      DESTINY is to act as a pilot for this strategy in SPIRIT3, by defining the proportion of
      patients that relapse during 12 months of TKI de-escalation followed by 24 months of
      cessation. DESTINY also includes scientific bolt-on studies, quality of life assessments and
      health economic evaluation.
