    
      A Prospective, Multicenter, Single-Arm Clinical Study of 51 subjects who are seeking a
      procedure to reduce the appearance of the periorbital wrinkles, and meet study eligibility
      criteria, and have provided informed consent will be enrolled in the study. Up to 5
      investigational centers in Israel and the United States will participate in the recruitment.
      Each study subject will receive 4 treatments with Tixel in a monthly interval. Follow-up will
      occur at 1 month and 3 months following the last treatment.

      The clinic visits will be as follow:

        1. Baseline (1st tx)

        2. Phone-call visit (3 days after the first treatment)

        3. 4wk (2nd tx)

        4. 8wk (3rd tx)

        5. 12wk (4th tx)

        6. 4 weeks after the last treatment (1st FU)

        7. 12 weeks after the last treatment (2nd FU= 3 months FU, primary endpoint and study
           completion visit) Primary Efficacy Endpoint is the comparison of the proportion of
           subjects with a â‰¥ 1-score improvement on the FWCS at the 3-month visit compared to
           baseline as determined by at least 2 out of 3 blinded Independent Photographic
           Reviewers.

      Primary Safety Endpoint is the evaluation of related adverse events up to the 3-month visit
      after treatment.
