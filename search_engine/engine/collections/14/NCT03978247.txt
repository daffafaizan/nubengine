      bariatric surgery course. An additional blood sample will be taken upstream of the surgical
      procedure in the fasted subject. The metabolic fingerprint of the patient will be analyzed on
      serum from spectral data measured at most two hours after collection. The spectra obtained by
      the spectroscopy platform will be processed by algorithmic analysis to build the diagnostic
      test.

      During the surgical procedure, a liver biopsy will be performed. The sample will be sent to
      the pathology laboratory for preparation and the slides will then be anonymized to be sent to
      a specialized laboratory for centralized reading by an expert pathologist. This expert will
      determine the diagnosis of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) or non-NASH after microscopic
      analysis of the sample without having any information about the patient.

      The two results obtained by the spectroscopic test and by means of the biopsy will then be
      compared to determine the diagnostic performance of the developped test (NASHMIR test).
