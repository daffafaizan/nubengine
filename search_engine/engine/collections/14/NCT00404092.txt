    
      Due to its efficacy and a broad antifungal spectrum against relevant fungal pathogens, lack
      of cross-resistance to azoles and amphotericin B, documented efficacy against human
      Aspergillus infections, favorable pharmacokinetic properties, and excellent tolerability
      according to the current data, caspofungin is a highly promising candidate for improving the
      results of treatment of invasive fungal infections.

      Preclinical and clinical data indicate a dose dependent antifungal efficacy of caspofungin as
      well as of other echinocandins such as micafungin and anidulafungin. Thus it appears
      reasonable to investigate the impact of higher doses of caspofungin to improve the results
      already achieved with this component so far.

      The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of caspofungin and the distribution of the drug in patients
      following administration of doses of 70 mg or more are not yet known. We therefore
      investigate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of caspofungin in rising doses in a
      dose escalation study in adult patients with proven or probable invasive aspergillosis.
