      with steroids has been suggested to be a potential protective therapy, although the benefits
      and risks have not been clearly established.

      The TESTING study was established to compare the effects of oral methylprednisolone 0.8
      mg/kg/day weaning over 6-8 months, to matching placebo on the risk of kidney failure events,
      using a double-blind, randomised, controlled design.

      After the randomisation of 262 participants to the TESTING an imbalance in serious adverse
      events was noted between the methylprednisolone and placebo arms of the trial by the Data
      Monitoring Committee, mostly due to infection. As the data also suggested likely benefit on
      kidney outcomes, a further 240 participants will be randomised to methylprednisolone 0.4
      mg/kg/day compared to matching placebo (The TESTING low-dose group). Oral
      sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim will also be provided to reduce the risk of infection All
      participants will undergo long term follow-up until at least 160 primary outcome events are
      observed (expected to be an average of at least 4 years), and the effects of steroids on the
      risk of the composite kidney outcome will be assessed on the study population as a whole,
      stratified for treatment regimen so long as there is no evidence of significant heterogeneity
      in the efficacy at reducing the primary outcome.

      Each of the original and the low-dose cohorts in TESTING will also have separate power to
      detect reductions in proteinuria and effects on average eGFR, along with effects on important
      safety outcomes with the steroid regimens used.
