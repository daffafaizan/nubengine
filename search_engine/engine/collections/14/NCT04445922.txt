      breast cancer. A generic anastrozole tablet was developed to offer an alternative to the
      marketed tablet formulation.The aim of the current study was to evaluate the bioequivalence
      between the test and reference formulations of anastrozole in a single-dose, 2-period,
      2-sequence crossover study with a 21-day washout interval. A total of 26 healthy Chinese
      female subjects were randomized to receive a single dose of 1.0-mg test and reference
      formulations of anastrozole within 30 min after beginning the consumption of a recommended
      high-fat, high-calorie breakfast (150 calories from protein, 250 calories from carbohydrate,
      and 500-600 calories from fat; total calories approximately 800-1000).This was repeated two
      times, separated by a 21-day washout period.Blood samples (3 mL) for pharmacokinetic analysis
      were collected predose and 20min, 40min, 1, 1.5, 2, 2h20min, 2h40min, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 7,
      12, 24, 48 and 72 hours postdose and were determined by a fully validated high-pressure
      liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method. The evaluated pharmacokinetic
      parameters, including Cmax, AUC0-t, AUC0-âˆž,were assessed for bioequivalence based on current
      guidelines.
