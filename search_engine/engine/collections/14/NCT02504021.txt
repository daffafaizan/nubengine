    
      Patients hospitalized at Henry For Hospital who have end stage renal disease will complete
      baseline questionnaires and be randomized into the experimental or control condition.
      Patients randomized into the experimental condition will have a single family consultation
      session before the patient is discharged. A trained, master's level therapist will conduct
      the family consultation, which will use education, motivational interviewing, and other
      techniques to help the family engage and support the patient's health needs. Patients in both
      the experimental and control conditions will complete follow up questionnaires 1 month after
      discharge. Investigators will conduct chart reviews of outcome data, including readmissions,
      at 1, 3, and 6 months post-discharge.
