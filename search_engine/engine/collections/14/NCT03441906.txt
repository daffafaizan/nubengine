      years of age) that will be newly diagnosed in 1.5 years period from October 1st 2017 to March

      in England).

      Patients will be invited before the start of treatment (with a two months eligibility window)
      and receive a questionnaire on diagnostic delay, risk factors and patient-reported outcomes.
      The questionnaire on patient-reported outcomes will be completed again 3 months, 6 months,
      1-year and 2 years later.

      Data collection will be done within PROFILES, an international registry for cancer patient
      reported outcomes (www.profilesregistry.nl). Clinical data will be collected through cancer
      registries and the junior investigator will collect extra data from patients' records.
