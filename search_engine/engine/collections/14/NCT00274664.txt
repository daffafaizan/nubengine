      service resource, and within the hospital sector account for around 80-90% of visits to the
      children's eye service. Occlusion of the better eye is the mainstay of treatment and because
      we have little understanding of the dose-response relationship this may continue for many
      months and sometimes for many hundreds of hours. This is demanding for the child and family
      as a whole and yet the outcome is frequently unsatisfactory. Currently, there is no reliable
      data on the kinetics of visual improvement, so occlusion tends to be prescribed on an ad hoc
      basis. Recent pilot research has shown that 75% of the treatment-generated improvement occurs
      within the first 4 weeks when 6 hours/day occlusion is prescribed.

      In this study we explore the possibility that by intensive treatment the period of amblyopia
      therapy can be shortened - i.e. made both more efficient and hopefully more effective. The
      purpose of the present study, the Randomized Occlusion Treatment of Amblyopia Study (ROTAS),
      is to compare two frequently employed patching regimens: 'substantial' (6 hrs/day) against
      'maximal' (12 hrs/day) patching. Our experimental design incorporates objective occlusion
      monitoring and is able to discriminate the beneficial effect of refractive correction from
      that of occlusion. The study comprises three phases: 'baseline', 'refractive adaptation' and
      'occlusion.' Our aim is to provide guidelines for patient management based, for the first
      time, on experimentally determined and statistically verifiable relationships between
      treatment and outcome.
