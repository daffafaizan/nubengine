      signing an informed consent form, all subjects will undergo medical examination which
      includes ECG, anthropometric measurements and Vo2max test. Afterwards, the subjects will
      perform 6 acclimatization days carried out by the standard protocol of Heat Tolerance Test
      (HTT). After acclimatization, the subjects will undergo 4 experiment days under heavy heat
      stress in a climatic chamber, dressed in each experiment day with one out of 4 clothing
      combinations (NBC protective garment [charcoal base], combat garment and 2 different types of
      work uniforms). Physiological stress will be evaluated from rectal temperature and heart rate
      measurements.
