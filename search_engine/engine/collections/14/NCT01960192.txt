      confined to the brain, leptomeninges, spinal cord, and eyes. The optimum treatment for
      patients with PCNSL remains challenging and at present there is no universally accepted
      therapeutic approach for patients with newly diagnosed disease. The purpose of this study is
      to evaluate the efficacy and safety of FVD regiment(fotemustine, teniposide and
      dexamethasone)contrast with HD-MTX-Ara-C program for patients with primary CNS lymphoma.
