      outcome for these patients, allowing a definitive surgical procedure. There are no reported
      cases of resolution of pulmonary hypertension with the use of pulmonary vasodilators allowing
      successful ASD closure.

      We report the case of a patient with trisomy 21 and a primum atrial septum defect with
      associated cleft mitral valve who was diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension at 8 days of
      life. Elevated pulmonary pressures were documented by cardiac catheterization during which
      the patient was found to have minimally responsive pulmonary vasculature to the
      administration of oxygen. He was started on pulmonary vasodilators which were continued for
      the following 5 months which resulted in gradual reduction in estimated PA pressure allowing
      successful closure of the primum ASD and repair of the cleft mitral valve. Following surgery,
      he was not restarted on pulmonary vasodilators and has continued to do well. The ability to
      reverse his pulmonary hypertension through the use of pulmonary vasodilators made him a
      candidate for his successful, definitive surgical repair. He currently has no residual
      cardiac problems and requires no cardiac medications. There will be no patient follow-up.
