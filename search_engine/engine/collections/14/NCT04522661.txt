    
      The EVIAN Study is a multicentre, feasibility, randomised controlled trial to evaluate the
      effect of early vitrectomy surgery on acute endophthalmitis.

      Patients with postoperative exogenous endophthalmitis following any ocular
      surgery/procedure/injection intervention will be recruited at 48 hours following initial
      presentation.

      Patients with vision of 35 ETDRS letters or better are ineligible for the trial, and would
      continue on standard of care management. Patients with vision of worse than 35 ETDRS letters
      will be eligible for the study. At the 48-hour time-point, eligible patients will be
      randomised in a 1:1 ratio.

      The treatment group will undergo vitrectomy between 48-96 hours of enrolment. The control
      group will have continued intravitreal antibiotic eye injections according to local
      protocols. If the vision reaches perception of light, then a vitrectomy surgery would be
      considered as part of standard of care at 12-15 days. Follow up will be for 6 months in both
      groups.

      Visual acuity, funds photography, B-scan ultrasound, and optical coherence tomography (OCT)
      scanning will be performed from baseline until the final follow-up at 24 weeks.
