      food. The AGE content in food is determined by the types of food you eat and also how you
      prepare your food. The researchers helping conduct this study have found a potential link
      between AGE levels and cancer. The purpose of this study is to identify safe pharmaceutical
      agents that can reduce the AGE levels in subjects with advanced cancer.
