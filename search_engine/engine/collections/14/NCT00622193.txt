      Despite the significant importance of cancer-related cachexia, treatments are lacking and
      there are no products approved for this indication. Anamorelin HCl, by virtue of its ghrelin
      agonist activity, may serve a role in the treatment of cancer cachexia. This placebo
      controlled dose range study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of anamorelin HCl in
      patients with non-small cell lung cancer, a cancer associated with a high prevalence of
      cachexia.
