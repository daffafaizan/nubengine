        -  Determine the safety and toxicity of doxorubicin, gemcitabine, and filgrastim (G-CSF)
           followed by ifosfamide, paclitaxel, cisplatin, and G-CSF in patients with metastatic or
           locally advanced transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelium.

        -  Determine the efficacy of this regimen in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of gemcitabine.

      Patients receive doxorubicin IV over 30 minutes and gemcitabine IV on day 1 and filgrastim
      (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) on days 3-11. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for 5 courses.

      After completion of the fifth course, patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours and
      cisplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1, ifosfamide IV over 1 hour on days 1-3, and G-CSF SC daily
      on days 6-17. Treatment repeats every 3-4 weeks for 4 courses.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of gemcitabine until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 3
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, additional
      patients are treated at the MTD.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 20 patients will be accrued for phase I and a maximum of 10
      patients will be accrued for phase II within 2-3 years.
