      patients randomized to assay-guided treatment (AGT) or treatment-as-usual (TAU). The
      treatment duration will be 8-weeks. Subjects will be assessed at visits at Week 2, 4, 6 and
      8. Approximately 300 subjects will be randomized 1:1 to the two treatment group (AGT and
      TAU). This is a multi-center trial, with approximately 25 sites in the US. Randomization will
      be by IWRS. The treating investigator will be unblinded to treatment assignment
      (necessarily). Other site staff, sponsor staff (including site monitors) and all others will
      be blinded to treatment assignment for the duration of the subject's participation in the
      study. The (blinded) rater for the primary endpoint, the SIGH-D-17 Hamilton Depression Scale,
      will have no other contact with the subject such as collection of screening data, follow-up
      assessments, documentation of adverse events, etc. Blinded raters will not discuss subjects
      with other study staff.

      After recruitment for main study is completed, an additional 70 subjects , age 65 years and
      older will be randomized to the Exploratory Elderly MDD Study. This follow-on sub-study will
      apply all procedures of the main study to this elderly population subset.
