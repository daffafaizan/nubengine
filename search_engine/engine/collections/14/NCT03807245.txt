      injections, 4 weeks apart, each consisting of 25 μg of GBS-NN and 25 μg of GBS-NN2 (24
      subjects) or placebo (6 subjects). Cohort 2 (30 subjects) will receive two 0.5 mL injections,
      4 weeks apart, each consisting of 50 μg of GBS-NN and 50 μg of GBS-NN2 (24 subjects) or
      placebo (6 Subjects). All vaccines will be adsorbed to 500 μg Al3+ as Alhydrogel®.

      Safety will be assessed after all subjects have completed Visit 4 (Day 8) for Cohort 1, at
      which point the decision will be made as to whether proceeding with administration of the
      doses in cohort 2 is appropriate.
