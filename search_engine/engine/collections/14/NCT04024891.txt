    
      Randomized, 2-arm cross-over, double-masked Phase 2b study in approximately 32 healthy
      subjects, evaluating safety and efficacy of Nyxol in subjects with pharmacologically induced
      mydriasis.

      At the first visit subjects will be screened for study eligibility.

      After screening, eligible subjects will be randomized 1:1 to one of the two treatment
      sequences:

      Treatment sequence 1: Placebo (Visit 1), Nyxol (Visit 2).

      Treatment sequence 2: Nyxol (Visit 1), Placebo (Visit 2).

      Randomization will be stratified by mydriatic agent (2.5% phenylephrine or 1% tropicamide).
      Approximately one half of the randomized subjects will receive 2.5% phenylephrine and one
      half will receive 1% tropicamide. Subjects will receive their mydriatic agent 1 hour before
      treatment. Each subject will receive the same mydriatic agent throughout the study.

      At each visit, pupil diameter (PD), accommodation, near and distance visual acuity (VA) and
      redness in each eye will be measured before (-1 hour/baseline) and 1 hour after (maximum/0
      minutes) the mydriatic agent instillation in each eye (i.e., right before the study treatment
      is administered), and at 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours and 6 hours after treatment
      dosing.

      As needed, two hours post treatment, subjects may request the administration of LumifyÂ® in
      the non-study eye.
