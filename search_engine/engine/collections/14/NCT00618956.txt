      active study drug or placebo, an inactive compound such as a sugar pill) and it is being
      conducted at various research centers in the United States.

      If the study staff determines that you are eligible and you decide to participate, there will
      be approximately 11 study visits in about 3 months. During these visits, you will undergo
      routine health exams and complete different kinds of questionnaires.

      This study requires that you wear a blood pressure cuff continuously for 24 hours on three
      separate occasions. You will also be required to make multiple same-day visits to the study
      site on three separate occasions for blood draws.
