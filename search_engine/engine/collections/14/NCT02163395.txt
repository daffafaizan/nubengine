      for each patient should be 35 to 42 month including a 3-year follow-up). It is acceptable to
      have the visit performed up to 6 month after the aspired date.

      The primary study parameter will be analyzed as soon as every patient passed visit 6 (annual
      follow-up visit, 12 month +/- 4 weeks).

      Implants will be placed transmucosally and will be protected by a thermoplastic splint for
      healing. A provisional prosthesis will be placed (out of occlusion) 12-14 weeks post implant
      placement. The final crown will be done between study week 24 and 28. Implant survival,
      implant success, bone loss, periodontal parameters and adverse events will be assessed in the
      follow-up visits.

      In total 8 visits are scheduled in this study. The investigational device: Straumann
      FullCeram Implant is a monotype ZrO2 implant with a diameter of 4.1 mm, available in lengths
      of 8, 10, 12 and 14 mm and abutment heights of 4.0 or 5.5 mm. This is a CE marked product.

      Three centres in Germany will participate. The study and any amendments will be performed as
      far as possible according to ISO 14155 (Second Edition, 2011-02-01) and conform to the
      Declaration of Helsinki (last revised Seoul 2008) and local legal and regulatory
