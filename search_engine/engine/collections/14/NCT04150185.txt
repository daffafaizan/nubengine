      liver disease but donor safety remains a major issue. It is the responsibility of the
      transplant team to restore donor's health, not only physical, but also mental, social and
      environmental. There is scarcity of long term longitudinal data on donor quality of life.
      Most of the studies are cross sectional which describe the quality of life at certain time
      point and do not take into account of changes that might occur over a period. It is more
      relevant in this scenario, as two persons from a family undergo surgery at the same time,
      which has a profound effect on family dynamics, and restoration towards normalcy goes hand in
      hand with adaptation to a new lifestyle. Another shortcoming of available literature is lack
      of uniform instruments which comprehensively measure the quality of life of live liver donors
      (LLDs). Standardized health related quality of life (HRQOL) instruments such as Short Form
      36(SF 36) or World Health Organization quality of life Brief (WHOQOL-BREF) are not designed
      for LLDs. Moreover, there are several symptoms which might interfere with daily activities
      such as incision site problems , dyspepsia to name a few, but are not distressing enough to
      be reflected on quality of life scores .The aim of current study was to observe the attitude
      of donors pre transplant, quality of life over a period, satisfaction with the donation
      process, their assessment of the health care team, satisfaction with the consent process, and
      change in pattern of symptoms and cosmesis after surgery.
