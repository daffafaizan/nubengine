    
      At University Medical Centre Ljubljana (UMCL; Slovenia), the investigators use
      electroencephalography (EEG) in wakefulness and sleep for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes
      in children with (suspected) epilepsy. Since epileptiform activity can only be detected
      during sleep in some patients and because children with intellectual disabilities have
      sometimes problems with cooperation, EEG in induced sleep is required.

      In this study, the investigators will enroll 150 children who need EEG recorded in their
      sleep. The investigators will compare safety and efficacy of the two active substances, one
      of which will be given in two possible routes. Fifty children will receive melatonin in the
      form of a syrup orally, 50 children will receive dexmedetomidine intranasally in the form of
      a nasal spray, and 50 children will receive dexmedetomidine sublingually. The investigators
      will monitor the following parameters: the time in which the child falls asleep, vital
      functions during sleep (blood pressure, blood oxygen saturation, respiratory rate frequency
      and heart rate frequency), the impact on the technical implementation of EEG, the depth of
      sleep and waking time. All parents will give their written consent for their child to
      participate in the study.
