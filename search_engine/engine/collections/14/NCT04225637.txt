      orthodontic practice. Miniscrew-supported maxillary expansion represents a promising modality
      for the treatment of transverse maxillary deficiency. However, controversies still exist
      regarding the activation protocol. One of these controversies is whether using a slow
      activation protocol would be more beneficial to the patients compared to a rapid activation
      protocol. Another question that consequently ensues is whether such activation protocol would
      result in less pain compared to the rapid activation protocol.

      The null hypothesis of the current study is that there is no difference between slow and
      rapid activation protocols of miniscrew-supported expander.
