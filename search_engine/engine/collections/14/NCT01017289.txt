      due to injury. The patients will undergo lateral and AP X- ray evaluation of the fracture.
      Following General anesthesia, closed reduction of the fracture will be performed. It will be
      followed by nail insertion, percutaneously, according to standard surgical techniques, with
      the help of the insertion handle. Following insertion the nail will be locked both distally
      and proximally using interlocking screws. The nail and screws insertion will be monitored by
      fluoroscopy. Patients will remain under follow up for 6 months following the procedure. In
      the follow up sessions the fracture will be evaluated by fluoroscopy or X-ray for correct
      bone alignment, callus formation, and fracture union.
