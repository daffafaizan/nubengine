    
      All patients in this study have received or will receive a score from the Michigan Urological
      Surgery Improvement Collaborative's Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment (askMUSIC) scoring
      system, at the time of enrollment. AskMUSIC is a risk calculator based on standard clinical
      and pathologic variables and is generally included as part of routine clinical care. The
      variables used in the risk calculator are prostate-specific antigen (PSA), Gleason score,
      number of positive core biopsies, number of negative core biopsies, and clinical stage.

      Patients will be randomized to either an intervention arm or a control arm. In the control
      arm, the treating provider will review the askMUSIC score with the patient. In the
      intervention arm, the treating provider will review the askMUSIC and the GEC score with the
      patient. Biopsies obtained during the course of standard clinical care will be analyzed using
      one of the following GECs: Decipher, Prolaris or Oncotype Dx Genomic Prostate Score. No
      additional biopsies will be obtained as part of this study.

      After reviewing the results, patients and their treating physicians will decide on a
      management strategy.

      Long-term follow-up will be tracked through the Michigan Urological Surgery Improvement
      Collaborative (MUSIC) registry.
