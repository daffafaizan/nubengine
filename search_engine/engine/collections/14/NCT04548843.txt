    
      MNV-BM-PLC is a personalized cell therapy based on autologous patient-derived Hematopoietic
      stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) enriched with mitochondria isolated from healthy placenta
      obtained from donors during C-section. Healthy mitochondria are employed, ex-vivo, to enrich
      the patient's CD34+ peripheral blood cells, followed by infusion of the mitochondrial
      enriched cells back to the patient. This therapeutic process of mitochondrial augmentation
      provides the patient with healthy mitochondria carrying non-mutated/deleted mtDNA that can
      supplement mitochondrial functionality in the patient's cells.
