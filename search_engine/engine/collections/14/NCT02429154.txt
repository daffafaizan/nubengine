      pressure and/or as a consequence of hypocapnia. This latter occurs frequently following
      traditional ventilation strategies with relatively high tidal volume and respiratory rate.
      New trends in anesthesia intend to promote protective lung ventilation by keeping a
      normocapnic or even mildly hypercapnic state. However, cerebral vascular vasotonicity is
      carbon dioxide (CO2)-dependent with hypocapnia potentially leading to vasoconstriction and
      subsequent decrease in cerebral blood flow. Changes in cerebral vasoreactivity can be
      assessed by the near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) device. This monitoring evaluates the
      changes in various parameters (deoxygenated hemoglobin, oxygenated hemoglobin, the tissue
      oxygenation index (TOI) and the tissue hemoglobin index (THI)) that act as surrogate for
      cerebral vasoconstriction.

      We, therefore designed this prospective observational comparative effectiveness study in
      order to characterize the potential beneficial effect of permissive hypercapnia on cerebral
      perfusion in infants.
