    
      This is an international, multicentre, randomised, non-interventional, collaborative post
      marketing surveillance study to assess the clinical use of the newly developed software
      medical device named ACRODAT®. Patients newly enrolled will be followed-up over a 2 year
      period. Patients will be assigned to the ACRODAT® group or the Standard Practice group
      according to a central randomisation. Patients assigned to the ACRODAT® arm will be followed
      up with the treating physician using ACRODAT® at every visit. The frequency of visits will be
      according to standard practice in the clinic. Patients not followed up with ACRODAT® will be
      followed-up in accordance with the standard medical practice of the hospital where they have
      been recruited, until study completion (Standard Practice arm).
