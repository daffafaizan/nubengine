      bean phenolic extract. Four different supplements were formulated, containing 3 or 5 g of two
      types of beta-glucan, with 35% and 70% b-glucan content, together with 600 mg of the green
      coffee bean extract. Blind sachets were prepared containing half the daily dose of the
      supplement.

      60 overweight/obese male and female volunteers (BMI 25-35 kg/m2, 18-60 y old) were recruited
      and randomly assigned to one of the four intervention groups. Volunteers were instructed to
      consume one sachet half an hour before lunch and dinner dissolved in 250 mL water daily
      during 6 weeks.

      At the beginning and at the end of the study, volunteers came to the Human Nutrition Unit at
      the research center after an overnight fast. Urine and blood samples were obtained, blood
      pressure was measured and anthropometric measurements were performed. Dietary and physical
      activity records were collected.
