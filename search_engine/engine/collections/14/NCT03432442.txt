      report. The interim analyses will be conducted as follows:

        1. First interim analysis: After the completion of the last volunteer of the group with
           body weight >30 kg receiving ivermectin 400 μg/kg every 24 hours for a total of three
           times (i.e. the sixth volunteer).

        2. Second interim analysis: After the completion of the last volunteer of the group with
           body weight >30 kg receiving ivermectin 600 μg/kg every 24 hours for a total of three
           times (i.e. the twelfth volunteer).

        3. Third interim analysis: After the completion of the last volunteer of the group with
           body weight 15 to 30 kg receiving ivermectin 400 μg/kg every 24 hours for a total of
           three times (i.e. the twelfth volunteer).

      The results of each interim analyses will be submitted to DSMB to determine whether the study
      is safe to be conducted in the next group of volunteers. Additionally, the results of interim
      analyses and the safety assessments from DSMB will be submitted to all ECs
