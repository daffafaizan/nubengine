      This is an important question since insulin resistance predates and predicts type 2 diabetes.
      We know that if pharmaceutical grade lipid is infused into people, they develop insulin
      resistance. Thus, we would like to infuse pharmaceutical grade lipid into trained subjects,
      believing that trained subjects will develop less insulin resistance, less decline in muscle
      energy function, and less accumulation of fat metabolites than untrained subjects. For
      comparing the effects of the pharmaceutical grade fat infusion, we will also have a group of
      trained and untrained subjects given a control (glycerol) infusion. Glycerol is basically the
      same as pharmaceutical grade lipid infusion without the lipid component.

      Three visits will be required. The first visit will involve measurement of fitness. A second
      visit will involve measurement of insulin resistance. The third visit will involve an
      inpatient stay, with a six hour infusion either the lipid or glycerol. Three muscle biopsies
      (before, during and after) will be take in conjunction with the infusion.
