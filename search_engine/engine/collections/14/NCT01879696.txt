      within 72 hours of injury. All Subjects will receive the Twin Star ECSPRESS catheters, which
      will be inserted at the end of the surgical procedure to stabilize the tibia fracture and
      will be connected to the pressure monitor in the operating room or immediately upon arrival
      in the recovery room. The catheters will be used for up to 24-hours after surgical fixation
      of the affected lower leg in order to (1) measure and record muscle compartment pressure, and
      (2) remove interstitial fluid in the subset of subjects that are randomized to the Treatment
      Group. Subjects will be followed closely during the 24 hours the catheter is inserted to
      gather muscle pressure data, occurrance of a fasciotomy, adverse events, etc. and then
      followed up at 2 weeks, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months post study enrollment after which
      the subjects participation in the study will be completed. There will no interim data
      analysis of the study outcomes during the conduct of this study. Data analysis and
      presentation of the data will be made after study closure.
