      the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab with panitumumab in subjects with unresectable,
      refractory, KRAS/NRAS/BRAF wild-type, microsatellite stable (MSS) metastatic colorectal
      cancer (mCRC). There will be an initial safety lead-in cohort to ensure the combination is
      well-tolerated. The primary objective of this study is to estimate the overall response rate
      in these subjects at 12 weeks . Secondary objectives include the following: estimating the
      overall response rate in these subjects at 12 weeks by immune-related RECIST criteria
      (irRECIST), estimating the best response rate by both RECIST 1.1 and irRECIST criteria,
      estimating progression-free survival (PFS) and duration of response using both RECIST 1.1 and
      irRECIST criteria, estimating overall survival (OS), and characterizing the safety issues
      associated with this regimen. Exploratory objectives involve investigating various biomarkers
      and peripheral blood and tumor assays.
