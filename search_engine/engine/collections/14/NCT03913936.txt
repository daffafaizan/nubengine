      hope that by piloting it with the participants they can improve the tool and the other
      processes. The main purpose of this pilot study is to test the web-based interface, the
      participant's engagement with the platform, and the recruitment procedures. This initial
      pilot study will inform the design of a larger study intended to monitor common symptoms and
      behavior, and to provide supportive care information and research opportunities in an
      iterative manner for young women who have been diagnosed with breast cancer using the YES
      portal, built for smartphones, tablets, and computers.
