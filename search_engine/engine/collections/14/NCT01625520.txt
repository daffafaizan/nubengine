      Neuroendocrine tumors have been demonstrated to express somatostatin receptors as well as
      mTOR pathway. The somatostatin analogues now available (octreotide and lanreotide) act
      preferentially through the somatostatin receptor subtype 2 (sst2). In MTC, these compounds
      have been reported to exert anti-secretive effects on calcitonin but no anti-proliferative
      effects.SOM230 (pasireotide) is a new somatostatin analogue showing a peculiar binding
      profile with high affinity for sst1, sst2, sst3, sst5. Preliminary data show SOM230 to be
      effective in a phase II study on patients with metastatic carcinoid. RAD001 (everolimus) is a
      novel agent that interacts with mTOR. It was demonstrated to inhibit tumor growth in
      neuroendocrine tumor cell lines. Some clinical trials have explored the efficacy of a
      combined therapy with RAD001 plus octreotide in patients with digestive neuroendocrine
      tumors, highlighting encouraging results in term of tumor control.In particular, octreotide
      and RAD001 seem to show a synergistic activity in inhibiting neuroendocrine tumor
      proliferation.
