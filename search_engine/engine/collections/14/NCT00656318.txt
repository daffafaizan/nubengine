      year. The vast majority of OCs combine both estrogen and a type of progestin, or
      progesterone-like substance into one pill which is taken daily. Depression or a negative
      change in mood, apparently resulting from the use of OCs, is thought to be one of the main
      reasons women miss pills or stop taking their oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) altogether.
      Clinical observation that some women develop depression when taking progestin only OCs or
      when adding progestins to menopausal estrogen therapy has led to the speculation that the
      progestin is the likely culprit of these negative mood changes in women using combined OCPs.

      The current study is designed to investigate the role of progestins in the development of
      mood symptoms in OCP users. Women participating in this study will receive one of two
      different OCPs for three months. Their mood while taking the OCPs will be compared to their
      mood prior to using OCPs. In addition, each woman will undergo a brain imaging study after
      the first dose of their OCP to determine whether acute changes in brain chemistry in response
      to the OCP predicts change in mood with OCP use. By choosing OCPs with the same estrogen
      product but 2 different types of progestins we hope to determine whether one type of
      progestin is more likely to result in negative mood.

      Determining factors that contribute to the emergence of depression with OC use is the first
      step in developing newer oral contraceptives that do not have this health outcome and will
      ultimately improve compliance with OCP use. Reducing side effects of OCPs is likely to
      improve compliance and thus decrease the prevalence of unwanted pregnancy.
