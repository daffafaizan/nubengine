      bypass graft (CABG) operations. Heart rate variability (HRV) is a physiological indicator of
      the effects of activity on heart ANS rate and has prognostic value for cardiac mortality.
      Spectral analysis of HRV can provide an assessment of adrenergic and cholinergic system
      activities during anesthesia. With the "power spectral" analysis of HRV, important clinical
      information can be obtained about the effects of anesthesia on the autonomic nervous system
      and the central nervous system. Decrease in HRV has a prognostic value for cardiac-induced
      mortality. The disease, which is transferred to intensive care unit (ICU) after CABG, is
      sedated with different medicines until the time of extubation. One commonly used sedative
      drug is deksmedetomidine, an α2 receptor agonist. Alpha 2 (α2) receptor agonist drugs reduce
      myocardial oxygen consumption and heart rate with sympatholytic properties. Therefore,
      deksmedetomidine can be safely and effectively used in patients undergoing cardiac surgery
      without pro-tachyarrhythmic and / or negative inotropic effects.In this study, it was aimed
      to investigate electrophysiologic effects of cardiac autonomic system by using HRV analysis
      in dexmedetomine and midazolam patients who underwent elective CABG and were used for
      sedation in the postoperative period.
