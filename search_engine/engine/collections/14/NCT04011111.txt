      endotracheal (n = 44) or spiral-embedded cuffed endotracheal (n = 44) tube were included in
      this study. An endotracheal tube of 7.5 mm was used for female patients and that of 8 mm was
      used for male patients. A preoperative acoustic voice analysis was performed, and fundamental
      frequency (F0), jitter%, and shimmer% values were recorded. In addition, voice handicap
      index-30 (VHI-30) questionnaire was completed by the patients for subjective evaluation. The
      same procedure was repeated in the first 48 hours postoperatively. The preoperative and
      postoperative data were statistically compared. In addition, the effect of the type of
      endotracheal intubation tube on acoustic voice analysis parameters and VHI-30 scores was
      statistically evaluated.
