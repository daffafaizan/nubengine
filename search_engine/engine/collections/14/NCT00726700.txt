        -  Determine the side effects of pegfilgrastim and cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin
           hydrochloride, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) with or without rituximab in older
           patients with aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

        -  Determine adherence to therapy regimens in these patients.

        -  Determine antitumor effectivity of immunochemotherapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      All patients receive prephase treatment comprising vincristine on day -6 and prednisone on
      days -6 to 0. Patients are then randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I (without rituximab): Patients receive pegfilgrastim subcutaneously (SC) on day 2
           or 4 and CHOP comprising cyclophosphamide IV, doxorubicin hydrochloride IV, and
           vincristine IV on day 1, and oral prednisone on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 2
           weeks for up to 6-8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
           toxicity.

        -  Arm II (with rituximab): Patients receive pegfilgrastim and CHOP for up to 6-8 courses
           as in arm I. They also receive rituximab (administered 2 hours before beginning CHOP) on
           day 1. Treatment with rituximab repeats every 2 weeks for up to 8 courses.

      Patients with bulky disease or extranodal disease also undergo radiotherapy.
