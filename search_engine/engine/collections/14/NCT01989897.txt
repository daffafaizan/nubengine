      dilutions. Higher dilutions (lower potency) have been shown in vitro to decrease in potency
      over time more rapidly than less dilute preparations. The investigators hope to determine
      whether there is a detectable difference in skin test reaction of dilutions of three common
      antigens (Cat, Timothy Grass, Dust Mite). The diluents used strongly affect the strength when
      extract potency is tested in vitro. Therefore, the investigators expect to find a detectable
      difference in skin test potency based on the diluents used (Saline vs. HSA Saline
      [300mcg/ml]).
