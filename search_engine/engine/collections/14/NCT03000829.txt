      discharge. Factors associated with lower mortality and improved function include provision of
      high-quality, minimally-interrupted chest compressions and swift defibrillation of eligible
      arrhythmias. Unfortunately, resuscitation teams provide suboptimal care to 25-40% of IHCA
      victims. A dedicated IHCA team "copilot" may improve resuscitation team performance by
      providing the team leader with parallel analysis, situational awareness augmentation, action
      checking, protocol verification, and error correction. Critical care physician involvement
      via a telemedicine link could allow experienced specialists to fill the "copilot" role in a
      cost and resource-efficient manner, particularly in smaller hospitals with fewer available
      physicians.

      The current study will evaluate how consultation by an off-site intensive care physician via
      a telemedicine link influences local IHCA teams' quality of care, team function and provider
      experience during simulated cardiac arrest events ("mock codes").
