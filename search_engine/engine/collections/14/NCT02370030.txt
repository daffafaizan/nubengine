      CMN Siglo XXI and CMN La Raza over the period of november 2015 through june 2016. After
      signing an informed consent they will be randomized into 80 for intervention arm and 80 for
      the placebo arm. All patients will receive usual medical treatment; and during seven days
      citurlline arm subjects will receive supplementation with oral or nasogastric citrulline (10
      g/day), while other group patients will receive during seven days oral or nasogastric placebo
      (10 g/day) with no visible difference between these. Microalbuminuria and interleukines 1, 6,
      and 10 will be measured at randomization and at day 7. All subjects will be followed for 28
      days, and after the follow-up period results will be analyzed to determine de efficacy and
      safety of citrulline, primary outcome are the incidence of multiple organic failure and
      death, also microalbuminuria levels 1,6,10-interleukines. We will use Student-t and Chi2 for
      statistical analysis.
