      discordant with their wishes, particularly at the end of life. Early serious illness
      conversations (SIC) improve goal-concordant care, and accurate prognostication is critical to
      inform the timing and content of these discussions. This study will use a stepped-wedge,
      cluster randomized trial to evaluate the effect of a health system initiative using machine
      learning algorithms and behavioral nudges to prompt oncologists to have serious illness
      conversations with patients at high-risk of short-term mortality. Oncology practices will be
      randomly assigned in sequential four-week blocks to receive the intervention.
