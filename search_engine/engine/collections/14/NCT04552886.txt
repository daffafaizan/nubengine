    
      This is a single arm (non-randomized) first-in-man pilot study to evaluate the safety and
      feasibility of delivering a dendritic cell vaccine in nine to twenty-four (n=9-24) adult
      patients diagnosed with glioblastoma (GBM) after undergoing neurosurgical tumor resection,
      and in whom a neuropathological diagnosis has been established. Standard of care chemotherapy
      and radiation therapy shall be followed as per routine neuro-oncologic paradigms after which
      patients enrolled into this study will receive a personalized vaccine beyond standard of
      care. Effective adjuvant therapies are urgently needed for these patients given that standard
      of care is rarely successful in preventing recurrence among GBM patients, nor death among
      relapsed patients with this very poor-prognosis tumor type. The study is constructed in a 3+3
      algorithm for three steps of dose escalation with rigorous and mandatory safety monitoring.
