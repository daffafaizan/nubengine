    
      In a randomized, double blind placebo controlled interventional study, children aged 1 month
      to 5 years, who are admitted with acute lower respiratory tract infection (ALRTI) to Dr
      George Mukhari Academic Hospital will be enrolled. The children will randomized to receive
      2500 IU of vitamin D or a placebo. It is intended to enrol 320 children, 160 to receive
      vitamin D and the other 160 to receive a placebo. This sample size was calculated at 80%
      power and 5% significance. The children will be enrolled within 24 hours of admission and the
      intervention (supplement or placebo) will be daily until the child is discharged fron the
      hospital.

      The severity of ALRTI will be assessed using the modified Respiratory Distress Assessment
      Instrument (MRDAI) score. The thorough physical examination and classification of severity of
      the symptoms will be done at enrolment and daily until hospital discharge.

      Blood samples for vitamin D and calcium concentrations will be assessed at enrolment, before
      the child is given the supplement or placebo.

      The difference in the improvement in MRDAI score between the placebo and the supplement will
      be assessed by analysis of variance (ANOVA). Similarly the difference in duration of hospital
      stay between the two groups will also be analysed using ANOVA. The association between the
      vitamin D levels and the MRDAI score on admission will also be assessed and analysed using
      ANOVA.

      All eligible children will be sequentially enrolled until the desired sample size is reached.
      A simple randomisation by means of computer generated numbers will be used to minimize
      selection bias. Both the study subjects and the investigators will be blinded to the
      allocation (treatment or placebo). The unblinding will be done only after the analysis has
      been completed.
