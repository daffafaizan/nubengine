    
      Comparison of the safety and effectiveness of the CE certified and established lipoprotein
      apheresis systems MONET vs. DALI and DIAMED vs. DALI for optimizing the individual therapy of
      patients with severe dyslipidemia using established and novel efficacy parameters.

      The primary objective is to compare the whole blood lipoprotein apheresis system DALI with
      the plasma lipoprotein apheresis systems MONET and DIAMED with regard to their efficacies in
      removing total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), triglycerides and
      lipoprotein (a) (Lp(a)).

      The secondary objective is to compare the whole blood lipoprotein apheresis system DALI with
      the plasma lipoprotein apheresis system MONET and DIAMED with regard to their efficacies in
      removing other novel efficacy parameters.
