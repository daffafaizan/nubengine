    
      Phase 1a of the study will adopt the "modified 3+3" dose escalation design with a total of 7
      planned dose levels. Patients with HER2-positive advanced solid tumor (including those with
      brain metastases) will be enrolled to receive a single-dose administration of ZN-A-1041
      followed by multiple-dose administration of ZN-A-1041.Phase 1b of the study will adopt the
      "traditional 3+3" dose escalation design with a total of 2 planned dose levels. The dose
      levels will be determined based on the MTD identified in the phase 1a study.

      In phase 1b, patients with HER2-positive advanced breast cancer (including those with brain
      metastases) will be enrolled to receive multiple doses of ZN-A-1041 in combination with
      Capecitabine. Patients with HER2-positive breast cancer with brain metastases were planned to
      be enrolled in the Phase 1c of the study to receive ZN-A-1041 in combination with
      Capecitabine. The dose levels will be determined based on the recommended doses obtained from
      the Phase 1b study.

      Each phase of the study includes a screening period, a treatment period and a follow-up
      period. During the trial, the safety, tolerability, PK and efficacy data of ZN-A-1041 as
      monotherapy and in combination with Capecitabine in the subjects will be collected and
      analyzed, thereby providing RP2D for the subsequent clinical trials.
