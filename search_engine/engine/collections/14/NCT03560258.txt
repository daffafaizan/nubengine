    
      This study will evaluate the safety, immunogenicity, and preliminary assessment of efficacy
      of a novel vaccine encoding conserved elements (CE) of the HIV-1 Gag core protein, p24Gag, as
      a therapeutic vaccine in HIV-1 infected persons who are on antiretroviral therapy (ART).

      The study will randomly assign participants to one of three groups. Participants in Arm 1
      will receive p24CE1/2 pDNA vaccine at Weeks 0 and 4, followed by p24CE1/2 pDNA admixed with
      full-length p55^gag pDNA vaccine at Weeks 12 and 24. Participants in Arm 2 will receive
      full-length p55^gag pDNA vaccine at Weeks 0, 4, 12, and 24. Participants in Arm 3 will
      receive placebo at Weeks 0, 4, 12, and 24.

      Study visits will occur at Weeks 0, 4, 6, 12, 24, 26, and 48 and may include physical
      examinations and blood and urine collection. Some participants may undergo leukapheresis and
      stool sample collection.
