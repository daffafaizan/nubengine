    
      Study design: this study is a double-blinded, randomised, controlled, parallel design dietary
      intervention study. The study will be conducted at Maastricht University and Wageningen
      University and Research, the Netherlands.

      Study population: the study population will consist of 240 men and women between 40-75 years
      old, with a BMI 25-40 kg/m2. Participants will be either muscle insulin resistant (MIR) or
      liver insulin resistant (LIR), as classified by an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) during
      the screening procedure. A subgroup of 80 participants will be selected for detailed
      metabolic phenotyping.

      Intervention: for 12 weeks, participants will receive either a diet optimal for MIR (high in
      mono-unsaturated fatty acids) or a diet optimal for LIR (high in protein and fiber, low in
      fat) with respect to changes in disposition index. Participants will be randomly allocated to
      one of the two diets. Detailed laboratory and daily life phenotyping will be done pre- and
      post intervention.
