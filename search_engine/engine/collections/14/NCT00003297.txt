      topotecan, mitoxantrone, and thiotepa given in combination followed by autologous peripheral
      blood stem cell transplantation in patients with recurrent or refractory platinum resistant
      epithelial ovarian cancer. II. Determine the progression-free survival and overall survival
      of these patients after this therapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of topotecan. All patients have peripheral stem
      cells collected. Patients then receive topotecan according to an escalating dose schedule,
      and mitoxantrone and thiotepa on a fixed dose schedule. Patients receive topotecan by
      continuous infusion for 24 hours on days 1-3, mitoxantrone intravenously over 1 hour on days
      1-3, and thiotepa intravenously over 4 hours on days 1-3, followed 48 hours later by infusion
      of their peripheral stem cells. Patients may receive a second course of chemotherapy and
      peripheral stem cell transplantation in the absence of disease progression and unacceptable
      toxicity. Dose escalation of topotecan continues in cohorts of 3-6 patients each until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at
      which 2 or more patients experience dose limiting toxicity. Patients are followed every week
      for the first month, then every month for 6 months, every 3 months for 1 year, and then every
      6 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 21-50 patients will be accrued for this study.
