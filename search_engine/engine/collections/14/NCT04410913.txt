      psilocybin-assisted therapy of alcohol use disorder. Psilocybin shows promise in early trials
      for alcohol use disorder, but initial results suggest that patients with alcohol use disorder
      may be less likely to achieve a mystical experience with standard doses of psilocybin.
      Optimizing Set and Setting for the psilocybin experience may improve outcomes without
      requiring higher drug doses. The current study will complete a pilot randomized clinical
      trial to assess the feasibility, safety, and tolerability of Visual Healing Set and Setting
      (N=10) versus standard Set and Setting procedures (N=10) in participants with alcohol use
      disorder undergoing open-label psilocybin 25 mg therapy. In the Visual Healing condition,
      participants will view nature-themed video programs during the Prep session and during the
      Ascent phase of the psilocybin experience. Anecdotal reports and reviews suggest that viewing
      Visual Healing creates a tranquil and calming environment that fosters a stronger connection
      between the viewer and nature. Psilocybin increases the users feeling of connection to nature
      and having an intention to connect with nature during the psychedelic session is associated
      with better outcomes of psychedelic-assisted therapy in initial studies. Reducing pre-dosing
      anxiety/apprehension and enhancing connections to nature with Visual Healing may improve
      outcomes of psychedelic-assisted therapy without the need for higher psilocybin doses.
