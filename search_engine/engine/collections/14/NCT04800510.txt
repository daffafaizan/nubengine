      procedures for inputting multiple data sources into the model to evaluate ankle articular
      contact stresses.

      Healthy adult participants will complete testing using three generic sized carbon fiber
      custom dynamic orthoses (CDOs) and with no CDO. Participants will be blinded to the design
      variation of each device and will only know them as CDO-A, CDO-B, or CDO-C. Testing will be
      completed under 4 conditions: No-CDO, CDO-A, CDO-B, CDO-C, with each bracing condition
      (A/B/C) representing a CDO design variant. Physical performance measures will incorporate
      tests of agility, speed, and lower limb power to ensure that changes to device design do not
      negatively affect physical function. Questionnaires will be used to evaluate participants'
      current and desired activity level, pain with and without CDO use, satisfaction with the
      devices, perception of comfort and smoothness between devices, and preference between CDOs.
      Semi-structured interviews will be completed to fully capture the participant's perspective.
      Lower limb forces and motion will be assessed using a computerized motion capture system and
      force plates in the floor. Forces between the foot and CDO will be measured using force
      sensing insoles, and muscle activity data will be collected using surface electromyography.
      Devices will be mechanically tested, and participant demographic and anthropometric data will
      be recorded.

      The information obtained from this study will help refine the musculoskeletal model data
      input methods to be used in future studies. The knowledge that will be gained from this
      investigation has the potential to substantially improve the long-term efficacy and
      efficiency of the musculoskeletal model and help improve ankle foot orthosis
