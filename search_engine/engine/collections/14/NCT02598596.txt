    
      This is an exploratory open-label, multicenter study to evaluate the effectiveness of a
      16-week high zone tolerance regimen of pegloticase on response to therapy (serum uric acid <6
      mg/dL) with this drug in adult hyperuricemic patients with gout refractory to conventional
      therapy.

      Eligible subjects will receive 1 of 3 different loading doses (8, 12, and 16 mg) on Study Day
      1, and then receive 8 mg on Week 2 and 3, followed by 8 mg every 2 weeks through Week 17 for
      a total of 10 doses.

      Subjects will be monitored for efficacy and safety endpoints through Week 17. Subjects will
      also have blood drawn for pegloticase levels prior to each dose on Weeks 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11,
      13,15, and 17. Following Study Week 17, subjects will have an option to continue dosing for
      an additional 8 weeks.

      A subset of subjects will participate in additional pharmacokinetic (PK) assessments.

      The study duration, per enrolled patient, will be approximately 26 weeks including a 2-week
      screening period, a 16-week treatment period (end of treatment [EOT] visit Week 17), and an
      optional 8-week dosing extension.
