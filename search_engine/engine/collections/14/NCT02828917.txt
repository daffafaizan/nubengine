      target vessel diameter of 2.5mm to 4.25, for subjects undergoing coronary artery stent
      implantation. The target population is subjects undergoing PCI for angina (stable or
      unstable), silent ischemia (in absence of symptoms a visually estimated target lesion
      diameter stenosis of ≥70%, a positive non-invasive stress test, or FFR ≤0.80 must be
      present), NSTEMI, and recent subacute STEMI (>72 hours from initial presentation and stable).
      Complex lesions are allowed. A maximum of two target vessels and two lesions per vessel may
      be treated (two lesions separated by up to 10 mm that can be covered by a single stent are
      considered as one lesion); the total planned study stenting in the coronary tree cannot
      exceed 100 mm.
