      safety of long-term use of pioglitazone tablets (Actos Tablets) in type 2 diabetic patients
      with inadequate glycemic control and a prior history of cerebral infarction.

      For adults, 15-30 mg of pioglitazone is usually administered orally once daily before or
      after breakfast. The dose should be adjusted depending on sex, age, and symptoms; however,
      the maximum daily dose should not exceed 45 mg.
