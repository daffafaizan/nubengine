        -  Determine the toxic effects of amifostine, topotecan, and cytarabine in patients with
           poor risk myelodysplastic syndrome.

        -  Determine the hematologic response rate, cytogenetic response rate, and the rate of
           polyclonal hematopoiesis following this treatment regimen.

        -  Determine the duration of response and time to disease progression following this
           treatment regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive topotecan by continuous IV over 24 hours plus cytarabine IV over 2
      hours, on days 1-5. Patients receive amifostine IV over 15 minutes every other day for a
      maximum of 60 days. Patients may receive a second course of the same regimen 8 weeks after
      the first.

      Patients are followed at least monthly for 2 years, then every 3-6 months until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 25 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 to 1.5
      years.
