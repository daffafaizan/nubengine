      mediating leukocyte trafficking from blood into the sites of inflammation. Although VAP-1
      plays important role in early phases of inflammation, its luminal expression on the
      endothelium will remain constant if the inflammation continues, which suggest VAP-1 as a
      promising target for molecular imaging of inflammation. We have previously shown that sialic
      acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin 9 (Siglec-9) is a VAP-1 ligand, and the gallium-68
      labeled 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-N,N´,N´´,N´´´-tetraacetic acid conjugated peptide
      ([68Ga]Ga-DOTA-Siglec-9) containing residues 283-297 from Siglec-9 can be used for PET
      imaging of inflammation in various experimental models. This first-in-human study evaluates
      safety, tolerability, biodistribution and performance of [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-Siglec-9 after single
      intravenous injection in six healthy volunteers and in ten patients with early rheumatoid
      arthritis (RA). VAP-1 is abundantly expressed in synovial blood vessel in RA joints, which is
      why they were selected as the first patient population.
