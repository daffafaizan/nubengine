    
      Objectives: To establish a cohort of about 10,000 registered nurses (aged 20 or over) in
      Xiamen, China; to describe the baseline major risk factors; to analyze their
      interrelationships; and to examine the risks of incidence and progression of major chronic
      diseases, such as hypertension, stroke, CKD and cancers, and all-cause and cause-specific
      mortality by different levels of the risk factors after about 5 years follow-up.

      Design: A prospective cohort study. Setting: 7 public hospitals in Xiamen, China.
      Participants: About 10,000 registered nurses (aged 20 or over) who work in public hospitals
      in Xiamen, China.

      Main outcome: Incidences of common chronic diseases, such as CVD, diabetes, chronic kidney
      disease, and cancers; progression of these diseases; all cause and specific-cause mortality.

      Hypothesis: Relative risks of major risk factors. Results of the study should have strong
      impact on prevention and control of these diseases and promoting nurses'health in the local
      population.
