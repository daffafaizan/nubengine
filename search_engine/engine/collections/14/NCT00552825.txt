      anti-cancer treatment. Treatment is frequently associated with diverse pulmonary damage which
      may become functionally and clinically evident many years later. PFTs may help to quantify
      the damage in the lungs; help to evaluate the point at which lung function deviates from
      normal to allow early intervention before irreversible lung damage occurs and thereby to
      reduce morbidity and mortality.

      Reliable PFTs in the preschool age have traditionally been difficult to perform, but recent
      publications have demonstrated that the majority of preschool children can produce
      reproducible forced expiratory flow volume (FEVC) curves with proper coaching techniques.
      This recent development may enable studying the long term effect (years) of treatment on lung
      function in young children suffering from hemato-oncologic diseases.
