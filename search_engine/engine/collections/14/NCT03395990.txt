      with continuous catheter. Following a standardized general anesthetic for the procedure,
      subjects will be asked to rate their pain using the NRS-11 pain scale in the recovery room.
      Once the pain is reported at a 5/10 or above, a femoral nerve block will be performed using
      either 2% chloroprocaine or saline placebo (randomized). Pain scores are then evaluated over
      the next 30 minutes by a blinded investigator to determine if the femoral block adds any
      additional analgesic benefit over an adductor canal block.
