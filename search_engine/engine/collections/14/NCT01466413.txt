      the same treatment regimen and using the same technique. A 4mm skin biopsy will be taken from
      each of the implant sites from Cohort A subjects (including replacements) on Day 169, and
      from Cohort B subjects (including replacements) on Day 85. The biopsy will encompass the
      needle point tattoo at the centre of the implant site. The biopsy site will be closed with a
      single stitch followed by standard aftercare procedures with stitch removal 7 to 10 days
      later.
