    
      Treatment will be administered in 2 phases, an induction and a maintenance phase, as
      described below. Subjects will continue induction treatment for up to 1 year. Treatment in
      the study will be discontinued if the subject experiences progressive disease (PD) or
      unacceptable toxicity (not corrected with dose reduction), withdraws consent, or if the
      Investigator feels it is no longer in the subject's best interest to continue treatment.
      Those who have a complete response (CR) in the induction phase will enter the maintenance
      phase of the study. Subjects who experience ongoing stable disease (SD) or an ongoing partial
      response (PR) at 1 year may enter the maintenance phase at the Investigator's and Sponsor's
      discretion. Subjects may remain in the maintenance phase of the study for up to 1 year. The
      duration of the maintenance phase can exceed 1 year if the subject continues to benefit, per
      the Investigator's and Sponsor's discretion. Treatment will continue in the maintenance phase
      until the subject experiences PD or unacceptable toxicity (not corrected with dose
      reduction), withdraws consent, or if the Investigator feels it is no longer in the subject's
      best interest to continue treatment. The time on study treatment, including both the
      induction and maintenance phases, is up to 2 years. The duration of the study may exceed 2
      years if the subject remains in the maintenance phase for more than 1 year, as described
      above.
