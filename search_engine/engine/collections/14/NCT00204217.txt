      controlled with a ventilator, the tidal volume varied in random order between 500, 700 and
      100 ml, and the volumes be measured continuously as will the impedance between the
      defibrillator electrodes. In case of failed CPR, the patient will be declared dead.
      Thereafter the lungs will be ventilated with 700 ml followed by removal of the endotracheal
      tube, placement of an endotracheal tube in the esophagus and ventilation of this tube, again
      with monitoring of the impedance.
