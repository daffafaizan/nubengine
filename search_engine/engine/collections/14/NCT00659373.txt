      Primary:

      * To evaluate and compare the changes in cognitive function over one year in premenopausal
      breast cancer patients who receive adjuvant tamoxifen (T) alone against those receive
      adjuvant tamoxifen (T+OFS) or exemestane (E+OFS) with ovarian function suppression (OFS).

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Objective cognitive function was measured with the CogState computerized test battery. The
      CogState battery consists of seven tasks: Detection, Identification, Monitoring, Memory,
      Learning, International Shopping List Task (ISLT), and ISLT-Delayed Recall. Performance speed
      is measured for the Detection, Identification and Monitoring tasks and performance accuracy
      is measured for the Memory, Learning, ISLT, and ISLT-Delayed Recall. Measures of performance
      speed are normalized using measures of performance accuracy (%) are normalized using arcsine
      transformation. The main outcome measure is a composite score which is the average of these
      task scores (after transformation and standardization by age-specific norms). Patients
      complete these assessments at baseline (i.e. before start of protocol hormonal therapy) and
      approximately one year after randomization to the parent IBCSG 24-02 (SOFT) study.

      Data were collected separately for the T+OFS and E+OFS participants in the parent study,
      IBCSG 24-02 (SOFT). The sample size for this Co-SOFT substudy was small, so the analysis plan
      was revised to pre-specify collective analysis for all patients receiving OFS.
