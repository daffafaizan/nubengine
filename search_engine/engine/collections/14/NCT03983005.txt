      Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) represents about 80-90% of all lung cancers. Endoscopic
      ultrasound with bronchoscope fine needle aspiration (EUS-B-FNA) is a safe and accurate
      technique that has been mostly described for the diagnosis and the mediastinal nodal staging
      of NSCLC, as a complementary technique to endobronchial ultrasound trans-bronchial needle
      aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) or when EBUS-TBNA may be difficult and/or contraindicated for clinical
      reasons (e.g. excessive cough, respiratory failure etc).

      Few retrospective studies evaluated the sensitivity and the safety of this technique in the
      diagnosis of parenchymal pulmonary lesions suspected for lung cancer, in contact or adjacent
      to the esophagus. Few data are available on the adequacy of the samples obtained by EUS-B-FNA
      for molecular analysis in NSCLC. The main predictors of success are still unclear.

      The primary aim of this prospective study is to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of EUS-B-FNA
      in the diagnosis of malignant parenchymal lung lesions. The Investigators will also evaluate
      the safety and tolerability of the technique, the main predictors of success and the adequacy
      of samples obtained for molecular analysis in patients with NSCLC
