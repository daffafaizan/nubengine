      (SBRT) on non-consecutive days will improve the chance of curing non-small cell lung cancer
      compared to treatment with SBRT on consecutive days. In either case, the dose of radiation is
      the same. Non-consecutive treatments will be at least 40 hours apart and no more than 100
      hours apart. The total course of treatment will be 8-12 days. Consecutive treatments will be
      daily over 4-5 days within one calendar week. The total course of treatment will be 4-5 days.

      The study team will assess if DNA from the tumor can be found in the blood to determine which
      patients respond quickest to radiotherapy. These results will not be made available to
      participants and will not change treatment.
