    
      Fermotein™ is a mycoprotein, derived from fungi, especially produced for human consumption.
      It is high in protein, high in fiber, low in saturated fat and contains no cholesterol. Its
      functional properties and nutrient content makes them ideal to use as an ingredient for meat
      alternatives and other vegetarian/vegan food products. This study aims to assess the impact
      of frequent intake of 11 grams of Fermotein™ powder (dry) on gastrointestinal complaints and
      several other health related biomarkers.

      The primary objective is to investigate gastro-intestinal complaints during 18 days of
      Fermotein™ consumption. The secondary objective is to assess blood based parameters related
      to general health and consumer acceptance.

      The study has a randomized parallel design. Two different treatments will be evaluated e.g. a
      18-day intervention with Fermotein™ based meals and a 18-day intervention with control meals.
      At the start and at the end of the intervention a blood sample will be collected.
      Questionnaires about gut complaints, stool consistency and frequency, wellbeing, health
      complaints or other adverse effects will be collected daily during intervention and up to two
      days after the intervention.
