      peripheral nerve blocks 1(PNBs1)- femoral nerve+lateral cutaneous nerve-with laryngeal mask
      anesthesia, or peripheral nerve blocks 2(PNBs2) - lumbar plexus and sciatic - with laryngeal
      mask anesthesia. Blocks were performed using ultrasound and 0.5% ropivacaine. All patients
      received postoperative multimodal analgesia. Postoperative recovery was assessed at 15
      minutes, 40 minutes,- 1 day, 3 days, and 7 days after surgery, with the Postoperative Quality
      of Recovery Scale, in physiological, nociceptive, emotive, modified activities of daily
      living, modified cognitive, and overall patient perspective domains.
