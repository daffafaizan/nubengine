      cancer-related death in men and women, and is responsible for 1.3 million deaths worldwide
      annually as of 2004. Surgery remains the best option for patients presenting with operable
      Stage I or II cancers, however the five year survival rate for these candidates remains at a
      dismal 53% for Stage I and 32% for Stage II1. The high rates of recurrence suggest that
      surgeons are unable to completely detect and remove primary tumor nodules in a satisfactory
      manner as well as lingering metastases in sentinel lymph nodes. By ensuring a negative margin
      through near-infrared imagery with a safe non-toxic contrast agent it would be possible for
      the investigators to improve the rates of recurrence free patients and thus overall survival.
      This study is a small pilot/feasibility study to determine if the investigators camera system
      can be effective at identifying malignancies in lung cancer patients.
