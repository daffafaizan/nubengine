      obese. Similar trends have been observed in Europe and more recently in Asia. A large number
      of obese patients seeks treatment through bariatric surgery or diet-lifestyle changes. The
      resulting massive loss of weight leaves patients with an excess cutaneous tissue, requiring
      body-contouring procedures.

      In the US 85% of post-bariatric patients seek body-contouring surgeries. Due to systemic and
      local factors, these procedures show a rate of local complications as high as 68-80%,
      significantly prolonging hospitalization and increasing treatment-related costs.

      Several clinical studies have shown that external suction (Closed Incision Negative-Pressure
      Therapy, ciNPT) can accelerate closure of surgical wounds in patients at high-risk for
      impaired/delayed healing and can significantly reduce the rate of local complications. The
      investigators believe that ciNPT might significantly decrease the rate of minor local
      complications in post-bariatric patients undergoing body-contouring procedures, and that this
      strategy could represent a cost-effective adjuvant treatment in body-contouring procedures.

      The investigators' preliminary study experience on post-bariatric obese patients undergoing
      an abdominoplasty and post-operatively treated with ciNPT, showed that ciNPT promotes
      effective and prompt wound closure minimizing peri-operative/post-operative complications in
      these patients. The investigators also showed that ciPNT positively impacts the length of
      hospitalization and the rate of secondary surgeries in these patients.

      Based on this successful preliminary experience, the invetsigators here propose to validate
      these findings in a prospective RCT.
