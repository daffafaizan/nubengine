      interleukin-4 (IL-4), Immunoglobulin G (IgG), Immunoglobulin E (IgE), Immunoglobulin G1
      (IgG1), Immunoglobulin G2a (IgG2a), Î²-Casomorphin-7 (BCM-7), Glutathione, calcium (Ca), iron
      (Fe) and zinc (Zn) concentration; gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms are measured via Visual
      Analog Scale (VAS) for gut tolerance, including borborygmus, bloating, break wind, abdominal
      pain, and diarrhea; behavioral well-being is assessed using Subtle Cognitive Impairment Test
      (SCIT).

      The total duration of study was 24 weeks, including subject enrollment, study intervention,
