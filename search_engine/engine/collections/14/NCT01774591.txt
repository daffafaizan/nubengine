      hypertension. The goal is to randomize 40 post-menopausal females with stage 1 hypertension
      and assess whether azilsartan reduces urinary aldosterone levels. We will compare subjects
      having azilsartan medoximil (treatment group) with placebo group. Additionally, a small
      sub-study comparing pre-menopausal and post-menopausal female aldosterone levels was
      performed as well as the presence of aldosterone production in fat cell cultures of a subset
      of 3 patients in the randomized trial.
