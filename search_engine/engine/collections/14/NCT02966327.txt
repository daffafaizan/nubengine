    
      Study design and setting: A pilot randomized controlled trial will be conducted on 50
      patients with gynecological cancer recruited from the McGill University Health Centre (MUHC)
      Royal Victoria Hospital and the Jewish General Hospital (JGH) Segal Cancer Centre in
      Montreal, Quebec. The data collection and interventions will be conducted at the MUHC
      Lymphedema Support Centre.

      Intervention: At 4-6 weeks post-operatively, each participant in the experimental group will
      be prescribed Jobst Elvarex compression class 1 (18 to 21 mmHg) standard or custom-made
      stockings for both lower limbs with or without panty. The participants will be recommended to
      wear the garments for 12 to 16 hours daily for at least 6 months post-operatively. At this
      time, the participants will also receive individualized education on exercise, self-lymphatic
      drainage and skin care by an unblinded lymphedema therapist.

      Control: At 4-6 weeks post-operatively (T2), both groups will receive standard education on
      lymphedema risk reduction along with printed materials from the Lymphedema Association of
      Quebec.
