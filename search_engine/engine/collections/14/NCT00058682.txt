    
      This study is designed as a prospective, randomized, double-blind, non-inferiority,
      multi-center trial of the safety and efficacy of anidulafungin versus fluconazole in patients
      with candidemia or other forms of invasive candidiasis. The objective of this study is to
      determine if anidulafungin is at least as effective as fluconazole in the treatment of
      patients with a diagnosis of candidemia and/or other forms of invasive candidiasis. The
      secondary objectives are to compare the safety of the two study drugs and determine the
      efficacy for the prevention of late Candida infections in patients treated with anidulafungin
      versus fluconazole. Assuming 25% of patients will be unevaluable at the end of intravenous
      therapy, 248 patients will be enrolled to obtain a total of 222 evaluable patients. Patients
      older than 16 years of age with candidemia or invasive candidiasis will be randomized to
      receive either anidulafungin or fluconazole. Patients randomized to anidulafungin will
      receive an IV loading dose on day one of 200mg followed by 100mg once daily. Patients
      randomized to fluconazole will receive an IV loading dose on day one of 800mg followed by an
      IV daily dose of 400mg. Patients will be maintained on IV therapy for a minimum of 10 days to
      a maximum of 42 days. After 10 days of therapy, patients on either study drug may be treated
      on an ambulatory basis with oral fluconazole therapy.
