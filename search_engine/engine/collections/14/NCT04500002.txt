    
      According to the American college of obstetricians and gynecologists (2005), medical abortion
      is an acceptable alternative for surgical procedures in pregnant women with gestational age
      of less than 10 weeks based on the last menstrual period

      Oral or vaginal misoprostol causes complete abortion in almost 85% of cases within seven days
      before the 12th week

      Adjuvant isonicotinic acid hydrazide (INH) administration with misoprostol raises the rate of
      complete abortion
