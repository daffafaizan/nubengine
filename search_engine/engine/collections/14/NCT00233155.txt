    
      Study C118 is a multicenter, open-label, single-arm study for subjects who successfully
      completed a previous NGX-4010 study and have not received open-label or blinded NGX-4010
      study patches within the 12 weeks prior to study entry. One hundred eligible subjects will
      receive an initial open-label NGX-4010 study patch application and up to three additional
      open-label NGX-4010 applications at intervals of no less than 12 weeks, based on the presence
      or return of pain. Eligible subjects will have moderate to severe neuropathic pain secondary
      to HIV-AN or PHN, with average pain levels deemed appropriate for further treatment with
      NGX-4010 as judged by the Investigator.
