      compared to white-fleshed sweet potatoes and vitamin A as retinyl palmitate on blood and
      breast milk cryptoxanthin (CX), beta-carotene (BC), and vitamin A (VA) concentrations by
      randomly assigning lactating Bangladeshi women to one of four treatment groups for 6
      days/week for 3 weeks.

      The investigators will also compare the relative vitamin A (VA) value of BC and CX from food
      sources by comparing the mean change in breast milk retinol concentrations of the groups that
      receive tangerines (CX) or orange-fleshed sweet potatoes (BC) with the mean change in breast
      milk retinol of the group that receives retinyl palmitate.
