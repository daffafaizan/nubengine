      total of 3 MBI scans: before you start your already scheduled chemotherapy treatment, after 2
      cycles of chemotherapy, and after you complete your chemotherapy treatment but before
      surgery. You will also receive your standard of care scans.

      Before each MBI scan, you will receive an injection of Tc99m sestamibi (a type of drug that
      gives off energy that is seen with special cameras, like the MBI scan, which creates images
      of the breast). You will have an MBI scan about 5 minutes after you receive Tc99m sestamibi.
      During the scan, your breast will be positioned between 2 detectors and lightly compressed.
      The detectors are 2 square cameras, which look very similar to mammography cameras. The scan
      should take about 40 minutes.

      Information, such as images from previous scans and your medical history, will also be
      collected from your medical record.

      The results from the MBI scans will not affect or change your treatment, including the type
      of surgery you may have.

      Length of Study:

      Your active participation on this study will be over after the last MBI scan is completed.

      This is an investigational study. MBI scans on this study are performed using FDA-approved
      and commercially available methods. Tc99m sestamibi is FDA-approved and commercially
      available. The use of MBI scans to measure how much cancer is in the breast during
      chemotherapy is considered investigational.

      Up to 100 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.
