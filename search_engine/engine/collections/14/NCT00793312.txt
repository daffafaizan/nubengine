      been assessed in a series of studies, e.g. ENDEAVOR I and ENDEAVOR II. The stent is composed
      of a cobalt alloy and is coated with a proprietary drug compound zotarolimus that is designed
      to reduce restenosis.

      This registry with the Endeavor(TM) Zotarolimus Eluting Coronary Stent System is being
      initiated 1) to expand the clinical knowledge base by including 'real world'patients in China
      and 2) to assess the event rate in Chinese patients known to have a higher risk of major
      adverse cardiac events, for example patients with diabetes mellitus, small vessels and long
      lesions.

      In total the plan is to enroll about 2200 patients from 37 sites.

      Follow-up will be one year for the main patients with cohort to collect acute and mid-term
      follow-up data, but will be extended to two years for certain patient subgroups.
