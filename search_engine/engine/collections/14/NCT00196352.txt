      contraceptive, with ethinyl estradiol supplementation during the usual hormone-free week, for
      up to an additional three consecutive years. This is an extension of the Seasonique Phase 3
      clinical trial to evaluate long-term safety. Only patients enrolled in the earlier trial are
      eligible for participation.
