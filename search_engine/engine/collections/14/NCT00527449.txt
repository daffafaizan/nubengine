      is possible. Using a neoadjuvant therapy the rate of breast-conserving surgery can be
      extended and tumor cell proliferation may be inhibited. Further the neoadjuvant chemotherapy
      is an in-vivo-activity-test for the used drugs. Epirubicin, Docetaxel and Carboplatin have
      shown antineoplastic activity against solid cancer alone and in combination.

      Using two different combinations of these three drugs, first 3 cycles Epirubicin/Docetaxel
      and then changing to Carboplatin/Docetaxel for 3 further cycles it is assumed that the
      results of the therapy will improve. Main criterion is the determination of pCR, second
      criteria are the rate of breast-conserving surgery, tumor response and therapy-dependent
      toxicities.
