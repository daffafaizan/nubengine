      Flu/Mel followed by autologous transplantation. Anti-PD-1 therapy of pembrolizumab will begin
      on Day +1 following stem cell transplantation and will be administered every 3 weeks for a
      total of 8 doses. According to the literature, the risk of 2-year relapse is estimated to be
      60-80% in patients with non-favorable risk AML in CR-1. With this protocol, investigators
      hypothesize that following lymphodepleting chemotherapy and pembrolizumab, the 2-year relapse
      risk will decrease to less than or equal to 35%. The one-sided Wald test at 5% significance
      level will be used to test the hypothesis. The size of 20 patients yields the power of 90.5%
      assuming that the actual 2-year leukemia-free survival is 60%.
