      graft donor sites and healing is determined based on clinical observation of the graft donor
      site and clinical judgement. Here we propose to use two instruments commonly used in skin
      research to measure wound healing. This study will validate the use of these two instruments,
      one that measures transepidermal water loss and the other that measures skin pigmentation to
      determine healing. To further validate the use of these instruments we will determine if
      these instruments can detect differences between two different wound dressing products that
      have been previously reported to heal skin graft donor sites at different rates.
