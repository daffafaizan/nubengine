    
      This is an open label, multi-centre, non-controlled, non-randomized, non-interventional study
      to evaluate the safety of Methylene Blue (MB) plasma. One centre per country will participate
      from United Kingdom, Belgium, Greece and Spain.

      The haemovigilance Case Report Form (CRF) will be completed for all patients who receive a
      Methylene Blue plasma transfusion and experience an adverse reaction. The patients will be
      monitored for the occurrence of possible adverse reactions within 24 hours after start of the
      transfusion. If the patient experiences an adverse reaction, information about the adverse
      reaction will be documented. Serious adverse reactions will be collected within a 7-day
      period after the transfusion.

      Each adverse reaction or serious adverse reaction will be followed up for 28 days after the
      occurrence of the reaction.

      Each centre will provide the number of transfused Methylene Blue plasma units and the number
      of transfused Methylene Blue plasma patients every three months.

      Information collected on the haemovigilance CRF will include:

        -  Details about the transfusion (transfused units, volume, other non-plasma blood
           components transfused)

        -  Details about the plasma (collected from whole blood, aphaeresis or both, filter using,
           type of reference used, illumination device model)

        -  Demographic data

        -  Transfusion history (including hospital department)

        -  History of previous transfusion reactions

        -  Details about the adverse reaction (date and time of reaction)

        -  Signs and symptoms and allocation to a diagnosis

        -  Classification of the adverse reaction (severity, imputability, non-serious or serious)

        -  Actions taken

        -  Outcome

        -  Time to recovery
