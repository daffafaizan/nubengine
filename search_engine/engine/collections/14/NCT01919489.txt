    
      Specific Aim: To determine whether treatment with liraglutide (Victoza®) will result in
      similar glycemic control (HbA1c at 26 weeks) and a lower rate of hypoglycemic events compared
      to treatment with glargine (Lantus®) in patients with T2D after hospital discharge. Patients
      with poorly controlled (HbA1c >7%-10%) T2D treated with diet or oral antidiabetic agents or
      low dose insulin naïve (0.4u/kg/day) prior to admission will be randomized to liraglutide or
      glargine in combination to OADs at hospital discharge.
