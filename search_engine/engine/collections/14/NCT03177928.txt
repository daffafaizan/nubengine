      Incidence of polycythemia vera ranged 0.01 to 2.61 per 100.000 population and the prevalence
      ranging from 0.49 to 46.88 per 100.000 population. Incidence of essential thrombocythemia is
      0.21 to 2.27 per 100.000 population, prevalence ranging between 11.00 - 42.51 per 100.000
      population.

      Primary myelofibrosis incidence is 1.15 -4.99 per 100.000 population and prevalence ranging
      between 1.76 - 4.05 per 100.000 population.In previous studies, cardiac involvement including
      coronary arterial thrombosis, myocardial infarction, pulmonary hypertension, asymptomatic
      pericardial effusion, cardiac tamponade, intractable cardiac failure due to intraventricular
      stenosis and valvular stenosis that occur in myeloproliferative neoplasms. There is a few
      number of studies in which cardiac lesions were evaluated in myeloproliferative neoplasms by
      using transthoracic echocardiography but still inadequate, so we need to understand more
      about cardiovascular complications in myeloproliferative neoplasms.
