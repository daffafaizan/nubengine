      controlled trial will be performed, with counties as the randomization units. The included
      counties will be randomized into an experimental group and a control group. A trauma
      treatment team will be only established in the experimental group. The in-hospital mortality
      rate will be compared between the experimental and control groups to investigate the effects
      of trauma treatment team establishment on the treatment of patients with severe trauma.
