      activity levels of users who sign up. The goal is to predict post-intervention endovascular
      failure before it occurs. Currently, physicians have no way of knowing when procedures such
      as angioplasties fail; with VascTrac, researchers hope to find downward trends in physical
      activity that will predict and indicate endovascular failure. All users are assigned numbers
      and their medical data is securely coded, decreasing the risk of promulgation of personal
      information.
