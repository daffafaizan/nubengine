      Trendelenburg position under pneumoperitoneum increases the incidence of postoperative
      complications. Approach termed lung-protective ventilation (LPV) strategy which refers to the
      use of low tidal volumes and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) may lead to a reduction
      in inflammation and prevent the occurrence of atelectasis. Computed tomography (CT) requiring
      transportation is the golden standard for measuring atelectasis, which is not suitable for
      perioperative observation. Lung ultrasound (LUS) which is noninvasive and easily repeatable
      at the bedside appears to be an accurate diagnostic tool for early detection of atelectasis.
      Thus, we conducted the trial to determine whether an LPV strategy has benefits in patients
      scheduled for RARC through a multifaceted method. We hypothesized that the use of
      prophylactic low tidal volume and PEEP would decrease postoperative inflammation and
      atelectasis, thereby, improve outcomes, as compared with the standard of nonprotective
      mechanical ventilation.
