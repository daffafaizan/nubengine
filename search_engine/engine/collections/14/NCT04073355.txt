      theory-based smartphone-delivered physical activity intervention among African American women
      aged 50-65 years. To accomplish this, we will deliver our previously developed Smart Walk
      physical activity intervention, originally developed for African American women aged 24-50
      years old, to 20 sedentary and obese African American women aged 50 to 65. We will collect
      data on the acceptability and feasibility of the intervention, as well as areas of
      intervention refinement to enhance the social, cultural, and behavioral relevance of the
      intervention for women in this age group.
