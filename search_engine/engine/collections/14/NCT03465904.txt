      Cefaly® Abortive Program device used at home for 2 hours to treat a migraine attack, as
      triptans are generally used. That is to say having randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled
      data of the efficacy and safety of the Cefaly® Abortive Program device in the abortive
      treatment of acute migraine as measured by 2-hour pain freedom, pain relief and
      migraine-associated symptoms freedom, plus evolution of these measurements for 24 hours after
      the beginning of the treatment session.
