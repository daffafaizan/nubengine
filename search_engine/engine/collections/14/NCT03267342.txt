      with financial counseling, and information about and access to financial management tools
      within the framework of citizenship-oriented care, which approaches recovery by linking
      clients to the 5 Rs of rights, responsibilities, roles, resources and relationships needed to
      achieve full membership in society. Based on results of previous research, the investigators
      hypothesize that the intervention will result in improved financial health, reduced financial
      stress, increased community participation, and improved satisfaction with care for the target
      group.
