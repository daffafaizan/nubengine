    
      This study is an open-label Intermediate-size EAP designed to provide treatment access for
      eligible Peanut-Allergic Children. This EAP entails visits every three months to assess
      patient status, safety, and to provide drug supply. ViaskinÂ® Peanut treatment will continue
      until, in the clinical judgment of the Investigator, the patient is no longer benefiting from
      continuation of the treatment, the drug becomes approved and available by prescription, or
      the study is terminated.
