      Group A, moderate altitude group, 1900 m, 40 participants Group B, low altitude group, 400m,
      40 participants Group A will spend 2 weeks at an altitude of 1900m and participants absolve a
      training program (3h, 4x a week, total training time 24h, training intensity 55-65% of
      maximal heart rate).

      Group B will spend spend 2 weeks at an altitude of 400m and participants absolve a training
      program (3h, 4x a week, total training time 24h, training intensity 55-65% of maximal heart

      C-peptid, free fatty acids, adiponectin, leptin, HbA1c, Metabolon cluster, c reactive
      protein, vit D3). Also BMI, BIA bioimpedance analysis, blood pressure, heart rate, egg,
      Physical status, exercise test.
