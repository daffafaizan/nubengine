      control and reduce hypoglycemia in patients with type 1 diabetes and insulin treated type 2
      diabetes. However, it takes about 48 hours before glycemic benefits are noticeable.
      Therefore, transition from insulin pump to multiple daily injection using insulin degludec is
      associated with hyperglycemia during first 48 hours of transition. Considering this, this
      study proposes to evaluate an investigational strategy to improve glycemic control during
      transition from insulin pump to multiple daily injections using insulin degludec and insulin
      aspart.
