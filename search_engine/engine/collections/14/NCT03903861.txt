      consumption of a carbohydrate mixture containing glucose with galactose has been shown to
      accelerate liver glycogen repletion as compared to glucose-only provision. However, the
      extent to which galactose-glucose combinations influence post-exercise muscle glycogen
      storage has yet to be determined.

      Therefore, this study will investigate whether short-term muscle glycogen storage after
      strenuous endurance exercise is enhanced by combined galactose-glucose or glucose only
      ingestion as compared to the ingestion of galactose alone.
