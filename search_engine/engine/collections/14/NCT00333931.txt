    
      Objective One: One study objective is to evaluate potential effect sizes of phenytoin and
      cognitive behavioral therapy for PTSD-related impulsive aggression.

      Hypothesis: Phenytoin and cognitive behavioral therapy are hypothesized to be effective in
      the treatment of PTSD-related impulsive aggression based on studies previously outlined.

      Plan: Patients enrolled in this pilot study will be randomized to receive an eight-week
      course of treatment with phenytoin or cognitive behavioral therapy in the Trauma Recovery
      Program at the Veterans's Affairs Medical Center in Houston, Texas.

      Objective Two: Another study objective is to begin to attempt to delineate potential neural
      correlates of treatment-related reductions in PTSD-related impulsive aggression.

      Hypothesis: Potential neural correlates of treatment-related reduction in intensity and/or
      severity of impulsive-aggressive acts are hypothesized to include changes in: 1) thalamic
      activation reflecting more effective thalamic sensory gating, with anticipation of increased
      activation of the thalamus post-treatment 2) activation of brain regions associated with
      verbal information processing, with the anticipation of increased activation of these regions
      post-treatment 3) activation of prefrontal regions, including the anticipation of increased
      activation of the medial and/or orbital prefrontal cortex post-treatment, 4) amygdalar
      activation, with the anticipation of decreased activation of the amygdala post-treatment 5)
      hippocampal activation, with the anticipation of increased activation of the hippocampus
      post-treatment, and/or, 6) right-left hemispheric dissociation of brain processing of
      stimuli, with the anticipation of greater degrees of bilaterality of brain processing of
      stimuli post-treatment. Specifically, greater degrees of activation of left hemispheric brain
      structures are anticipated in post-treatment fMRI scans.

      Plan: Patients with PTSD-associated impulsive aggression will undergo an eight-week course of
      treatment with phenytoin or CBT. Treatment-related changes in impulsive-aggressive acts will
      be correlated with changes in brain activation comparing pre- and post-treatment fMRI scans
      utilizing a standardized Go-No Go task which has been used in the study of impulsive
      aggressive individuals.
