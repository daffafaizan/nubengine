      brachii, musculus brachialis and musculus brachioradialis. Muscle selection in elbow flexor
      spasticity for botulinum toxin application has impact on treatment outcome. The
      superficiality of the biceps brachii muscle makes it an easy target for botulinum toxin
      injection. In dynamic electromyography studies, it has been reported that brachioradialis
      muscle is the most common contributor one to elbow flexion spasticity, followed by biceps
      brachii muscle. In the diagnostic selective nerve blocks, the brachialis muscle has been
      reported to be foreground.

      Determination of which muscle is more spastic before injection of the botulinum toxin, and
      the application of the targeted treatment to that muscle results in more improvement in
      spasticity. Can the target muscle selection clinically be performed instead of methods such
      as electromyography where equipment is required and the evaluation period is relatively long?
      Can semi-quantitative methods used to assess the severity of spasticity provide reliable
      information regarding the muscle or muscles that contribute to elbow flexor spasticity? It is
      known that the muscles that flex elbow in healthy individuals change according to forearm
      position. While the biceps brachii flexes the forearm in supination, the brachioradialis
      flexes the forearm in the neutral position. The brachialis muscle acts as a primary flexor
      muscle when the forearm is in pronation.

      The aim of this study is to investigate whether the severity of spasticity differs depending
      on the forearm position.
