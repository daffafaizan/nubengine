      Hypothesis: Drug-coated balloons improve functional and patency outcomes of
      failing/dysfunctional hemodialysis fistulas compared to plain uncoated balloons

      Aim of the Study:

      Compare the effectiveness of drug-coated balloons to plain balloon angioplasty in reducing
      stenosis rates in dialysis AVFs.

      Specific Objectives:

      Primary functional endpoint: Access circuit patency based on functional criteria at 12 month.

      Primary safety endpoint: Peri procedural complication rate

      Secondary endpoints:

        -  Technical success (<30% residual stenosis without postdilation)

        -  Access circuit dysfunction free survival (Time to event) based on functional criteria

        -  Target lesion restenosis free survival (Time to event) (in case of new lesion causes
           circuit dysfunction)
