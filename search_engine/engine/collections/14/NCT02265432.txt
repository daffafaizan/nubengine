      promotion of physical activity and reduction of sedentary behavior have an important role to
      improve population health.

      Primarily, potential participants will be identified and recruited among participants from
      the Singapore Health Study (SHS) 2014 based on pre-specified selection criteria . SHS is a
      cross-sectional study of adults between 18 and 79 years which is conducted annually to
      monitor health, health behavior and health determinants among the Singapore general
      population.

      All eligible participants will be randomized with a 1:1 ratio to intervention and control
      group.

      Intervention group participants will receive a personalized mobile-technology based
      intervention to promote physical activity. It consists of four components:

        1. General physical activity educational materials

        2. Wearable activity tracking devices to enable the intervention participants to
           self-monitor their physical activity behavior and receive real-time feedback

        3. Access to an online map of Singapore providing location based information about leisure
           time physical activity opportunities

        4. Personalized text messages which include, educational information, tailored theory-based
           motivational messages, as well as compliance enhancing reminders

      Control group participants will receive general physical activity educational materials,
      identical in content to that of the general educational materials of intervention group
      participants.

      All participants will be assessed at baseline, 6 months and 12 months after the intervention
      by accelerometry and self-reported questionnaires.
