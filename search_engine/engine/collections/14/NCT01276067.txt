      crossover study was conducted to compare the relative bioavailability of equal doses of the
      test and reference products under fasted conditions. The study was conducted with 32 (31
      completing) healthy adults in accordance with Protocol No. 10940307 (Revision 0). In each
      study period, a single 10 mg tablet of donepezil hydrochloride was administered to all
      subjects following an overnight fast of at least 10 hours. The test formulation was donepezil
      hydrochloride 10 mg tablet (OHM Laboratories, Inc., USA a subsidiary of Ranbaxy
      Pharmaceuticals, Inc. USA) and the reference formulation was ARICEPTÂ® (donepezil
      hydrochloride) 10 mg Tablets (Eisai Inc.). The subjects received the test product in one
      study period and the reference product in the other period; the order of administration was
      according to the dosing randomization schedule. Subjects were confined at the clinical
      facility from at least 10 hours prior to dosing until after the 24 hour blood collection.
      Subjects returned to the clinical facility for the 36, 48, and 72 hour blood sample
      collection. There was a 28-day interval between treatments.

      Blood samples were collected pre-dose and at intervals over 72 hours after dosing in each
      period. The plasma samples from all subjects were shipped to Warnex Bioanalytical Services
      for determination of donepezil concentrations.

      Statistical analysis was performed by Ranbaxy Laboratories Limited to compare the
      bioequivalence of the test formulation to the reference product. Bioequivalence was
      determined based on the confidence intervals for the major pharmacokinetic parameters,
      AUC0-72 and Cmax, for donepezil.
