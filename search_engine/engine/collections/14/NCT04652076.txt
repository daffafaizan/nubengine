      cancer progressing/relapsing after at least one prior systemic treatment remains poor. The
      development of new innovative anti-tumor drug candidates as single agent or in combination
      with chemotherapy or check point inhibitors is needed.

      NP137 is a first-in-class humanized monoclonal antibody targeting specifically and
      selectively Netrin-1. By blocking Netrin-1, NP137 is capable of restoring apoptosis in tumor
      cells in vitro and in vivo, leading to therapeutic activity in various animal cancer models.

      Dependence receptors inhibitor such as NP137 might be a novel choice to improve the clinical
      outcomes of these patients.

      The herein proposed study will be a multicenter, open-label, randomized, Phase I/II trial
      with:

      A safety run in part to assess the safety of the therapeutic combinations for the first 6
      patients enrolled in each of the therapeutic combinations independently of the tumor type.
      According to safety rules, these therapeutic combinations will be investigated or not in the
      Phase II part.

      A Phase II part will be then conducted using an adaptive Bayesian approach allowing to
      quickly stop treatment cohorts without evidence of efficacy and/or select promising treatment
      cohorts. The Phase II part will be initiated with a preliminary step to assess the clinical
      activity of the proposed therapeutic combinations in 2 tumor types before proceeding to the
      activation of extension phase II part of the study. For each cohorts, clinical activity will
      be assessed through by sequential statistical analysis at specific timepoints.
