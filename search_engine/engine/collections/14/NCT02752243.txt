    
      This is a phase I/II multicenter-study to investigate the feasibility safety and efficacy of
      interleukin (IL)-15 activated CIK cells in patients with acute leukemia or myelodysplastic
      syndrome (MDS) showing evidence of relapse after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT).

      CIK cell infusions will be given with an interval of 4-6 weeks according to a dose escalation
      schedule in patients with impending relapse after allogeneic SCT. In presence of acute graft
      versus host disease (aGvHD) â‰¥ grade II, the next scheduled infusion will not be administered.
