      serum levels of high sensitive TroponinT (hsTnT) is done. The main objectives of the TROPIC
      register are to evaluate the level of high sensitive TroponinT before and after S-ICD device
      implantation and to compare these changes in TroponinT-levels with those after standard
      transvenous ICD-implantation.
