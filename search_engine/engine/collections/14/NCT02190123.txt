      up to 12 months unless discontinuation is clinically indicated. Early discontinuation could
      result in an increased risk of cardiovascular death or myocardial infarction due to the
      patient's underlying disease.

      There are no robust data allowing to evaluate the treatment persistence with OAPs after ACS
      in the current practice in Belgium and Luxembourg at this time. It is currently unclear as to
      why patients discontinue, switch or reinitiate treatment and upon whose advice. A
      non-interventional study is needed to obtain reliable data on treatment persistence and
      reasons for discontinuation, switch or reinitiation of treatment.

      REWINDER is a multinational, multicentre, non-interventional, retrospective study of patients
      treated with an oral antiplatelet (ticagrelor, prasugrel or clopidogrel) while in hospital
      after an ACS event, to be conducted in Belgium and Luxembourg. Primary objective is to
      evaluate the actual treatment persistence with OAPs after an ACS in the clinical practice in
      Belgium and Luxembourg. The main secondary objectives are to describe the most frequent
      reasons for OAP treatment switch, discontinuation or reinitiation; to identify the
      decisionmakers in the OAP treatment changes and to characterize the patient profile in terms
      of demographics, diagnosis, management strategies, comorbidities and concomitant medications
      to identify any association between patient profile and treatment duration.

      The target sample size of the study is 500 patients.
