      highly variable HCV genotype geographic distribution. Genotype 2 HCV is reported to be the
      second most common type (~25%) in Chinese population and associated with a high risk of acute
      liver disease exacerbation and other extrahepatic diseases. Sofosbuvir is a pan-genotypic HCV
      ribonucleic acid (RNA) polymerase inhibitor directing at HCV RNA replication. Genotype 2
      chronic hepatitis C has a high treatment response to the combined regimen of peginterferon
      and weight-adjusted ribavirin. The all-oral combination regimen of sofosbuvir and ribavirin
      is expected to completely suppress genotype 2 HCV replication in subjects chronically
      infected with HCV and achieve a sustained virologic response, namely, HCV not detected or
      below a predefined limit in plasma, 12 or 24 weeks after cessation of treatment.
