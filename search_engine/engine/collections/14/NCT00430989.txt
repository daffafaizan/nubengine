      (CAD) or risk factors for CAD.

      N2O interferes with vitamin B12 and folate metabolism. This impairs production of methionine
      (from homocysteine), used to form tetrahydrofolate and thymidine during DNA synthesis. It has
      been repeatedly demonstrated that N2O anaesthesia increases postoperative homocysteine
      levels. Chronic hyperhomocysteinaemia is associated with cardiovascular disease, and acute
      hyperhomocysteinaemia is known to cause endothelial dysfunction. One small trial has
      demonstrated an increased incidence of postoperative myocardial ischaemia in patients
      receiving N2O anaesthesia. Reducing postoperative myocardial infarction and death are
      important aims for those with CAD undergoing major surgery.

      Our previous trial (ENIGMA) studied 2050 patients and identified some serious adverse
      effects, but most patients were not at risk of CAD and so we could not reliably assess
      serious cardiac complications. We propose a large simple randomized clinical trial of 7,000
      patients to provide a definitive evaluation of the safety of N2O anaesthesia.
