      versus multiple-dose antimicrobial prophylaxis in terms of the incidence of infectious
      complications associated with peroral endoscopic myotomy. Six hundred sixty-six patients
      undergoing POEM for achalasia will be randomized to receive only single-dose ceftazidime (2g)
      or an additional 2 doses every 12 hours postoperatively (multi-dose group). POEM associated
      infectious complications will be assessed and recorded as regional infections, remote
      infections and systemic infections. Infection rate, adverse events related to antibiotics and
      POEM, Clavien-Dindo classification of surgical complications, length of hospital stay and
      efficacy of POEM will be compared. Body fluid bacterial culture will be conducted in patients
      suspected of infectious complications.
