      colonoscope. Several minor studies have shown that the use of Endocuff probably increases the
      number of detected polyps in colonoscopy. Endocuff is made of soft plastic and has been
      designed to give an optimal view of the entire colon. It gently averts and flattens folds in
      order to see small polyps "hiding" in the space behind colonic folds.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate into the effect of the Endocuff in screening
      colonoscopy compared with screening colonoscopy performed without Endocuff. The device has
      been used during several years yet an effect on the number of polyps detected during
      screenings colonoscopy has not been shown. This studies main hypothesis is that the use of
      Endocuff in screenings colonoscopy will increase the adenoma detection rate in these
      patients, with a potential to reduce interval cancer.

      This study is a randomized controlled trial with 900 patients.
