        -  Group 1: 20 patients with induced radio sarcoma

        -  Group 2: 20 patients without primary sarcoma or induced radio sarcoma

        -  Group 3: 20 patients with primary sarcoma These numbers will make it possible to have
           preliminary data making it possible to judge the interest of the genetic signature in
           the prediction of the radiation-induced sarcomas.
