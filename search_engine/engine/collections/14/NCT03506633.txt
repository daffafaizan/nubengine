      leg arteries, and the resulting impaired blood flow, and concomitant reduced oxygen delivery
      to skeletal muscle results in the pathophysiology of PAD. We have recently demonstrated that
      patients with PAD have higher levels of systemic and local skeletal muscle inflammation due
      to impaired oxygen transfer capacity of leg blood vessels, which causes hypoxic conditions,
      meaning lack of oxygen, in the leg skeletal muscle. Skeletal muscle mitochondrial dysfunction
      and elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) represent key pathological processes linked to
      atherosclerosis-mediated hypoxic and metabolic stress in PAD patients. One potential
      defensive mechanism to these negative consequences of impaired oxygen transfer
      capacity-induced hypoxic stress may be having higher levels of antioxidant capacity. MitoQ, a
      derivative of CoQ10, is a commercial antioxidant that counteracts this oxidative stress
      within the mitochondria. High ROS levels have been positively correlated with reduced NO
      bioavailability, which limits the ability of the blood vessels to dilate, thereby increasing
      the occlusion that leads to claudication in PAD patients. MitoQ should reduce these ROS
      levels and increase vasodilatory function. However, the influence of MitoQ intake on leg
      blood flow, ROS production, claudication and leg function has not yet been investigated in
      this disease population. This research project may help us to understand the beneficial
      effects of higher mitochondrial specific antioxidant capacity on oxygen transfer capacity of
      leg blood vessels, mitochondria function, leg performance and leg pain in patients with PAD.
