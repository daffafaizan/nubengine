      the effectiveness of exclusion of the aneurysm sac from blood flow. For this reason, aneurysm
      diameter and the presence of endoleaks is evaluated with computed tomographic (CT)
      angiography yearly after Endovascular Aneurysm Repair (EVAR).

      The aim of this study is to investigate the value of magnetic resonance imaging using
      Vasovist as a contrast agent for the detection of endoleaks.

      The advantages of magnetic resonance imaging with respect to CTA are no use of ionizing
      radiation, use of less nephrotoxic contrast agents.
