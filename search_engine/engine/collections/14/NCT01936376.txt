      Southern California, the University of Minnesota, the Dana Farber Cancer Institute, and the
      MD Anderson Cancer Center. Blood and urine samples will be collected from patients undergoing
      treatment with either cisplatin or aminoglycosides, which are two different drugs known to
      cause injuries to the proximal tubule of the kidney. Cisplatin is a common chemotherapy drug
      taken by patients with head and neck cancer. Aminoglycosides are a common antibiotic drug
      taken by patients with cystic fibrosis.
