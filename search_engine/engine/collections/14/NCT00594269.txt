      agitation, aggression and apathy. These symptoms are called Behavioural- and Psychological
      Symptoms in Dementia (BPSD), and are difficult to treat. Antipsychotic and antidepressant
      medication is used as treatment, despite its lack of clinical evidence.

      We will discontinue risperidone in one group of 30 patients and compere them to 30 controls
      and we will discontinue antidepressants in a group of 76 patients and compere them to 76
      controls. Patients should have dementia of Alzheimer- or vascular origin. They should live in
      Nursing Homes and have no other psychiatric disease for which they receive psychotropic drug.
      They will be registered with 7 different questionnaires at baseline and after 3, 6, 12 and 24
      weeks. The study period is 24 weeks. The questionnaires are filled in by the patients and the
      nurses at the nursing homes.

      This is a double blind RCT study with placebo-controlled group.
