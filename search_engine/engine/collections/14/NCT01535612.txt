      (using insulin aspart) in patients with T2DM who are currently receiving basal/bolus insulin
      therapy with or without oral anti-diabetic drugs (OADs) for glycemic control. The patient's
      participation in the study is comprised of four phases: screening, baseline evaluation,
      transition to PaQ™ use, and PaQ™ treatment period. The use of these phases will allow an
      orderly transition to PaQ™ treatment as well as a reliable construct from which to interpret
      the final data.
