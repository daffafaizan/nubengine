      and standardized way, without the need for expertise in cognitive test administration. Such
      methods would be particularly helpful in mild traumatic brain injury, where objective
      measures are needed, and would greatly expand the capacity to make such assessments in
      standard clinical practice.

      Our goal is to recruit 100 subjects total in two groups of age, gender, and education matched
      subjects, as follows: TBI (n = 50) and non-TBI (n = 50).

      The subject will be asked to perform 2 computer-based cognitive tests while the fNIRS device
      is in place. The fNIRS sensor pads will record changes in blood oxy/deoxy hemoglobin
      concentrations in the underlying cortex. Data will be stored for post processing analysis.

      The main outcome measures will be: 1) a correlation of the fNIRS results between the TBI and
      non-TBI groups; 2) a correlation of the fNIRS results with the severity of the TBI within the
      TBI group. Finally, we plan to compare individual measurement from TBI patients with the
      healthy group.
