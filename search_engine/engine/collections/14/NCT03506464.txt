      Subjects of the plantar fasciitis group (PFG) will be recruited in May2018 to apply to them a
      myofascial release technique.

      Healthy volunteers without a history of plantar fascia disease will be recruited as control
      group (CG).

      The examination will be included B-mode scanning and real time sonoelastography using an US
      scanner with linear array transducer (ML6-15). All examinations will be conducted by a
      sonographer with more than 10 years' experience in musculoskeletal imaging.

      Using a standardized protocol three images of every pre-post intervention video will be
      stored uncompressed and with no losses in bitmap format (bmp), and the mean value of the
      histogram components will be used for statistical analysis. The examination protocol shows
      good reliability, and has been reported previously.

      ImageJ 1.45 software will be used to perform quantitative analysis of gray-scale images and
      the color histogram of the elastogram.
