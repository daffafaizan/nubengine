      thyroid gland. This is considered the most common autoimmune disorder, and the most common
      endocrine disorder. Psychological trauma has been suggested as a possible factor in the
      pathogenesis and development of autoimmune diseases. Although a diversity of
      psychotherapeutic interventions have been studied in adults with autoimmune diseases, there
      is a lack of psychological research and randomized controlled trials in the field of the
      Hashimoto disease.

      This study is designed to be a clinical trial with three arms: one experimental and two
      control groups. The experimental group receives EMDR, one control group receive placebo and
      the other is a waiting list. 90 out-patients with Hashimoto disease will be randomly assigned
      to the three groups. The investigators hypothesize that the therapeutic gains will be more
      significant in the experimental condition than in the control groups at the completion of the
      therapy and that this will be maintained at the 3-month follow-up.The EMDR group undergoes a
      90 minutes session of EMDR each week for twelve weeks.The sessions will be conducted by
      clinicians or psychotherapists specialized in EMDR. The placebo group will receive a similar
      amount of time of placebo intervention. If therapy is efficient on the autoimmune disorder,
      participants in the control groups will be reallocated to EMDR after the experimental
      treatment will come to an end.
