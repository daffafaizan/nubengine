      million people die every year due to CAD in Europe.[1] The incidence of ST elevation
      myocardial infarction (STEMI) appears to be declining; however, it is still an important
      issue in cardiovascular medicine.[2] Initial risk assessment is important for STEMI to
      estimate adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Previous studies demonstrated that increased age,
      advanced Killip class, heart rate, arterial hypotension, increased serum creatinine, white
      blood cell counts, and hemoglobin levels were predictors of in-hospital and early mortality
      in patients with STEMI treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI).[3,4
      ]Therefore, risk scores including the aforementioned parameters were developed to estimate
      mortality in patients with STEMI.

      No-reflow is still a challenging major issue in the management of the patients with STEMI
      undergoing primary PCI. It is defined as inadequate myocardial perfusionthrough a given
      segment of the coronary circulation without angiographic evidence of mechanical vessel
      obstructionas [5] Angiographic no-reflow defined as less than Thrombolysis In Myocardial
      Infarction (TIMI) 3 flow [6] and angiographic success was defined as TIMI Grade 3 Flow .

      PRECISE-DAPT score includes age, creatinine clearance, white blood cell counts, hemoglobin
      levels, and prior spontaneous bleeding [7]. All these factors have a close relationship with
      coronary artery disease (CAD) and complications [8-10]. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to
      evaluate the association of admission PRECISE-DAPT score with the development of slow flow &
      bleeding & othershort term cardiovascular complications that develop in patients with STEMI
      treated with primary PCI.
