      Primary Objective: To assess the impact of ciprofloxacin on the change in PSA from
      baseline/randomization to prostate biopsy

      Secondary Objective: To assess the impact of ciprofloxacin on the overall infectious
      complications following prostate biopsy

      The impact of observation versus ciprofloxacin on PSA levels will be assessed by PSA change
      from baseline. The first PSA measurement will be at the study entry and randomization. The
      second PSA measurement will be immediately prior to prostate biopsy, which will occur 21-45
      days following randomization.
