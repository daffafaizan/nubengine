      randomized trial for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery to compare and to test
      improvement in wound healing, quality of life, safety/efficacy, cost-effectiveness, short and
      long-term outcomes and vein-graft patency after endoscopic open CO2 harvesting system versus
      conventional vein harvesting.
