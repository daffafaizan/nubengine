      through FMT as a therapy for Irritable bowel syndrome(IBS). We established a standard
      microbiota isolation from donated fresh stool in lab. Then the microbiota is transplanted to
      the whole colon through a tube. Patients from Guangzhou First People's Hospital in this study
      will be assigned to receive FMT at least two times according to associated guidelines and
      follow-up for at least six months. Questionnaires will be used to assess participants at
      study start and at study completion.
