      matching (PSM) will be primarily descriptive in nature. The statistics are as in the
      following:

        -  Continuous variables: N, mean, standard deviation, lower quartile Q1, median, upper
           quartile Q3, minimum, maximum;

        -  Categorical variables: frequencies and percentages of patients at each category.

      Before the statistical analyses, the medical history and co-morbidities need to be coded
      using ICD10. At the same time, the data collected should be clearly understood and provide
      the following information but not limited to the number of subjects enrolled in each site,
      the list of variables, the number of observations of each variable and the missing proportion
      of the variable.

      The factors involved into the logistic model for propensity score matching include but not
      limited to demographic, baseline characteristics, severity of COPD, etc. A factor research
      will be performed before the matching is performed aiming to include appropriate factors into
      the model. Matching ratio could be exact or approximate.

      Programming software is SAS 9.3 (SAS: Statistical Analysis System) or higher in Windows
      system. R statistical software could be another tool for the exploration.
