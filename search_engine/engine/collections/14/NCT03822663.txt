      efforts. CAF supplementation may reduce effort-induced multi-faceted symptoms of fatigue and
      can improve psychomotor functions (like agility or decision-making processes), which is
      required during the intermittent high-intensity efforts in combat sports and speed-strength
      disciplines. Moreover, it is suggested that CAF treatment is associated with increased
      glycolytic activity during simulated or real training/competition bouts, which results in
      performance and physical capacity improvement.

      However, there are hardly any data on the individual CAF-induced and dose-dependent changes
      in physical capacity and discipline-specific performance in combat sports and speed-strength
      disciplines. Therefore, the study aims to examine the effect of acute, different-dose CAF
      ingestion on physical capacity and discipline-specific performance in combat sports and
      speed-strength athletes, in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial.
