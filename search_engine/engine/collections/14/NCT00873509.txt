    
      This is a multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-masked study of 166 evaluable
      participants taking buspirone twice daily for 6 months. Children aged 2-6 years with autism
      will be randomized to receive one of three treatments: 2.5mg, 5.0mg, or matched placebo. The
      placebo controlled trial will be followed by an optional follow-up trial to assess the long
      term safety of buspirone. In addition, a PET scan of serotonin synthesis and plasma serotonin
      will be measured at baseline to determine whether these measures are predictors of drug
      response. This trial is aimed at the core features of autism. The outcome measures for
      efficacy will be examiner and parent ratings on psychological tests and questionnaires. The
      outcome measure for the primary objective will be the Autism Diagnostic Observation Scale
      (ADOS) Composite Total score. The behavioral outcomes for the secondary aims are delineated
      in the study design.
