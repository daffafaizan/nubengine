    
      We propose a prospective double-blinded randomized controlled trial. 336 pediatric patients
      presenting to Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary (MEEI) for adenotonsillectomy who are
      eligible for the study based on inclusion and exclusion criteria will be recruited. A
      Clinical Pharmacy specialist, will be in charge of preparing the dexmedetomidine and placebo
      doses and will randomize the patients to four equally numbered groups. The anesthesiologist
      will receive the assignment for the extubation method in a sealed envelope from the Clinical
      Pharmacy specialist. Multiple parameters will be recorded in perioperative period to quantify
      perioperative adverse respiratory events.
