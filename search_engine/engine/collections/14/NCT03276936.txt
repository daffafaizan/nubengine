    
      This is an open-label, multicenter, 40-week extension study to evaluate the long-term safety,
      tolerability, and efficacy of FMX103 1.5% topical foam in the treatment of moderate-to-severe
      facial papulopustular rosacea. Subjects entering this study will have recently participated
      in 1 of 2 pivotal, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, safety and efficacy studies (FX2016-11
      and FX2016-12 - NCT03142451). Subjects must demonstrate that they are eligible to continue
      into Study FX2016-13 based on safety evaluations and IGA score performed at Final Visit of
      one of the previous double-blind studies.

      At the completion of the Final Visit in Study FX2016-11 or Study FX2016-12, subjects may be
      invited to continue into this open-label study for an additional 40 weeks of open-label
      treatment. A minimum of 400 subjects will be enrolled into from Studies FX2016-11 and
      FX2016-12. Subjects who elect to continue into this open-label study will receive supplies of
      active FMX103 1.5% minocycline foam.
