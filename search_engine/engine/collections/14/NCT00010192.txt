      intermediate-dose pulse interleukin-2 (IL-2) in patients with CD20-positive B-cell lymphoid
      malignancy.

      Determine the maximum tolerated dose of intermediate-dose pulse IL-2 in this patient
      population.

      Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of intermediate-dose pulse aldesleukin.

      Patients receive rituximab IV on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Patients then receive low-dose
      aldesleukin subcutaneously (SC) on days 29-39, 43-53, 57-67, and 71-81, and intermediate-dose
      aldesleukin SC on days 40-42, 54-56, 68-70, and 82-84. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive
      escalating doses of intermediate-dose pulse aldesleukin until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is reached. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
