      The study intervention is to start patients with HIV and tuberculosis on anti-retroviral
      treatment along with the continuation phase of anti-tuberculosis treatment (ATT)ie after
      completion of first two months of treatment. The anti-TB regimen used in this trial will be
      2EHRZ3/4RH3. Two different once-daily regimens are being compared for their efficacy and
      adverse event profile, namely ddI + 3TC + NVP versus ddI + 3TC + EFZ. The primary aim is to
      study the outcome of patients treated with both ART and ATT at 6 months (24 weeks of ART). A
      secondary objective is to compare the utility of partially supervised directly observed
      treatment with unsupervised administration of anti-retroviral drugs.

      Patients with HIV-1 infection and active tuberculosis (pulmonary and extrapulmonary) will be
      started on a four-drug intermittent short-course anti-TB regimen on recruitment to the trial.
      They will be randomized at the end of intensive phase of ATT to receive either of the ART
      regimens and the outcome measured at the end of 6 months. During this phase, both ATT and ART
      will be given under supervision three times a week. Patients with viral load < 400
      copies/ml(favourable outcome) at this time point will be randomized to receive ART either by
      partial observation of treatment (three times a week)or monthly supply (unsupervised
      administration) and final outcome will be measured at the end of 24 months of ART. The study
      will provide information on the comparative efficacy of the two regimens when given with
      anti-TB treatment as well as any added advantage that direct observation of treatment may
      provide.
