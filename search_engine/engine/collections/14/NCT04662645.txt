      I. To determine feasibility of embedding a palliative care (PC) physician within the James
      Thoracic Oncology Clinic.

      II. To assess patient and caregiver outcomes over a 12-month period within an embedded
      onco-palliative care clinic model.

      III. To evaluate and describe clinician attitudes and beliefs regarding utilization of
      embedded palliative care as well as symptoms of provider burnout.

      IV. To analyze health care utilization among participants receiving embedded onco-palliative
      care.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants and caregivers undergo embedded palliative care comprising symptom management
      (physical and psychological), advanced directives and goals of care discussion, caregiver
      support, and referral for adjunctive supportive services as needed at each clinic visit.

      After completion of study, patients are followed for up to 1 year.
