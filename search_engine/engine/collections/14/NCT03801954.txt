      bladder cancer is chemotherapy followed by RC. Patients undergoing this surgery are at risk
      for complications. Being malnourished can increase the risk of mortality by three times. The
      patients also suffer from taste alterations after chemotherapy and gastrointestinal
      disturbances such as diarrhea and constipation. These can lead to poor nutritional intake and
      malabsorption of nutrients.

      This study is being done to develop an educational video series for patients undergoing RC
      and assess their impact. The videos are created to address the nutritional needs of these
      patients and improve their outcomes after surgery.
