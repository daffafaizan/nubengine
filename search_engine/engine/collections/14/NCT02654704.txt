      following their pneumonia vaccination over twelve time points. Genomic sequencing will be
      used to evaluate the volunteer's genomic risks based on variants with known disease
      association. Full transcriptome (via RNA-Sequencing), proteome and metabolome profiling (via
      mass spectrometry) will be performed per time-point. This will allow the dynamic monitoring
      of thousands of molecular components and their responses to vaccination, capturing both the
      initial innate response reaction in addition to the adaptive response and return to baseline.
      This study involves a simple blood draw, saliva collection, standard FDA-approved
      pneumococcal vaccine administration and Spirometry.
