      and secretion or reduced tissue function.According to the prevalence survey of thyroid
      diseases in ten cities in China in 2010, TSH>4.2 mIU /L was the diagnostic cut-off point, and
      the prevalence of hypothyroidism was 17.8%, of which the prevalence of subclinical
      hypothyroidism was 16.7%, and the prevalence of clinical hypothyroidism was 1.1% [6].The
      prevalence was higher in females than in males and increased with age.The annual incidence of
      hypothyroidism in China is 2.9â€°[7].Epidemiological evidence suggests that hypothyroidism is
      associated with anxiety and mood disorders [4].Several studies have shown that hypothyroidism
      is associated with lower quality of life (QOL), higher load symptom, poorer physical and
      mental health, and poorer attention performance.The treatment goal of primary clinical
      hypothyroidism is that the symptoms and signs of hypothyroidism disappear, and TSH, TT4 and
      FT4 values remain in the normal range.Levothyroxine (L-T4) is the main alternative therapy
      for this disease [8].Thypro questionnaire (Thypro) is the first comprehensive scale developed
      by Danish scholar Watt et al., which is applicable to patients with various benign Thyroid
      diseases. It has been translated into 10 languages and applied in populations in many
      countries.[9].Studies have shown that, in the treatment of hypothyroidism patients, even if
      thyroid function is in the normal range, there are still chills, fatigue, anxiety, depression
      and other physiological or psychological damage, reducing the quality of life of patients.The
      relationship between thyroid hormone levels and quality of life in patients with treated
      hypothyroidism is controversial.Studies have shown that in patients with primary
      hypothyroidism, higher TSH values are associated with impaired quality of life, even if TSH
      is within the normal reference range.TSH was positively correlated with the scores of fatigue
      and emotional susceptibility scales, indicating that these two aspects of quality of life
      were significantly affected with the increase of TSH level [1].However, some studies have
      shown that the quality of life of hypothyroidism patients treated with levothyroxine has
      nothing to do with the level of thyroid hormone, and TSH or free T4 cannot be used as the
      indicator of the best treatment effect, because it cannot reflect the patient's quality of
      life [2].But in the study, a significant percentage of patients with hypothyroidism
      simultaneously with high blood pressure, diabetes, dyslipidemia, diseases such as depression
      or anxiety, long-term use may affect the metabolism of thyroid hormones and drugs, and
      combined with the disease itself also has effect on the quality of life in patients with [2],
      not real thyroid hormone levels in patients with quality of life, their metabolism and the
      influence of correlation, etc.

      This study except for other factors, such as merger disease with primary hypothyroidism
      patients quality of life assessment, observe the normal JiaJian patients, we use the current
      widely used thyroid disease patients to evaluate the quality of life questionnaire (ThyPRO -
      39), observe JiaJian thyroid hormone levels in patients with son and their quality of life
      scale and the relevance of the blood sugar, blood lipid metabolic indicators related to
      relevance.

      Signed in patients voluntary and informed consent, to assess all criteria of patients,
      collected demographic data (such as gender, age, etc.), record the history and the other
      previous medical history, family history, related to the vital signs data (such as height,
      weight, waist circumference, hip circumference, BMI and waist hip ratio, blood pressure),
      laboratory indexes (including thyroid function, HbA1c, fasting insulin, fasting C peptide,
      blood biochemistry), thyroid ultrasound.Patients meeting the inclusion criteria received two
      questionnaires: ThyPRO-39 (Chinese version), and the MOS 36-item Short Form Health Survey
      (SF36).ThyPRO39 has 39 items, 12 subscale tables and 1 single item to evaluate overall
      quality of life.The 12 subscales were further divided into 3 categories: (1) somatic symptoms
      (goiter symptoms, hyperthyroidism symptoms, hypothyroidism symptoms, thyroid ophthalmopathy
      symptoms);(2) physiological (fatigue, cognition), psychological (anxiety, depression, mood)
      and social (social activities, daily life);(3) the appearance.This scale is a self-rating
      scale, and Likert 5-grade score is used to calculate the crude score of each subscale, and
      then the control scoresheet and calculation formula are converted into standard score. The
      total score of standard score ranges from 0 to 100, and the higher the score, the worse the
      quality of life [3].SF36 is a commonly used universal scale for the study of quality of life
      in patients with thyroid disease, which measures 8 health concepts and 1 self-rating of
      health changes.Eight of these health concepts are further divided into two categories, namely
      physical health and mental health.SF36 is a multi-item scale, each dimension contains 2 ~ 10
      items, including a total of 36 items.The total score of SF36 is 100 points, and the higher
      the score, the better the health status [5].The purpose of this study was to evaluate the
      relationship between thyroid function and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and related
      metabolic indicators in patients with hypothyroidism.
