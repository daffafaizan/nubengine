      is associated with a longer breast cancer event-free interval in breast cancer survivors. II.
      Motivate an intervention group of breast cancer survivors to adopt and maintain a dietary
      pattern that is rich in vegetables, fruit, and fiber and low in fat. III. Demonstrate that
      the intervention can produce significant changes in circulating carotenoid and estrogen
      biomarkers compared to a healthy control diet. IV. Test whether the probability of a
      secondary cancer event is associated with change in self-reported dietary intake, circulating
      carotenoid concentrations, and circulating estrogen concentrations.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to age
      (under 55 vs 55 and over at time of diagnosis), stage of tumor (stage I and at least 1 cm vs
      stage II/IIIA), and clinical site. Patients are randomized to one of two healthy dietary
      regimens: Arm I: Patients are taught to follow a dietary pattern that will produce
      significant changes in circulating carotenoid and estrogen biomarkers. Arm II: Patients are
      assigned to follow dietary guidelines established by the National Cancer Institute and the
      USDA. All patients participate in 24 hour dietary recalls, cooking classes, as well as
      complete several questionnaires, at baseline and then at 12, 24 or 36, 48, and 72 months; a
      randomly selected 50% sample participate in recall at 6 months. Patients are followed by
      telephone every 6 months for an average of 6 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3,000 women will be accrued for this study within 5 years.
