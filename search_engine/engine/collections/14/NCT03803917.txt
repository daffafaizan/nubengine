      patients with CrohnÂ´s Disease who underwent treatment with freshly harvested autologous
      adipose tissue for perianal fistulas between March 2015 and June 2018. Inclusion criteria
      consisted of the following: the presence of complex CD fistulas refractory to standard
      surgical intervention, including long-term seton and regular curettage, and/or medical
      treatment. Pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed to describe the location and
      extent of the fistula. Clinical examinations of the patients were performed at intervals of
      six weeks, three months and six months following adipose tissue injection. Primary endpoint
      was complete fistula healing at clinical examination six months after the last injection. A
      fistula was considered completely clinically healed: (i) if the patient had no symptoms of
      discharge; (ii) if there was no visible external fistula opening in the perineum; and (iii)
      if no internal opening could be palpated with rectal digital examination. Secondary endpoints
      included either reduced or ceased fistula secretion. If clinical healing of the fistula was
      not obtained six weeks after the first treatment, patients were offered a second adipose
      injection within two weeks. A third injection was offered to patients who did not have
      complete healing within six weeks of the first two injections.Pelvic MRI was repeated in all
      patients with transsphincteric and intersphincteric fistulas who, upon clinical examination,
      demonstrated complete healing at 6 months after the last injection.
