      management with shorter duration of hospital stays. Pain management is medically pertinent
      for optimal care in surgical patients. Although development and advancement in understanding
      of the patho-physiology of pain, analgesics, pharmacology and the development of better
      effective techniques for post-operative pain control, patients still continue to experience
      considerable discomfort.

      Laparotomy results in parietal pain, whereas laparoscopy has a visceral component, a somatic
      component and shoulder pain secondary to diaphragmatic irritation because of CO2
      pneumo-peritoneum. Postoperative pain associated with laparoscopic cholecystectomy, although
      less severe and of shorter duration than that after open cholecystectomy, is still a source
      of marked discomfort and surgical stress. The degree of the pain after laparoscopic
      procedures has multifactorial influence including the volume of residual gas, type of gas
      used for pneumo-peritoneum, pressure created by the pneumo-peritoneum and insufflated gas
      temperature.

      Local anesthetic infiltration of the incision sites decreases postoperative opiate
      requirement and improves subjective pain scores but does eliminate the pain.

      Earlier scientists have also reported several beneficial effects of the intra-peritoneal
      application of bupivacaine with morphine on postoperative pain management after laparoscopic
      cholecystectomy.
