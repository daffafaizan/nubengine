      novel family-focused lifestyle modification intervention is more effective in reducing risk
      for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD) than an individual-focused lifestyle
      modification intervention. We will enroll 220 Hispanic family pairs or dyads, of whom one
      member has two or more risk factors for type 2 diabetes or CVD but does not have type 2
      diabetes or CVD. The second member of the family dyad may or may not have type 2 diabetes or
      CVD or may or may not be at risk for type 2 diabetes or CVD. Of the 220 family dyads, 110
      will be randomly selected to participate in the family-focused intervention and 110 will be
      randomly selected to participate in the individual-focused intervention. The interventions
      for both groups will be provided by community health workers. Both groups will receive eight
      educational sessions about healthy lifestyle behaviors and support to address personal and
      environmental barriers to engaging in healthy behaviors. After the eight sessions, the
      community health workers will follow up with participants once a month by phone over the next
      12 months. Primary outcomes include short-term and long-term impact of the family-focused
      active intervention compared to the individual-focused control condition on type 2 diabetes
      and CVD biological risk factors (for example, blood pressure and weight) and behavioral risk
      factors (for example, physical activity and tobacco use). Outcomes are measured at baseline,
      immediately post-intervention, and at the end of the 12 month period of the study for both
      groups.
