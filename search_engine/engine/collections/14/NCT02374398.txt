    
      The study is randomized, placebo controlled. The study population includes patients older
      than 18 years of age undergoing elective total primary knee replacement under spinal
      anesthesia. All patients enrolled in the study will undergo TKA performed by the same
      orthopedic surgeon. Since controversies exist regarding the effect of different types of
      anesthesia (general anesthesia versus spinal or epidural anesthesia) on intraoperative blood
      loss, in order to eliminate an important confounding variable we decided to exclusively
      enroll for our study patients that qualify for and agree with spinal anesthesia to be used as
      the main anesthetic technique for their TKA.

      All clinical trial procedures will be performed by personnel blinded to study treatment
      assignment. Unblinding is only allowed for safety concerns in an emergency situation.The only
      other exception is represented by the surgeon, who can't be blinded in regards to using
      Aquamantys system and the bipolar sealer. Once a subject becomes eligible for the trial, the
      investigator or the designee will access the randomization system.

      Enrolled subjects will be assigned to one of the 4 groups by block randomization of
      alternating 4 and 8 and 12 patients per block. The Pharmacy Department will provide the iv
      placebo or the iv TXA according to the randomization process.

      This clinical trial will be conducted in accordance to this protocol, Good Clinical Practice
      and applicable regulatory requirements
