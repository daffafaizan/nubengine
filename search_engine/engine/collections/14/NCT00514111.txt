      phase of clinical latency which makes its early diagnosis difficult and results in the
      development of a large number of cases to complications such as cirrhosis, hepatic
      insufficiency and hepatocarcinoma. In Brazil, it is estimated three million estimated cases
      to 52 thousand reports. The aim of this study is to evaluate the sustained virologic response
      (RVS) in HVC patients treated with pegylated-interferon or conventional-interferon and
      ribavirin, and to investigate the associated factors with RVS, by means of retrospective
      analysis.
