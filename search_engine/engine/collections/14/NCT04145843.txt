      associated costs of over US $6 billion. Common bile duct (CBD) stones in turn occur in 15-20%
      patients with gallstone disease and require treatment due to risk of infection and
      pancreatitis. Endoscopic treatment via endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)
      is the treatment modality of choice in CBD stones. The most simple treatment techniques
      include biliary sphincterotomy and stone extraction via the use of standard devices such as a
      stone retrieval balloons or stone retrieval baskets. However, patients with difficult bile
      duct stones require advanced maneuvers namely mechanical lithotripsy, large balloon
      sphincteroplasty (LBS) of the major duodenal papilla and single operator
      cholangioscopy-guided lithotripsy (SOC-LL).

      Currently, there are no standardized treatment approaches in the management of CBD stones,
      especially in the management of difficult CBD stones. Therefore, ERCP in patients with
      difficult CBD stones can be inefficient and prolonged with use of multiple devices and
      techniques. In an effort to standardize the management of bile duct stones, we have devised
      an algorithm for the treatment of bile duct stones using current standard of care methods,
      taking into account the size of bile duct stones, size of bile duct and availability of
      endoscopic expertise. The objective of this registry is to evaluate the procedural and
      clinical outcomes in patients undergoing endoscopic treatment of bile duct stones when
      utilizing an algorithmic management approach.
