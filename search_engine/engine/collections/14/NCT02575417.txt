      importance of advance care planning, many feel uncomfortable initiating end-of-life
      conversations with loved ones. Few tools exist that effectively engage caregivers and address
      their particular concerns and needs. The investigators have preliminary data showing that an
      easily implementable intervention (a conversation game) effectively engages healthy
      participants in realistic and satisfying ACP conversations. However, the investigators have
      not yet tested the acceptability or feasibility of using the game in a population of
      caregivers and/or patients with chronic illness. This pilot project will enable us to engage
      community-based patients and caregivers to determine if they find the game a satisfying,
      acceptable, relevant, and effective tool for advance care planning.
