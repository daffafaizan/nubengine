    
      All accrued subjects will be randomized 2:1 to AlloVax™ (CRCL + AlloStim™) immunotherapy vs.
      standard chemotherapy. AlloVax™ is an experimental individualized therapeutic vaccine shown
      to be active in this study population.

      The standard chemotherapy arm (Arm 1) will receive up to six three-week cycles of
      chemotherapy consisting of cisplatin on day 0 of the 3-week cycle at dose 80-100 mg/m2 IV
      followed by 1000 mg/m2 IV flurouracil (5FU) on days 1-4 of the cycle.

      The immunotherapy arm (Arm 2) will receive immunotherapy (AlloVax™) twice a week for 4 weeks
      and then every 4 weeks for an additional 12 weeks.

      The study is designed and powered to determine if AlloVax™ is not inferior to the active
      chemotherapy control.
