      blood loss is between 600 and 1700 mL. The incidence of at least one intraoperative blood
      transfusion is 9 to 67%, and the postoperative transfusion risk is at least 15%. Among
      cystectomy patients who receive transfusion, a median of 2 units of blood cells are given.
      Therefore, it is very important to establish surgical and anesthetic protocols aimed at
      minimizing intraoperative blood loss and subsequent blood transfusion requirements in order
      to improve postoperative outcomes.

      Venous thromboembolism (VTE) in radical cystectomy can account for up to 22% of total deaths
      after surgery . In the bladder cancer literature, symptomatic thromboembolic events occur in
      up to 8.3% of patients , but subclinical deep vein thrombosis (DVT) rates can be as high as
      24.4% when examining an ultrasonography (US)-screened population . In fact, undergoing a RC
      is a significant, independent risk factor on multivariable analysis for developing a deep
      venous thrombosis.

      Lysine analog drugs are synthetic derivatives of the amino acid lysine that reversibly block
      lysine-binding sites on plasminogen molecules. This action prevents the conversion of
      plasminogen to plasmin, the active enzyme that degrades fibrin clots. Therefore, lysine
      analogs decrease the breakdown of clots and are considered anti-fibrinolytics. There are two
      commonly studied lysine analogs, tranexamic acid and epsilon-aminocaproic acid. Both of these
      drugs have been shown to decrease blood loss and blood transfusion need during some surgeries
      without a significant increase in adverse events.
