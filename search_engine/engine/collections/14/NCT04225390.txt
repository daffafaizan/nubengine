    
      PROMIT is a phase 2, single arm, open label study of DTIC followed by combined immune
      checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy or PD-1/PD-L1-blockade monotherapy in adult (≥ 18 years)
      subjects with previously treated, unresectable or metastatic melanoma (Stage III or Stage IV
      melanoma as per the AJCC staging system). Subjects must be BRAF wildtype and must have shown
      primary resistance to ICB. Fresh tumor tissue from an unresectable or metastatic site of
      disease must be available.

      Subjects will be treated with DTIC 850 mg/m² day 1 and 21 i.v. (DTIC phase). Afterwards,
      patients will receive combined ipilimumab (3 mg/kg) and nivolumab (1 mg/kg) 4 times every 3
      weeks i.v. OR nivolumab 240 mg every 2 weeks OR pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks (ICB
      re-exposure phase; EMA-approved dosing scheme). By the end of the ICB phase, response will be
      documented (primary endpoint). A safety follow-up for treatment-related adverse events will
      be performed until 30 days after the last dose of combined ICB. Patients will be followed for
      survival every 12 weeks after the end of the combined ICB phase (second primary endpoint).
      Tumor and blood samples will be assessed over the course of the study to evaluate changes in
      tumor, tumor microenvironment and immune system.
