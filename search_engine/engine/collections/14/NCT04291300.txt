      expressed on prostate cancers cells and other malignancies. Recently, several ligands have
      been developed that target PSMA. Linked to Gallium-68, this enables diagnostic
      68Ga-PSMA-PET/CT scans. Linked to Lutetium-177 enables therapeutic 177Lu-PSMA Radioligand
      therapy. Most research on the diagnostic and therapeutic possibilities of PSMA has been
      conducted in patients with advanced prostate cancer.

      This research group investigates whether these findings also apply to salivary gland cancer
      (SGC), a rare cancer. Previously the investigators conducted a phase II 68Ga-PSMA imaging
      study (NCT03319641), to evaluate PSMA ligand uptake in locally advanced, recurrent and
      metastatic (R/M) ACC and SDC (two subtypes of SGC). A relevant PSMA-ligand uptake was
      observed in 93% of ACC patients and 40% of SDC patients. Therefore we consider 177Lu-PSMA
      radioligand therapy a potential new treatment option for these subtypes of SGC.

      Objective: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of 177Lu-PSMA RLT in patients with R/M ACC and
      SDC with PSMA ligand uptake.

      Study design: Phase II pilot study, single centre, two cohorts.
