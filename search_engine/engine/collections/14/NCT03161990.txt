      Patients who have been revised once for an infected total hip arthroplasty with debridement
      and implant retention and in whom either the transgluteal og posterior operative approach was
      used in both procedures will be selected. The potential participants will be contacted by
      letter. They will be asked for written informed consent and to fill out three questionnaires:
      the Hip Disability Osteoarthritis Score (HOOS), which also allows for the calculation of the
      Western Ontario and McMaster Universities osteoarthritis index (WOMAC), the EQ-5D (quality of
      life) and a questionnaire asking about confirmation that the patient only has been revised
      once for his/her infected arthroplasty, about limping, other complications (nerve injury,
      dislocation, reoperation for other causes than infection), if the infection is considered to
      have been eradicated and overall satisfaction. The data recorded in the Norwegian
      Arthroplasty Register will be used in a multiple linear regression analysis to evaluate if
      the surgical approach is an independent factor influencing the outcome measures.
