      tablet computer. These tablets are linked to an internet-based service platform The project
      main objective is to demonstrate by way of a randomized controlled trial the significance of
      the improvement of residents' QOL achieved by 2 one-hour KODRO sessions per week during 6
      months (KODRO nursing homes) when compared with the usual stimulation activity program
      (nursing homes "controls") (difference for the QOL-AD score > 2 points).At last, the
      objective of the study is also observational, i.e. to determine the quality of life of NHR at
      baseline, in its differents aspects.Subjects & methods Analysis will be conducted to compare
      quantitative parameters at the beginning of the trial to verify the comparability of the two
      groups and of the mean average change between parameters measured at baseline, 3 months, and
      6 months in both groups.
