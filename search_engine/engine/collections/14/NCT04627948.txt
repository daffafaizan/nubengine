      Stockholm3 test in a prostate cancer cohort on AS for upgrading on rebiopsy. Men from the
      study sites, diagnosed with prostate cancer and currently on AS and planned for rebiopsies
      will be invited to the study. Eligible individuals have to be alive without any severe
      comorbidity and without a history of initiating treatment; surgery, radiation, hormone
      therapy or chemotherapy. To avoid the need for additional investigations, sampling will be
      synchronized with timing for planned follow-up within the AS program for each individual.

      At baseline blood will be drawn for Stockholm3 analyses. The patient will be asked to fill
      out an informed consent. For each man the following data will be collected: Stockholm3 Risk
      Score, Stockholm3 Prostate Volume cut-off, total PSA, DRE status, MRI results (PI-RADS,
      optional, only if MRI is conducted within 3 months before biopsy), prostate volume, biopsy
      results (ISUP, cancer length, number of positive cores, total number of cores and stage).

      Main outcome measurement will be number of upgrading, i.e. number of detected ISUP â‰¥ 2
      cancers.
