      in 1976 Edwards and Steptoe reported a tubal ectopic pregnancy after in vitro fertilization
      (IVF) with a day-3 embryo transfer, which may be accepted as the earliest evidence for
      migration of embryos from the cavity. The migration concept is very recently taken into
      consideration by few authors, with studies on fresh IVF and frozen ET cycles.

      Oocyte donation (OD) is a method of ART, in which by using young oocytes from donors the
      embryo quality is optimized. OD cycles have high LBRs, and are the choice of treatment in
      advanced reproductive age, repeated IVF failure, premature ovarian insufficiency(POI) and
      particular heritable genetic diseases. Donor oocytes can be used as fresh or
      cryoprotected-thawed, where fresh oocytes have higher LBRs.

      In the literature, there are no studies performed in fresh OD cycles about air bubble and
      fundus distance after ET, and there are no studies performed whether there is any embryo
      migration after 60 minutes of ET and its effects on CPR and LBR.

      Therefore, the investigators conducted this study to evaluate the impact of embryo distance
      from fundal endometrium, measured 60 minutes after transabdominal USG guided ET, on CPR and
      LBR in fresh OD cycles. In literature, this study is first to focus on embryo migration and
      LBR in fresh OD cycles.
