      Postpartum (EPP) period that are expelled at 6 months postpartum. This prospective,
      multi-site randomized trial will enroll approximately 424 women at three large academic
      hospitals in the United States.

      Women will be recruited who are interested in receiving a levonorgestrel-IUD or a copper-IUD
      after delivery. Postpartum women who desire an IUD will be randomized to EPP IUD insertion
      (between 14-28 days PP) or interval postpartum IUD insertion (42-56 days PP) and the
      proportion of IUDs expelled will be compared between groups at 6 months postpartum. All women
      will be seen in clinic at 6-8 weeks and 6 months postpartum. Women randomized to EPP IUD
      placement will be seen at 2-3 weeks postpartum.

      Provider perspectives of EPP IUD placement will also be evaluated, as will whether these
      attitudes change after 6 to 9 months of providing early postpartum IUDs.
