    
      Background:

      Cluster of differentiation 25 (CD25) is expressed on the malignant cells of patients with
      certain lymphoid malignancies as well as the non-malignant T cells that surround the
      malignant tumor cells of patients with Hodgkin's disease.

      Zenapax is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to CD25.

      Zenapax has been chemically modified by the addition of a chelating molecule to permit
      binding of radioactive yttrium.

      The yttrium labeled Zenapax binds to CD25 to deliver radiation treatment to the tumor.

      Objective:

      To assess the toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of (90)Yttrium-labeled humanized
      anti-Tac((90)Y-HAT) in patients with Tac-expressing hematologic malignancies.

      To determine the sites of localization of radiolabeled Zenapax.

      Eligibility:

      Patients with Hodgkin's disease and other CD25 positive lymphoid malignancies.

      The patient must have a granulocyte of at least 1,200/mm^3 and a platelet count of greater
      than 100,000/mm^3.

      Design:

      Patients will be treated with 10 mCi (if a bone marrow transplant was part of the patient's
      previous therapy) or 15 mCi of yttrium labeled Zenapax.

      Indium labeled Zenapax is given to demonstrate the antibody distribution and confirm
      localization at sites of tumor.

      Treatment is given every six weeks if tolerated and patients will be hospitalized for about
      one week for each treatment.

      Tumor response will be evaluated after every treatment. Stable or responding patients will
      continue treatment with evaluations after every cycle of treatment. Patients will be treated
      for up to seven cycles.
