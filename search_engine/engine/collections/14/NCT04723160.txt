      self-control and superiority test design. In total, 1,500 retinal fundus images from 750
      individuals in need of fundus examination (one image for every single eye) were selected.
      Then a test group, along with a control group was set up in our study. For the test group,
      ophthalmologists read images with the aid of the assistant software(MCS). In contrast, the
      same work in the control group was finished by ophthalmologists independently. Meanwhile, the
      gold standard were obtained from the cooperation of senior ophthalmologists. Diagnoses of
      both groups were compared with those of the gold standard, thus the investigators could
      evaluated the safety and effectiveness of this assistant software in diagnosis.

      The primary endpoint of this study is the superiority of the consistency rate of the test
      group. A diagnosis for an image is consistent if it gives the same negative result as the
      reference standard, or reveals any one condition indicated by the reference standard. The
      consistency rate is the rate of consistent diagnoses for all the involved images. One control
      group is designed, where each doctor reads and diagnoses, and give at most 3 possible
      conditions for each image. In the test group, doctors do the same thing with the help of this
      software. The investigators in the test group and control group are the same and they are
      chosen from ophthalmologists with 1~3 years experience. The reference standard of each fundus
      image is collaboratively given by retinal specialists/fellows from 5 centers. The
      investigator of XieHe center is the arbitrator if full consensus cannot be reached for any
      image during the building of reference standard.
