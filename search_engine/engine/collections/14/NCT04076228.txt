      using anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy for treatment of cancer shows promising in some types of
      cancer, including melanoma, head and neck squamous cell cancer, and lung cancer etc.
      Pembrolizumab is a FDA-approved anti-PD-L1 drug for treatment of advanced stage non-small
      cell lung cancer. In China, it is approved for used in Macau and Hong Kong. Biomarkers
      associated with predictive response includes PD-L1 high expression, high mutational burden,
      and T-cell infiltration based on several clinical trial studies in the western countries.
      However, the response rate is low (around 10-15 %) in patients treated in Macau SAR, China.
      The investigators hypothesize that immunophenotying, molecular analysis and functional
      characterization of CD38 expressing cells and/or other immune populations CD38 will help to
      identify predictive, Progression and resistance markers associated with PDL1 treatment
      response. The investigators will collect the blood samples of Pembrolizumab response and
      non-response Chinese lung cancer patients and compare the imumnophenotypic and molecular
      dynamic changes during treatment courses. The investigators will also examine the role of
      CD38 and other molecular markers associated with Pembrolizumab response, functional
      characterize in vitro. The molecular mechanism controlling Pembrolizumab response will be
      better understood for designing a better treatment strategy.
