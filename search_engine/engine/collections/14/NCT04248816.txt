      incidence rates of HCC have tripled in the US since the 1980s due to the burden of hepatitis
      C virus (HCV) and the epidemic of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The overwhelming
      majority of HCC in the US occurs in the setting of cirrhosis. Early diagnosis of HCC dictates
      survival: The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) recommends
      biannual HCC surveillance for all patients with cirrhosis using an abdominal ultrasound.
      These guidelines seek to maximize early diagnosis of HCC which leads to earlier detection and
      improved survival because early-stage HCC is curable, with 70% 5-year survival compared to 5%
      in advanced disease.

      HCC surveillance rates are suboptimal: Despite longstanding published guidelines for HCC
      surveillance, adherence is low, with surveillance rates ranging from 15-30% in the US. Two
      RCTs have tested interventions to increase HCC surveillance, including electronic reminders
      for primary care providers and mailed reminders (with or without navigators), but neither has
      been scalable, produced durable responses, or increased surveillance rates above 50%.

      This is a 3-arm pilot randomized controlled trial applying behavioral economic approaches
      (opt-out framing and financial incentives) to encourage patients with liver cirrhosis to
      complete regular surveillance ultrasounds which may allow for earlier diagnosis of and better
      outcomes for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
