      response by transcriptomics and the co-infection(s) of all microorganisms. For this, an
      accredited method according to standard 15189 and used in diagnostic routine for the
      exploration of complex infections will be used. In practice, the samples will be
      pre-extracted (chemical, enzymatic and mechanical lysis) then extracted using QiaSymphony
      (Qiagen). The library will be prepared jointly by Nextera XT kit for DNA and Stranded TruSeq
      Total RNA (Illumina) then sequenced by NovaSeq (Illumina). The metagenomic and transcriptomic
      analysis will be performed by our MetaMIC software, supplemented with a specific module
      recently added for the analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genetic variability and its dynamics over time.
      Finally, an unsupervised data-mining analysis will be carried out to establish the presence
      of the "hyperinflammatory" and "immunoparalysis" groups, then allow the analysis of the
      determinants guiding their clustering. Each group will be analyzed according to its clinical,
      biological and virological data to determine specific prognostic markers.

      The proposed project will therefore comprehensively assess the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2
      infection, the inflammatory profile and the microbiological documentation of COVID-19
      patients in ARDS by metagenomics / transcriptomics with the aim of detecting profiles of
      patients at higher risk, to understand the mechanisms of severe forms of the disease and to
      allow a more precise and earlier evaluation of the prognosis, as well as an adaptation of the
      management.
