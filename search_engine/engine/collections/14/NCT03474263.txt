      Patients with rapidly progressive ALS will be assigned to the following dose regimen of IC14:

      â€¢ 4 mg/kg intravenously on Day 1, followed by 2 mg/kg daily x 3 days on Days 2-4. This 4-day
      course will be repeated on Days 8-11.

      Patients will be followed for 28 days after the last dose of study drug. Patients will all
      undergo [11C]-PBR28-MR-PET scans at two time points: before treatment onset and after the
      last treatment cycle.

      Patients will be followed for 28 days after the last dose of study drug for safety.
