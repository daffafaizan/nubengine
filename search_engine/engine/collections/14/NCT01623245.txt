      TTR and improve the care of patients and their families.

      The detection of this disease is important because this disease is fatal and a new treatment
      to prevent the accumulation of TTR is now available (Tafamidis). This drug has proved
      effective in stabilizing neurological damage.

      Depending on the number of patient with cardiac amyloidosis in TTR detected, the prospect
      will begin a clinical trial to test the effectiveness of a new treatment to prevent the
      increase in mass of the left ventricle wall objectified resonance nuclear Magnetic.
