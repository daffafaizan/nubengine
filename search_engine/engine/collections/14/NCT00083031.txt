    
      This study uses an investigational drug called Bevacizumab. Investigational means that this
      drug is not approved by the Federal Drug Administration and is still being studied.
      Bevacizumab is the common name for the commercial drug Avastin. The Bevacizumab used in this
      trial, however, is for use in research studies only and may be made at locations different
      from those where Avastin is made. Although some differences may exist, bevacizumab for
      research use and the commercial drug, Avastin, are manufactured by a similar process, meet
      similar standards for final product testing, and are expected to be very similar in safety
      and effectiveness.

      The purpose of this study is to find out what effects (good and bad) low-dose continuous
      chemotherapy (referred to as metronomic chemotherapy) using drugs Cytoxan (also called
      cyclophosphamide) and methotrexate (CM), with or without bevacizumab.
