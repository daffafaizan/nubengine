      cell transplantation in aplasia after induction therapy for high risk patients with acute
      myeloid leukemia. A rapid analysis of risk-factors (cytogenetics, FLT3 status, clearance of
      blasts after first induction) and the donor situation is of utmost importance. For this "fast
      search" diagnostic, which is accomplished in all enclosed patients, significant resources are
      provided, to take the load off the participating centers. Furthermore, the relevance of
      autologous transplantation and the benefit of additional substances within the postremission
      therapy such as m-AMSA or mitoxantrone will be investigated. There is an up-front
      randomisation in four therapy arms with two cross-classifying factors of two stages
      (intensified vs. standard therapy and Ara C vs. Ara C+ mitoxantrone + m-AMSA). Thus, the
      intergroup treatment schedule of the German Competence Network is integrated into the AML2003
      study as a central element and 25% of the patients are treated accordingly. In the
      intensified therapy arms a risk-adapted and priority-based therapy is implemented, including
      early allogeneic and consolidating autologous stem cell transplantation, respectively. In
      addition to the clinical questions , a detailed concomitant research program was initiated
      for the AML2003 study, to get a better view of the heterogeneity of AML and to open new ways
      for "custom-made" therapies.
