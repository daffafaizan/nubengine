    
      Enteral Feeding Tube (EFT) such as Nasogastric Tube (NGT), Duodenal/Jejunal Tube and
      Gastrostomy Tube are frequently used in Intensive Care Unit (ICU). However, EFT is generally
      an omitted/neglected source of contamination. EFT can serve as a reservoir of Methicillin
      Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA), which multiplies the risk of mortality by 2-2.5
      times, for microorganism transmission. As a consequence of contamination of EFT,
      microorganisms, that may be manifest with the symptoms such as abdominal pain, distention,
      nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, may reproduce and progress to bacteremia, septicemia and even to
      death. In some studies, it is observed that there is a relation between the contamination on
      the external surface of EFT and contamination on the entry of EFT (hub), and it is also
      reported that the rate of contamination on the hub of the EFT and the environment of the
      patient is quite high. ICU nurses are responsible for sustaining safe and secure feeding,
      medication and fluid replacement of patients. Also, they provide enteral feeding products to
      patients as they are prescribed. Personnel training, proper processing procedures and
      developed enteral feeding protocols are shown to decrease the incidence of bacterial
      contamination on the enteral feeding tube
