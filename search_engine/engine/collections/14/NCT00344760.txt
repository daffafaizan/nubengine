      to evaluate the use of Enfuvirtide in an induction/maintenance treatment model. Patients
      meeting inclusion criteria will be stratified into two groups according to HIV-1 RNA viral
      loads (less than 300,000 copies/ml and greater than 300,000 copies/ml). Thereafter, patients
      will be block randomized (the size of each block will be two patients) into one of two
      treatment arms.

      All patients will receive Efavirenz 600mg once a day, Lamivudine 300 mg once a day, and
      Tenofovir 300mg once a day. After randomization, one half of the patients will receive no
      additional treatment, while the other half will receive Enfuvirtide 90mg sq BID until the
      viral load is <50 x 2 consecutive visits or 12 weeks (whichever comes first).
