      willing to participate to the study will have both nasopharyngeal and conjunctival swab for
      SARS-CV-2 genome detection using PCR. The project will evaluate the prevalence of positive
      conjunctival swabs in patients with positive nasopharyngeal swab. These results will be
      corelated to symptoms of disease assessed with a standardized questionnaire.
