    
      Assess toxicity and safety of subcutaneous GM-CSF and iv IL-2 in enhancing
      Dinutuximab-mediated ablation of Bone Marrow (BM) disease in patients with high-risk
      neuroblastoma who have achieved a Complete Response or Very Good Partial Response of the
      macroscopic disease in the investigators institution.

      Assess response of minimal residual disease (MRD) of the anti-GD2 monoclonal antibody
      Dinutuximab combined with granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and IL-2
      in patients with high-risk neuroblastoma (NB). More precisely, to apply real-time
      quantitative RT-PCR to test the hypothesis that minimal residual disease content of BM after
      the first treatments with dinutuximab/GM-CSF has significant prognostic impact on
      relapse-free survival.
