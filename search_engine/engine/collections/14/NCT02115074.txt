    
      Dose escalation scheme only concerns Fluvastatin, and is based on a CRML model (Continual
      Reassessment Method Lilelihood approach). Dose associated with a probability of DLT closest
      to 25% will be considered as Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D).

      Escalation phase :

      Patients will be included by cohort of 2. First patient will be included at the first dose
      level of Fluvastatin (2mg/kg/day). The second patient will be included only after sufficient
      time to assess the absence of DLT on first patient. In absence of DLT during the first 28-day
      cycle, dose escalation will be allowed (4, then 6 and 8 mg/kg/day of Fluvastatin).

      The second and all subsequent patients will be treated at the dose level which DLT
      probability is closest to 25%, without skipping step. Intra-patient dose escalation is not
      allowed. Treatment will be administered until progression, or unacceptable toxicity for one
      year. A minimum of 21 patients will be included during the 1st step, including a minimum of 6
      patients receiving RP2D.

      Expansion phase :

      At RP2D, the number of subjects will be increased to reach a total of 14 evaluable patients,
      in order to better characterize RP2D safety. Patients will be included in the expansion phase
      according CRML model as well, to confirm the recommended dose.

      Probabilities of DLT associated with each dose level will be re-estimated by CRML
      progressively, without the need to suspend inclusions. Results could modify RP2D retained
      during 1st step (dose reduction or a dose re-escalation).
