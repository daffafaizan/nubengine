      the short term beyond 3 months, medium and long term on regular clinical follow-up and ECG
      holters. The patient cohort followed since 2007 allows a very long-term follow-up of patients
      who have benefited from atrial fibrillation cryoablation.

      Isolation of the pulmonary veins by cryoballoon (IVP) has emerged as an alternative to
      radiofrequency in the treatment of drug resistant atrial fibrillation (AF). (1) The potential
      benefits of cryoablation include shorter procedure times, decreased fluoroscopy time, shorter
      hospital duration, a different rate and type of complications compared to radio frequency
      offers potential benefits, including Including shorter procedure times, a decrease in the
      length of hospital stay 1 and a reduction in fluoroscopic time. (2) Effectiveness on a one
      year follow-up in cryoablation for AF is comparable to that of radiofrequency ablation in a
      prospective, randomized study with a lower major complication rate (3,4). The number of
      subjects is limited and most retrospective studies on cryoablation have a limited number of
      patients or an average follow-up not exceeding one year.

      long-term follow-up of the patients of the CHU of Grenoble.
