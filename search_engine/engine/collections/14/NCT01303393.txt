    
      Sample Inclusion criteria are patients over 18 years of age that have gone through a surgery
      for colorectal cancer without having a stoma, and their next of kin with whom they live.

      Instruments In study I, 100 patients filled in four different instruments 1-2 weeks after
      discharge to measure: QOL, information needs, sense of coherence and performance status.

      QLQ-C30 and QLQ-CR38 were used to measure QOL. INFO26 were used to measure received
      information. The SOC - Sense of Coherence was used to measure sense of coherence. And finally
      the scale for ECOG Performance Status was used to measure the level of physical performance
      status.

      In study II the same patients filled in the same instruments a second time, 5-7 week after
      discharge.

      Information about marital status, occupation, diagnosis and prognosis were taken from the
      medical record.

      Interviews In study III 16 patients both filled in the instruments in study I and II, and
      were interviewed to gain a deeper understanding of their information needs. The interviews
      were semi structured and will be analysed with content analysis.

      In study IV the next of kin to patients in study III were interviewed about their own
      information needs in connection to discharge.

      The interviews were performed twice for each person, 1-2 weeks after discharge and a second
      time, 5-7 week after discharge.

      Data sampling The data were collected consecutively, and every third patient living together
      with their next of kin were asked to participate in the interviews.
