      bleeding associated with uterine fibroids in women and many women must resort to surgery for
      relief. The objective of this study is to determine the long-term safety of two asoprisnil
      doses (10 and 25 mg tablets) administered daily to women who received asoprisnil in one of
      the asoprisnil long-term studies (study C03-062 or study M01-391). The safety endpoints for
      this study will include the affects of asoprisnil on the endometrium, ovaries, bone (a subset
      of study M01-391 subjects), lipid profiles, adverse events, and changes from baseline lab
      values and vital signs.

      Some subjects receiving asoprisnil developed endometrial changes. As a result, dosing was
      prematurely discontinued for all subjects. To ensure safety, subjects will remain on study
      and will undergo scheduled study procedures. In most subjects, endometrial changes reversed
      after asoprisnil discontinuation.
