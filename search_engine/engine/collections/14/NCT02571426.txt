      experimental animals undergoing sevoflurane anesthesia. Preliminary data suggest that this is
      not as obvious with propofol anesthesia. The investigators aim to study if this difference is
      present in children.

      Subjects are collected from ordinary routine operations of hypospadia. By routine, all boys
      undergoing this surgery get a sacral blockade and a urine catheter. The children are
      randomized to either sevoflurane or propofol anesthesia. Before or immediately after
      induction of anesthesia baseline blood samples are collected for analysis of sodium,
      potassium, creatinine, osmolality, angiotensin II, arginine-vasopressin and aldosterone.
      Perioperative fluids are started, a balanced glucose infusion with 132mmol sodium content,
      covering basal fluid need + 20%. This infusion is continued until the end of the protocol at
      the ward. At the induction of anesthesia the investigators start measuring urine output every
      20th minute. The same blood samples as above are collected again during mid-operation. At the
      end of anesthesia the investigators collect all the urine and send a sample for urine
      analysis of sodium, potassium, osmolality and creatinine.

      In the postoperative ward the investigators again start collecting urine every 20 minutes for
      120 minutes. All urine after 120 minutes are collected, and a sample sent for analysis. After
      60 minutes at the postoperative ward, blood samples are again collected for analysis.

      In the childrens ward the protocol for the postoperative ward is repeated, with urine
      collection and sample, as well as blood samples. After 120 minutes the protocol ends.
