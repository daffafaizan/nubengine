      physician-based intervention on smoking-cessation rates in Head and Neck cancer adult
      patients. The secondary objective is to assess predictors of long-term smoking cessation in
      such patients.

      After an initial assessment of demographic, clinical and smoking characteristics, the
      patients are randomised (based on a computer randomisation program) in 2 groups:

        -  Group 1 will receive the usual care in Lebanon, which consists of a brief advice to quit
           (10 seconds)

        -  Group 2 will receive a brief (10-15 minutes) standardised smoking cessation counseling
           session peri-operatively (immediately before or after surgery), by an ENT residents,
           based on the 5 "A"'s motivational interviewing model:

        -  Ask (screen for tobacco use)

        -  Advise (provide a personalised and strong quit message)

        -  Assess (evaluate the smoker's willingness and readiness to quit)

        -  Assist (provide cessation counseling, pharmacotherapy, self-help guides)

        -  Arrange (for followup to prevent relapse, and evaluate cessation progress) A
           motivational gadget will be distributed to group 2 patients. They will also be offered
           nicotine replacement therapy (nicotine transdermal patches) for a total of 8 weeks. This
           will be followed by a telephone boost session after 6 weeks.

      The follow-up at 3, 6 and 12 months will be done, for the 2 groups, by a person not
      implicated in either the randomisation or the intervention (single-blind), in person or, if
      impossible, by telephone.
