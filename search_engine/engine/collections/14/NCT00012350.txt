      with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma treated with R115777. II. Determine whether the
      degree of inhibition of FTase activity and farnesylation of lamin-B, H-, K-, and N-RAS in
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells and tumor tissue correlates with tumor response in
      patients treated with this regimen. III. Determine whether the presence of activating RAS
      mutations in myeloma cells predicts treatment response in patients treated with this regimen.
      IV. Correlate R115777 plasma levels and RAS mutation status with tumor response in patients
      treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral R115777 twice daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed
      for at least 30 days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 12-42 patients will be accrued for this study within 25
      months.
