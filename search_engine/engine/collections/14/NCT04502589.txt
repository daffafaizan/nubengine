      day for approximately 8 weeks and have weekly study visits. At these visits, participants
      will be asked questions about their medical history, drinking behavior and life events, have
      bloodwork checked routinely, have regular medication counseling, and perform some computer
      tasks. Throughout the study, there will be regular phone calls from staff. Participants will
      also be asked to use a device called "Soberlink" which is like an at-home breathalyzer test
      to help track progress throughout the study.

      Participants will be randomly assigned (like the flip of a coin) to receive either Perampanel
      alone or Peramanel and Disulfiram.

      Participation in this study will last up to 10 weeks. Approximately 20 individuals will
      participate in this study.

      This study will sequence all or part of participant's DNA. This is a necessary part of the
      study.

      Before starting the study, participants may be referred to an alcohol detoxification program
      (medical treatment of an alcoholic), if clinically indicated.
