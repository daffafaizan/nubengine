    
      The SATBRAD study is a single-centre, prospective, open-label, single-group trial with a
      historical control group of BAD patients treated with single antiplatelet therapy and regular
      statin treatment in Chang Gung Memorial Hospital in Taiwan.

      Eligible participants are as follows:

        1. have a clinical diagnosis of ischemic stroke;

        2. National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of 1-8;

        3. an ischemic lesion on diffuse-weighted imaging located in the middle cerebral
           artery(MCA) perforator, Heubner's artery or vertebrobasilar perforator territories;

        4. BAD, defined by a visible lesion in three or more axial MRI cuts in the MCA perforator
           territory or Heubner's artery territories or infarcts that extended from the basal
           surface of the brainstem.

        5. can receive intensive medical treatment within 24 hours of stroke onset.

      Participants in the intervention group will receive DAPT and high-intensity statin treatment.
      DAPT treatment is administered within 24 hours of stroke onset, with aspirin (300 mg loading
      and 100 mg/day) and clopidogrel (300mg and 75m/day). Participants will take aspirin and
      clopidogrel for 21 days and then keep aspirin or clopidogrel alone. High-intensity statin is
      administered, including atorvastatin 40-80mg or rosuvastatin 20 mg for 3 months.

      A historical control group of patients receiving single oral antiplatelet medication and
      regular statin treatment will be drawn from previous prospective observation studies which
      were executed since Jan. 2011 to Dec. 2020. The total sample sizes are 147 for intervention
      group and 277 for control group.

      The primary endpoint is the composite of END, defined as an increase of â‰§2 points of NIHSS
      within 7 days, and recurrent ischemic stroke within 30 days.
