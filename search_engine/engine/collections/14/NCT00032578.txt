      Primary Hypothesis: It is feasible and cost-effective to create a CSP-wide facility for
      banking genetic tissue in CSP studies.

      Study Abstract: This is a program-wide genetic tissue databank for the Department of Veterans
      Affairs Cooperative Studies Program (CSP). The study has five components: a central
      repository for DNA and other genetic tissue specimens; a Scientific Advisory Committee of
      individuals with expertise in the genetics and epidemiology of diseases with special
      importance to the VA (including cardiovascular, neurologic, respiratory, psychological and
      other disorders); an Ethical Oversight Committee of individuals with expertise in bioethics
      and the law, as they apply to the collection and use of genetic tissue, A Veteran's Advisory
      Group, and a Coordinating Center administers the tissue bank, coordinates the three oversight
      committees, maintains central access to clinical study data linked to the tissue bank, and
      provides statistical analysis.
