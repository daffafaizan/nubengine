      in-depth the language and verbal short-term memory abilities of individuals with aphasia
      (Called the TALSA - Temple Assessment of Language and Short-term memory in Aphasia. Based on
      a test that we have developed and tested over the past decade, we will create a shorter
      version that can be used by clinicians in a rehabilitation setting. The data to support this
      development will come from two sources: (1) clinicians in rehabilitation facilities who will
      use the new clinical test and provide feedback on the test (administration, value etc) and
      (2) people with aphasia who will be administered the longer version to help us identify the
      best test items in the laboratory version of the TALSA to be carried over to the shorter
      clinical version.

      We are recruiting individuals with aphasia as well as people without aphasia (to serve as
      controls) to help with development of this assessment battery. The battery consists of
      between 15 and 20 subtests that assess many aspects of language and verbal short-term memory.
