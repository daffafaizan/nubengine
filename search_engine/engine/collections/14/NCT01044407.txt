      'periodic breathing'. This means that patients have a worse prognosis and they have
      debilitating symptoms including breathlessness, fatigue and disrupted sleep. Many of these
      patients also have cardiac pacemakers fitted, to improve their heart function. We have
      discovered a new physiological mechanism linking the heart and lungs, and have shown that by
      changing the programmed settings of a cardiac pacemakers, we can change a patient's
      breathing. If we increase the programmed pacing heart rate, we increase the rate of delivery
      of carbon dioxide to the lungs temporarily, which increases ventilation. When we reduce the
      programmed pacing heart rate, the converse happens. We aim to demonstrate this phenomenon
      scientifically, and to use this information to stabilise periodic breathing in heart failure
      patients using pacemakers. We then plan to continue to investigate whether we can show that
      sleep quality is improved in heart failure patients with periodic breathing, by our pacing
      protocol.
