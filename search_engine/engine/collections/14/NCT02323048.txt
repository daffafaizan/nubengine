      The first experimental session will consist of a "Pre-test", where baseline data regarding
      attentional, psychophysiological, and self-reported responses tovarious stimuli will be
      collected. The following 4 sessions will consist of a drug (sedative or stimulant) or
      placebo. During these sessions, subjects will play simple computer games, as well as complete
      questionnaires regarding mood and potential subjective drug effects. The subjects will then
      complete a "Test" session, where attentional, psychophysiological, and self-reported
      responses to the stimuli will be assessed, as in the first experimental session.
