      enrolled subjects to create a data repository. The data will be used to further elucidate
      recommendations for PCI of angiographically intermediate lesions (30-90% stenosis) in
      epicardial lesions in women by comparing FFR and iFR findings to findings of inducible
      ischemia on existing non-invasive stress imaging studies. Gender comparisons will also be
      made from archived and published research data sets from studies comprised up to 80% men.
      Data will also be stored long term for use in future undefined analyses.
