      design. 100 patients will be included in the study. The teeth will be randomized into two
      groups according to the dental restorative material.

      Group 1: SDF only ((Riva Star) 2: SDF (Riva Star) +ARR (Equia Forte). The US Public Health
      Service criteria (secondary caries, anatomical form, surface roughness, marginal integrity,
      marginal discoloration and retention) will be used for clinical evaluation of atraumatic
      resin restorations. The restorations will be evaluated at baseline and 1., 6., 12., 18., 24.
      months. Intra-oral photos will be taken directly after treatment and at control appointments
      to evaluate discoloration and seconder caries under magnification.

      The data will be analysed statistically using Fisher's Exact Test; and the Kaplan-Meier and
      Wilcoxon method will be used to estimate survival percentages.
