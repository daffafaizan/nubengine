      remodeling. However, this has not been tested in patients following an acute myocardial
      infarction.

      Acute myocardial infarction is serious condition with increasing incidence across the world.
      Following treatment, a reasonable amount of patients develop remodeling of the left
      ventricle, which is associated with worse prognosis. This occurs despite patients are treated
      with GDMT.

      Dapagliflozin is an SGLT2i with biological plausibility to decrease left ventricular
      remodeling following acute myocardial infarction. In the present study, researchers will test
      the hypothesis that Dapagliflozin will reduce left ventricular remodeling in patients who
      have had a myocardial infarction (less than 7 days). This will be a randomized, single-blind,
      placebo controlled trial. The primary endpoint will be the change in end-diastolic and
      end-systolic left ventricular volumes from baseline to the end of the intervention (6
      months). We will include patients with acute myocardial infarction who have been treated with
      primary PCI.
