      experience in contact lens wear and myopia control treatment will be recruited. They will be
      prescribed with monthly replacement orthokeratology lenses for a period of one year. Axial
      elongation and ocular conditions during the study will be determined. Subjects will be
      randomly assigned to normal cleaning and intensive cleaning groups. Subjects in normal
      cleaning group will be provided with complimentary contact lenses solutions for daily
      cleaning and disinfection. In addition to the daily procedures for lens case, subjects in the
      intensive cleaning group will be required to perform weekly protein removal.
