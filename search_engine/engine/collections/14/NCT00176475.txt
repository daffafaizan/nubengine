      Primary

        -  Determine the toxicity of irradiated HLA-partially matched related donor lymphocytes
           when administered with rituximab in patients with relapsed or refractory CD20-positive
           lymphoproliferative disease.

        -  Determine the efficacy of this regimen in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Correlate response with Fc receptor FcγIIIA polymorphisms or predicted HLA-directed
           natural killer cell reactivity.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.

        -  Rituximab therapy: Patients receive rituximab IV on days -1, 6, 13, and 20. Treatment
           repeats approximately every 4 months in the absence of disease progression or
           unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Donor lymphocyte infusion: Patients receive irradiated donor lymphocytes IV over 1 hour
           on day 0. Treatment repeats every 8-16 weeks (alternating with courses of rituximab
           therapy) for up to 6 donor lymphocyte infusions in the absence of disease progression or
           unacceptable toxicity.

      Peripheral blood is collected periodically during study for correlative laboratory studies.
      Blood samples are analyzed for FcγIIIA polymorphism by fluorescent in situ hybridization or
      by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Survival of donor lymphocytes is assessed
      by chimerism studies.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study.
