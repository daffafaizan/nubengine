      vessel) in type, mainly caused by an intrinsic, non-atheromatous, non-cardioembolic disease
      of the small deep perforating cerebral arterioles. More diffuse cerebral small vessel disease
      also causes up to 45% of dementias (350,000+ patients estimated currently in the UK), either
      alone or in association with Alzheimer's disease. There is no proven treatment for cerebral
      small vessel disease: conventional antiplatelet drugs may be ineffective or even hazardous,
      whilst antihypertensive treatment and statins may not have an effect. The disease mechanism
      is poorly understood but endothelial dysfunction, blood-brain barrier failure and vessel
      stiffness appear to contribute to the pathogenesis. Promising data available for licensed
      drugs with relevant modes of action, cilostazol (>6000 stroke patients in the Asia Pacific
      Region) and isosorbide mononitrate (ISMN, widely used in cardiac disease) support their
      testing in cerebral small vessel disease. This trial will be an Phase IIb preparatory to
      Phase III, randomised, partial factorial, open label, blinded end-point trial, testing
      cilostazol, ISMN, both, or neither, to assess the feasibility of recruitment, drug
      tolerability, trial procedures, safety and event rates in 400 patients recruited in UK stroke
      centres and followed-up to one year (primary endpoint). This trial is preparatory to a large,
      definitive, Phase III randomised controlled trial to prevent recurrent lacunar stroke and
      progressive small vessel disease-related physical and cognitive impairments after lacunar
      stroke.
