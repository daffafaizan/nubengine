      different 810 nm diode laser technologies for the purpose of permanent hair reduction to
      determine the effectiveness and subject's tolerance for hair reduction. Twenty volunteers
      will be enrolled into this study. Subjects will receive a total of 5 treatments of either
      axilla or lower legs. 10 patients will have both axilla treated while the other 10 subjects
      will have the lower legs treated. Placement to the axilla treatment group vs. the lower leg
      treatment group is random.

      Treatment areas will be randomized to receive Soprano SHR treatment or Light Sheer/Duet
      treatment. One extremity (example: right axilla) will receive Soprano SHR treatment and the
      contra-lateral extremity (example: left axilla) will receive Duet treatment. The treatments
      will occur every 6 - 8 weeks and then there will be follow up visits at 1 month, 6 months,
      and 12 months after the last treatment.
