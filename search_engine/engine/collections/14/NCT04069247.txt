      Currently, researchers have done considerable work to investigate whether eCBT-I could be
      effective in improving psychological well-being for adults, and previous studies have
      confirmed that eCBT-I is effective in reducing depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation in
      adult population.

      However, such studies have not been established in youths yet. Additionally, it is still
      unclear that by which mechanisms eCBT-I might affect mental health, and whether eCBT-I could
      reduce the risk of depression and suicide.

      This study will be the first specifically designed investigation of the preventive effects of
      eCBT-I for depression and suicide in youths, and the first large scale causal test of the
      relationship between insomnia treatments and psychiatric disorders. The results can be
      expected to influence care provision for the youth population who are at a life stage of
      emerging adulthood and vulnerable to psychiatric disorders. Further, because the
      investigators will be using an eCBT-I approach, a scalable solution may be demonstrated as
      both feasible and effective. The findings of this study will show the possibility of
      developing novel preventive intervention for depression and suicide by targeting insomnia.
