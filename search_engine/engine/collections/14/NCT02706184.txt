      is an effective way of treatment. Besides the desired effects on neoplastic cells, the
      cytotoxic effects often lead to undesirable effects in other cells. Particularly the
      epithelial tissue of the gastrointestinal tract is affected, mucositis and diarrhea occur. By
      loss of water and electrolytes, diarrhea often make delay in chemotherapy necessary. Besides
      mucositis, a chemotherapy also causes changes in gut microbiota as animal models proof. It is
      well known, than probiotics shorten diarrhea. So far, the use of probiotics in chemotherapy
      patients was only investigated in one single study. Severity of diarrhea was reduced compared
      to placebo. Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) is a well investigated probiotic. In cell
      culture, the supernatant of EcN reduced the noxious effect of 5-Fluoruracil concerning cell
      toxicity and disruption of barrier function.

      Therefore, the aim of this study is whether in patients with gastric or colorectal cancers,
      where a treatment with 5-Fluoruracil in combination with other chemotherapeutic remedies
      (FLO, FOLFOX, FOLFOX-Bev, FOLFIRI) is planned, EcN-Suspension is capable to reduce duration
      and intensity of chemotherapy induced diarrhea.
