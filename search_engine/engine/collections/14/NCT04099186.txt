      affected pulmonary arteries with thrombolysis or embolectomy; to decrease right ventricular
      afterload and reverse right ventricular failure and shock, prevent chronic thromboembolic
      pulmonary hypertension , and decrease the recurrence risk.

      The first-line treatment in patients with acute high risk pulmonary embolism presenting with
      persistent hypotension and/or cardiogenic shock is intravenous thrombolytic therapy. However
      a significant proportion of patients may not be a candidate for Intravenous thrombolysis
      because of major contraindications. An alternative option in patients with absolute
      contraindications or has failed intravenous thrombolysis is surgical embolectomy , but the
      number of experienced tertiary care centers that can do emergency surgical embolectomy are
      limited.

      Percutaneous catheter mechanical fragmentation of proximal pulmonary arterial clots followed
      by injection of 200 ml saline at high pressure using power injector can be used as an
      alternative to intravenous thrombolytic therapy and surgical embolectomy because of their
      ability to rapidly recanalize occluded pulmonary blood flow.
