      and remifentanil. Remifentanil was administered via target-controlled infusion and anesthetic
      depth was maintained keeping the BIS between 40 and 60. Patients were randomized into one of
      three groups depending on intraoperative doses of remifentanil and naloxone: effect-site
      concentrations of remifentanil 1 ng/ml (control group), 4 ng/ml (remifentanil group), and 4
      ng/ml combined with infusion rate 0.8 ng/kg/min of naloxone (remifentanil and naloxone
      group). Postoperative mechanical pain thresholds, pain intensity, and analgesic consumption
      were examined during 48 h of postoperative period. The primary outcome was mechanical pain
      threshold measured on the peri-incisional area 24 h after surgery.
