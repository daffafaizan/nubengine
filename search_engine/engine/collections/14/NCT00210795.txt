      level, or low red cell count). Anemia occurs commonly with aging and is a frequent medical
      condition in individuals over the age of 65. Physical performance and function is generally
      worse in individuals who are anemic. This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      multi-center study to assess physical function (to include falls) and fatigue in
      approximately 80 elderly patients with chronic anemia (anemia present for at least 3 months)
      and who are receiving weekly PROCRIT. The study will also evaluate hemoglobin levels (oxygen
      carrying protein in red blood cells), safety, fatigue and cognitive function. The study
      hypothesis is to demonstrate the study drug will be more effective in treatment of chronic
      anemia than placebo, resulting in the improvement of physical function and subsequent
      disabilities, generally well-tolerated. The patients will receive weekly injections of
      Epoetin alfa (PROCRITÂ®) or placebo at a starting dose of 10,000 units administered
      subcutaneously (under the skin).
