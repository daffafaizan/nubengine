      disease. It is important to diagnose and treat high blood pressure to reduce risk of these
      complications. Getting blood pressure checked only when someone sees a doctor is not the best
      way to diagnose high blood pressure or to make sure blood pressure is well managed. Checking
      blood pressure at home gives a better idea of whether someone's blood pressure is normal or
      too high.

      As part of their usual blood pressure monitoring, participants will be given an Omron 3
      series or 5 series blood pressure monitor which has been cleared by the US Food and Drug
      Administration and validated to meet accuracy and performance requirements. For one month,
      participants will monitor their blood pressure once a day and then return the device to the
      clinic at the end of the study. Participants will text their blood pressure result to the
      American Heart Association's Check, Change, Control (CCC) secure online tracker.

      As part of the research study, participants will also be randomized to either receive or not
      receive weekly check-in phone calls from a pharmacist to review their blood pressures and the
      number of times they tested in that week. Approximately 50 individuals will participate in
      this study. Participation in this study will last 1 month.
