      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety
      and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works
      in treating a specific disease. "Investigational" means that the intervention is being
      studied. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved liposomal irinotecan
      for your specific disease but it has been approved for other uses. The FDA has approved
      FOLFOX, carboplatin, and paclitaxel as treatment options for this disease.
