    
      This is a prospective, single center, Phase II biologic effects study of recombinant
      interleukin-11 (rhIL-11, Neumega) in subjects hemophilia A, moderate or mild; or with Von
      Willebrand disease unable to take desmopressin acetate (DDAVP) because they are unresponsive,
      allergic, or DDAVP is contraindicated. The purpose of the study is to establish the biologic
      efficacy and safety of rhIL-11 in those not able to take DDAVP. Study subjects will include
      adults, age >= 18 years, with hemophilia A, moderate, defined as factor VIII 0.01-0.04 U/ml,
      or mild, defined as factor VIII >= 0.05 U/ml; or with VWD defined by low VWF:RCo and /or low
      VWF:Ag, past bleeding history, and/or family history of VWD. A total of 10-16 subjects will
      be enrolled in order to assure that 10 complete the study. The specific aims of the study
      are: 1) to determine the biologic effect of rhIL-11 when given 4 consecutive days; 2) to
      determine the safety of rhIL-11 when used in subjects with hemophilia A, moderate or mild; or
      with VWD unresponsive or unable to take DDAVP; and 3) to determine the mechanism of the
      hemostatic effects of rhIL-11. The biologic efficacy outcomes will be measured by VWD-related
      coagulation tests (VWF:RCo, FVIII:C, VWF:Ag, closure times) before and after rhIL-11
      injection. Safety outcomes will be measured by the number and frequency of adverse events,
      including fever, headache, fatigue, myalgias, arthralgias, fluid retention, or edema. The
      mechanism of rhIL-11 hemostatic effect will be measured by VWFmRNA before and after rhIL-11
      response. Response to DDAVP following rhIL-11 will also be assessed in those in whom DDAVP is
      not contraindicated. The study will last up to 1 month per subject, and for 24 months for the
      entire study.
