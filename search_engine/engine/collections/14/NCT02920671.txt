      some individuals but not others is poorly understood. Mitochondrial impairment, particularly
      in skeletal muscle with its high energy requirement, has been implicated in the pathogenesis
      of obesity-related insulin resistance. In addition, individuals with genetic disorders
      affecting mitochondrial function are at increased risk of diabetes. The proposed studies will
      investigate the association between skeletal muscle oxidative phosphorylation capacity
      (OXPHOS), which is a dimension of mitochondrial function, and glucose and lipid homeostasis
      in (i) individuals with genetic disorders of muscle mitochondrial function as compared to
      (ii) non-obese adults and (iii) otherwise healthy obese adults.

      During a single 2-day, 1-night study visit, investigators will use innovative, non-invasive
      magnetic resonance imaging-based methods of estimating skeletal muscle oxidative
      phosphorylation capacity, including post-exercise chemical exchange saturation transfer
      (CrCEST) recovery and 31-Phosphorus (31P) magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and muscle
      lipid content, including 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and 3-point Dixon
      techniques, in conjunction with a tracer-enhanced oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT*) to
      measure overall insulin sensitivity and the selective effect of insulin on glucose disposal
      (Rd). The percentage suppression of endogenous glucose production by the oral glucose load (%
      suppression of Ra of endogenous glucose) will also be assessed. Infusion of a glycerol tracer
      permits assessment of lipolysis in both the fasting state, and also after the oral glucose
      load, such that the percentage suppression of lipolysis by the oral glucose load can also be
      calculated (% suppression of Ra of glycerol). In addition, the insulin and c-peptide minimal
      models will also be used to model pancreatic Î²-cell responsiveness to the oral glucose load
      and hepatic insulin extraction.
