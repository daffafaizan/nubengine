    
      A prospective randomized controlled trial will be performed on up to 150 subjects who will
      undergo a tendoachilles lengthening, Strayer's procedure, epiphysiodesis of the femur or
      femoral osteotomy metal work removal.

      Subjects will be randomized into two groups: the first group will have an anesthetic pain
      pump device supplemented with oral analgesia and the second group will only receive oral
      analgesia. The anesthetic continuous device will be used continuously for 48 hours and with a
      flow rate of 2ml/hour of 0.25% bupivacaine diluted in accordance to patient weight. Subjects
      in both groups will receive oral analgesia according to their pain requirements. The amount
      of oral analgesia used will be documented over 12-hour intervals in a patient diary over a 4
      day period. Subjects will have their pain score assessed daily with the use of the
      Non-Communicating Children's Pain Checklist-Postoperative Version. Their overall satisfaction
      with post-operative pain management will be assessed at the end of the study with the use of
      the Parent Total Quality Pain Management questionnaire.
