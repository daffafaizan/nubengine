      drug resistant Parkinson's disease, responsible to dopaminergic therapy, to the state of
      complication. The efficacy of this therapeutic approach has transformed the functional
      prognosis of these patients. Unfortunately, those of the patients presenting with
      contraindications for anaesthesia or electrode implantation are excluded of these therapeutic
      hope.

      Gamma Knife radiosurgery is a neurosurgical procedure going to operate in the brain of the
      patients without opening the skull without infection or bleeding risk.

      Gamma Knife radiosurgical treatment will be done in two separate times (GK1 and GK2).
      Treatment of the second side (GK2) will be done at least 12 months after the treatment of the
      first side (GK1), in the same methodology as the first treatment. The major risk of onset of
      acute ballism although low is planned to be managed by the standard protocol by the
      recruiting team involved in the trial.
