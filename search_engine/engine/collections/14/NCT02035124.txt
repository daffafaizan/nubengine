      administering BKM120 with a standard dose of cabazitaxel will be assessed. If safety is
      confirmed, a subsequent Phase II portion will assess the activity of the combination in
      patients with mCRPC previously treated with docetaxel. The treatment will consist of 3-week
      (21-day) cycles.

      The ultimate purpose of this study will be to determine progression-free survival, response
      rate, disease control rate and overall survival of patients treated with the combination
      regimen and compare outcomes to historical results with single-agent cabazitaxel.
