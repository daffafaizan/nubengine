      beneficial effect on health has prompted the question of whether there are empirical measures
      of improvement that do not rely solely on subjective reports. The present study proposes to
      explore whether transcranial stimulation (or cranial electrotherapy stimulation; CES) using
      an FDA-approved device can alter brain function, mood and responses to cognitive tasks.
