      study, is based on the observation that antigen-encoding DNA plasmids can induce both
      cellular and humoral immune responses against various viral and bacterial pathogens. DNA
      vaccines are perceived as having a number of potential advantages over other types of
      vaccines. For example, DNA vaccines are easily constructed by recombinant technology; easily
      and inexpensively manufactured as a well-characterized molecule [DNA plasmid]; and at boost,
      not eliminated by prior immune response to the carrier or vector. Furthermore, as nonliving
      vaccines, they cannot lead to infection. The object of DNA vaccination is to deliver DNA into
      the nuclei of cells capable of presenting the encoded antigen to immune reactive cells that
      can elicit an immune response.

      The study will enroll 6 randomized groups of 12 subjects each, for a total of 72 subjects.
      This approach will ensure at least 60 subjects complete all vaccinations at around 10
      subjects per group, taking possible attrition into account. Subjects will receive one dose of
      vaccine on each of Days 0, 28, and 56 either intramuscularly or intradermally by
      electroporation and will be followed until Day 220.
