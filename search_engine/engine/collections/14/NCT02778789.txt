      emerged as highly effective cytokine blocking strategies in the treatment of rheumatoid
      arthritis (RA) in the last years. Both, inhibition of TNF-α (TNFi) and of the interleukin-6
      receptor by tocilizumab ameliorate the signs and symptoms, reverse the elevated acute phase
      response and inhibit the progression of bone erosion in RA patients (1). Despite striking
      similarities with respect to their efficacy and safety in the treatment of RA, TNFi and
      tocilizumab are two entirely distinct approaches for targeting chronic inflammatory diseases
      in humans. This concept is highlighted by the differential response to TNFi and tocilizumab
      in other chronic inflammatory diseases such as psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and
      spondyloarthritis, with clinical efficacy of the former but not the latter treatment modality
      (2). On the other hand, tocilizumab has a direct effect on the acute phase response and iron
      metabolism, which is not found with TNFi. Therefore, subtle differences may exist between
      TNFi and tocilizumab, which are relevant for the long-term treatment of RA patients.
