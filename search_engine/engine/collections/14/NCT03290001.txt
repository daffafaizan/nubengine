      (RT) and chemotherapy are the mainstays of therapy for NPC because these tumors are
      biologically highly radiosensitive and chemosensitive. Anxiety and depression symptoms were
      common psychological symptoms around the time of cancer diagnosis and were often persistent
      during cancer treatment. Psychological symptoms are associated with prolonged hospital stays,
      lower quality of life, and worse treatment adherence among patients with cancer. Depressive
      symptoms have been demonstrated to predict early mortality among patients with some kinds of
      cancer. But among NPC patients, the influence of anxiety and depression symptoms to long term
      survival have not be explored. Therefore, this prospective, observational cohort study aimed
      to explore the influence of anxiety and depression to long term survival in NPC patients.
