      multifactorial, and destructive. Progression and severity of the disease depend on
      interacting risk factors such as: immunological, microbiological, environmental, and genetic
      factors, as well as age, sex, and race.Some patients are genetically predisposed to AgP; they
      have immunological abnormalities, which are thought to be under genetic control. However,
      high susceptibility for periodontal destruction and the relationship between inflammatory
      changes, and genetic factors remain unclear.

      Gene expression profiling is a powerful means of generating comprehensive genome-level data
      sets on diseases such as cancer, asthma, rheumatoid disorders and periodontitis, and provides
      significant insight information for these diseases. Gene expression profiling may provide an
      evidence for involving genes in the pathogenesis of AgP and generate further information
      other than clinical signs and symptoms of AgP.

      The aim of this study was to identify gene-expression patterns of patients with generalized
      aggressive periodontitis by whole-transcriptome gene-expression analyses.
