      compared to self-help materials plus prize contingency management (CM) for smoking abstinence
      in substance abuse treatment patients and (2) examine the effects of smoking abstinence on
      substance use and substance treatment retention. To address these specific aims, cigarette
      smokers entering treatment for alcohol, cocaine or heroin abuse or dependence, who report
      daily smoking (at least one cigarette per day) for the past year, and who meet other
      inclusion and exclusion criteria, are randomly assigned to receive self-help materials or
      self-help materials plus CM. Individuals in the CM group have the opportunity to win prizes,
      worth on average $1, $20, or $100, when they meet smoking abstinence criteria (CO < 8ppm and
      salivary cotinine < 10ng/mL). Participants meet with research staff 4 times/week during Weeks
      1-4, 2 times/week during Weeks 5-8 and 1 time/week during Weeks 9-12. Follow-up interviews
      are scheduled 1, 3 and 6 months following the smoking quit date.
