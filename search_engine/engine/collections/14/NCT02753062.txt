      predominant subtype. However, none of the trials have been performed for the specific
      population of DLBCL type monomorphic PTLD. The investigators will select Patients with
      proven, measurable monomorphic PTLD of DLBCL after solid organ transplantation (e.g. heart,
      lung, liver or kidney etc.). Patients having PTLD with or without Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)
      association, positive for CD20 monomorphic DLBCL type. The B-R treatment will continue up to
      6 cycles with interval of 21 days. Patients will receive 375 mg/m2 on day 1 and bendamustine
      120 mg/m2 by intravenous infusion on day 2 and 3 in the first cycle. From the 2nd to 6th
      cycle, rituximab will be administered subcutaneously at a fixed dose of 1400 mg and
      bendamustine 120 mg/m2 by intravenous infusion on day 1 following administration of rituximab
      and day 2. On the first day of infusion of bendamustine in each cycle, palonosetron 0.25 mg
      will be given as a single intravenous injection about 30 minutes before infusion of
      bendamustine. Pegfilgrastim 6 mg will be administered as a single subcutaneous injection
      between 24 to 48 hours after completion of chemotherapy at each cycle. Based on relatively
      good safety profile and efficacy of bendamustine and rituximab (BR regimen), the
      investigators will investigate a feasibility of BR regimen in this immunocompromised patients
      with DLBCL type monomorphic PTLD.
