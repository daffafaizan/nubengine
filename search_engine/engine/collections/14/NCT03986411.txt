    
      Aims: The investigator's overall purpose is to conduct an RCT to determine whether one to one
      physiotherapy can improve the symptoms of urinary incontinence (UI) in a group of athletic
      women. This feasibility study will enable us to ascertain the viability of conducting a
      definitive appropriately powered trial.

      Research protocol: The research design is a mixed methods study with three distinct but
      related phases.

      Phase 1: 6-8 local health care professionals (GPs, nurses and physiotherapists) will be
      recruited for interview to explore current management practices of urinary incontinence (UI)
      in primary care.

      Phase 2: 15-20 sporting or athletic women who self- report symptoms of UI will be recruited
      from the local sporting community. Each will undergo individual subjective and objective
      assessments in order to establish history, symptoms and pelvic floor muscle function. The
      intervention will be then be tailored from these assessments and agreed between each
      individual and the specialist physiotherapist. It will include guided exercise within the
      clinic and a regular home exercise plan, in keeping with typical pelvic health regimes for
      pelvic floor muscle (PFM) dysfunction.

      Phase 3: 6-8 participants from phase 2 will be invited to take part in a qualitative
      interview in order to gain more in-depth understanding of UI. Purposeful selection will
      account for age, sporting activity and severity of symptoms. The interviews will be to
      explore the effects of UI on their quality of life, their participation in sport and exercise
      and the acceptability of the intervention.

      Measurable end points: 6 months from recruitment of the last participant in phase 2 will be
      considered to be the end point of the study.
