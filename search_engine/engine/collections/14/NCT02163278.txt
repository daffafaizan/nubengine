    
      This study represents the administration of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) inhibitor DBPR108
      to humans to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic
      (PD) properties following multiple oral doses in healthy subjects.

      DPP4 is a validated drug target for the treatment of human type 2 diabetes. Objectives of the
      study will be to assess the safety and tolerability, PKs and PDs of DBPR108 at steady state
      after administration of multiple oral doses to healthy male subjects.
