      Transplantation at the University Hospital of Munich will be included in this study.
      Intravenous Meropenem will be administered as perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis for lung
      transplantation. Interstitial Lung Fluid and Epithelial Lining Fluid will be extracted
      immediately after explantation of the lung from explanted lung tissue. Concentrations of
      antibiotics will be determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in ILF
      and ELF. Serum samples will be collected according to our in clinical routine established
      therapeutic drug monitoring. Tissue/Serum concentration ratio will be calculated. ELF will be
      collected on postoperative day 1-5 when bronchoscopy is performed during clinical routine.
      Numerous clinical and laboratory parameters will be determined. The investigators expect that
      correlations between antibiotic target site and blood concentrations and clinical and
      laboratory parameters will be found.
