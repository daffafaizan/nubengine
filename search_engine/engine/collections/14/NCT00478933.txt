    
      Evaluate the positive predictive value of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the genes
      GNB3, GNAS and GNAQ as predictors of ventricular arrhythmia <400 msec.

        1. Evaluate the positive predictive value of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms as predictor
           for death, cardiac death and atrial fibrillation/flutter in the genes GNB3, GNAS, GNAQ
           and other SNPs involving signal transduction components which impact on the activity of
           cardiac ion channels.

        2. Evaluate the best combination of genetic parameters, baseline data and follow-up data as
           predictor of primary endpoint, All cause Mortality, cardiac death and atrial arrhythmia.

        3. Evaluate the usage of ICD-system diagnostics (battery status, impedance, pacing
           threshold, sensing) resulting in medical consequences*.

        4. Evaluate the usage of ICD-based patient diagnostics (arrhythmia, IEGM, heart frequency,
           %pacing, Cardiac Compass) resulting in medical consequences*.

        5. Evaluate the frequency of programming changes involving AF-prevention and AF-therapy
           algorithms.

        6. Evaluate the frequency of pacing-parameter programming changes and the resulting medical
           consequences*.

             -  Medical consequences include: Hospitalization, medical interventions, medication,
                surgery, additional diagnostics and ICD-programming changes.
