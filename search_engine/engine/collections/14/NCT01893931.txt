    
      Procedures: All patients age 65 and above will be randomized to one of two groups within 1-3
      days after discharge from the UNC ED: 1) Interventional follow-up phone call; or 2) Placebo
      phone call, implementing only a satisfaction survey.

      The intervention phone call will ask whether patients have obtained the newly prescribed
      medicines, ask if the patient understands the instructions for taking the medicines and
      inquire if a patient has made an appointment with his/her personal physician. The caller will
      attempt to answer questions about the medicines, and encourage patients to take the medicines
      as directed. The caller will also encourage the patients to follow-up with their own
      physician in a timely manner and offer to help with setting up follow up appointments if
      needed.

      Subsequently, 30-35 days after ED discharge, all patients will receive a phone call to
      evaluate rates of compliance with medicines and scheduling follow-up appointments. All calls
      will be made by trained nurses.

      Using an α 0.05 and β 0.80 we will need to enroll 2235 patients to detect a decrease in ED
      return visits/re-admission/ death of 6%. There will be one interim analysis 1 year into the
      two year planned study.
