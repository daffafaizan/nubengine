      several days. The current standard treatment for severe acidosis during OLT is NaHCO3,
      although it may compromise myocardial performance, exacerbate lactic acid accumulation and
      cause central nervous system demyelination. Surgical procedure is a primary source of
      endogenous lactic acid production, especially visceral ischemia originating from anhepatic
      stage. The present study thus hypothesized that GIK solution may improve metabolic acidosis
      in OLT patients through its unique effects of metabolic alleviation. Patients for orthotopic
      liver transplantation was enrolled and received either GIK or placebo. GIK or placebo
      infusion started after anesthesia induction. Intraoperative measures were mean arterial
      pressure, HR, arterial blood gases, lactate, glucose, Na, liver and renal function indexes.
      Outcome measures were time to tracheal extubation, intensive care unit, length of stay,
      complications, hospital length of stay, requirement for postoperative plasma transfusion,
      retransplantation, and perioperative mortality.
