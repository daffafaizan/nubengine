      Specific Aim #1: Human-centered development of an English/Spanish smoking cessation web app.
      The investigators will develop iterative versions of a digital smoking cessation tool (a web
      app with text messaging components) that is highly responsive to the needs and preferences of
      low-income English- and Spanish-speaking smokers. Development will take place with systematic
      input from patients who are part of the San Francisco Health Network (SFHN). The SFHN serves
      70,000 members, most of whom are low-income individuals.

      Specific Aim #2: Improvement of dissemination strategies. Input from SFHN patients will
      identify effective ways of reaching and encouraging low-income English- and Spanish-speaking
      smokers to use the digital smoking cessation interventions to be developed. This information
      will support ongoing dissemination and implementation efforts beyond the grant period.

      Specific Aim #3: Evaluation of resulting smoking cessation web app. Researchers will evaluate
      the effectiveness of the successive versions of the resulting stop smoking web app by
      recruiting smokers at two levels: a) within the SFHN, and b) throughout the state of
      California, culminating with an online randomized controlled trial. Increased effectiveness
      will be defined as 1) increased utilization of the web app and 2) higher abstinence rates
      than those obtained by a baseline "usual care" web app.
