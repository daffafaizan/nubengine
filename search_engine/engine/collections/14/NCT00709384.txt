      right atriotomy (surgical dissection plus cryoablation) and the atriotomy with the inferior
      caval vein (cryoablation alone) to prevent atrial flutter on 15 consecutive adult patients
      undergoing surgery for congenital heart disease. Conduction times between electrodes placed
      on both sides of the lesions are measured on the second postoperative day. Coronary
      angiography and electrophysiology study using an electroanatomic mapping system to assess
      conduction across the line and to try to induce atrial flutter are performed three month
      after the operation.
