      measured by RVM(Respiratory Volume Monitor) compared to the one-time respiratory volume
      measured by mechanical ventilation in post-operative ICU patients.

      In addition, the investigators investigated the decrease in respiratory volume in opioid
      infusion after ventilator weaning in this patient, and to measure the one-time respiratory
      volume change by RVM during deep breathing induction using Inspirometry exercise.
