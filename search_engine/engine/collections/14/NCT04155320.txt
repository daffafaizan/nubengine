        -  Option 1 (Self-tell): Participant is encouraged to disclose his HIV+ status to his
           partner(s) and given information about sites where his partner(s) can receive free HIV
           testing.

        -  Option 2 (Tell together): Participant discloses his HIV+ status to his partners with a
           counselor (project staff) present. Counselor refers the partner to HIV testing,
           including a study-affiliated HIV testing site.

        -  Option 3 (Provider referral): Project staff (nurse or peer educator) will notify the
           partner anonymously - without identifying the participant (index patient). Partners are
           offered immediate HIV testing in their home or at a study-affiliated HIV testing site.
