      a specialized class of neurons, the photoreceptors. Currently available systems for retinal
      imaging in humans do not allow neuronal imaging at the cellular level, which is crucial to
      understand, diagnose and monitor retinal diseases. In recent years, adaptive optics (AO)
      fundus imaging has proven its capability to image individual photoreceptor cells in the human
      retina. This technology is now reaching technical maturation. A prototypic AO system
      (manufactured by Imagine Eyes) is currently in operation in a clinical setting (Clinical
      Investigation Center 503) and has proven its reliability to monitor single photoreceptors
      over time. Yet, the clinical evaluation of AO imaging is still in its infancy, and biomarkers
      issued from AO imaging have not been validated. The goal of the iPhot project is thus to
      optimize the process of AO imaging (from the implementation of novel technical solution to
      image processing and data analysis) in order to obtain morphological, quantitative and
      longitudinal information concerning retinal microstructures in humans. For instance, we will
      aim at detecting early photoreceptor damage during retinal dystrophies.
