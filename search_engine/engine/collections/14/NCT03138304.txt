      Accordingly, professional organizations, state authorities, and the federal government have
      endorsed the systematic triage and transfer of these patients to trauma centers either
      directly from the field or after evaluation at a non-trauma center. Nonetheless, between 30
      to 40% of patients with moderate-to-severe injuries still only receive treatment at
      non-trauma centers, so-called under-triage. Most of this under-triage occurs because of
      physician decisions (rather than first-responder decisions). Existing efforts to change
      physician decision making focus primarily on knowledge of clinical practice guidelines and
      attitudes towards the guidelines. These strategies ignores the growing consensus that
      decision making reflects both knowledge as well as intuitive judgments (heuristics).
      Heuristics, mental short cuts based on pattern recognition, drive the majority of decision
      making. The investigators developed an adventure video game (Night Shift) to serve as a novel
      method of recalibrating physician heuristics in trauma triage and compared its efficacy with
      a standard educational program. This study is designed to measure the degradation of the
      treatment effect.
