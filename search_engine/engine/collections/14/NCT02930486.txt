      common treatment is with a syndesmotic screw through the fibula and tibia which is later
      removed, usually after 10-12 weeks. The ZipTight suture endobutton (Biomet) is used for the
      same indication. It does not need removal and thus avoids subsequent surgery. This trial will
      compare these two methods and see if they are equal.

      patients 18-70 years presenting to one of the three hospitals with and acute syndesmotic
      injury are eligible for inclusion. 120 patients are randomized to two treatment groups. One
      group will be treated with a ZipTight suture endobutton fixation and the other receives a
      tricortical screw fixation. Neither suture endobutton or screw is routinely removed. Follow
      up intervals are at 6 weeks, 6, 12 and 24 months with clinical and-points. Standardized CT
      scans are taken postoperatively and at 12 and 24 months.
