      postmenopausal growth-hormone (GH) secretion and; (b) systemic vis-Ã -vis CNS actions of
      endogenous estrogen differentially control the outflow of somatotropic hormones (viz., GH,
      IGF-I, IGFBP-1).

      Approach: contrast regulation of the GH axis in postmenopausal women pretreated with the
      CNS-excluded selective estrogen-receptor antagonist, fulvestrant, versus placebo.

      Background: fulvestrant was released recently by the FDA for therapy of estrogen-sensitive
      postmenopausal breast cancer. The drug acts as a mechanistically novel inhibitor of
      estradiol-receptor dimerization, thereby depleting nuclear estrogen receptors. Fulvestrant
      does not gain access to the CNS. Thus, inhibition of estrogen action will be restricted to
      non hypothalamic sites of GH-axis control, such as the pituitary gland, liver and fat cells.
      In contrast, endogenous estrogens have access to both CNS and peripheral sites.

      Premise: selective blockade of peripheral estradiol receptors will reduce GH secretion if
      endogenous estrogens maintain GH secretion via systemic effects.
