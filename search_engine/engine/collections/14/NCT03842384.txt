      overdose rising by 90% from 2011 to 2016. Medication-assisted treatment (MAT), the use of
      pharmacotherapy in combination with behavioral therapies, is associated with significant
      reductions in illicit opioid use. Buprenorphine, a partial opioid agonist, is one
      pharmacological option for MAT that is growing in popularity because of its more flexible
      administration through office-based programs. Despite its many advantages, nearly half of
      participants are unsuccessful in achieving buprenorphine stabilization. Distress tolerance
      (DT), defined as the perceived or actual ability to handle aversive physical or emotional
      states, is a transdiagnostic vulnerability factor implicated in the development and
      maintenance of substance use. Targeting DT during substance use treatment may improve
      outcomes by promoting the ability to persist in goal directed activity (e.g., abstinence)
      even when experiencing physical or emotional distress. Personalized feedback interventions
      (PFI) represent a promising method to effectively motivate engagement in and adherence to
      buprenorphine treatment. These interventions are generally brief, individually tailored, and
      have the potential to be delivered via mobile platforms (e.g., computers, text message).
      Specific aims of this research study include (1) the development, through formative
      evaluation, of an interactive computer- and text message-delivered PFI, that incorporates DT
      skills training, for persons actively seeking outpatient MAT (PFI-DT); and (2) pilot testing
      the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of PFI-DT for increasing motivation,
      abstinence, adherence, and retention to treatment compared to treatment as usual.
