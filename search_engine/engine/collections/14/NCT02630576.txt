      neuro-stimulation, and assessment of the ability to acquire muscle action potentials and
      record these evoked responses on the SD-card. The study will be performed on healthy
      volunteers - 10 male and 10 female. Testing will be done at two separate
      stimulation/recording sites: ulnar nerve stimulation/abductor digiti minimi (ADM) muscle
      recording; and ulnar nerve stimulation/adductor pollices (AP) muscle recording. The side of
      testing (RIGHT vs. LEFT hand) will be determined a priori and randomly by the principal
      investigator, such that 10 volunteers each will be tested on the RIGHT and 10 on the LEFT
      hands. At each stimulating/recording site two stimulation protocols (single twitch
      stimulation and train-of-four stimulation) will be performed with growing current intensity
      (10-60 mA (milliAmps), in a 10 mA step-up fashion). Volunteers will rate the tolerability of
      each stimulation protocols on a visual analogue scale. EMG data will be recorded on the SD
      card and evaluated off-line.
