      Postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) are the second most common surgical complication
      and adversely influence surgical morbidity. Postoperative respiratory failure (PRF) is one of
      the most serious pulmonary complication.

      Two hypotheses can be forward by the literature. First, a low VT lung protective ventilation
      in combination with a strategy aimed at minimizing alveolar distension by using low PEEP
      level (and without recruitment maneuver) could improve postoperative outcome while reducing
      the risk of hemodynamic alterations or, second, could increase the risk of PRF compared with
      a strategy aimed at increasing alveolar recruitment using higher PEEP level adjusted
      according to driving pressure in combination with recruitment maneuvers in adult patients
      undergoing emergency abdominal surgery. Given the uncertainties, and in order to determine
      the impact of lung protective ventilation strategies on clinical outcomes of high-risk
      surgical patients, a randomized trial is needed.

      Our primary hypothesis is that, during low VT ventilation, a strategy aimed at increasing
      alveolar recruitment by using high PEEP levels adjusted according to driving pressure in
      combination with recruitment maneuvers could be more effective at reducing PRF and mortality
      after emergency abdominal surgery than a strategy aimed at minimizing alveolar distension by
      using lower PEEP without recruitment maneuver.

      Given the number of patients for whom the question applies, the prevalence and the burden of
      PPCs, the study can have significant clinical importance and public health implications.
