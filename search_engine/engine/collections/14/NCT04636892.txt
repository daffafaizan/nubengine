      wearable infrasonic sensor to detect the mechanical, electrical, and hemodynamic function of
      the cardiovascular system. 25 patients with cardiovascular disease will undergo a
      comprehensive echocardiogram, electrocardiogram, and cardiac catheterization while wearing a
      infrasonic earbud device. The infrasonic and hemodynamic waveforms will be analyzed using
      machine learning with the goal of correlating infrasound data captured by the earbud to the
      patient's cardiovascular hemodynamics.
