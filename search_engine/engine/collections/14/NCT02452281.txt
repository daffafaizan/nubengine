    
      This is a randomized, open label, single-center, phase I-II trial to determine the safety,
      feasibility and immunogenicity of combination treatment of HSPPC-96 and ipilimumab in
      patients with therapeutically unresectable Stage III or Stage IV malignant melanoma.

      The main purpose of this study is to assess whether the administration of the combination of
      ipilimumab and HSPPC-96 is safe. The rationale for combining the two treatments resides in
      their respective roles on the immune system as described below and based on the clinical
      experience collected so far. HSPPC-96 is able to initiate a tumor specific immune response
      that ipilimumab could theoretically amplify by blocking a checkpoint that naturally
      down-regulates T cells.
