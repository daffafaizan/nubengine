        1. Reduce the rate of ventilator-associated events

        2. Improve the compliance with NASAM bundle elements

        3. Reduce the mortality of mechanically ventilated patients

      The plan of this quality improvement project is to extend the implementation to a total of
      100 ICUs in collaboration with multiple health systems across the country. A significant
      component of this project includes measuring the safety culture of ICUs.
