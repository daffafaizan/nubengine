    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To discover whether two administrations of 2.5 mg tetanus (Tet)-CMV
      peptide co-injected with 1 mg of PF-03512676 (tetanus-CMV fusion peptide vaccine), by
      subcutaneous (SC) route on days 28 and 56 post-hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) are
      safe and well tolerated in human leukocyte antigen (HLA) A*0201 CMV-positive recipients of
      allogeneic HCT.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To measure levels of CMV-specific T cells in vaccinated compared to unvaccinated HCT
      recipients (control arm).

      II. To assess whether vaccination of HCT recipients with Tet-CMV co-injected with PF03512676
      reduces expression of programmed death 1 (PD-1) on CMV-specific T cells.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive Tet-CMV + PF03512675 SC on days 28 and 56 post-HCT.

      ARM II: Patients undergo immune monitoring only.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at days 70, 84, 100, 130, 160,
      and 180.
