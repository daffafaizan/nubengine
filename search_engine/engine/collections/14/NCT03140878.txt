      criteria/complete questionnaire/give information about the study and receive consent. At
      visit 2 and 3 the included individuals will drink a placebo blend or a drink containing
      Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGGÂ®) and they will subsequently be biopsied from the upper
      intestine during endoscopy while under nurse administered propofol sedation (NAPS). There
      will be four weeks between visit 2 and 3.

      At visit 2 and 3, biopsies will be taken from duodenum and jejunum, and luminal fluids will
      be collected, and one blood sample will be collected.

      The down stream analysis will include a combination of gene expression analysis, microbiome
      analysis and classification of the individuals based on analysis of blood samples.
