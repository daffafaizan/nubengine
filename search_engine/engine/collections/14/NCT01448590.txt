      epidural or spinal anesthesia, resulting from needle puncture of the dura layer of the
      meninges. This puncture can be deliberate (during spinal anesthesia) or accidental (during
      epidural anesthesia). Dural punctures allow a leak of cerebrospinal fluid, leading to the
      characteristic syndrome of PDPH; also known as a spinal headache or low-pressure headache.
      Accidental dural punctures occur with approximately 1.5% of all epidural attempts. Studies
      have estimated that, within the obstetrical population, headaches resulting from an
      inadvertent dural puncture are as high as 50% to 75%.

      As the risk of accidental dural punctures (ADP) cannot be eliminated, research has focused on
      possible interventions that may be taken in order to avoid the onset of a PDPH, eliminate its
      severity, or treat effects. One of the most common and effective treatments being an epidural
      blood patch (EBP). More recently, threading the epidural catheter directly into the
      intrathecal space after the dural puncture has been recognized as a viable option.
