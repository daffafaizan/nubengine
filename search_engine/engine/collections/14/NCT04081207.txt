      their pre-stroke language capacity as possible.Typically, usual care is a non-standardized
      therapy that is tailored to the specific needs of the person with aphasia.Once a person
      reaches a plateau in language recovery, AAC is implemented with a focus on circumventing, or
      compensating for the communication challenges associated with aphasia.

      The ability of people with aphasia to (1) recover language function well-into the chronic
      phase of stroke recovery and (2) self-cue to promote word retrieval during anomic events
      offer the solution for how AAC could be employed as a dual-purpose tool to augment language
      recovery and compensate for deficits. This approach, however, this requires a shift in how
      AAC is implemented. With the goal of language recovery, treatment needs to focus on
      instructing people with aphasia how to use AAC as a mechanism for self-cueing, rather than as
      a tool to replace speaking. Based on our pilot data, we hypothesize that this novel method to
      AAC implementation will promote language recovery by coupling the canonical language and
      visual processing neural networks.

      This work will also contribute to our ability to identify, a priori, who will respond to this
      particular AAC intervention and who will not, by combining neuroimaging with behavioral and
      clinical data. This has the potential to reduce the cost of healthcare for stroke recovery by
      implementing the most effective treatment possible. Importantly, when we identify
      non-responders, this will allow us to construct a profile and identify features of the AAC
      treatment that require adjustment to meet their unique needs.
