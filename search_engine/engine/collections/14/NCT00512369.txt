      individual gene silencing in mammalian cells is a robust method that is well-described and
      validated in mammalian cell culture systems. We will apply this technique to achieve
      post-transcriptional "silencing" of PAI-1 in monocytes obtained from otherwise healthy
      volunteers, and study the subsequent loss of this gene's function on the migratory capacity
      of these cells in the proposed in vitro experimental system. This concept has not yet been
      demonstrated in the literature, and if validated, would be a novel and fundamental
      description of the role of PAI-1 in human monocyte biology as related to the development of
      atherosclerosis.
