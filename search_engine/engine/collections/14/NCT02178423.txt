      allows for exact examination of the relevant anatomy in order to visualize the target vessel,
      so as to facilitate the puncture in real-time. However, to ascertain the correct position of
      the central venous catheter (CVC), a chest X-ray is still the gold standard. The main
      disadvantage of the X-ray is the children's exposure to radiation. That's why the
      investigators intend to perform this study whether the ultrasound is as sufficient as the
      chest X-ray to verify the correct position of a central venous catheter in children.
