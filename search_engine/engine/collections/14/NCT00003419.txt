        -  Determine the efficacy of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in treating
           patients with HIV-related stage I-III nonaggressive epidemic Kaposi's sarcoma.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive therapy consisting of nucleoside analogues (RTI) and protease
      inhibitors (PI). Patients may receive either 2 RTIs or 2 RTIs plus 2 PIs. Treatment continues
      for 12 weeks, then progression is assessed.

      Patients with stable or regressing Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) with a viral load of greater than
      500 copies of RNA/mL may continue with the therapy (if the viral load has decreased by
      greater than 2 logs) or may modify therapy (if the viral load has decreased less than 2
      logs). Patients with progressive disease may begin chemotherapy but continue to receive the
      antiretroviral therapy. Treatment continues for at least 48 weeks.

      Patients are followed every 8 weeks until week 48.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: This study will accrue a total of 14-25 patients.
