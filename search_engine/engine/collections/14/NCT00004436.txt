    
      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, placebo-controlled study. Patients are stratified
      according to gender and by position of the lesion (periorbital vs nonperiorbital).

      All patients receive oral prednisone daily for 3 weeks. Patients are then randomized to
      receive either placebo or leuprolide IM every 3 weeks, while continuing oral prednisone.
      Tumors are assessed at 1, 3, and 6 weeks. If the tumor is not responding, the leuprolide will
      be administered every 2 weeks. Tumors are reassessed at 3 and 6 months, at which point the
      treatment is stopped. Responding patients are observed every 3 weeks for 3 months. If the
      tumor begins to grow again, leuprolide may be administered for another 3 months. Patients
      whose tumors grow rapidly during treatment may crossover to the alternate therapy, repeat the
      leuprolide or prednisone therapy, or undergo surgical excision.
