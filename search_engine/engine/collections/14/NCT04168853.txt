    
      Eighty elective male patients undergoing CABG were selected using one or two internal
      thoracic arteries under CPB with a roller pump (RP group) or centrifugal pump (CFP group).
      ITA samples were collected before starting CPB (Time 1) and before the last coronary
      anastomosis during aortic cross clamping (Time 2). Terminal complement complex activation
      (SC5b-9) and neutrophil activation (elastase) analysis were performed on arterial blood at
      the same times.
