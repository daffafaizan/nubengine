      glaucoma or ocular hypertension requiring hypotensive ocular treatment. Up to 100 subjects
      will be enrolled in the study to ensure a minimum of 80 completing three IOP fluctuation
      monitoring sessions. Patients will be considered enrolled in the study upon signature of
      informed consent. A screening visit and three 26-hour IOP fluctuation monitoring sessions are
      planned for each patient. IOP monitoring sessions will be carried out in ambulatory mode at 4
      week intervals (plus/minus 7 days). All subjects will be monitored during the same period of
      the day (Â± 1hr). The expected duration of participation for each patient is of 3.5 days over
      three to four months. Patients will be recruited over a 16-month period. The total expected
      study duration is 16 months.
