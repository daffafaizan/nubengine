      picture of pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE), an inherited autosomal recessive disease. A
      substantial proportion of vitamin K, namely the K2 form (menaquinones), is produced by gut
      microbiota. In healthy volunteers fecal levels of the major menaquinone producers,
      Escherichia coli and Bacteroides species, are approximately 5 and 9 log10 CFU/g dry weight
      respectively. There is however a lack of data on gut microbiota in PXE patients. The
      objective of our project is to demonstrate a potential association between gut microbiota
      composition, plasma levels of various forms of vitamin K and severity of clinical
      manifestations in PXE patients.

      This study will be performed as Research surrounding bio collection "Clinical and biological
      exploration of PXE patients" kept at the Center of Biological Resources of Angers University
      Hospital (bio collection n° DC 20116-14-67, authorization to transfer n° 2016-27-99). Fecal
      samples, plasma samples and clinical data will be collected from patients diagnosed with PXE
      who will be monitored at the Angers University Hospital Referral Center (France) in
      2019-2020. Clinical severity of PXE will be assessed using modified Phenodex score. Gut
      microbiota will be analyzed using metagenomic sequencing. Plasma Vitamin K species and fecal
      excretion of menaquinones will be assessed using HPLC. Plasma dp-ucMGP (circulating biomarker
      of vitamin K status) and serum PIVKA-II (protein induced by vitamin K absence-II) will be
      assessed using immunoassay. Results will be compared to healthy age- and gender-matched
      controls from the pre-existing Biofortis database.
