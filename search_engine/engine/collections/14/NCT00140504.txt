    
      -  A drug safety module called MedCheck was developed for PatientSite. This allows
           physicians to query patients automatically 10 days after they receive a new prescription
           asking them questions about their new prescription. In this study new enhancements will
           be tested.

        -  Participants will be assigned at random to the intervention group or control group. The
           intervention group will receive a single electronic PatientSite message asking them
           questions about the new prescription which is then forwarded to their physician. The
           control group will receive a generic message about medication safety.

        -  To identify adverse drug events, a telephone survey and medical record review will be
           conducted of patients in the intervention group and controls.

        -  This study will run for 12 months.
