      various diseases are accumulated in recent years. Characterization of methylation changes
      that occur in cancer may contribute to the development of methods for early detection of
      cancer by detecting cancer cells in liquids. Early detection of such changes and their
      correlation examining different cancers may lead to a diagnostic tool for the early detection
      of cancers and improve the treatment of these patients. Detection by molecular analysis can
      be a sensitive method and non-invasive early diagnosis of the disease In this study the
      investigators will collect Blood,sputum and saliva samples for Characterization of
      Methylation Patterns in lung Cancer.
