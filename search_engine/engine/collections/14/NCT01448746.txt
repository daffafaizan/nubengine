    
      Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is common and often fatal complication in patients with cancer.

      Gastric cancer is the most frequent cancer in Korea.

      The incidence of VTE would be increased in patients with gastric cancer, especially
      associated surgery.

      However, the incidence and optimal prophylactic method associated with cancer surgery are not
      well studied in Asian patients.

      Most Korean surgeon concerns regarding the increased postoperative bleeding associated with
      low molecular weight heparin(LMWH)prophylaxis.

      The incidence and adverse event will be examined to define the optimal prophylactic method of
      VTE in surgical patients with gastric cancer.
