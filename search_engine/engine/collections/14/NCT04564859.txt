      Cannula or Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation in the prevention of extubation failure.

      These review all have similar results summarized here:

      Compared with Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation, Heated Humidified High-Flow Nasal
      Cannula provides better patient comfort, fewer oxygen desaturation episodes, lower likelihood
      of interface displacement, and, lower reintubation rate than Noninvasive positive pressure
      ventilation.

      However, most of these clinical trials focused on participants experiencing acute respiratory
      failure.

      Investigators of this study want to find something difference between oh these two groups.
