      adherence to national prevention guidelines among family members of patients hospitalized
      with CVD. Participants were blood relatives or cohabitants of patients hospitalized with
      atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, aged 20-79 years, did not have established
      cardiovascular disease or diabetes, and spoke English or Spanish. Participants randomized to
      a special intervention group received behavioral counseling and education on diet and
      physical activity; personalized risk factor screening and immediate feedback; and
      reinforcement and follow-up throughout the year. The control group received a brief CVD
      prevention message in the form of a handout. All participants received standardized
      assessments of diet, lifestyle, and CVD risk factors at baseline and 1 year (94% follow-up).
      The main findings have been published showing the mean percent change in LDL-cholesterol
      level from baseline to 1-year improved in both groups and was not significantly different in
      the special intervention vs. control group (-1% vs. -2%; p=.64).
