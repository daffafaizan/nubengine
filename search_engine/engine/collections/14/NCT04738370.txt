      improve the diagnosis and management of women with a pregnancy of unknown location (PUL) and
      ectopic pregnancy (EP). There is potential for this to be achieved by the incorporation of a
      statistical model that uses one or more novel markers identified by this study.

      Recruitment-1000 patients. Inclusion: Patients attending the Early Pregnancy Unit (EPU) in
      the first trimester with a PUL or ectopic pregnancy on trans-vaginal ultrasound scan between
      the ages of 18-50 years. Exclusion: Patients diagnosed with cancer, presence of acute medical
      condition, patients aged less than 18 years, patients who cannot give fully informed study
      consent.

      Consent - Posters will advertise the study. Patients in EPU will be invited to the study by a
      member of the clinical care team. Written consent will be required.

      Confidentiality - The Chief Investigator will preserve the confidentiality of participants
      taking part in the study and is registered under the Data Protection Act. Patient consent
      forms will be stored securely within the study file. All patient identifiable information,
      where required, will be stored electronically on National Health Service (NHS) approved
      computers, accessible only by personnel involved in the study via password.

      Conflict of interest - None involved in the study have a conflict of interest. Dissemination
      of results - No patient identifiable information will be included in the research report or
      publication. Anonymised results will be disseminated to scientific community by means of
      publication in peer-reviewed literature and presented at national and international meetings.
