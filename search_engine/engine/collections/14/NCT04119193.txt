      application used with a smartphone and the values measured by reference method, which is the
      radial arterial line

      Patients admitted to the post-anesthesia care unit after major surgeries (Erasme hospital)

      Patient's arterial pressure will be measured with both measurement methods (novel smartphone
      application and the invasive arterial line).

      The placement of an arterial line is standard of care in the investigators institution for
      patients scheduled for major surgeries. These patients spend 24 hours in the post-anesthesia
      care unit after their surgery for acute care management. Patient's blood pressure will be
      measured in parallel (same arm) with the mobile application and with the reference equipment
      (radial arterial line). Measures will be done during five times ( so five times one minute of
      recordings).

      Blood pressure values obtained by the two methods will be compared to confirm the reliability
      of the data obtained with the mobile application.
