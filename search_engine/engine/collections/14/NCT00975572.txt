      of febrile respiratory illnesses in Mexico and the United States. It rapidly spread to many
      countries around the world, prompting the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare a
      pandemic on June 11, 2009. Data from several cohorts in different age groups that received
      licensed trivalent seasonal influenza vaccines suggest that these vaccines are unlikely to
      provide protection against the new virus. In addition, adults are more likely to have
      measurable levels of serum hemagglutination inhibition assay (HAI) or neutralizing antibody
      than are children. These data indicate the need to develop vaccines against the new H1N1
      strain and suggest that different vaccine strategies (e.g., number of doses, need for
      adjuvant) may be appropriate for persons in different age groups. The primary safety
      objective of this study is to assess the safety of split- virion inactivated H1N1 vaccine
      with and without adjuvant when administered at the 7.5,15 or 30 mcg dose. The primary
      immunogenicity objective is to assess the antibody response following each dose of split-
      virion inactivated A(H1N1) vaccine with and without adjuvant,. Participants will include up
      to 2200 healthy persons age 3 and older who have no history of novel influenza H1N1 2009
      infection or novel influenza H1N1 2009 vaccination. This is a randomized, double-blinded,
      Phase II study in healthy males and non-pregnant females, aged 3 years and older. This study
      is designed to investigate the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of an inactivated
      influenza H1N1 virus vaccine at different dose levels of split- virion inactivated H1N1
      vaccine with or without adjuvant or placebo in 4 aged groups. Subjects will be stratified by
      elders (equal to or more than 61 years), adults (18-60 years), adolescents (12-17 years) and
      children (3-11 years), elders and adolescents will be randomized into 5 dose
      groups(adjuvanted H1N1 vaccine of 7.5,15 or 30 mcg per dose or non-adjuvanted H1N1 vaccine of
      15 or 30 mcg per dose ) , children will be randomized into 4 dose groups(adjuvanted H1N1
      vaccine of 7.5 or 15 mcg per dose or non-adjuvanted H1N1 vaccine of 15 or 30 mcg per dose ),
      adults will be randomized into 6 dose groups(adjuvanted H1N1 vaccine of 7.5,15 or 30 mcg per
      dose or non-adjuvanted H1N1 vaccine of 15 or 30 mcg per dose or placebo ), 110 subjects per
      dose and age stratum will be to receive intramuscular influenza H1N1 vaccine . The H1N1
      vaccine will be administered at Day 0 and Day 21. Following immunization, safety will be
      measured by assessment of adverse events through 21 days following the last vaccination (Day
      42 for those receiving both doses), serious adverse events and new-onset chronic medical
      conditions through 6 months post the final vaccination (Day 180 after second vaccination),
      and reactogenicity to the vaccine for 8 days (Day 0-7) following each vaccination.
      Immunogenicity testing will be HAI on serum obtained on the day 21 of each vaccination (prior
      to vaccination), on Day 21 after first vaccination, and 21 days following the second
      vaccination (Day 42).
