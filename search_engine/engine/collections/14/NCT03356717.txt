      limited by the imbalance between the growing number of students and the human resources
      available in such a way that all residents cannot play a role during scenarios. This leads to
      a new situation in which not all residents can be an active participant in scenarios with
      some remaining observers all along the simulation sessions. Based on Kolb experiential
      theory, this situation should lead to a decreased knowledge acquisition. Previous studies
      have however provided controversial results but overall no significant differences in
      learning outcomes can be demonstrated between observers and participants engaged as players
      in scenarios.

      Moreover, preliminary data suggest that learning outcomes of observers might be improved by
      using an observer tool during the scenario. However, no high-quality study has yet shown if
      this assumption is verified.

      In the present study, after informed consent will be obtained, 3rd-4th year residents in
      anesthesia will be randomized before high fidelity scenarios to act as observers only or
      active participants in some scenarios and observers in others.

      The main outcome parameter will be the learning outcomes by comparing data obtained before
      and after the sessions by using questionnaires specifically dedicated to the knowledge of
      technical skills in the management of crisis scenarios. In addition, self-efficacy of the
      simulation sessions will be explored through the responses to additional questionnaires
      evaluating the change in non-technical skills after the sessions.
