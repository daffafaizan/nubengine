      with metastatic, hormone-refractory, symptomatic prostate cancer. II. Determine the
      contribution of this treatment on control of pain in these patients. III. Determine the
      toxicity of this regimen in these patients. IV. Determine the objective response and
      biological observations in these patients after this treatment. V. Determine the effect of
      this regimen on survival of these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to one of two
      treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive methylprednisolone IV weekly for 3 months. Arm II:
      Patients receive methylprednisolone IV and doxorubicin IV weekly for 3 months. Quality of
      life is assessed before treatment, every 4 weeks during treatment, and then every 3 months.
      Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 160 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.
