      offers several advantages over oxytocin and ergometrine, the drugs currently used to treat
      PPH. For example, misoprostol is stable at high temperatures and has a shelf life of several
      years, it is easy to administer, it can be given to hypertensive patients, and it is
      inexpensive. This randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial will test whether
      misoprostol is as effective as oxytocin in treating primary PPH in hospital births, both when
      women have received prophylactic uterotonics in the third stage of labor and when they have
      not.

      Blood loss will be measured for all consenting women who deliver vaginally. If PPH occurs and
      uterine atony is the suspected cause, women will be randomized to receive either: a) four 200
      µg pills of misoprostol sublingually and an IV of saline (resembling oxytocin) or b) four
      placebo tablets resembling misoprostol sublingually and 40 IU oxytocin by IV. This study
      seeks to answer the following questions:

        -  Is misoprostol as effective as oxytocin for treatment of primary PPH for women who do
           and do not receive oxytocin prophylaxis in the third stage of labor?

        -  Does misoprostol have an acceptable safety profile when given as an 800 µg sublingual
           dose to treat PPH?

        -  Is the side effect profile of misoprostol acceptable to women?

      This study will take place in hospitals located in Burkina Faso, Ecuador, Egypt, Turkey, and
      Vietnam.
