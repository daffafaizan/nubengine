    
      Retrospective (from 2010 to 2019), multicentre, observational study carried out in the French
      national M3C network (complex CHD expert centers).

      Patients with a prenatal diagnosis of isolated right aortic arch will be included. Patients
      with a right aortic arch associated with any CHD will be excluded, as well as patients whose
      parents refuse the use of medical data of their child.

      The following data will be collected:

      Clinical data:

        -  Functional signs of tracheal or esophageal compression in the first year of life.

        -  Association with a genetic syndrome.

      Echocardiographic data:

        -  Prenatal: anatomical description of the aorta and supra-aortic trunks. Position of the
           ductus arteriosus, presence of a thymus.

        -  Postnatal: confirmation of the right aortic arch, absence of conotruncal CHD, closure of
           the ductus arteriosus.

      If performing a chest CT scan in the first year of life:

        -  Reason: systematic or on symptoms,

        -  Age of realization,

        -  Anatomical analysis of the aortic arches,

        -  Concordance with antenatal diagnosis,

        -  Evaluation of the degree of tracheal compression,

        -  Screening for a vascular complication.

      If performing an ante- or post-natal genetic sampling:

        -  Type of sampling if antenatal: amniocentesis or trophoblast biopsy,

        -  Type of analysis: karyotype, FISH, CGH array,

        -  Molecular diagnosis.

      If performing a surgery during the first year of life:

        -  Indication: prophylactic or symptomatic,

        -  Type of intervention,

        -  Age at the intervention
