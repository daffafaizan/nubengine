    
      Patients who have had a thyroidectomy for cancer routinely have a Tc-99m Pertechnetate
      (GPERT) scan at the Cross Cancer Institute to check for thyroid tissue remnants prior to
      radioactive iodine therapy. The first 10 subjects will receive a CPERT whole body scan, and
      and 20 subsequent case-matched controls (2 for each CPERT subject, matched for age and
      gender) will receive a GPERT whole body scan. CPERT safety will be assessed by pre-injection
      and post-imaging collection of vital signs and blood samples (haematology and biochemistry).
      Adverse event collection will be done for both CPERT and GPERT subjects. The whole body
      biodistribution pattern of CPERT will be qualitatively compared to GPERT by two independent
      and blinded Nuclear Medicine physicians.
