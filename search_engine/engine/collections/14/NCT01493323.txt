      prevention strategies, a better understanding of the physiopathology of SB is needed.
      According to a "stress vulnerability" model, people who make a suicide attempt when they are
      subject to a stress factor (environmental stress, interpersonal difficulties, depression,
      tobacco, substance abuse...) are those who have a specific vulnerability. Vulnerability
      factors to SB may be considered in clinical terms (propensity to hopelessness, aggressive
      impulsivity traits), neurobiological terms (serotoninergic system disorder, especially in the
      ventral prefrontal cortex-vPFC) and cognitive terms (decision making, cognitive functions
      mediated by the vPFC and the serotoninergic system). Finally, genetic factors seem also
      involved in suicide vulnerability. The investigators have conducted a preliminary study which
      suggests that increased perception of psychic pain during a major depressive disorder
      increases suicidal ideation and suicidal act. Study about anatomic basis of psychic pain and
      its triggers represents a relevant theme to understand the suicidal process. Among the
      classical factors triggering psychic pain and suicidal act, events of social exclusion
      appears to be crucial. Finally, many data suggests the close relationship between physic and
      psychic pain.
