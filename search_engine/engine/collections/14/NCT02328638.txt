      approach to treat obesity in 16 children (age 3 to 10 years) with autism spectrum disorder
      (ASD). This 16-week program integrates behavioral psychology and nutrition science to meet
      the challenges of obesity in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The PI will apply
      an evidence-based behavioral intervention to increase food variety,15 use applied behavior
      analytic strategies to teach physical activities in a developmentally-appropriate manner,
      employ biometrics to assess progress, utilize dietetic interventions to improve nutritional
      balance, and train caregivers to use behavior management strategies.
