    
      Patients well established and stable on a standard or peptide enteral tube feed will be
      changed to a low calorie paediatric formula for a period of seven days. This group will act
      as their own controls. Each child will receive for a period of seven days the paediatric
      formula.

      The dietitian will determine the feeding regimen on an individual basis and the enteral
      formula will be provided via a feeding tube. A baseline questionnaire will be completed by
      the dietitian to ensure eligibility of study, current stool patterns or symptoms and weight
      at the start of the study.

      The parents will complete a week intake chart to monitor how much feed has been consumed each
      day and a tolerance diary to review gastrointestinal symptoms at the start and end of the
      study.
