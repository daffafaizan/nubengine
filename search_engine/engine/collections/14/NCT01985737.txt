      healthcare-associated infections (HAI),which are associated with significant mortality,
      morbidity and healthcare costs. Neonates are at higher risk for CLABSIs than children or
      adults and CLABSIs are seen more commonly in neonatal than pediatric or adult intensive care
      units. Neonates, who develop CLABSIs, are not only at serious risk for mortality but also
      long term neurodevelopmental impairment. CLABSIs are often caused by organisms colonizing the
      skin and the most frequently isolated organisms are CONS, S. aureus and Candida.

      The catheter biofilm microbiome, to our knowledge has not been investigated before.
      Evaluation of biofilm microbial signatures and microbial DNA load is a novel strategy that
      may permit earlier diagnosis of CLABSIs. Earlier detection may enable earlier targeted
      therapy such as antimicrobial lock solutions and may facilitate preservation of catheters in
      this vulnerable population. Catheter microbial DNA signatures or load may be useful
      biomarkers to not only predict or diagnose infections but to monitor antibiotic therapy and
      to confirm resolution of infection.

      We will study 15 percutaneously inserted central catheters (PICC) each from neonates with
      CLABSIs and those without. We will evaluate the bacterial microbiome by profiling V3-5 region
      of the 16S rDNA, by PCR and pyrosequencing. We will correlate the catheter biofilm microbiome
      with catheter tip cultures and the skin microbiome at the catheter entry site. We aim to
      identify microbial signatures that predispose to dissemination of infection from catheter
      biofilms leading to CLABSIs. Further, we will quantify microbial DNA load in blood from the
      catheters at the time of removal, by real-time PCR of the bacterial 16S rDNA.
