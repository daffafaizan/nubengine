    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary:

      To assess the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of the single-dose and multi-dose of
      CPGJ602 administered by intravenous infusion.

      Secondary:

      To assess the immunogenicity and anti-tumor activity of CPGJ602, compare the pharmacokinetics
      and immunogenicity between CPGJ602 and the active comparator, cetuximab, and to provide
      scientific basis for the subsequent phase 2/3 clinical trials.

      OUTLINE:

      This is an open-label, parallel designed study in patients with at least one prior chemical
      regimen failed metastatic colorectal cancer. The study can be divided into 3 parts:

      Part 1: Single-dose Part

        -  Arm A: CPGJ602, IV over 2 hours, 100 mg/m2 X 1;

        -  Arm B: CPGJ602, IV over 2 hours, 400 mg/m2 X 1;

        -  Arm C: Cetuximab, IV over 2 hours, 400 mg/m2 X 1.

      Part 2: Multi-dose Part

      The subjects from arm A in Part 1 will be randomized into arm B or C.

        -  Arm B: CPGJ602, IV, QW, 400 mg/m2 X 1, over 2 hours, followed by 250mg/m2 X4, over 1
           hour for each time;

        -  Arm C: Cetuximab, IV, QW, 400 mg/m2 X 1, over 2 hours, followed by 250mg/m2 X4, over 1
           hour for each time. The completion of Day 63 Visit (the visit on the 7th day after the
           5th dose in Part 2) can be considered as the completion of the study.

      Part 3 (Follow-up Part)

      CPGJ602, IV over 1 hour, QW, 250mg/m2, until the patient's death or the withdrawal decision
      of the patient and/or investigator.
