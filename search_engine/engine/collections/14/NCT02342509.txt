      consent 63 ASA I-III patients undergoing elective hip or knee replacement surgery under
      general anesthesia were included. Patients were randomly organized into 3 groups (20-22
      each). Anesthesia was induced with intravenous anaesthetics. After tracheal intubation MIRUS
      automatically adjusted the end-tidal VA concentration to 1.0 MAC. Patients were ventilated
      with the Puritan Bennett 840 ICU ventilator. After 1 h of anaesthesia with 1.0 MAC the
      ventilator mode was switched from SIMV V+ (totally controlled ventilation, "passive patient",
      with a tidal volume of 8 ml/IBW) to proportional assist ventilation (PAV) with 50% support
      ("active patient"). At the end of surgery the MIRUS system was stopped (MAC set to 0.0) and
      recovery times were measured.
