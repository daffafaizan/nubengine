      diseases caused by unhealthy lifestyle. Medical students spent many hours in acquiring
      knowledge in the medical professions but little time invested in studying fields related to
      medicine lifestyles.

      On the other side, the family doctors in charge of health promotion in the community find
      themselves inundated with patients that often can make lifestyle on the one hand but a huge
      shortage of time for providing advice and support in favor of this issue on the other.

      The Faculty of Medicine in Safed project exists "As you hear" where each student is asked to
      choose a project support and assistance to the community. Medical students who elected to be
      incorporated into this project with the assistance of patients with chronic diseases to
      lifestyle changes.

      Each student will work closely with a family doctor who finds for patients who need and want
      it accompanied by a change he introduced them and guide him on health status, medication and
      change the desired objectives.

      In the program students will receive guidance on healthy lifestyle and support a patient to
      perform health changes in theoretical and practical. Training sessions will be held
      periodically, close supervision and guidance, counseling and cross-fertilization and updates
      from the scientific literature.

      The student will meet with patients and support them to make a lifestyle change in favor of
      health
