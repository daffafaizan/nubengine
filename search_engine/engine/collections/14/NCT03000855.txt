      cancers, and its development can hinder the use of chemotherapy, decrease patient quality of
      life and decrease survival. Malignant biliary obstruction is traditionally palliated with
      ERCP with metallic stent insertion. However, these stents are prone to obstruction due to
      tumour ingrowth. In addition, ERCP may not always be possible due to tumour obstruction and
      percutaneous biliary drainage may be required.

      Recently, ECDS has been described as an alternative to percutaneous biliary drainage in
      patients with failed ERCP. The procedure is also associated with potential advantages as
      compared to conventional ERCP. In particular, the risk of tumour ingrowth into the stent
      placed after ECDS is low and stent patency rates may be better than ERCP. Thus, the aim of
      the current study is to compare primary ECDS versus ERCP with CSEMS in unresectable malignant
      distal CBD strictures.
