      Our previous NHLBI-supported study (HL 57232) showed that a combination treatment of
      "Coaching" through follow-up phone calls 2 and 5 days following an index ED visit plus
      monetary incentive was highly effective in increasing the percentage of low-income urban
      children who received recommended primary care within 2 weeks of the ED visit for asthma, 44%
      in the intervention group vs 29% in usual care (p = 0.0004). However, the intervention was
      not associated with significant differences in morbidity (subsequent ED visits). We conclude
      that the intervention was effective in promoting the initial link to primary care, but was
      not effective in sustaining that link or management practices to minimize acuity of symptoms
      during exacerbation.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      Primary outcome The proportion of children of subjects in each group who have at least one ED
      visit for acute asthma symptoms during the thirty-six month period following enrollment.

      Key secondary outcomes A. The proportion of children of subjects in each group who are
      hospitalized during the thirty-six month period following enrollment.

      B. The proportion of children of subjects in each group who have either acute asthma visits
      or asthma-planning visits with their primary care providers.

      C. The costs of asthma-related care during the thirty-six month period D. Variables which may
      mediate or moderate the intervention such as the attitudes toward asthma care of the subjects
      and the personal social support perceived by the subjects .
