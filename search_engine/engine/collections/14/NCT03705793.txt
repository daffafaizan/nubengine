      overall goal of this proposed research project is to optimize topical delivery of MF to the
      paranasal sinuses in surgery-naive CRS patients through the use of high-volume, low-pressure
      nasal saline irrigation. The investigators will be conducting a single-site, double-blinded,
      placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial (RCT) in which we propose to evaluate the
      effectiveness of MF nasal irrigation compared to MF nasal spray.
