      obesity. The current treatment options for patients with obesity related respiratory failure
      is non-invasive ventilation (NIV). This has shown to reduce partial pressure of arterial
      carbon dioxide (PaCO2) and improves symptoms such as dyspnea (breathlessness)and enhances
      quality of life. NIV has also shown to increase physical activity (using actigraphy)and there
      can be associated weight reduction after three months of initiation.

      Currently, the length of an inpatient stay for NIV set up is between 4.5 and 6 days. As yet
      it is unknown whether or not a patient can be set up onto NIV as effectively on an outpatient
      basis using an AE-AVAPS (Automatic Expiratory Positive Airway Pressure - Average Volume
      Assured Pressure Support) algorithm compared to the usual practice of inpatient titration by
      specialist respiratory nurses. Furthermore, the cost effectiveness of outpatient initiation
      vs inpatient initiation is unknown in this group of patients.

      This will be the first trial to assess the cost effectiveness of such a set up.
