      soon after thrombolysis for acute myocardial infarction did not result in a clinical benefit.
      This finding emphasizes the importance to select a subgroup of patients with a recent
      myocardial infarction, who will really benefit from angioplasty of the infarct-related
      artery.

      Several studies have demonstrated that the presence of viability in the infarct-area early
      after acute myocardial infarction imposes an increased risk of new cardiac events like
      recurrent infarction, angina pectoris and need for coronary interventions. Therefore, it is
      postulated that only patients with viability in the infarct-area will benefit from
      angioplasty early after acute myocardial infarction.

      In the VIAMI-trial patients who are admitted to the hospital with an acute myocardial
      infarction and who did not undergo immediate coronary angioplasty, will undergo viability
      testing by dobutamine-echocardiography within 3 days of admission. Patients with unequivocal
      signs of viability in the infarct-area will then be randomized to an invasive or a
      conservative treatment strategy. In the invasive strategy patients will undergo coronary
      angiography with the intention to perform balloon angioplasty with stenting of the
      infarct-related coronary artery, with concomitant use of the intravenous platelet inhibitor
      abciximab. In the conservative group patients will undergo coronary angiography and
      angioplasty only when new impending infarction or recurrent ischemia is present. In the
      invasive group balloon angioplasty will be performed as soon as possible after randomization.
      Patients without viability will not be randomized,but will participate as a control group.
