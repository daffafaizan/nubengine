    
      Patients with neuromodulation systems implanted for either movement disorders or chronic pain
      and who require programming of their systems will be approached to enter the study. Those who
      consent will be consecutively assigned to either the normal standard of care (i.e.
      programming of their systems with an experienced clinician) or programming of their systems
      with an inexperienced programmer (nurse) who will be directed by the experienced programmer
      via the remote presence robot. Both the nurses and the patients will complete questionnaires
      rating their satisfaction of the programming experience.

      They will each only receive one questionnaire at the end of the programming session. There is
      no other test point.
