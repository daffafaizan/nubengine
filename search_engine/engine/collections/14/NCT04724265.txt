      collected after cochleostomy using a 1ml seringue. The drop of liquid is deposited on a
      Guthrie card; on another card, a drop of blood is deposited on another card. CMV PCR
      (polymerised chain reaction) is then performed in order to assess for the presence of CMV.
      The sensibility, specificity, positive and negative positive values are then calculated.
