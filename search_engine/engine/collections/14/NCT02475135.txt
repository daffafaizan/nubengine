    
      This is a Phase 1, 3-panel, open-label, randomized, 2-way crossover study in healthy
      subjects. Healthy subjects will be divided over 3 panels (Panel 1, 2 and 3). Subjects will be
      randomized within each panel. In each panel, during 2 subsequent sessions, each subject will
      receive 2 treatments (Treatments A and B in Panel 1, Treatments C and D in Panel 2, and
      Treatments E and F in Panel 3). Each treatment is defined as follows: Treatment A: single
      oral dose of D/C/F/TAF 800/150/200/10 milligram (mg) as FDC tablet under fed conditions
      (standardized regular breakfast); Treatment B: single oral dose of E/C/F/TAF 150/150/200/10
      mg as FDC tablet under fed conditions; Treatment C: single oral dose of D/C/F/TAF
      800/150/200/10 mg as FDC tablet under fed conditions; Treatment D: single oral dose of DRV as
      800-mg tablet, FTC/TAF as 200/10 mg tablet and COBI 150 mg tablet under fed conditions.
      Treatment E: single oral dose of D/C/F/TAF 800/150/200/10 mg as FDC tablet, under fasted
      condition and Treatment F: single oral dose of D/C/F/TAF 800/150/200/10 mg tablet, with a
      standardized high-fat breakfast. Each treatment will be separated by a washout period of at
      least 7 days. Primarily pharmacokinetic parameters will be assessed. Subjects' safety will be
      assessed throughout.
