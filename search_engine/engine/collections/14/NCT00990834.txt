      trials but remain underutilized partly due to the associated myopathy. Severe reactions
      manifested as rhabdomyolysis are rare but myalgia is commonly noted in clinical practice. The
      pathophysiology of these events remains obscure. Previous studies suggest that statins block
      the downstream products (such as cellular signaling molecules) of the mevalonate pathway
      needed for normal muscle function. Other studies show that statins are associated with gene
      expressions involved in muscle damage such as atrogin-1. We will quantify these entities pre
      and post statin therapy to better understand these reactions.
