    
      This is a multi-center randomized controlled trial of 224 patients in order to clearly
      delineate differences in post-operative outcomes and the trajectory of recovery between
      simultaneous and staged bilateral KA. The primary outcome measure is difference in generic
      health related quality of life between the two groups measured 1 year following surgery.
      Secondary outcome measures include differences in joint specific scores, time off work,
      satisfaction and costs.

      This trial will inform patients and clinicians about differences in recovery, function and
      efficacy of the procedure to aid in the selection of treatment pathway to best suit the
      patient.
