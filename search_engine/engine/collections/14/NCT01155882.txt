    
      Primary

      The primary objective of this registry study is to collect clinical data from patients who
      undergo the WATSA procedure. Specific hypotheses to be tested are

        -  To determine how effective Whipple at the Splenic Artery (WATSA) is at resecting tumors
           with negative microscopic margins (R0) at the resection line on the pancreas and at the
           tangential posterior, uncinate, and venous margins.

        -  To determine if WATSA can be performed within the usual range of morbidity and mortality
           (30 day postoperative mortality) for a standard a Whipple procedure.

      Secondary

      The secondary objectives of this registry study are to

        -  To determine the survival/recurrence rates at 2 years.

        -  To determine the effect of occlusion of the splenic vein at the confluence.
