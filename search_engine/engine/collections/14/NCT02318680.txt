      hospitalization and discharge together with the nurse from the ward. Next, the patient is
      discharged from the hospital and is driven by the project nurse from the hospital to the
      patient's home where they meet the nurse from the municipality. Together with the patient the
      two nurses review:

        -  Cognitive skills

        -  Medicine

        -  Nutrition

        -  Mobility

        -  Level of functioning

        -  Future appointments in the health care sector

      All patients in the project - both patients in the intervention group and patients in the
      control group - will receive treatment and care equivalent to normal applicable quality
      standards with discharge from the hospital.

      It is expected that the study will demonstrate a reduction of hospital readmissions within
      180 days in the intervention group with 14 % (with a power of 90% and a significance level of
      5%). There will be a need for 200 patients in both the control and intervention group, ie 400
      patients in total.
