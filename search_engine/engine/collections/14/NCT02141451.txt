      of INCB7839. Up to three dose levels will be tested (100 mg bid, 200 mg bid, and 300 mg bid).
      As the 300 mg bid has been proven safe in the non-transplant setting, dose escalation follows
      a Fast-Track Design with 1 patient enrolled per dose level unless a grade 2 or greater
      treatment emergent event occurs within the 1st 14 days of INCB7839. At that point, dose
      escalation converts to a standard 3+3 design and two additional patients are enrolled at the
      current dose level. If dose level 3 is completed without dose limiting toxicity (DLT) in the
      1st 3 patients, an additional 3 patients will be enrolled at this level (without the
      staggering required by the DLT rules) prior to moving to the phase II component.

      Once the phase I dose escalation is completed, an additional 12 patients will be enrolled at
      the MTD (or dose level 3, if no DLT) to obtain a more detailed toxicity profile as well as a
      preliminary estimate of progression free survival at 6 months post-transplant.
