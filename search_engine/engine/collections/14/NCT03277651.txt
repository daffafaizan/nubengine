      that the hemodynamics measurements of the liver are strongly correlated with the stages of
      liver fibrosis and portal hypertension, and can therefore serve as an alternative means of
      diagnosis. We have developed a physics-based mathematical model that incorporates our
      biological understanding of fibrosis development. The model quantitatively predicts changes
      of liver tissue stiffness and blood flow dynamics as a function of fibrosis stage.
      Preliminary data using ultrasound Doppler images and needle biopsy from liver fibrosis
      patients have suggested the 'prove of principle. We propose further test our hypothesis by
      collecting and analyzing ultrasound Doppler and biopsy data to confirm the correlation
      between blood flow dynamics and disease stage from patients with hepatic fibrosis and portal
      hypertension. If tested true, we can expect to use features of ultrasound Doppler as a
      non-invasive means of diagnosis for fibrosis and portal hypertension.
