    
      Objective：To identify the novel circulating miRNA expression profiles that may serve as a
      sensitive and reliable biomarker to predict future adverse CV outcomes and death in patients
      with established CAD.

      Methods：The investigators propose to utilize next-generation sequencing (RNASeq) to identify
      the novel plasma miRNA expression signature linked to adverse CV outcomes in participanrs
      with CAD. The identified miRNA candidates that are predictive of adverse CV events will be
      validated in a larger independent cohort of CAD patients. In addition, miRNAs that are linked
      to adverse CV outcomes in CAD patients will be investigated mechanistically in human aortic
      endothelial cells to understand their functional contribution to the occurrence of adverse CV
      events.

      What is New or Innovative in this Study? This study could be one of the few studies to
      investigate circulating miRNAs as novel biomarkers for risk stratification and the clinical
      outcome prediction in patients with established CAD. This report will also demonstrate that
      some dysregulated circulating miRNAs might contribute to endothelial dysfunction and adverse
      CV events in CAD patients.

      Scientific or Clinical Implication of the Expected Results：The results from this study will
      provide a new prognostic tool to predict CV outcomes in CAD patients using plasma miRNA
      expression signature. It will also provide important scientific insights into the complex
      non-coding RNA regulatory network involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. The
      insights from this study may provide a unique opportunity to improve the risk assessment of
      adverse CV events in CAD patients by targeting theses miRNAs.
