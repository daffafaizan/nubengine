      documented by clinical history or imaging studies. If the aortic valve was replaced
      surgically, they may still be eligible. Participants will be asked to donate a single tube of
      blood and fill out a questionnaire. Patients will also be followed up by telephone or email
      about once a year to determine if they experience any medical complications related to
      Bicuspid Aortic Valve (BAV), such as aortic aneurysms, aortic dissections or valve disease.
      Patients may not be included if they are less than 18 years old at the time of recruitment or
      have a recognized genetic syndrome or genetic mutation such as Marfan or Ehlers-Danlos
      syndrome.
