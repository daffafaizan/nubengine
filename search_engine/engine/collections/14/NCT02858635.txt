      1500 patients with a personal history of suicide attempt will be recruited. Clinical,
      biological and neuropsychological assessments will be performed. The first objective of the
      study is to replicate the results already obtained regarding the association between
      serotonergic system genes and suicidal behaviour. The allele frequencies for different
      markers tested in suicidal and in control subjects with no history of suicidal behaviour will
      be compared. The patients that will be recruited will be compared to the control population
      already recruited for another project.

      Prospective study: 554 patients hospitalized for a suicide attempt will will be evaluated,
      each 6 month, during the 2-years period of the study. Clinical, biological and
      neuropsychological assessments will be performed.

      At the end of the inclusion visit, 60 participants will be assessed using ecological
      momentary assessment(ESM). They will be instructed to carry a smartphone with them for one
      week, and to record at each alarm signal daily life events, negative emotions, psychological
      pain, suicidal ideas, and specific attributions to these events. Participants will be
      signalled five times a day during the period. Subjects will be contacted by telephone halfway
      through the assessment period to monitor and encourage compliance.
