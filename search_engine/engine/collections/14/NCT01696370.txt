      Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a common inherited disorder of heart muscle affecting 1
      in 500 individuals worldwide. It is associated with arrhythmias, heart failure and sudden
      death in young people. In the majority of patients, HCM is caused by mutations in genes
      encoding cardiac contractile proteins. It has been hypothesised that excessive sarcomeric
      energy consumption is an important and early factor in the pathophysiology of HCM. Therefore
      modulation of myocardial metabolism presents a novel target for improving myocardial
      performance and symptoms in patients with HCM. Trimetazidine is an anti-anginal agent which
      like perhexiline reduces fatty acid oxidation and increases glucose oxidation, thus
      increasing the efficiency of energy production. Trimetazidine has been shown to significantly
      improve exercise performance in patients with stable angina, ischaemic and non ischaemic
      cardiomyopathy, either as monotherapy or in combination with beta-blockers or calcium channel
      blockers,

      DESIGN: A single centre prospective randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled, trial of
      trimetazidine therapy.

      DOSING: 20 mg Trimetazidine or Placebo three times daily for three months

      METHODS: The following assessments will be made at baseline and after 3 months treatment:
      history and physical examination, Minnesota heart failure questionnaire, fasting blood tests,
      electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, cardiopulmonary exercise test, six minute walk test, 24
      hour ECG Holter monitor.
