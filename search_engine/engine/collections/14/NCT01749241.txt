      indications. Following any incisional surgery, postoperative inflammation occurs at the
      surgical site. This study will evaluate the efficacy of reducing postoperative inflammation
      after bilateral eyelid surgery using Loteprednol etabonate (steroid) vs. Soothe ointment
      (vehicle of Loteprednol etabonate). Common postoperative changes at the incision include:
      erythema, thickening/elevation of the skin, pigmentary changes and pain. The use of a
      topically applied steroid would be expected to reduce inflammation and this study will
      evaluate this. For each patient, one eyelid will be randomly chosen to treat with medication
      and the other eyelid will be treated with vehicle ointment and by using the same patient,
      each patient will be internally controlled. Antibiotic prophylaxis is often given after
      eyelid surgery and this will be used in all patients in the study.
