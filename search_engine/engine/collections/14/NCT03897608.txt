      effect on the liver as well as other organ systems (the extrahepatic manifestations of HCV).
      It has been widely reported to have a profound negative impact on patient's health-related
      quality of life (HRQL).

      The reduction of HRQL is probably also due to physical and psychiatric symptoms as a direct
      consequence of this chronic infection and its sequelae (such as cirrhosis). The chronic
      inflammation is believed to signal the brain and to give rise to neurovegetative symptoms
      (e.g. malaise and fatigue) and to amongst others depression and concentration difficulties.
      Possibly, also the brain itself is infected by HCV . The Egyptian government introduced
      Sofosbuvir as the first DAAs into Egypt through the government funded National Treatment
      Program. These agents are highly efficacious with significantly fewer side effects .

      To date, there is only one study reported about how Egyptian HCV patients receiving the new
      DAAs perceive their HRQL. This study is first one to be done in Upper Egypt to assess
      health-related quality of life of HCV patients receiving direct acting antivirals (DAAs)
      therapy prior and at the end of therapy
