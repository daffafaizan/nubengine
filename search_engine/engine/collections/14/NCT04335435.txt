      polyphenols that might interfere with the employed analytical chemistry techniques. This
      period of diet restriction is the washout period. The list of foods to avoid are: oats, whole
      grains, fruits, vegetables, herbal supplements, ginger, coffee, tea, and chocolate.

      After the washout period, a baseline urine and fecal sample will be collected from the
      participants, then a large portion of oat bran will be provided to the participants for
      consumption. The approximate portion size will be 100 g by dry weight. The participants will
      then provide urine samples during the designated time points. The time points for the urine
      collection are as follows:

        1. st sample, ~ 30 min to 1 hour prior to oat consumption

        2. nd sample: 0-2 hours after oat consumption

        3. rd sample: 2-4 hours after oat consumption

        4. th sample: 4-6 hours after oat consumption

        5. th sample: 6-9 hours after oat consumption

        6. th sample: 9-12 hours after oat consumption

        7. th sample: 12-24 hours after oat consumption

        8. th sample: 24-32 hours after oat consumption

        9. th sample: 48 hours after oat consumption These samples will be analyzed in using HPLC
           and LC/MS.
