    
      To conduct a feasibility study on implementing the computer-based screening decision aid for
      prostate cancer screening in a primary care setting during a 60-minute interview. To aid in
      informed decision making, the screening decision aid will include a graphical representation
      of predicted probabilities of prostate cancer diagnosis, prostate cancer-specific mortality,
      death from competing causes based on a man's unique demographic information. The study team
      will provide standardized counseling followed by individualized counseling with the screening
      decision aid. It will assess the quality of the decision making process (patient feels
      knowledgeable, informed of the risks/benefits, feels clear about their values, is involved in
      the decision), and quality of the decision.
