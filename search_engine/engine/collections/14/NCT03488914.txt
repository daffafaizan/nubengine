      be offered following field-based HIV counseling and testing (C&T) - the YMHP intervention and
      an enhanced "treatment as usual" (eTAU) condition involving HIV prevention services provided
      at two community based organizations (CBOs) to test their relative effectiveness in reducing
      substance use and sexual risk behavior among HIV-negative MYMSM. In collaboration with two
      CBOs, our goals are to better understand substance use and sexual health-related outcomes
      among HIV-negative MYMSM who are unlikely to be treatment seeking and to implement the YMHP
      intervention in a way that will maximize portability and scalability. Working together with
      our collaborators will help to address practical problems at the frontline of service
      provision to pave the way for a comprehensive program to reduce substance use and HIV
      infection among MYMSM.
