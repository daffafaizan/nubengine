      I. Determine the response rate in pediatric patients with recurrent or refractory soft tissue
      sarcomas or Ewing's sarcoma family of tumors treated with ecteinascidin 743 (trabectedin).

      II. Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients. III. Determine the
      pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive trabectedin IV over 3 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21days for up
      to 26 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for up to 5 years.
