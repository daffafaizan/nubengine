      Persona knee implants. The study will require each site to obtain Ethics approval prior to
      study enrollment. All potential study subjects will be required to participate in the
      Informed Consent Process.

      Study subjects will undergo preoperative clinical evaluations prior to their total knee
      arthroplasty. The post-operative clinical and radiographic evaluations will be conducted at 5
      days to 6 weeks, 3 to 6 months, 1 year, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years after implantation. The hospital
      CHU Clermont-Ferrand, France with PI Prof. Boisgard will conduct additional 7 (voluntary) and
      10 years (standard of care) follow-up visits.
