      Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) or orally (PO) over 1 hour, bortezomib
      IV over 3 minutes, and dexamethasone IV or PO on days 1, 8, and 15. Patients also receive
      pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 1 hour on day 8. Treatment repeats
      every 28 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years, then
      annually up to 5 years.
