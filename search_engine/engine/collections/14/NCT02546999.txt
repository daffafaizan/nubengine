      a computer number random generator and will be carried out and held by the unit of Applied
      Clinical Research at NTNU. Two strata: age and center.

      The study will be conducted according to Consort guidelines and guidelines for Good Clinical
      Practice. It is approved by the local Ethical committee (REK Nord) and the Norwegian Drug
      Agency.

      Primary research question is: Do BoNT-A injections in the calf muscles make walking easier in
      children with CP? Secondary research questions: 1) Do BoNT-A injections in the calf muscles
      increase activity? 2) Do BoNT-A injections in the calf muscles improve walking capacity 3) Do
      BoNT-A injections in the calf muscles improve perceived performance and satisfaction related
      to mobility tasks and 4) Do BoNT-A injections in the calf muscles reduce recurrent
      musculoskeletal pain? The participants will receive the treatment with both local anaesthesia
      and conscious sedation with oral or nasal benzodiazepines.Outcome measures are made at
      baseline and 4, 12 and 24 weeks after treatment, with primary endpoint at 12 weeks.

      Data will be analyzed using a linear mixed model (LMM). The difference in change in the
      primary outcome measure (energy cost during walking) between the treated and placebo groups
      will be done using a post hoc test following the LMM. Secondary, the same model will be used
      to test for an effect also at 4 and 24 weeks post injection. Age, GMFCS Level, number of
      prior BoNT-A treatments and study center will be considered as potential covariates.

      A substudy will be conducted within the frames of this RCT, aiming to identify
      characteristics of those who respond to the treatment compared to those who do not respond
      (outcome measures 6, 7,8 and 9).
