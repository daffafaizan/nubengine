      life expectancy. However, antiretroviral treatment does not fully restore the immune system
      in all individuals due to persistent immune activation and inflammation, increasing the risk
      of non-AIDS complications, such as insulin resistance, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia,
      obesity, low bone mass density, oxidative stress and micronutrient deficiencies. Several
      studies showed that HIV+ patients present zinc and selenium deficiency. Those micronutrients
      are involved in the pathogenesis of metabolic complications and have a major role in
      maintaining immune system function. It remains unknown the effect of zinc and selenium
      supplementation on metabolic and immunological parameters associated to non-AIDS
      complications.
