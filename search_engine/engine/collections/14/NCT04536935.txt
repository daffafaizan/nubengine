      participants who are essential workers and/or unemployed due to COVID-19 and have a past
      history of mental health issues or experiencing suicide ideation motivational risk factors.
      Participants will be asked about their mental health needs, challenges they face accessing
      care, and strategies they have used to manage their mental health. All participants will then
      be shown App Store descriptions of ten apps that have received the highest rating by
      PsyberGuide, a non-profit company that consistently rates existing apps for their safety,
      data privacy and user ratings. Participants will provide initial impressions on the
      acceptability and feasibility of using these apps. The investigators will then ask
      participants if they would be willing to participate in a randomized trial to test these
      apps, with the aim of recruiting 1000 participants. Participants will be randomized (250 per
      group) to one of the four apps. They will be asked to download their assigned app and use it
      for 4 weeks. After 4 weeks of use, participants will be asked to provide an evaluation of
      acceptability, feasibility and usability of the app, how often they used the app, and if they
      found the app helpful. Participants will also be asked to complete clinical outcome measures.
