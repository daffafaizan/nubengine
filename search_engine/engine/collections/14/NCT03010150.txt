      I. To determine whether illness perceptions significantly predict adherence to swallowing
      exercises at 6 months after the end of radiation.

      II. To determine whether sickness behaviors (depression, fatigue, pain)'s effect on illness
      perceptions are mediated by pro-inflammatory cytokines.

      III. To determine whether social support moderates the impact of coping on appraisal of
      coping.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. As a secondary aim, to determine the feasibility and utility of cardiac impedance
      pre-ejection period measurement as a corollary measure for depression and distress.

      II. As a secondary aim, to identify potential genetic markers for swallowing dysfunction
      which has developed by the 6-month follow-up.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants provide blood samples prior to and at the 6-month visit after receiving
      radiation therapy. Participants also complete questionnaires either at home, in clinic, or
      via internet over 30 minutes prior to receiving radiation therapy and within 14 days of blood
      sample collection.

      After completion of study, participants are followed up periodically for up to 2 years.
