      and/or cerebellar involvement. Neuropathologically, MSA is characterized by glial cytoplasmic
      inclusions (GCI) of abnormally aggregated α-synuclein (α-syn). This was a study to test the
      hypothesis that Rifampicin, because of its ability to inhibit the formation of α-synuclein
      fibrils and disaggregate fibrils already formed, will delay progression or reverse neurologic
      and autonomic functions and symptoms in MSA. This approach has been proposed as a potential
      approach to treat parkinsonism and specifically, MSA. In an experimental model of MSA, it was
      hypothesized that Rifampicin would improve behavioral abnormalities of MSA and halt or
      reverse the pathological changes. The primary objective was to undertake a double-blind
      placebo-controlled clinical trial on the effect of Rifampicin on progression of neurological
      and autonomic failure in MSA.

      The Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) recommended stopping the study after an interim
      analysis of the primary endpoint revealed that futility criteria were met.
