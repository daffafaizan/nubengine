      experience hallucinations, delusions, disordered thinking, movement disorders, social
      withdrawal, and cognitive deficits. In considering the high rate of cigarette smoking among
      people with schizophrenia, it is also likely that they smoke. People with schizophrenia who
      smoke tend to experience improved cognition, and tobacco withdrawal has been associated with
      deterioration of cognition. This suggests that nicotine may improve cognitive deficits or
      medication side effects in people with schizophrenia.

      Auditory sensory gating, a neural mechanism thought to reflect sensory information processing
      and affect cognition, is diminished in people with schizophrenia. Auditory sensory gating has
      been associated with the 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, a brain receptor that is
      important for cognition and can be activated by nicotine. Activation of this receptor using
      an agonist medication, such as tropisetron, may produce the same positive effect that
      nicotine has on cognition. This study will determine the effectiveness of using tropisetron
      as supplemental therapy to the atypical neuroleptic risperidone in people with schizophrenia.

      Participants in this 12-week double blind study will be randomly assigned to receive either
      tropisetron or placebo. All participants will also follow a 6-mg risperidone regimen. Study
      visits will occur every 2 weeks throughout the study and final outcome assessments will
      include cognitive functioning and treatment safety and effectiveness.
