      conducted a trial extension for an additional 28 days. During that time, the original control
      group was trained in the use of the portable stress management device and used it, without
      support of the research team, for 28 days. Also during that time, the original intervention
      group were told that they could keep the PSMD and use it as they like. At the end of the 28
      day trial extension, stress, and physiological parameters were measured again. For the
      initial control group, this allowed us to test effectiveness of the PSMD (real life 1 hr
      training on the device then unsupported use). For the initial intervention group, this
      allowed us to see if any effects of using the PSMD were maintained for an additional 28 days,
      without ongoing support from the research team.
