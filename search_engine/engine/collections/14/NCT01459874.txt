      remote monitoring systems, a further step should approach the issue of how remote monitoring
      can be implemented as a part of routine activities of a cardiology outpatient clinic. A clear
      definition of roles and workflow to timely manage information and properly react to adverse
      events is required. The HomeGuide Registry proposes an organizational model specifying roles
      and procedures for outpatient clinics using a specific remote monitoring system in routine
      follow-up. The HomeGuide model is essentially based on an interaction between one or more
      allied professionals (expert and trained nurses or technicians) and a responsible physician.
      The main objective of the HomeGuide Registry is to evaluate:

        1. Clinical efficiency of remote patient management;

        2. Health service resources required by a remote patient management.
