      supportive care device) called, Care4AD for reducing burden and stress of caregivers,
      enhancing patient adherence to scheduled tasks, and increasing Individuals with dementia
      activity (IWD). The investigator will conduct a 6-month prospective randomized control trial
      (RCT) of 100 persons with mild to moderately severe dementia to examine changes in
      caregiver's burden and stress and IWD's physical activity and adherence to scheduled ADLs.
      Feedback (e.g., reminders about completed/incomplete tasks) will be activated in the
      intervention group (IG) and de-activated in the control group (CG). The investigator will
      also use an ADL log and bi-weekly phone interview with a caregiver as gold standards to
      validate the detection of adherence to scheduled ADLs of interest. Furthermore, the
      acceptability, perception of benefit, and ease of use of Care4AD will be further assessed
      using technology acceptance model (TAM). We hypothesize that at 6 months, those in the IG
      compared to the CG will have less caregiver burden (Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) (primary
      outcome), greater IWD adherence to scheduled ADLs (primary outcome), and higher IWD physical
      function and activity (primary outcome). Secondary outcomes will include caregiver coping
      (Brief Cope), self-efficacy (Revised Scale for Caregiving Self-Efficacy), and preparedness
      (Preparedness for Caregiving Scale), and quality of life of IWD (Quality of Life in
      Alzheimer's disease scale)
