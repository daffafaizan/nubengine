      Service (NHIS). As healthcare providers in South Korea need to claim reimbursement to NHIS
      for the vast majority of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, the NHIS database enabled us
      to construct a large cohort who did or did not undergo CT for appendicitis. The purpose of
      this study is to compare the incidence rate of cancer between CT-exposed and CT-unexposed
      group in patients who underwent appendectomy in South Korea.
