      majority of MSM acquire HIV after exposure to the rectal mucosa through unprotected receptive
      anal intercourse. Post-exposure-prophylaxis (PEP) is an intervention that is used to prevent
      HIV infection soon (72 hours) after a potential exposure. HIV-negative people with a possible
      exposure to HIV are instructed to take 28 days of a combination anti-HIV medication regimen,
      Truvada® + Raltegravir.

      This study is being conducted to determine if the uptake of another anti-HIV medication,
      called Genvoya®, at different time-frames, is different at several body sites, including
      mucosal tissues. This medication might be considered for on-demand PEP regimens in the
      future.
