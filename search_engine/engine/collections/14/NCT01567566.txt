      mechanics for both treatment groups following completion of the exercise programs. We
      hypothesize that there will be differences observed between groups following the 6wk
      rehabilitation programs, and that only the group completing the combined local (segmental)
      stabilizer and hip stabilizer strengthening program (T2) will demonstrate significant
      differences in mechanics compared to baseline testing.
