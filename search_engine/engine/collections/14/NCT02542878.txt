      popular in sport. Scientific literature currently suggests that the effects of
      self-myofascial release are mediated by the stimulation over neural and connective tissue.
      There is evidence that this stimulation could improve the maximum range of motion and
      decrease muscle soreness. Nonetheless, there is few evidence about the effects of
      self-myofascial release on muscle endurance.

      Given the increased use of autonomously (self-treatment) in the athlete population, this
      study aims to assess the effect of a low back short application (60 seconds) on the back
      extensor muscles endurance measured by the Biering-Sorensen test.

      With the obtained results we want to elaborate an evideced based recommendation about its use
      prior to physical activity or sports competition.
