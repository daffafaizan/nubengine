      episodes and duration of paroxysmal AF and AT and the rejection of far field sensing of the
      far field R-wave (FFRW). The study aims to evaluate the accuracy of the detection of atrial
      tachyarrhythmias (ATAs). An improved detection can potentially increase the accuracy of
      clinical treatment decisions, based on device derived data.
