    
      This is a post-authorisation safety study (PASS) of new users of aclidinium bromide, fixed
      dose aclidinium bromide/formoterol fumarate dihydrate, and other inhaled medications
      frequently used by patients with COPD.

      The plan is for the PASS study to be conducted on one population-based automated health
      database; the initial candidate database is the CRPD in the United Kingdom.
