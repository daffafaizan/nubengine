    
      Aim 1: To compare patient outcomes at health centers randomized to intervention vs.
      standard-of-care TB diagnostic evaluation strategies. The investigators will randomize 20
      community health centers to continue standard TB evaluation (routine microscopy plus referral
      of patients for Xpert testing per existing processes of care) or to implement the
      intervention strategy (1. Onsite molecular testing; 2. Re-structuring clinic-level procedures
      to facilitate same-day TB diagnosis and treatment; and 3. Performance feedback). The
      investigators will compare reach and effectiveness based on the numbers and proportions of
      patients (N=5500) who complete TB testing, are found to have TB, and have treatment initiated
      within one week of specimen provision.

      Aim 2: To identify processes and contextual factors that influence the effectiveness and
      fidelity of the intervention TB diagnostic evaluation strategy. The investigators will use
      quantitative process metrics to assess the adoption and maintenance over time of the core
      components of the intervention strategy. The investigators will also collect quantitative and
      qualitative data to describe the fidelity of implementation of each component and
      faithfulness to the conceptual model.

      Aim 3: To compare the costs and epidemiological impact of intervention vs. standard-of-care
      TB diagnostic evaluation strategies. The investigators will model the incremental costs and
      cost-effectiveness of intervention relative to standard-of-care TB diagnostic evaluation from
      the health system and patient perspective. The investigators will then construct an epidemic
      model of the population-level impact of the intervention strategy on TB incidence and
      mortality.
