      intervention compared to an attention control condition among 20 first time caregivers of CCI
      patients discharged to an extended care facility. The investigators will collect mixed
      methods data at baseline (T1) on Day 15 (T2) and Day 30 (T3) after subject enrollment to
      describe changes in proximal and distal outcomes. We have chosen our time points to capture
      neural and behavioral changes associated with the intervention.

      The investigators aim to:

        1. Determine whether there are differences in the distal outcomes [psychological burden
           (anxiety, depression, caregiver burden, HRQoL), cardiovascular health (BP and HRV) and
           economic costs] between subjects who were exposed to ASSIST compared to those exposed to
           the attention control condition.

        2. Examine whether decentering, self-efficacy, decision-making, motivation, caregiver
           activation, and perceived stress mediate the relationship between exposure to a
           self-management condition (ASSIST vs. attention control) and the proximal
           (self-management) outcomes (stress reduction behaviors, sleep hygiene behaviors, and
           physical activity).

        3. Determine if social support and demographics (gender and age) moderate the proximal
           outcomes [emotional distress, sleep quality, and physical activity] or distal outcomes
           [psychological burden (anxiety, depression, caregiver burden, HRQoL), cardiovascular
           health (BP and HRV) and economic costs].

        4. Explore the differences in brain activation (structural and fMRI scans) and HPA function
           and stress response (hair cortisol, inflammation panel) between subjects exposed to
           ASSIST compared to those exposed to the attention control condition.
