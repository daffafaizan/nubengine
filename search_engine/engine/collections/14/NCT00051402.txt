      mood and may play a prophylactic role against age- and disease-related cognitive-cerebral
      decline. Phytoestrogens are plant-derived substances that have demonstrated estrogenic
      activity, but there is little prospective research regarding their effects on mental
      function. Mental health practitioners generally do not prescribe phytoestrogens. However,
      many women experiencing peri- and post-menopausal symptoms use marketed phytoestrogens under
      the perception of general health benefits, including presumably enhanced mental function. The
      purpose of this study is to develop preliminary data regarding the efficacy of isoflavone
      phytoestrogens in improving cognitive function in late middle-aged and elderly postmenopausal
      women with symptoms of memory impairment.

      Participants in this study will be randomized to receive either isoflavone supplementation or
      placebo. The study will last for 16 weeks, during which participants will take the supplement
      pill or placebo three times a day. Participants will be assessed at study entry and at Week
      16 for changes in basal cortisol levels, mood, and neuropsychological measures of executive
      function ability and episodic memory.
