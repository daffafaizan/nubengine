    
      Pain during labor is caused by contractions of the muscles of the uterus and by pressure on
      the cervix. This pain can be felt as strong cramping in the abdomen, groin, and back, as well
      as an achy feeling. Some women experience pain in their sides or thighs as well. Most women
      have an epidural or spinal during labour or after the birth.
