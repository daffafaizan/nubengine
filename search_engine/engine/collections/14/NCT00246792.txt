        1. Deliver an ecologically informed school-based intervention that addresses individual,
           social and environmental factors, to improve the adjustment of students with LD

        2. Examine the efficacy of the intervention

        3. Contribute to knowledge of the factors that influence the adjustment of students with LD

        4. Circulate this information to those who live and work with students with LD in order to
           offer understanding and direction for programs and interventions and to facilitate
           cross-sector collaboration

      The research will utilize both quantitative and qualitative methodologies. 6 schools will be
      selected. 3 will receive the intervention in year 1 (2004-2005 school year), comprising 1)
      group treatment, 2) workshops, and 3) consultation. The other 3 schools will be controls in
      year 1 and receive the intervention in year 2 (2005-2006 school year).

      Students in grades 6-8, identified as having LD will be offered the opportunity to
      participate in the project (with parental consent). This project comprises 3 components:

        1. School-based group treatment for students in grades 6-8 with LD and psychosocial
           problems. Group treatment will focus on assisting participants to understand the impact
           of their LD as well as on development of self-advocacy skills.

        2. Workshops on understanding LD for teachers, parents, and students without LD (grades
           6-8).
