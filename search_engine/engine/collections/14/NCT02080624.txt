      separated by an interval of 6 weeks and with 1% topical rapamycin or placebo in the superior
      or inferior half, both applied once a day for 12 weeks. The clinical response will be
      analyzed using a morphologic and chromatographic computerised system and with spectrometry.
      Histological response will be evaluated also. For that purpose, we will make 4 biopsies, one
      in each quadrant (quadrant treated with PDL and placebo, quadrant treated with PDL and
      rapamycin, quadrant treated only with rapamycin and quadrant treated only with placebo)
