      randomization. Potential subjects who have previously used disease-modifying antirheumatic
      drugs (DMARDs) and/or biologic agents may be eligible to participate after completing a
      washout period. Subjects who complete the 12-week dosing period in this study may be eligible
      to participate in a long-term, open-label Extension Study.
