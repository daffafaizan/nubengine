      randomized (1:1) to capecitabine/cisplatin plus bevacizumab or capecitabine/cisplatin plus
      placebo. This is an event-driven trial with the primary analysis planned after approximately
      517 deaths had been observed. After the primary analysis, the study will remain open and
      patients can continue with study treatment until progressive disease or earlier at the
      investigator's discretion. After discontinuation of the last patient, the study will end
      globally.
