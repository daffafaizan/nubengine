      such as cementum and dentin undergo some changes over time, such as secondary deposition of
      dentin, which results in the reduction of root canal length. In addition, with aging the
      teeth undergo color changes, presenting a more yellowish or grayish coloration (Ravindra SV
      et al., 2015). The fact is that most of the studies that involve the technique of dental
      bleaching have as inclusion factor only young adult patients, excluding patients of more
      advanced age groups. Therefore, it is fundamental to evaluate the whitening technique in
      these older patients, since it is a treatment that does not cause harm to the individuals To
      assess the effect of dental bleaching in the office with Whiteness HP Automixx, FGM at 35%
      and Opalescence Boost at 38% in the same arch, in different age groups (18 to 25 years and 40
      to 65 years) in absolute risk and intensity Of the postoperative dental sensitivity through
      the visual analog (VAS 0-10) and analogue (NRS 0-4) scales.

        -  Evaluate the efficacy of Whitening HP Automixx, FGM 35% and Opalescence Boost 38% in the
           same arch in different age groups (18 to 25 years and 40 to 65 years) using Color Vita
           Classical and Vita Bleachedguide, and the Vita Easyshade spectrophotometer.

        -  Evaluate the satisfaction of patients after Whitening HP Automixx at 35, FGM and
           Opalescence Boost 38% in the same arch in different age groups (18 to 25 years and 40 to
           65 years).
