      effect of local intravenous steroids following anterior cervical spine surgery on the
      development of dysphagia in patients. This study aims to investigate if there is a difference
      in the efficacy of intravenous steroids compared to a placebo of physiological saline for
      patients undergoing anterior cervical spine surgery. Furthermore, this study aims to
      investigate the correlation between radiographic measurements of soft tissue swelling and the
      severity of dysphagia for patients. Finally, this study aims to examine the impact of
      intravenous steroids on nausea and radicular pain in patients. Secondary outcome measures
      will include patient focused outcomes questionnaires, pain medication requirements, and
      fusion rates.
