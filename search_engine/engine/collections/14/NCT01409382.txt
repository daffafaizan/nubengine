      situations that increase maternal insulin requirements would increase the risk of neonatal
      hypoglycemia. Mothers were selected if they had grade III obesity, acanthosis nigricans
      (surrogates of chronic maternal hyperinsulinemia), any invasive bacterial infection or if
      they had used corticosteroid within seven days before delivery (surrogates of subacute
      insulin resistance), if they reported to have consumed a high-glycemic index diet within 24
      hours before delivery or if they were physically inactive within 24 hours before delivery
      (conditions that could increase maternal insulin requirements close to delivery).

      Based on the finding that that the risk of neonatal hypoglycemia increased fivefold with
      inactivity (95% CI: 2-11, P <0.001), 11-fold with high-carbohydrate intake (95% CI: 4-24, P
      <0.001) and 329-fold with both risk factors (95% CI: 32-3362, P <0.001), next we have
      evaluated how a protocol combining exercises and a balanced diet throughout pregnancy
      influences maternal and neonatal outcomes. One of the outcomes analyzed was neonatal
      hypoglycemia.
