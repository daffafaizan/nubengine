           inclinometer (ActivPAL) in Latinas at risk for heart disease.

        2. Investigate the 3 month effect of the intervention to impact the secondary health
           outcomes of blood pressure, depressive symptoms, and anthropometrics.

        3. Explore the psychosocial & environmental mediators & moderators of changes in sitting
           time.
