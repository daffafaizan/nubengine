      after the baseline assessment. Each assessment may be divided into 2 visits to accommodate
      the MRI and TCD (Transcranial Doppler ultrasound). Detailed medical history will be extracted
      from the patients' medical records, interviews and questionnaires. We will obtain brain MRI
      (without gadolinium contrast) in enrolled patients. Neuropsychological test (NP) tests will
      include a standard battery to detect subclinical changes in cognition which can be missed by
      screening tests like the mini mental state exam.
