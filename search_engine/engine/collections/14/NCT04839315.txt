      clinical trials, and most patients with rheumatic diseases are taking immunosuppressants, the
      immune responses towards the mRNA COVID19 vaccines in these patients remains unknown. The
      goal is to study the immune response to COVID-19 vaccination in patients with rheumatic
      diseases. Blood samples collected before and longitudinally after mRNA-based COVID-19
      vaccination (i.e., Pfizer and Moderna vaccines) will enable detailed immunological
      investigation of the interaction between COVID-19 vaccination and rheumatic diseases. These
      efforts will provide novel insights into the COVID-19 vaccine response in patients with
      rheumatic diseases, and eventually would inform clinical management to improve patient care.
