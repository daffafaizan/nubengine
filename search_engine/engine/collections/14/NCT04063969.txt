      relevant for endovascular team members and patients. To date, many interventions which aim to
      improve radiation safety habits of an endovascular team focus on improving technology and
      team radiation safety knowledge. Safety literature has indicated that a safety climate can be
      identified as the shared perceptions of team members or workers about the safety in their
      workspace and that this safety climate is closely related to safety behaviors and outcomes.
      In endovascular specialties, the concept of a radiation safety climate remains unexplored.
      Therefore, this study aims to measure the radiation safety climate in a diverse pool of
      endovascular team members from different hospitals, using self-assessment questionnaires and
      to investigate the relationship of radiation safety climate with their self-reported safety
      behaviors.
