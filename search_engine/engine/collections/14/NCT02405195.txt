      surgery procedures during normothermic CPB will be included after informed consent. Systemic
      and renal variables will be measured by pulmonary artery and renal vein catheters. Glomerular
      filtration rate (GFR) will be measured by renal extraction of 51Cr-EDTA and renal blood flow
      (RBF) by the infusion clearance technique for para-aminohippuric acid (PAH) corrected for by
      renal extraction of PAH. Repeated measures ANOVA followed by Fisher's PLSD post-hoc test were
      used for statistical analyses
