      and to test the effects of hypoxia under standardized conditions, the investigators initiated
      a prospective and controlled investigation in healthy controls and IBD patients in stable
      remission. the investigators primary aim is to show that a 3-hour stay at high altitude can
      alter disease activity of IBD. Ten healthy volunteers, 11 Crohn's disease (CD) patients and 9
      ulcerative colitis (UC) patients underwent a 3-hour exposure to hypoxic conditions simulating
      an altitude of 4,000 m.a.s.l. in a hypobaric low-pressure chamber situated at the Swiss
      Aeromedical Center, Dubendorf, Switzerland. Stool samples for the analysis of calprotectin
      and microbiotal composition, biopsy samples from the rectosigmoid region, and blood samples
      were repetitively collected and analysed in conjunction with detailed records of clinical
      symptoms over a subsequent interval of 4 weeks.
