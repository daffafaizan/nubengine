      linkage to stuttering. Genetic linkage will be determined by first obtaining genomic DNA from
      both affected and unaffected adults and children from families containing pairs of
      individuals who stutter as adults. Individuals who stutter from genetically isolated
      populations will also be sampled. Phenotype will be assigned by a speech-language
      pathologist, and DNA samples will be obtained from affected and unaffected family members
      from 2 cc. of saliva or from 20 cc. of blood. These DNA samples will then be genotyped using
      markers distributed across the human genome. The genotypic information analyzed to determine
      which markers or variants show linkage to stuttering. The initial goal of this study is to
      identify specific genetic variants, which predispose individuals to stuttering. No genetic
      information will be provided back to participants. A secondary goal of the study will be to
      perform broad clinical evaluations of the individuals found to have mutations that cause
      stuttering. These will take place at the NIH Clinical Center and will include standard
      procedures including history and physical, neurological exam, audiological exam,
      ophthalmologic exam, electromyographic (EMG) exam, electroencephalography (EEG), X-rays,
      speech evaluation, and brain imaging including MRI and fMRI.
