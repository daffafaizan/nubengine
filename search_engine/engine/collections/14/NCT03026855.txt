      relieve pain and promote accelerated healing of Non-healing Foot Ulcer /Wound. The body's
      response to any tissue injury is to deliver platelets, which play an instrumental role in the
      normal healing process by secreting growth factors and attracting stem cells-critical
      components of the healing cascade.

      Any wound or ulcer on skin that has been present for 4-5 weeks duration, without healing is
      called a non-healing ulcer. Non-healing ulcers include venous, arterial, diabetic, pressure
      and traumatic ulcers. Cellular therapies using Autologous Platelet Rich Plasma provides new
      options for wound healing. The efficacy of the treatment has been proven in surgical
      applications, in the treatment of severe burns and in transplantation of cells and tissues.

      Local application of a solution of plasma enriched in platelets derived from the patient's
      blood intends to trigger the healing process in non-responsive chronic wound, increase the
      wound repair rate and reduce pain. PRP is a good option for non-healing wounds because it
      utilizes the body's natural healing processes to jump-start wound healing. Plasma which
      contains very valuable growth factors is separated from other blood components utilizing a
      point of care technology based on density gradient centrifugation. The platelet rich plasma
      is harvested and then activated by a mixture of human thrombin and calcium chloride for
      initiating the healing cascade followed by PRP injection directly into the ulcer/wound
      periphery or spread over a wound in the form of a PRP gel.
