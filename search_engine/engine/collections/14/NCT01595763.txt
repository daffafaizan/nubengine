      inhabitants) to the Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau emergency department with suspected
      DVT. We will enter physical examination and anamnesis variables, Wells and Oudega's rules
      variables, D-Dimer value and ultrasonography result. The outcome variables are the cost (â‚¬)
      of each possible way of diagnostic approach and the effectiveness will be measured by the
      ultrasonography result, which confirms or excludes the diagnosis. The sample will include 437
      patients. A decision tree will be developed to analyze the different diagnostic options in
      DVT cases, using standard notation.
