      of liver involvement in patients with HCV. A direct comparison between SPECT results and
      liver pathology has been examined in patients with liver disease other than infectious
      hepatitis. SPECT has been found to be more accurate than standard liver-spleen scans in
      assessing liver pathology. While current data suggest that liver pathology may correlate with
      SPECT, which specific SPECT parameters are predictive of certain hepatic pathology is
      unknown. The pilot study will compare SPECT parameters with the results of liver biopsies to
      determine the limitations of SPECT.

      All screened patients are registered into Step 1, in which they receive a radioactive tracer
      injection and SPECT scan. Specific SPECT parameters will be measured to determine a grading
      scale corresponding to that used in liver biopsy results. Some patients undergoing a second
      liver biopsy in A5071 are enrolled into Step 2, with permission from protocol co-chairs, in
      which a pregnancy test and second SPECT scan are performed. Patients are reimbursed for
      completing each SPECT scan. SPECT scans or copies are reviewed to establish which parameters
      correspond to category E of the Knodell stage based on severity of fibrosis.
