      the luteal or follicular phase of their menstrual cycle. Standardized anesthesia and pain
      management regimen was given to all patients. Pain and analgesic consumption were evaluated
      in PACU and every four hours in first 24 hours. Adverse effects were also questioned every
      four hours. Time to oral intake and ambulation were recorded. Post-surgical pain, hospital
      anxiety and depression scale, and SF-12 questionnaire were also evaluated at 1- and 3-month
      visits.
