      intense symptoms of dyspnea when they use their arms and shoulders. To control dyspnea they
      avoid using their arms and ultimately experience a significant loss of upper body (UB)
      strength and a decrease in the level of physical activity. Some pulmonary rehabilitation
      programs include strength training, but the training intensity is typically very low. The
      purpose of this research is to examine the effects of UB strength training (designed to
      maximize strength gains) with a self-confidence intervention to enhance adherence to
      exercise. This is an experimental study with random assignment of subjects to one
      experimental and two control groups: (a) UB strength training and self-efficacy intervention
      for adherence (experimental), (b) UB strength training with health education (control 1) and
      (c) gentle armchair fitness exercises with health education (control 2). Each subject will be
      studied for a total of 16 months.The intervention period is four months in duration with a
      12-month follow-up period. The sample will be people with moderate to severe COPD who
      experience dyspnea with UB activities. This research is innovative in that it examines the
      effects of upper body strength training designed to maximize strength gains and combines it
      with a theory-based self-efficacy (confidence-building) intervention to promote adherence to
      training in people with COPD.
