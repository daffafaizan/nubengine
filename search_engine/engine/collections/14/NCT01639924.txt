    
      Patients with suspected or established acute or chronic gastrointestinal diseases are
      evaluated and treated in this protocol and will be screened for entry into other research
      protocols. This protocol serves several purposes: 1) allows for detailed inquiry into the
      gastrointestinal disorders of these patients and the status of other organ systems that would
      determine their ability to safely enroll in active Digestive Diseases Branch (DDB) research
      protocols; 2) allows investigators to offer clinical diagnostic testing, procedures, and
      treatment to patients if clinically indicated to facilitate their participation in clinical
      trials; 3) allows outpatient evaluation and treatment of patients with a variety of
      gastrointestinal diseases for the purposes of physician education in our accredited
      gastroenterology training program; and 4) After completion of the initial evaluation process,
      patients will either be offered a chance to participate in an active research protocol or, if
      no appropriate protocol is identified, patients may be seen long-term to follow the disease
      progression for potential future participation in DDB gastrointestinal studies.
      Recommendations for other treatment options outside of the NIH will be discussed with study
      patients and/or to their primary or referring physicians.
