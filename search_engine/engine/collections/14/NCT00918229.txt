    
      Primary Endpoint Parameters

      The incidence of unexpected serious adverse events related to BioProtect's SpaceGuard balloon
      implant and/or implantation procedure:

        1. Serious Adverse Events related to the BioProtect balloon and/or implantation procedure
           were defined by the Clinical Trials.gov definition of a serious adverse event. Serious
           Adverse Events will be documented in Serious Adverse Event Form.

        2. Adverse Events related to the BioProtect balloon and/or implantation procedure. Adverse
           Events were documented in Adverse Event Form.

        3. Subjective discomfort related to the balloon and implantation procedure were assessed by
           a pain analogue scale.

      Secondary Endpoint Parameters A 10% decrease or greater of the average rectal doses at V50 in
      at least 75% of the subjects after balloon implantation as compared to the doses at V50
      before the balloon implantation. This was measured by routine Dose Volume Histogram (DVH) per
      local hospital practice and according to the instructions regarding anatomical landmarks
      delineated in this protocol.
