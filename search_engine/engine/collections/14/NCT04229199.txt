      theater guided by an expert anesthesia technologist on reducing the Preoperative anxiety
      levels for children who were scheduled for elective day case procedures under general
      anesthesia, and their parents' anxiety levels through a 10-months randomized controlled trial
      at tertiary medical center in Riyadh-Saudi Arabia, and confirmed that children and parents
      who received the intervention had significantly lower preoperative anxiety levels than
      controlled children and parents.

      Given that, the results showed critical levels of preoperative anxiety among school age
      children, and that preoperative tour to simulation operating theater as a child-friendly
      maneuver is directly applicable and could be considered for children scheduled for day-case
      procedures under general anesthesia.
