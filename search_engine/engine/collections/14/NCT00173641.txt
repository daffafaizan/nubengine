      destruction of pancreatic βcell. Dysregulated B and T cells were reported in the animal
      model. The loss of maintenance of immune homeostasis is thought to be major mechanism and
      result in persistence of autoreactive T cell in the periphery. Therapies which modulate the
      immune dysfunction may be helpful for the patients of T1D.

      Immune homeostasis means a balance between the responses that control infection and tumor
      growth and reciprocal responses that prevent inflammation and autoimmune disease. CD4+ CD25+
      regulatory T cells (Tregs) are critical to maintain such functions. Their actions can be
      through cell-to-cell contact or bystander effect. The specific markers of Tregs include CD25
      molecule (IL-2 receptorαchain), Foxp3 (forkhead-winged helix transcription factor). The Foxp3
      is a transcription factor that controls some genes encoding Tregs associated molecules, such
      as CD25, CTLA-4 and GITR.

      The previous studies of modulation of Tregs in T1D show positive results in animal model. But
      the relative sizes of CD4+CD25+ population in human are still controversial. Our hypothesis
      is that the imbalance of Tregs and autoreactive T cells is the pathogenesis of T1D.
      Therefore, we used flow cytometry to determine the number of CD4+CD25+ Tregs population and
      quantitative real-time PCR to assay the expression of Foxp3, CLTA-4, GITR in patients with
      different stages and normal control. Besides, autoantibodies to GAD65 is associated with T1D
      in 60-80% patients. It is a marker of autoimmune diabetes. We anticipated that the
      realization of Tregs functions in patients of T1D will help our further guide of
      immunotherapy of patients with T1D and other autoimmune disease.
