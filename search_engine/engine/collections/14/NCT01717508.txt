      (CBT) for adolescent depression on neural functioning. Specifically, the study will utilize
      Brent and Poling's (1997) cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) manual (Cognitive Therapy
      Treatment Manual for Depressed and Suicidal Youth), and investigators will examine pre- to
      post- neural activity patterns for children and adolescents who receive individual CBT for
      depression. Electroencephalography (EEG) techniques will be utilized to assess
      treatment-related effects on brain activity (i.e., anterior cingulate cortex and dorsolateral
      prefrontal cortex functioning). Neural activity patterns will also be compared to
      non-depressed, healthy controls.
