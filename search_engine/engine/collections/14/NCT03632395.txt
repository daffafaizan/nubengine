      surgery. Early diagnosis is key to minimize other hazards which are caused by anastomotic
      leak. Investigators introduced a novel method to detect early diagnosis of anastomotic leak
      after gastric cancer surgery. Oral contrast agent is used for CT. Investigators carefully
      collected all the data prospectively and standard definition of anastomotic leak was applied.
