      in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myelogenous leukemia, acute lymphoblastic
      leukemia, or blastic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia. II. Determine the toxicity of this
      regimen in these patients. III. Measure serum levels of topotecan at steady state and
      correlate them with any change in topoisomerase II content in leukemic blasts. IV. Assess
      whether it is feasible to correlate any upregulation of topoisomerase II expression with
      tumor response to etoposide in subsequent Phase II studies. V. Assess whether levels of
      pretreatment expression of topoisomerases I and II in leukemic cells are predictive of
      clinical response. VI. Assess whether it is feasible to develop a pharmacodynamic assay based
      on posttreatment apoptotic changes in leukemic blasts and whether this could be correlated
      with tumor response in subsequent phase II trials. VII. Determine the response in patients
      treated with this regimen.
