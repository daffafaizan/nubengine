      patients were divided into 4 groups. Patients in group 1 were using rivaroxaban (20
      patients), patients in group 2 were using apixaban (20 patients), patients in group 3 were
      using edoxaban (20 patients), and group 4 was the control group (5 volunteers). Iohexol (60
      ml) was used as a contrast agent. Two tubes were used to collect 2 ml of blood from the
      patients at 4 hours after the drug dose (rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban) and 1 hour after
      the contrast CT (CT was performed 3 hours after the drug was taken). In the control group, at
      any time and 1 hour after contrast CT, 2 tubes of 2 ml of blood were collected. The
      anticoagulant properties of rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban were evaluated using
      anti-factor Xa levels.
