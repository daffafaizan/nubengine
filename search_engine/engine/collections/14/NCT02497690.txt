      they undergo cochlear implantation surgery or hearing aid fitting followed by aural
      rehabilitation therapy in the first three to four years of life. High quality therapy,
      however, may not be available in many areas. This study will assess the effectiveness of
      post-cochlear implant or hearing aid fitting ART delivered by means of telemedicine
      technology. This will be accomplished primarily by evaluating subjects' language abilities
      using the 5th Edition of the Preschool Language Scales.
