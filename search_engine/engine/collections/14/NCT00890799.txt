      malformation and constitutes over 20% of all congenital cardiac disease. Though conventional
      surgery for VSD is a widely accepted procedure with minimal operative mortality, it carries a
      small but definite risk of morbidity and mortality associated with cardiopulmonary bypass and
      surgical closure. The newly appeared transcatheter device closure technique provides an
      alternative to surgical closure. However, the mid-to-long term effects of this technique
      using occluders is not clear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and
      effectiveness of transcatheter closure of perimembranous ventricular septal defects using
      septal occluders.
