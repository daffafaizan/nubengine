      double-blind, randomized control trial. All participants will complete a baseline interview,
      a medical screening and follow-up interviews at 1, 3 and 6-months post-baseline. These
      interviews take approximately 60 minutes, and survey various areas of the participants'
      experiences, including basic demographic information, mood, sleep and substance use areas.
      All participants will also be asked to complete a 2-night sleep monitoring at the time of the
      baseline interview and again at the 1-month follow-up interview. Participants will also
      receive study medication; half of the participants will receive a placebo medication, and the
      other half will receive Trazodone, a widely-prescribed, well-tolerated, low side-effect
      medication. Neither the participant nor the study staff will know which medication the
      participant is taking while the participant is actively enrolled in the study. This
      information can be available to the participant at the end of his/her study participation.
