    
      Comprehensive coagulation assays using recently popular rotational thromboelastometry
      (ROTEM), factor Xa/thrombin/plasmin generation test, and coagulation wave analysis and
      recently developed flow chamber system under blood flow conditions (T-TAS®) will be used. A
      bypassing agent, aPCC (Feiba®) and recombinant factor VIII (Advate®) will be added ex vivo to
      whole blood and plasma samples from patients with hemophilia A with inhibitors to compare
      with the coagulation effects of aPCC in the presence of factor VIII and those of aPCC in its
      absence under the conditions close to the physiological condition. Furthermore, the
      difference in the coagulation effects by the difference in inhibitor epitopes will be
      examined.
