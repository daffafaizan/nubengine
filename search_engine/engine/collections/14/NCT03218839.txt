      potential to have a major impact on reducing HIV incidence in areas with high HIV prevalence
      and low prevalence of male circumcision, as is the case in Zimbabwe. Male circumcision
      devices have the potential to accelerate VMMC scale-up as the procedure is faster and simpler
      and can be safely performed by nurses. However, fear of social stigma and desire to avoid HIV
      testing remain potential barriers to those HIV+ men who would otherwise seek out VMMC. Study
      subjects (n=400) are HIV+ males who elect to undergo VMMC with PrePex as a study subject, and
      healthcare workers involved in implementation of PrePex on HIV+ male subjects. The aim of the
      study is to determine if PrePex can be used safely among HIV+ men with similar rates of
      adverse events to HIV-uninfected men. If so, then the barrier of mandatory HIV testing as
      part of VMMC could be removed, encouraging more men to undergo the procedure. Determining
      PrePex safety in HIV+ men would also allow both those with unknown status and those with
      positive status to undergo MC with PrePex. Determining the barriers to performing VMMC among
      HIV+ men among healthcare workers, if any, would also inform future policy.
