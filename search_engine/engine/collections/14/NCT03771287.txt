      that utilizes an adaptive directional microphone system with an automatic gain control noise
      reduction program. This hearing aid feature is intended for adult hearing aid users and its
      potential benefits of speech, vocabulary and listening development in pediatric users has not
      been investigated. Here the investigators aim to evaluate the efficacy of OSN programming in
      pediatric hearing aid users (6-12 years of age) diagnosed with a symmetrical sensorineural
      hearing loss in the mild to moderately-severe range. The investigators will use a
      double-blind randomized control methodology of two participant matched (based on age and
      audiometric configuration) groups. The first group will include pediatric patients fit with
      bilateral Oticon OPNâ„¢ behind-the-ear hearing aids with the standard Omni-directional
      microphone setting enabled. Group two will include pediatric patients fit with the same
      hearing aid model with the OSN feature enabled. Participants will undergo standard
      audiometric diagnostic testing and will be fit with the hearing aids by a licensed clinical
      audiologist. Participants are required to wear the hearing aids full time (at least 8 hours
      per day average) during the duration of the study. The evaluation measures will include
      speech recognition testing in controlled background noise and the Speech, Spatial and
      Qualities of Hearing Scale questionnaire (completed by parents/legal guardian). Testing will
      be performed within a week of the hearing aid fitting and 6-8 months post fitting.
