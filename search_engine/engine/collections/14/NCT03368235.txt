      countries, most likely Sweden, Denmark and The Netherlands involving 5-6 sites. It is
      estimated that 80-100 patients have to be enrolled to ensure the randomization target of 40.
      The study population is patients with rheumatoid arthritis on stable treatment with
      conventional disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) with an active flare. It is a
      two-arm parallel study and the randomization ratio is 1:1 to the two weeks of once daily
      treatment of 40 mg of AZD9567 and 20 mg prednisolone.

      The primary objective is to assess the efficacy of AZD9567 40 mg, compared to prednisolone 20
      mg in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis in spite of stable treatment with
      conventional and/or s.c/i.v. biological DMARDs and the primary variable is change from
      baseline in 28 joint Disease Activity Score using CRP (DAS28 - CRP). As secondary variables
      swollen and tenderness of 66-68 joints and safety variables are also included. For
      exploratively purposes there is also a biomarker program, collecting blood samples for future
      research.
