      hepatitis C after infection. Moreover, chronic hepatitis C is less well treatable in
      HIV-Coinfected than in hepatitis C monoinfected patients. There is basic research and
      clinical data on hepatitis C mono-infection supporting high sustained response rates of
      hepatitis C when treatment is started in the acute phase of infection.

      Aim of the study: To determine whether pegylated interferon therapy is effective to treat
      acute hepatitis C infection in HIV-coinfected individuals.

      Methods: Prospective, open-label, historical controlled trial. Eligible subjects are treated
      over 24 weeks with a pegylated interferon at standard dose. Weight-adjusted ribavirin
      comedication is recommended for HCV-genotypes 1 and 4. Treatment will be withheld for 12
      weeks in order to allow spontaneous resolution in subjects with clinical symptomatic
      hepatitis C infection.
