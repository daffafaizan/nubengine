      Tomography (FFOCT) technology, which allows to image fresh tissues up to a depth of a few
      hundreds microns. The system is a microscope coupled with an interferometer. A halogen light
      source is used to illuminate the tissue specimen and a reference mirror. The light retro
      diffused by the specimen is combined with the light reflected by the mirror, and the
      interference signal is measured. Multiple Grey scale images are obtained and automatically
      stitched to obtain a complete slide throughout the specimen. The feasibility of the technique
      has been reported in various pilot studies, as well as the absence of any potential tissue
      harm and subsequent pathological artifact caused by the process.

      FFOCT could be used as an additional detection tool for prostate cancer screening. The use of
      extended systematic trans-rectal ultrasound-guided (TRUS) prostate biopsies has led to
      over-diagnosis and over-treatment. Also, the number of unnecessary biopsies has increased,
      along with the morbidity of the procedure. Performing a "pre-pathological" evaluation of
      biopsy cores during the biopsy procedure would be of significant help to determine the nature
      of targeted areas and guide the number of biopsies to perform.

      We hypothesize that FFOCT imaging of prostate biopsy cores would allow a cancer detection
      rate not statistically different from pathological analysis.
