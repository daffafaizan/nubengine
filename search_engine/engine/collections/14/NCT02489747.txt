      aestivum L. or its bran, the investigators hypothesize that extract of wheat bran (WBE) is
      beneficial to elderly people with age-associated cognitive impairment. The investigators
      investigated the efficacy and safety of WBE on improvement of cognitive function through
      measuring the neuropsychometric assessments in adult with subjective cognitive impairment by
      a randomized clinical trial.

      Seventy participants aged from 50 to 80 years old with subjective cognitive impairment were
      randomly assigned to receive either WBE (3,000 mg/day) in this 12-week, double-blind
      placebo-controlled and parallel trial. Neuropsychological assessments including Computerized
      Neurocognitive function test (CNT), Working Memory Test (WMT), Korean Mini-Mental State
      Examination (K-MMSE), Brief Cognitive Rating Scale (BCRS), Prospective and Retrospective
      Memory Questionnaire (PRMQ), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), 36-Item of Short-Form Health
      Survey (SF-36) and blood Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were used to assess the
      cognitive function before and after the intervention.
