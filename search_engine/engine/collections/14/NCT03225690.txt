      and ethics approval. American Society of Anaesthesiologist physical status (ASA) I-III 105
      patients who undergoing major abdominal surgery in obstetric and gynaecology clinic were
      recruited to this study. Patients were randomized into the 3 groups with computerized
      randomization programme. Lumbar epidural catheter will be inserted to the all patients. After
      than anaesthesia induction will provide with 2 mg/kg propofol and 0.6 mg/kg rocuronium.
      Desflurane and N2O-O2 will use for anaesthesia maintenance. During surgical operation, 0.3
      microgram/kg/h remifentanil infusion will continuous till the end of surgery. In group I, 2
      ml serum physiologic (0.9 NaCL)will apply from epidural catheter before surgical incision. In
      group II, 1 mg morphine will apply from epidural catheter before surgical incision. In group
      III, 1 mg morphine will apply from epidural catheter at the time point of peritoneum is
      closed. Epidural patient controlled analgesia will provide with bupivacaine for postoperative
      analgesia. Postoperative pain will be assessed with numerical pain scale. Postoperative
      analgesic requirement will be calculated. Hyperalgesia will detect with algometer and von
      Frey ligaments.
