    
      This open label, non-randomized, multi-center, pragmatic study aims to establish whether
      patients with rare tumors can benefit from matched molecular therapy as dictated by their
      next-generation sequencing (NGS) results. The study leverages a remote consent and
      participation approach to open enrollment to all patients with rare tumors within the United
      States. Traditional, site-based patient consenting and participation is also available for
      enrollment to the study.

      Each participant will undergo comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) by Foundation Medicine
      Inc. (FMI) of their tumor as well as plasma circulating cell-free DNA. Plasma circulating
      cell-free DNA may be additionally collected for repeat CGP at various timepoints during the
      study.

      The CGP findings will be provided by FMI directly to the treating physician and study sponsor
      TargetCancer Foundation (TCF), with TCF presenting cases with genomic findings to the Virtual
      Molecular Tumor Board (VMTB). The VMTB will analyze the findings and provide a written report
      to the treating physician on recommended treatments and/or relevant clinical trials; the
      treating physician makes all treatment decisions. The resultant treatments and treatment
      responses will be tracked longitudinally during the term of this study, thus linking
      molecularly informed treatments to specific patient outcomes.
