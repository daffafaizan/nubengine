      The investigators will form 2 groups of 5 to 10 patients matched on their score on the sense
      of humor scale, their gender and their level of education. The participants will be asked to
      complete a series of tests measuring their ability to use humor, clinical variables and
      general functioning.

      Group 1 - experimental - will participate in a "humor group" with a one-hour group session
      per week for 6 weeks.

      Group 2 - the control group - will follow a usual treatment regimen for 6 weeks. At the end
      of the "Humor Group" of group 1, the 2 groups of patients will undergo a second series of
      tests identical to those of the pregroup. The paired patients should be randomly assigned.
      The control group will do the "Humor Group" after 6 weeks.
