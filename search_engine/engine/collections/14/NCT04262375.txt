        1. Circulating free methylated DNA immunoprecipitation and high-throughput sequencing
           (cfMeDIP-seq) can yield cancer type-agnostic predictive biomarker(s) of response and/or
           toxicity in subjects receiving this combination.

        2. The combination of oleclumab (anti-cluster of differentiation [CD]73 monoclonal
           antibody) with durvalumab (anti programmed cell death ligand 1 [PD-L1]) will demonstrate
           adequate safety, tolerability, and antitumor activity in subjects with metastatic
           non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and renal cell cancer (RCC) previously treated with
           checkpoint inhibitors.
