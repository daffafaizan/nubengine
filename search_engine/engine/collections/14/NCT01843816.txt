    
      Healthy volunteers between 18-65 ages who have no disorder that may disturb posture or erect
      position (inflammatory diseases, kyphosis, scoliosis, joint deformities)will be included into
      the study. A wall corner will be used as the measurement platform; the evaluated person will
      be positioned as described in BASMI. A rigid ruler will be placed form anterior superior
      iliac spine (SIAS) to the lateral wall, parallel to the back wall; a projection point will be
      determined and its distance from back wall will be measured (SIAS-WD). In the same position,
      projection point of the middle of the humerus head and back wall distance (shoulder-WD) and
      TWD also will be measured. The relationships between these parameters will be statistically
      assessed.
