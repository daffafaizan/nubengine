      this reason in this study the degarelix was tested in order to minimize the risk of OHSS as
      well as to improve the pregnancy rate in these patients. The use of long acting GnRH
      antagonist promotes a deep suppression of LH and consequently the activity of theca cells,
      which secrete androgens (the precursors of estradiol), and consequently the levels of
      estradiol remains low. Comparing the long acting GnRH antagonist at the first day of cycle
      with a flexible GnRH antagonist protocol in a group of patients with PCOS will be useful in
      order to establish the best way to perform controlled hyperstimulation in IVF cycles and
      minimize the risk of OHSS.
