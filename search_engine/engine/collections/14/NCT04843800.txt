      IRB approval and will be registered at Clinicaltrials.gov before it begins. Participants with
      chronic non specific low back pain (NSLBP) will be recruited from one site. On the day of the
      registration visit, the participants will meet with the research assistant to review and sign
      the consent form, give clinical and demographic data and respond to validated outcome
      questionnaires.

      The participants will then undergo a research dynamic ultrasound (US) of the lower back. One
      musculoskeletal radiologist will perform the US exams consisting of a series of 5 dynamic
      scans of both the right and left paraspinal muscles, obtained during passive flexion of the
      lower body. Following the US exam, the participants will be randomized in three groups
      (allocation 1:1). One group will receive a standardized acupuncture treatment and another
      group will receive a standardized chiropractic treatment. One treatment session per week for
      3 consecutive weeks will be provided. Following the 3 treatment sessions, at week 4, the US
      exam will be repeated and the questionnaires will be administered.

      The third group will be placed on a waiting list for 3 weeks and will be reexamined by US and
      respond to the questionnaires at week 4. Then, the participants will undergo a standardized
      therapeutic massage treatment with one treatment session per week for 3 consecutive weeks.
      Following the 3 treatment sessions, at week 7, the US exam will be repeated and the
      questionnaires will be administered.
