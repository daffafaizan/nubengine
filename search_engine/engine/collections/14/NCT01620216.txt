      I. To determine the clinical activity of kinase inhibitors using pre-clinical (in-vitro)
      activity to select individual therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate overall objective response rates (complete response plus partial response).

      II. Determine overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS).

      EXPLORATORY/CORRELATIVE OBJECTIVES:

      I. Prioritize active/aberrant kinase pathways using an in vitro inhibitor screen using
      individual primary leukemia samples.

      II. Measure "on target" in vivo kinase inhibition and signal transducer and activator of
      transcription (STAT)-5 phosphorylation and correlate with response to treatment.

      III. Perform next generation sequencing (whole exome sequencing) for complete mutational
      analysis.

      IV. Identify aberrant gene expression in primary leukemia samples from study subjects.

      V. Evaluate pharmacokinetics for each individual kinase inhibitor during therapy.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 7 treatment groups based on pre-clinical kinase
      inhibitor activity.

      GROUP I: Patients receive dasatinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      GROUP II: Patients receive sutinib malate PO QD on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      GROUP III: Patients receive sorafenib tosylate PO twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Cycles
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      GROUP IV: Patients receive ponatinib hydrochloride PO QD on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      GROUP V: Patients receive pacritinib PO BID on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      GROUP VI: Patients receive ruxolitinib PO BID on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      GROUP VII: Patients receive idelalisib PO BID on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
