    
      Adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency (ADSL) is a rare disorder of purine metabolism whose
      symptoms are mental retardation, autistic disorders, epilepsy, related to the accumulation of
      succinylpurines: succinylaminoimidazole carboxamide riboside (SAICAr) and succinyladenosine
      (S- Ado). The S-Ado / SAICAr ratio in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is correlated with the
      clinical severity: the cerebral toxicity of SAICAr is incriminated. There is no specific
      treatment.

      Based on the work of Gertrude B. Elion (1988 Nobel Prize in Medicine), who reports that
      allopurinol (a structural analogue of hypoxanthine) can be a substrate for hypoxanthine
      phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) and thus produce allopurinol ribonucleotides with as a first
      step in the de novo synthesis of purines, investigators tested the hypothesis that treatment
      with allopurinol in children with ADSL deficiency would reduce the production of the toxic
      metabolite SAICAr.

      This hypothesis was validated in 3 minor patients with biological and clinical improvement.

      So the investigators put the phase II, non-comparative study based on 4 visits to
      Necker-Enfants malades Hospital or La Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital: Month 0 (before treatment),
      Month 3, Month 6 and Month 12 after the start of treatment.

      After verification of the inclusion criteria and information of the parents or the patient or
      guardian, signature of the consent and inclusion of the patient:

        -  Clinical and neurological evaluation;

        -  Psychiatric assessment with standardized tests;

        -  Biological evaluation: determination of urinary and plasma metabolites (SAICAr, S-Ado,
           ...) Experimental treatment: Allopurinol (Zyloric®) will be administered orally for 12
           months without exceeding 400 mg / day in children and 900 mg / day in adults, with
           dosage adjustment in case of renal failure.
