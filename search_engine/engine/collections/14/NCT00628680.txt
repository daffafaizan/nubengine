      in preventing Catheter Related Blood Stream Infections (CRBSI) when used as a catheter lock
      solution in Central Venous Catheter's for Dialysis between hemodialysis treatments (3x per
      week), where CRBSI's are defined as concordant bacteria found in both the catheter and
      peripheral blood or the exit site and peripheral blood in subjects demonstrating a
      temperature greater than 38 degrees celcius.
