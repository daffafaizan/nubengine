      sleep. In contrast, preliminary data suggest that obese girls (who have high testosterone
      levels in general) demonstrate low LH frequency during the day and night during early
      puberty; but at mid puberty rapidly transition to a high LH frequency during the day and
      night. We hypothesize that in early pubertal girls with high testosterone levels, overnight
      increases of LH frequency are less prominent than those observed in early pubertal girls with
      normal testosterone levels. We will assess this using a frequent sampling protocol for
      assessment of LH pulse frequency (with sampling occurring while awake and while asleep) in
      early pubertal girls with and without high testosterone levels. Sleep will be formally
      evaluated.
