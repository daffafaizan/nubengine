      primary team as part of their medical care, the investigators will collect hemodynamic data
      from their pulmonary artery catheters and echocardiographic data. Echocardiographic and
      hemodynamic data obtained from pulmonary artery catheters will be simultaneously collected at
      baseline (within 24 hours of catheter placement) and after 24 and 48 hours of intensive
      medical therapy if the pulmonary artery catheter is still in place at those times. The
      placement of the pulmonary artery catheter and the taking of hemodynamic measurements from
      the catheter will be done as per the primary medical team. The research team will not place
      any pulmonary artery catheters.
