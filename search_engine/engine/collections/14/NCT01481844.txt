      in quadruple group . mean age was 43 in both groups. In sequential therapy group 42
      patients(84%) completed the treatment , 39 patients returned to follow up . In quadruple
      group only 33 patients (64.7%) completed the treatment , 29 of them returned to follow up.

      Compliance to the treatment was significant better in sequential group comparative to
      quadruple .Sides effects connected to gastro-intestinal tract were reported in 27(65.9%) of
      quadruple group patients and in 19(43.2%)of sequential group.

      The H pylori was eradicated in 23 of 39 patients in sequential group(59%), and in 19 of the
      29 patients in quadruple group(65.5%). no comorbidities like smoking, diabetes or other
      influenced the efficacy of eradication.

      Sequential therapy showed the same eradication rate as second line treatment of H pylori as
      quadruple one, but was associated with better compliance and less adverse effects.

      Both treatments protocols failed to show an appropriate eradication rate in population of
      Southern Israel .
