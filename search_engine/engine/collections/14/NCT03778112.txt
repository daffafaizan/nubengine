      RT regimens consist of 8-9 weeks of daily RT. Recent data support the use of hypofractionated
      RT (5-6 weeks) due to similar disease control in a contracted treatment time. This study
      combines the benefits of RT dose escalation while shortening the overall RT treatment course.

      In this protocol, patients will undergo a pretreatment mpMRI prostate scan and be stratified
      to two separate SBRT regimens depending on whether prostate lesions are present. For patients
      without any positive mpMRI lesions, an SBRT monotherapy (36.25 Gy in 5 fractions) approach
      will be utilized. Patients with an equivocal or positive mpMRI lesion(s), will receive
      IG-IMRT (45 Gy in 25 fractions) to prostate and seminal vesicle +/- lymph nodes followed by a
      SBRT whole prostate boost (18 Gy in 3 fractions) with a simultaneously integrated boost (SIB)
      (21 Gy in 3 fractions) to intraprostatic lesion(s) only.

      Patients will be regularly assessed every 3 months for the first 2 years and then every 6
      months, indefinitely. Side effects will be monitored using the standardized international
      prostate symptom score (I-PSS) and Sexual Health Inventory of Men (SHIM) questionnaires at
      baseline and subsequent follow-up appointments.

      Hypothesis: MRI-guided treatment planning and delivery can selectively target high-risk
      prostate cancer nodules and deliver a higher effective RT dose, to achieve maximal tumor
      control without increasing toxicity, all in a shortened treatment duration.
