    
      patients scheduled for modified radical mastectomy and axillary dissection under general
      anesthesia (GA) will be included in the study. The patients will be randomly allocated by a
      computer-generated table into one of the two study groups.Thoracic paravertebral block group
      (TPV group) and combined erector spinae and pecto-intercostal fascial plane blocks group
      (ES-PI group).

      0.25% bupivacaine and 1 mg dexamethasone will be injected with different volumes in each
      block.

      The first time to ask for rescue analgesia post-operatively will be measured. Using MedCalc
      Software version 14 (MedCalc Software bvba, Ostend, Belgium), 24 patients (12 patients per
      group) were calculated for a relative difference of 10% (0.635 hours) in the time to first
      analgesic request between both groups, with a study power of 95% and an alpha error of 0.05.
      This number will be increased to 30 patients (15 patients per group) to compensate for
      possible dropouts.

      Analysis of data will be performed using the Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS)
      software, version 21 for Microsoft Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, iL, USA). Categorical data
      will be reported as numbers and percentages and will be analyzed using the chi-squared test.
      Continuous data will be checked for normality using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Normally
      distributed data will be presented as means (standard deviations) and will be analyzed using
      the unpaired student t-test. Skewed data will be expressed as medians(quartiles) and will be
      analyzed using the Mann Whitney U test. For repeated measures, a two-way repeated measures
      ANOVA will be used to evaluate block (between-groups factor) and time (repeated measures)".
      Post-hoc pairwise comparison will be performed using the Bonferroni test. A P value of 0.05
      or less will be considered significant.
