    
      The purpose of this open label study is to assess the safety and tolerability of tipranavir
      co-administered with low-dose ritonavir (500 mg tipranavir/200 mg ritonavir BID) in HIV-1
      infected patients who are triple antiretroviral class experienced with at least two previous
      PI-containing regimens.

      The safety assessment will be performed by evaluating:

        -  The frequency of treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) , all serious adverse events
           (SAEs), and additional safety laboratory parameters.

        -  The occurrence of PI class-specific AEs, such as hemorrhage, dyslipidemia, hepatic
           events, hyperglycemia, pancreatitis, and rash.

      The efficacy assessment will be performed by evaluating:

        -  The quantity of HIV-1 RNA

        -  The CD4 cell count.
