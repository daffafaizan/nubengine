    
      This is a single-site, cross-sectional, repeated measures study of healthy adult panelists
      which will investigate individual differences in the taste of a diverse set of commonly used
      pediatric liquid medications (e.g., clindamycin, prednisone, dexamethasone, mercaptopurine,
      ibuprofen, lopinavir/ritonavir, propylthiouracil) and excipients (e.g., sucrose, citric acid,
      bitter agents, salt, menthol and other odors) in tandem with genetic analysis. Because the
      medication given to pediatric patients is the whole liquid formulation (API + excipients),
      the investigators' approach will be to have panelists taste (without swallowing) what
      patients taste. Using validated psychophysical tools such as the general labelled magnitude
      scale (gLMS), the hedonic gLMS, and the hedonic 5-face scale, adults panelists will rate the
      intensity of the basic tastes, overall intensity, irritation, or palatability (hedonics) of a
      variety of pediatric drugs (with and without noseclips), along with generally recognized as
      safe (GRAS) taste and odor stimuli commonly used in basic research and/or as excipients in
      many liquid formulations These data will establish whether the palatability and flavor of
      each medicine varies among adult panelists. From these data, the investigators will determine
      a) whether the dislike of one medicine by a panelist predicts their dislike of another
      medicine in the same class or medicines with the same excipients; b) whether variation in the
      flavor and palatability ratings of each medicine relates to variation in genetic
      polymorphisms, as determined from the GWAS; and c) whether the panelists' palatability
      ratings of each medicine, as assessed by the simpler hedonic 5-face scale, is significantly
      related to hedonic gLMS ratings.
