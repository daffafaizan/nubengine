      dysfunction, reporting decreased and weakened nocturnal penile tumescence of six months
      duration or longer.

      Patients were treated at The treatment comprised 40 daily hyperbaric sessions, 5 days a week,
      in a multiplace hyperbaric chamber (HAUX-Life-Support GmbH). Each session consisted of 90
      minutes of exposure to 100% oxygen at 2 ATA with 5 minutes air breaks every 30 minutes and 1
      meter per minute compression and decompression.

      Sexual function Efficacy of the treatment was assessed using the International Index of
      Erectile Function (IIEF) questionnaire which was filled by all patients at baseline and
      within 2 weeks of the last HBOT session. In addition, assessing efficacy was the global
      efficacy question (GEQ) ("Did the treatment improve your erections?"), with a response of yes
      or no.

      Six patients underwent two MRI scans 1-2 weeks prior to and after HBOT. Imaging was conducted
      in using a 3Tesla system (MAGNETOM Skyra, Siemens Medical Solutions, , Germany). The MRI
      protocol included anatomic T1 and T2 sequences and DCE. The MRI DCE sequence parameters are
      detailed in supplementary section.
