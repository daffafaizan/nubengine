      hematological malignancies, including non Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), acute lymphoblastic
      leukemia (all) and chronic lymphoblastic leukemia (CLL). CD19 and CD20 are restricted to the
      surface of B cells. They are not expressed in hematopoietic stem cells, nor in other tissue
      cells. They exist in all stages of B cell development and differentiation. They are not lost
      from the cell surface until B cells differentiate into plasma cells. Clinical studies have
      found that CD19 and CD20 are excellent targets for immunotherapy of B-cell malignancies.The
      purpose of this study was to observe the efficacy and safety of treatment for patients with
      relapsed or refractory CD19 / CD20 positive B cell line hematological malignancies.
