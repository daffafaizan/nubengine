      the world and increasing quickly. The investigators recently evaluated an after-school
      program of recreational physical activity to control obesity and other cardiovascular risk
      factors in primary school children in Cuenca. This program, known as the Movi program,
      reduced adiposity, increased serum apolipoprotein (apo) A-I concentration and reduced apo B
      concentration over one-year period.

      Though the intervention MOVI had great acceptance between the children and his families, and
      it demonstrated to be effective opposite to the obesity, his results were relatively modest.
      For it, our hypothesis of work, which justifies this new project, is that a major intensity
      of the intervention, and a major weekly duration extending this one to the weekend, it might
      improve the efficiency on the obesity.
