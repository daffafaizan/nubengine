    
      This is an 8 hospital repeated measures Randomized Controlled Trial design using a centrally
      controlled cluster random allocation of units with stratification by hospital. The sample
      consisted of the 16 hospital units that implemented the EPIQ intervention in the CIHR Team in
      Children's Pain study. Randomization was restricted so there was one intervention unit and
      one standard care unit at each site. Outcomes were measured at 3 time points:12 months after
      the completion of the EPIQ intervention: Baseline (Time 1); 12 months following the
      implementation of the Booster intervention (Time 2); and 36 months following the
      implementation of the Booster intervention (Time 3), including the frequency and proportion
      of children receiving pain assessment and management strategies, children's pain intensity
      during painful procedures, and health care professionals' perceptions of the context of
      sustainability.
