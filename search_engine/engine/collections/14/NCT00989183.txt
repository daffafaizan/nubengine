        -  Measurements of FSH, estradiol, inhibin B, AMH, white-blood cells for telomere length,
           measurement of hemoglobin A1C to control for blood glucose levels

        -  AFC as determined by transvaginal ultrasound exam

        -  skin autofluorescence measurement

        -  subjects then undergo surgery with their primary care gynecologist

        -  determination of ovarian PF number by modern morphometric methods
