      United States, more than three million patients, and 700.000 in Italy, have cardiac failure
      and its most common cause is ischemic heart disease. The major goal to improve post
      infarction LV function would be the stimulation of neovascularization and the enhancement of
      regeneration of cardiac myocytes within the infarcted area. Recent experimental studies
      suggest that bone marrow-derived progenitor cells (BMCs) or circulating endothelial
      progenitor cells (cEPCs) contribute to the regeneration of infarcted myocardium, to enhance
      neovascularization of ischemic myocardium, to prevent cardiomyocyte apoptosis, to alter scar
      formation by reducing the development of myocardial fibrosis and, thereby, to improve cardiac
      function.

      G-CSF is a hematopoietic cytokine produced by monocytes, fibroblasts and endothelial cells.
      G-CSF is known to have multiple functions in normal, steady-state hematopoiesis. It is
      routinely used to mobilize CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells from the BM into peripheral blood,
      thus enabling their easier collection compared to BM aspirate procedure. The proven efficacy
      and safety of G-CSF, both in healthy donors and patients with haematological disease, along
      with favourable results from studies of CD34+ cell transplantation in patients with MI or
      ischemia, suggest that G-CSF based BMC transplantation may have an efficacy in patients with
      MI.
