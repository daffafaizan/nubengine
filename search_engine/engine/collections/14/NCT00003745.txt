      I. Determine the response rate in children with recurrent or refractory brain tumors,
      sarcomas, or neuroblastomas treated with topotecan. (Brain tumor and neuroblastoma strata
      closed to accrual effective 07/02/2001) II. Assess the toxicity of this regimen in a larger
      group of patients treated at the currently defined maximum tolerated dose.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive topotecan IV continuously on days 1-21. Treatment continues at least every 4
      weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

      Patients are followed every 3 months.
