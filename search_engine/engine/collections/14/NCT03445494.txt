      surgery, the patient will be randomized into group A (brace) or group B (normal sling).

      Both groups will then perform only passive movements according to pain for the first 6 weeks
      supported by the physiotherapy, according to standard therapy. The following six weeks
      passive movements will be associated with active movements . No brace nor normal sling will
      be used anymore.

      Patients are in study for 6 months. During this period quality of life and pain
      questionnaires are submitted to the patients and a MRI will be done at the end of the study.
