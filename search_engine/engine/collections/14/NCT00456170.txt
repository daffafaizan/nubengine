    
      Patients booked for vaginal hysterectomy at Southern Health will be offered participation in
      this trial, and randomised to two separate groups: procedure using ultrasonic shears or
      traditional sutures. Each patient will receive detailed explanation in document form as well
      as from the Gynaecology registrar in pre-admission clinic prior to obtaining consent.

      After the procedure of vaginal hysterectomy, a research associate will follow these patients
      up until discharge, collecting relevant data.

      A statistician has been employed to perform power calculations, and to analyse data after
      collection, looking at outcomes mentioned above.

      The Harmonic Scalpel has been extensively used to replace the use of traditional clamping and
      suturing in General Surgery, Laparoscopic surgery, and specifically Total Laparoscopic
      Vaginal Hysterectomies, but it has never been subjected to a randomised control trial to
      confirm the anecdotal benefits of the device.
