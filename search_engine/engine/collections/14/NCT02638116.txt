    
      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), single-center,
      sequential-design drug interaction study to assess the effect of omeprazole on
      pharmacokinetics of ibrutinib and metabolite PCI-45227 in healthy participants. The study
      mainly consists of 3 Phases: Screening Phase (within 21 days prior to the first dose of study
      medication), treatment Phase, and a follow up Phase (10 to 12 days after the last dose of
      study medication). In the treatment Phase, participants will receive Ibrutinib 560 milligram
      (mg) orally (4 x 140 mg capsules) on Day 1 and Day 7. participants will receive Omeprazole at
      a dose of 40 mg tablets orally once on Days 3 through 7. The total duration of study for each
      participant will be approximately for 29 to 32 days. Blood samples will be collected for
      evaluation of pharmacokinetics of Ibrutinib. Participants' safety will be monitored
      throughout the study.
