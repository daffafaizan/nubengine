    
      Patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis with evidence of disease activity
      defined as at least one relapse or at least one new MRI lesion during the year prior to
      inclusion will be included in the study.

      Eligible patients will be randomised for daily treatment with either oral omega-3 fatty acid
      (Triomar™) or placebo. After six months all patients will in addition receive interferon-beta
      1a (Rebif™) 44 mcg subcutaneous three times per week for another 18 months.

      The patients will undergo monthly contrast enhanced MRI for the first nine months and
      thereafter at months 12 and 24. They will also be examined by clinical and laboratory tests
      at six months intervals in addition to month 9 (3 months after start of IFNB treatment).
      Fatigue and QoL registration will be performed at baseline and at months 6, 12 and 24. Tests
      for circulating neutralising antibodies against interferon-beta will be performed during the
      study.
