    
      A single arm, open-label pilot study is designed to determine the safety, tolerability and
      engraftment potential of CAR-GPC3 T cells in patients with GPC3-positive hepatocellular
      carcinoma.

      Primary objectives:

      Determine the safety, tolerability and cytokinetics of the autologous T cells transduced with
      the anti- GPC3 lentiviral vector in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.

      Secondary objectives:

      Make a preliminary evaluation on the efficacy of CAR-GPC3 T cells in patients with
      hepatocellular carcinoma by the following parameters:

      Objective response rate (ORR); Disease Control Rate (DCR); Time of tumor progression (TTP);
      Overall survival (OS).
