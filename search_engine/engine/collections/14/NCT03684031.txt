      associated with social problems, such as dating violence and workplace violence. High trait
      anger is a personality construct characterized by elevations in the frequency, duration, and
      intensity of anger episodes. However, the cognitive processes contributing to high trait
      anger are still poorly understood. According to the Integrative Cognitive Model of Anger and
      Reactive Aggression (ICM), three cognitive processes jointly contribute to the experience of
      high trait anger and reactive aggression: 1) hostile interpretation biases; 2) cognitive
      control; and 3) anger rumination. The proposed study will evaluate the validity of this model
      in relation to cognitive control using a computer-based cognitive control training (CCT)
      program.
