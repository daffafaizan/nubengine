      Primary Objectives:

      To evaluate each assay performance for its ability to detect LRRK2, its activity and/or the
      detection and activity of the pathways it impacts using a variety of different approaches
      (quantitative western blot, immunoassays and LC-MS). Assay performance will be assessed and
      those demonstrating high sensitivity and consistency will be considered for further
      development.

      Secondary Objectives:

      To assess the ability of the assay or a combination of assays to differentiate pathogenic
      LRRK2 variant manifesting and non-manifesting carriers, idiopathic PD and healthy
      non-carriers.
