    
      Based on the results of collaborative and translational (human-animal) work, investigators
      wish to conduct the first prospective study that would allow:

      (i) To assess the incidence of Neurogenic paraosteoarthropathies (clinical suspicion and
      radiological confirmation). The prospective nature of this clinical data collection will make
      it possible to avoid the biases attributed to the retrospective studies conducted to date.

      ii) Early detection of patients at risk of developing Neurogenic paraosteoarthropathies,
      using specific biomarkers and clinical parameters. Early diagnosis could prevent
      complications and functional impact of Neurogenic paraosteoarthropathies.

      Investigators have chosen to restrict population to patients most at risk of developing
      Neurogenic paraosteoarthropathies as a result of the central neurological event in order to
      have 2 populations appear at the end of the study: a population with Neurogenic
      paraosteoarthropathies and a population without Neurogenic paraosteoarthropathies that can be
      compared.
