      tapering over 6 weeks. Half of the subjects will be randomized to concomitant 6-MP 1-1.5
      mg/kg/day and half will receive concomitant placebo treatment. During the entire course of
      the trial all subjects will receive maintenance treatment with 5-ASA in an oral dose of at
      least 2 gram per day. Subjects will be subjected to one colonoscopy at baseline and one
      sigmoidoscopy in week 52 in order to assess endoscopic disease activity.

      Data will be collected using electronic case report forms (eCRF) with Castor EDC. Quality and
      data validation procedures will be applied to ensure the validity and accuracy of the
      clinical database. Monitoring of the study will be done according to the GCP guidelines and
      following a monitoring plan. The financier of the study, ZonMw Goed Gebruik Geneesmiddelen,
      has the right to perform an audit if seen necessary.
