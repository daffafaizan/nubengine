      ecteinascidin 743 in pediatric patients with refractory solid tumors. II. Determine the
      pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients. III. Determine the antitumor activity of
      this drug in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      pretreatment (pretreated vs less heavily pretreated). Patients receive ecteinascidin 743 IV
      over 3 hours on day 1. Treatment continues every 3 weeks in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of
      ecteinascidin 743 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as
      the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting
      toxicities.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-20 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
