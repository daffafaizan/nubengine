      symptoms of ET and improve quality of life. To-date, unilateral MRgFUS has been beneficial in
      providing patients with some of relief from tremor. However, tasks that require two hands
      remain a challenge for many patients. Historical risks of bilateral treatment have been an
      impediment to complete tremor relief. The introduction of MRI and current stereotactic
      methodologies has significantly reduced the probability of non-target tissue injury. In this
      study, a second MRgFUS thalamotomy will be performed in a cohort of patients who have already
      successfully undergone unilateral MRgFUS treatment. Tremor severity, speech, balance, gait,
      and cognition will be assessed during baseline and follow up visits.
