      Studies suggest that glucocorticord-based immunosuppression regimens hasten the onset and
      progression of recurrent chronic HCV liver disease. Treatment of acute allograft rejection
      with steroid boluses is also associated with rapid HCV recurrence. The relative contribution
      of various calcineurin inhibitors to recurrent HCV liver disease has not been established.
      Previous retrospective studies, as well as prospective studies have not demonstrated a
      difference in recurrent HCV liver disease rates between patients receiving CsA or tacrolimus
      immunosuppression regimens respectively.
