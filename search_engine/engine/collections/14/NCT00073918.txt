    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the progression-free survival of patients receiving 131 I labeled tositumomab
      antibody, etoposide (VP-16) and cyclophosphamide (CY) followed by autologous transplantation.

      II. To examine the potential efficacy of 131 I labeled tositumomab antibody, etoposide
      (VP-16) and cyclophosphamide (CY) followed by autologous transplantation.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the overall survival of patients receiving 131 I labeled tositumomab antibody,
      etoposide (VP-16) and cyclophosphamide (CY) followed by autologous transplantation.

      II. To evaluate the toxicity and tolerability of the above therapy.

      OUTLINE:

      RADIOIMMUNOTHERAPY: Patients receive a test dose of iodine I 131 tositumomab intravenously
      (IV) on day -24 to determine biodistribution. Patients then receive therapeutic iodine I 131
      tositumomab IV over approximately 40-60 minutes on day -14 and are entered into radiation
      isolation until day -4.

      CHEMOTHERAPY: Patients receive etoposide IV on day -4 and cyclophosphamide IV on day -2.

      AUTOLOGOUS STEM CELL TRANSPLANTATION: Patients undergo autologous peripheral blood stem cell
      transplant on day 0.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months and then
      annually thereafter.
