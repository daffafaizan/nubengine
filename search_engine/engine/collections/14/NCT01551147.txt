      challenge in subjects with asthma. Patients will be required to have EAR and LAR after
      standardized allergen challenges during the screening. Eligible patients will complete a
      randomized, double-blind, three-way crossover study. During each of three evaluation periods,
      patients will be administered either 200 mg ONO-6950, 10 mg Montelukast, or placebo for 8
      days. Each evaluation period will occur over 8 days and will include various assessments
      following allergen challenge and methacholine challenge. The study does not require an
      overnight stay at the clinical research center.
