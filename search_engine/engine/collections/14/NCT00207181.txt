      to good health and a reduced risk of a multitude of diseases. Currently physical activity and
      health promotion research is limited by self- report data that is confounded by participants'
      ability to accurately remember and record their physical activity. A potentially new method
      of accurately assessing moderate-intensity physical activity is called context sensitive-
      ecological momentary assessment (CS-EMA). Mobile computing devices (personal computing
      devices, PDAs) that automatically identify when a specific type of physical activity (e.g.,
      moderate-intensity physical activity) is being performed has the potential to provide
      valuable objective data for naturalistic, experimental, and clinical intervention research
      purposes, and has the potential for educational, recreational, and clinical applications. The
      goal of this exploratory study is to assess the accuracy of two methods of collecting data on
      moderate-intensity physical activity. The study will compare the use of a paper diary to
      collect self-reported data on moderate-intensity physical activities performed throughout the
      day to self-reported data collected using ecological momentary assessment methods which are
      facilitated by a PDA that cues the participant to record when specific intensity levels of
      physical activity are achieved. This study will also develop algorithms that will
      automatically identify specific types of physical activities being performed. The data
      collected from the heart rate monitor, motion sensor, and information requested directly from
      the participant via the PDA interface will be used to train pattern recognition systems to
      classify the intensity and type of physical activity being performed by the participant. This
      study will contribute to research on context- awareness and human activity recognition.
