      chemotherapy refractory colorectal cancer. A recent pre-clinical study has shown that Tas-102
      may have activity as a radiation sensitizer in bladder cancer cell lines. Benefit of single
      agent Tas-102 against chemotherapy refractory colon cancer and the drug's promise a
      radiosensitizer make Tas-102 a potential candidate drug for testing in combination with
      radioembolization using Yttrium-90 resin microspheres in patients with liver-dominant
      chemotherapy-refractory mCRC. This is a phase I dose escalation study with a dose expansion
      arm designed to evaluate safety of the combination of Tas-102 and radioembolization using 90Y
      resin microspheres for patients with chemotherapy-refractory colon or rectal adenocarcinoma
      metastatic to the liver.
