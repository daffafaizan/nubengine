      placebo in children and adolescents with Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS). OXT has already been
      proven safe and effective in a treatment study of socialization and disruptive behavior in
      adults with PWS and is being used in infants with PWS in an ongoing clinical trial. The
      investigators hypothesize that OXT will be superior to placebo and have a positive effect on
      child and adolescent PWS eating and repetitive behaviors, and social cognition. If proven
      superior, this data will add to the current knowledge that OXT is a beneficial treatment with
      minimal side effects for PWS symptoms. Additional knowledge of OXT's ability to reduce
      overeating could lead to improvement of patient's quality of life and physical health and
      reduction in familial stress.

      The investigators propose a randomized double blind 8 week treatment trial of intranasal OXT
      vs. placebo in 24 subjects aged 5 to 18 years with PWS in order to assess IN-OXT's affect (1)
      Eating behaviors (2) Repetitive and disruptive behaviors (3) social cognition measures and
      (4) Salivary OXT levels and plasma levels of ghrelin, pancreatic polypeptide and leptin. The
      investigators will determine if IN-OXT reduces eating behaviors in addition to improving
      social cognition and reducing repetitive/disruptive behaviors in children with PWS. If
      superior to placebo, this data will add to the current knowledge that OXT is an effective
      treatment for hyperphagia as well as other problematic symptomatology of PWS.
