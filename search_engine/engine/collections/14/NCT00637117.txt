      in application of local radiotherapy is the relative short duration of response and as a
      consequence is used mainly for palliation. Therefore novel therapies are needed to improve
      the outcome of patients with lymphomas. The potential specificity of the immune system to
      recognize and eliminate tumor cells is especially relevant in lymphoma. Immune responses are
      induced, coordinated and regulated by dendritic cells (DCs), the most potent
      antigen-presenting cells. Based on the central role of DCs in initiating immune responses,
      four vaccinations will be administered at intervals beginning two days after low dose
      radiation is given to the tumor site.
