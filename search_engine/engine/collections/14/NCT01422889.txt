      stent. It is designed for improved performance specific to deliverability and radio-opacity
      while maintaining a similar drug release profile of the TAXUS Express and TAXUS Liberté
      stents. Following PMA approval from the FDA for the ION™ Paclitaxel-Eluting Platinum Chromium
      Coronary Stent System the ION US Post-Approval study will compile real-world clinical
      outcomes data for the ION™ Paclitaxel-Eluting Platinum Chromium Coronary Stent System in
      routine clinical practice. Post-approval studies of drug-eluting stents (DES) provide an
      opportunity to observe and assess patient outcomes and technology performance in a real-world
      setting.
