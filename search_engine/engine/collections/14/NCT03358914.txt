    
      The present study will examine the psychometric properties of a preliminary 41-item version
      of the PsoTeenQOL. The preliminary PsoTeenQOL has been developed based on qualitative
      interviews of adolescents (12-17 years) with psoriasis, their parents, and health
      professionals working within the field, as well as literature reviews and existing
      questionnaires. Face and content validity has been established through subsequent cognitive
      interviews with the target group.

      Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and analysis of differential item functioning (DIF) will be
      used to further refine the PsoTeenQOL questionnaire by selecting the most appropriate items.
      In addition, indicators of reliability (internal consistency; test-retest reliability),
      validity (construct validity, criterion validity; discriminant validity), and responsiveness
      will be evaluated.
