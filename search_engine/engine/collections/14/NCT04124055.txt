      Measuring pharmacokinetic variability of anti-tuberculosis (TB) drugs and responding by dose
      correction will allow individualized treatment to improve microbiological response, curb
      acquired drug-resistance, protect and extend the efficacy of novel drugs rolled-out to
      endemic areas (pharmacovigilance), reduce toxicity to patients and lead to treatment duration
      shortening.

      Aims and Objectives:

      Implement Dried Blood Spot (DBS) collection for performance of high-performance liquid
      chromatography (HPLC) to optimize multidrug resistant TB (MDR-TB) treatment in Tanzania.
      Simultaneously, provide a proof-of-principle-demonstration that the developed saliva point of
      care drug assay for measurement of fluoroquinolone concentration works in a field setting.

      Methods:

      This will be a phase II prospective diagnostic study among patients from a national referral
      of MDR-TB in Tanzania. The investigators anticipate recruiting a minimum of 50 study
      participants to power for the primary aim. Subjects will have a minimum amount of blood and
      saliva collected for therapeutic drug monitoring and the investigational drug assays
      respectively. Expected results include agreement of saliva point-of-care and DBS for
      measurement of fluoroquinolone concentrations in HPLC. Other important findings related to
      field-testing include the best time for sample collection within the dosing interval and the
      algorithmic use of DBS and saliva, and clinical - demographic factors such as HIV
      coinfection, concomitant drugs, and diabetes mellitus that may influence the saliva drug
      assay results. Performance characteristics (sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive
      predictive values) of the saliva point-of care (PoC) and DBS will be calculated as a
      measurement of accuracy with reference to the gold standard.
