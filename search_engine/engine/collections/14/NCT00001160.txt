      thyroid cancer using established best standard of care and new techniques and approaches as
      they are developed. Study subjects will include adults and children with thyroid nodules
      requiring diagnostic imaging and fine needle aspiration biopsy, surgery, radioiodine scanning
      or therapy, appropriate follow up, consisting of tumor markers monitoring and anatomical and
      functional imaging. The limitations and significance of serum thyroglobulin (Tg) measurement
      for diagnosing tumor recurrence will be assessed. The study will permit a continued
      evaluation of the risk/benefit ratio of already established methods of administering
      radioiodine therapy, including the impact of pre-treatment dosimetric calculations,
      individualizing treatment with radioiodine. Under this protocol, samples of benign nodules
      and cancer tissue specimens for research studies will be collected. Data and samples
      collected during routine clinical care will be used to address research questions utilizing a
      number of approaches including microscopy, immunohistochemistry, proteomics and molecular
      analysis. All research studies will relate to the diagnosis, natural history and therapy of
      thyroid tumors, regulation of thyroid function, and the effects of thyroid function on the
      body. Blood and urine specimens will be collected for research studies in both the
      hypothyroid and euthyroid state.
