      evaluate with the following assessment tools: Demographic datas; age, gender, height, body
      mass, year, side and level of limb loss will be recorded. Gait parameters (step length,
      variation of step length) will evaluate with Gait Trainer Biodex 2, at participant's
      preferred speed. To eliminate the learning effect, participants practiced at treadmill to
      determine appropriate gait speed. Once participants implied the preferred speed, they asked
      to walk at their self selected speed for 6 minutes. Data was recorded between the 4nd and 6th
      minutes at walk.
