      be done remotely. It is not necessary to live in San Diego or visit UC San Diego to
      participate in the study.

      YBCS who are interested in the study will be provided access to an online screening survey to
      determine eligibility. Eligible YBCS who consent to the study will be followed for 24 weeks.

      Following a one-week study run in, YBCS participants will be randomized to the SCPR
      intervention or control arms and receive the corresponding interventions.

      All YBCS participants will complete 3 study time points at enrollment, 12 and 24 weeks. At
      each time point, they will complete a web-based study questionnaire on medical and
      reproductive health. YBCS participants will also daily track their hot flashes via text
      messaging. YBCS participants will designate a healthcare provider with whom they would
      discuss reproductive health issues.

      Designated healthcare providers will be approached to participate in the study. Those
      providers who enroll will complete 2 study assessments at weeks 0 and 24. At each study time
      point, HCP will be assessed for preparedness on managing reproductive health issues by a
      web-based questionnaire.
