      Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which results in deterioration of lung function and, eventually,
      death. In this study, we hope to improve our understanding of the innate immune response to
      infection by strains of P. aeruginosa that express type III cytotoxins and to delineate
      better the role of modifier genes in disease progression.

      We will examine relationships between the patient's clinical course, the presence of
      antibodies to P. aeruginosa, and single nucleotide polymorphisms in suspected CF modifier
      genes.
