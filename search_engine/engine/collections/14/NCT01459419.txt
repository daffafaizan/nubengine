      days. Up of 9 subjects will be treated at each dosage level, and up to 9 subjects will
      receive placebo buffered in normal saline that is used as diluents for the MAb. One 20mg
      tablet of Omeprazole (a proton pump inhibitor) will be taken orally as part of the study drug
      cocktail in order to neutralize stomach pH for enhancing stability of the MAb. During the
      treatment period, subjects will ingest the study drug/s every day for 30 days, and will be
      followed for clinical and laboratory effects. Subjects will be followed up to Day 60 (30 days
      after termination of treatment)
