    
      Aim of this study is to evaluate in a population of old osteoporotic chronic kidney disease
      females the effect of denosumab:

        -  on bone mineral density (femoral T-score) (by bone densitometry) at 24 months

        -  on bone mineral density evolution (femoral T-score) (by bone densitometry) after 24
           months of follow-up

        -  on bone mineral density evolution (lumbar T-score) (by bone densitometry) after 24
           months of follow-up

        -  on coronary and abdominal aorta calcification scores evolution (by multiple detector
           computed tomography and plain abdominal X-ray) after 24 months of follow-up

        -  on parameters of bone remodelling (OPG, RANKL, sclerostin, DKK-1), of mineral and
           calcium metabolism (FGF23 Ct, Klotho, PTH, 25(OH) vitamin D3, phosphorus, calcium, bone
           alklaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, CTX), of inflammation (CRP) after 24 months of
           follow-up

        -  on cardiovascular morbidity (cardiovascular events) and mortality after 24 months of
           follow-up

        -  the tolerance after 24 months of follow-up
