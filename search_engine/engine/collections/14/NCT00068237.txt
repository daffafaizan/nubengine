        -  Determine the reproducibility of the surgical technique of submandibular salivary gland
           transfer in patients with head and neck cancer.

        -  Determine the rate and severity of radiation-induced xerostomia after this surgery in
           these patients.

        -  Determine the pattern of recurrence, disease-free survival, and overall survival of
           patients treated with this surgery followed by radiotherapy.

        -  Determine the quality of life of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients undergo surgical transfer of the submandibular salivary gland to the submental
      space.

      Within 4-6 weeks after surgery, patients undergo radiotherapy once daily, 5 days a week for 5
      Â½ to 7 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Salivary scans are performed before surgery, at 2-3 weeks after surgery, and then at 6 months
      from the start of radiotherapy.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and at 3, 6, and 12 months from the start of
      radiotherapy.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years and then
      annually.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 11-48 patients will be accrued for this study within 1.6 years.
