      available and as such, there remains an urgent need for a collaborative approach to
      streamline patient care and optimize use of hospital resources. This study will focus on
      management of MBO in advanced gynecological cancers.If patients with MBO can be effectively
      managed in an ambulatory setting, this may improve quality and consistency of patient care,
      and help reduce volume and duration of bed occupancy.
