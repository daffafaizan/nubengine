      States. At present pharmacologic treatment, although beneficial, is not curative. Certain
      nonpharmacologic treatments have assisted caregivers of AD patients by reducing their stress
      and burden, and others have aided patients, by improving their mood and physical functioning.
      Comprehensive, individualized approaches to improving Alzheimer's patients' symptomatology
      and caregiver stress and burden have not been systematically investigated in Alzheimer's
      patient care. This study seeks to train and counsel caregivers as well as develop an
      individualized, comprehensive management program that will seek to enhance the functioning of
      each patient participant.

      Patients are randomly placed into one of two groups. Both groups receive memantine and
      comprehensive evaluations at baseline, 4, 12,28 and 52 weeks. Additionally, group 1 receives
      an individualized management program, which consists of home visits to get the patient
      exercising, doing enjoyable activities and cognitive stimulation, educational sessions for
      caregivers on coping with difficult situations and a caregiver support group to help with
      questions and emotional concerns.
