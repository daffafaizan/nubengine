      2020 will be evaluated and classed as low risk patients (groupe LR) or not low risk patients
      (NLR) after coronary angiography evaluation. High risk criteria will include age >80 years,
      severe comorbidities, unstable hemodynamic or rhythmic state requiring specific therapeutic
      intervention, failure of reperfusion or unsatisfactory result of angioplasty, patients with
      residual coronary lesions requiring further revascularization, left ventricular ejection
      fraction <40%. Patients who have not received optimal antithrombotic treatment during
      angioplasty for any reason will also be considered at high risk, as will patients at risk of
      bleeding due to antecedent or associated pathology or taking a long-term anticoagulant
      treatment. For the specific case of SCA with ST segment elevation, they will all be included
      in the group, except for patients who have been successfully reperfused less than 3 hours
      after the onset of pain or who have an open artery during coronary angiography performed
      within the first 3 hours.

      Our primary endpoint is to compare the percentage of patients with at least one serious
      clinical event between the high and low risk groups. A serious event is defined by the
      occurrence within 7+/-5 days of one of the following criteria: death all causes, serious
      neurological or hemorrhagic complications, hemodynamic instability and severe heart failure,
      rhythm or sustained or poorly tolerated conduction disorders requiring therapeutic
      intervention, chest pain recurrence requiring new coronary angiography, any secondary
      transfer to intensive care for any reason. Secondary endpoints include evaluation of adverse
      events (all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, unplanned hospitalization for cardiac and
      non-cardiac causes) at 1 month follow-up in the 2 groups, length of hospitalization of the
      two groups, calculation of the average number of serious events per patient The low-risk
      group event rate is estimated at 3 percent without any fatal events. It is estimated at 15
      percent in the high risk group.

      Assuming a frequency of the event of 3% in the low risk group and 15% in the high risk group,
      it is necessary to include at least 269 patients, including 196 patients in the high risk
      group and 73 patients in the low risk group (for a power of 90% and an alpha risk of 5%).

      Our hypothesis is that low-risk patients, about 1/3 of ACS admission in ICU, will have very
      few events and no fatal events and that they don't need intensive care admission
