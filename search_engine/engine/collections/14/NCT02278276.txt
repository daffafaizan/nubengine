      SG1002 given twice daily will be safe and will improve circulating levels of hydrogen sulfide
      and/or nitrite in heart failure subjects. In addition, secondary endpoints such as 6 minute
      walk distance, Minnesota heart failure questionnaire, biomarkers of inflammation and
      oxidative stress and cardiac remodeling will be assessed.
