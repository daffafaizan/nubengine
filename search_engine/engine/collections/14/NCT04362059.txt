      requiring ventilator support is that endogenous surfactant is dysfunctional. This could be
      due to decreased concentration of surfactant phospholipid and protein, altered surfactant
      phospholipid composition, surfactant protein proteolysis and/or oedema protein inhibition of
      surfactant surface tension function and/or oxidative inactivation of surfactant proteins.
      Variations of these dysfunctional mechanisms have been reported in a range of lung diseases,
      including cystic fibrosis and severe asthma, and in child and adult patients with ARDS. Our
      studies of surfactant metabolism in adult ARDS patients showed altered percentage composition
      of surfactant PC, with decreased DPPC and increased surface tension-inactive unsaturated
      species, and decreased concentrations of both total PC and phosphatidylglycerol (PG)

      The SARS-CoV-2 virus binds to the angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor, which is
      preferentially expressed in the peripheral lung ATII cells. Consequent viral infection of
      ATII cells could reduce cell number and impair the capacity of the lungs to synthesise and
      secrete surfactant. This, however, has not yet been demonstrated empirically in COVID-19
      patients. If this is the case, then exogenous surfactant administration to the lungs is
      potential one treatment option to mitigate disease severity in these patients.
