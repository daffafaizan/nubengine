      cardiovascular diseases. The date include information on the hyperlipidaemia treatment,
      clinical characteristics, any treatment modalities and prognosis in this population. Data
      collection is patient-based (not event-based).

      The study population is formed by all-comer patients hospitalized in cardiology wards and
      intensive cardiac care units with a diagnosis of coronary disease, both stable angina, and
      acute coronary syndromes (ACS). For the purpose of this study hyperlipidaemia is defined in
      accordance with European Society of Cardiology guidelines.

      Complete patient demographics; medical history, complete hospitalization data (diagnostic and
      therapeutic), in-hospital and out-hospital results are collected in an electronic form by the
      attending physician. The patients are under constant follow-up for all cause mortality and
      major adverse events.
