    
      The drug being tested in this study is called sapanisertib (MLN0128). Sapanisertib is being
      tested to determine the effect of a single 40 mg dose on the electrocardiographic measure of
      the time between the start of the Q wave and the end of the T wave in the electrical cycle of
      the heart (QT)/rate corrected QT (QTc) interval in patients with advanced solid tumors. This
      study will look at electrocardiogram (ECG) results before and after a single dose of
      sapanisertib.

      The study will enroll approximately 30 patients. All participants will receive a single 40 mg
      dose of sapanisertib capsules on Day 1. Participants may continue to receive sapanisertib for
      up to 1 year at a dose of up to 30 mg once weekly if a clinical benefit is being derived.

      This multi-centre trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to
      participate in this study is up to 14 months. Participants will make 6 visits to the clinic
      and end of study visit 30 to 40 days after last dose of study drug for a follow-up
      assessment. Participants that continue treatment with sapanisertib will continue to make
      additional visits to the clinic once or twice every 4 weeks and the end of study visit 30 to
      40 days after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.
