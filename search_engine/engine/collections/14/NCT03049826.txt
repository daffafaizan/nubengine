      (registry study) of malnutrition among all children with cancer, admitted during a two year
      period, and a clinical trial to evaluate the effect of a standardized nutrition protocol for
      children undergoing SCT. Nutritional status is assessed before, during and one year after
      treatment with SCT.

      The subjects are 140 children and adolescents (2-17 years) being treated for cancer and a
      subgroup of 25 patients treated with SCT at Oslo University. The results will be compared
      with a reference group of 25 patients treated with home parenteral nutrition as well as 50
      healthy reference persons in the same age group.

      The methods used for measurement of nutritional status are: Body composition, bone density,
      blood tests, diet record, activity detection and measurement of quality of life. The
      measurements are done on three occasions for patients with cancer and stem cell
      transplantation, and on one occasion with a reference. Information on demographics and
      medical care will be taken from journal. Growth data will be collected from health centres
      when needed. Parents' experiences of children's feeding problems will also be examined.
