      radiotherapy in patients with limited stage small cell lung cancer who are receiving
      combination chemotherapy. II. Determine whether the development of local recurrence and
      distant metastases are affected by the timing of thoracic radiotherapy in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified by center. All
      patients receive cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and vincristine by IV bolus alternating with
      3 days of daily etoposide IV infusion over 60-120 minutes and cisplatin IV infusion over 30
      minutes. This treatment alternates every 3 weeks for six courses. Patients are randomized to
      have thoracic radiotherapy either with course 2 (arm I) or with course 6 (arm II) of
      chemotherapy. Patients in arm I are given 1 week of rest between radiotherapy and the second
      course of chemotherapy. If there is no disease progression after chemotherapy and
      locoregional irradiation, and a repeat brain scan is negative, patients receive prophylactic
      brain irradiation. Patients are followed monthly for the first year and then every 2 months
      thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: This study will accrue 398 patients.
