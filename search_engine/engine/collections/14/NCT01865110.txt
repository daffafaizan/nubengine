      improves progression free survival (PFS) compared to standard rituximab maintenance after
      induction treatment consisting of R-CHOP + R-HAD versus R-CHOP alone in older patients (â‰¥ 60
      year old) with mantle cell lymphoma. 643 patients will be randomized in induction phase and
      433 in maintenance phase.

      The treatments consist of two phases:

        -  induction treatment will be 3 cycles of R-CHOP21 + 3 cycles of R-HAD28(alternating)
           versus 8 cycles of R-CHOP21 alone

        -  maintenance treatment will be 13 cycles of rituximab every 8 weeks + 26 cycles of
           lenalidomide every 4 weeks vs 13 cycles of rituximab every 8 weeks.

      Patients will be followed 2.5 years after the last patient randomized for maintenance for
      final analysis. All subjects who complete or discontinue the maintenance treatment for any
      reason will be followed for at least 3 years after his/her last study treatment
      administration in maintenance period for Second Primary Malignancies (SPM). A long term
      follow-up for progression/death will be done up to the end of period of SPM data collection.
