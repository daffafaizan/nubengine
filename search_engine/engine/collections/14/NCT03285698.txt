      clinical outcomes of DermACELL® compared with Integra® Bilayer Wound Matrix in dermal
      regeneration. A total of 100 subjects will be randomized into either the DermACELL® (n=50) or
      Integra® Bilayer Wound Matrix (n=50) treatment group. An interim analysis will be performed
      when both groups have enrolled 25 subjects. Subjects will receive either DermACELL® or
      Integra® Bilayer Wound Matrix in the operating room for coverage of deep soft tissue defects
      in the lower extremity. Subjects will then be followed in the outpatient clinic. Once the
      neodermis has been sufficiently generated, a split thickness skin graft (autograft or
      allograft) will be applied in the operating room. The split thickness skin graft application
      site will be then followed to observe viability.
