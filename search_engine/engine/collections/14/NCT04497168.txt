      cognitive decline, an important component of Parkinson dementia. In Parkinson disease,
      low-range cortical Abeta plaque levels associate with serotonin terminal losses. Multicenter
      Parkinson disease observational findings show that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
      (SSRIs) associate with lower dementia conversion risk and different cerebrospinal fluid
      Abeta-42 levels. This study aims to test the hypothesis that citalopram use in Parkinson
      disease will reduce visuospatial cortex Abeta plaque accrual, leading to an amelioration of
      longitudinal visuospatial cognitive decline linked to Parkinsonian dementia. The study will
      test this hypothesis in a randomized placebo-controlled trial of citalopram 20mg daily over
      26 months in Parkinson disease subjects (age â‰¥65) without depression (n=58).
