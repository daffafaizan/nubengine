      inhibitory and facilitatory activity evokable in the motor cortex. Studies in several diverse
      disorders of basal ganglia outflow and cortical regulation show an alteration in the
      direction of decreased inhibition or increased facilitation. In general, these have been
      quite small, data from different interstimulus intervals have been pooled for analysis, and,
      therefore, disease and state-specific information may have been missed. A deeper
      understanding of what this technique can tell us about pathological and normal cortical
      regulation requires detailed studies within populations looking for correlations between
      physiological and clinical/behavioral variables and large, uniform, head-to-head comparisons
      between clinical populations. This proposal contains a project that combines the
      correlational and comparative approaches in Parkinson's disease and healthy individuals. Data
      from this project will then be comparable to future similar studies in other disorders.
