      surgery. There may be many different reasons why some people get atrial fibrillation after
      their heart surgery. These reasons may include that a person is older or that he/she is
      taking certain types of medications before surgery. Genes may also be a reason. Genes contain
      the material passed from parent to child that determines the make-up of the body and mind.
      For example, some genes control the color of your hair or eyes. Some people may have genes
      that make it more likely for them to get atrial fibrillation after their heart surgery. This
      research project is being done to find out if the cells of people who develop atrial
      fibrillation after heart surgery are different from the cells in people who do not develop
      atrial fibrillation after surgery.

      This study seeks to identify regulatory events in atrial myocyte transcription and
      translation that are altered by germline variation
