      evaluate the antileukemic efficacy in AML, ALL, and CML-accelerated and blastic phases in
      terms of complete response (CR) rate, response duration, and survival; and (2) analyze the
      relationship between cellular uptake and retention of clofarabine triphosphate (the active
      metabolite), inhibition of DNA synthesis, and clinical outcome.
