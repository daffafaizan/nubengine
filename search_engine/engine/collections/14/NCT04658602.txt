    
      Molar incisor hypomineralization can represent a serious and challenging clinical management
      problem. Children with MIH require higher levels of treatment needs and demonstrate
      considerable management problems.

      For most severely affected MIH molars, direct esthetic restorative materials or preformed
      metal crowns will be the treatments to choose between. A number of aspects which could
      support decision-making, however, are not clearly demarcated. First and foremost, it is not
      clear if both treatments are similarly acceptable for patients and providers.
