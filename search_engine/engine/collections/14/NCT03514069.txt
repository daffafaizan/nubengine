    
      Primary Objective

      Arm 1:

      To determine Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ruxolitinib with radiation (2 Gy x 30) in
      patients with unmethylated MGMT high-grade glioma (HGG)

      Arm 2:

      To determine Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ruxolitinib with radiation (2 Gy x 30) and daily
      temozolomide at 75 mg/m2 in patients with methylated MGMT high-grade glioma (HGG)

      Secondary Objective(s)

      Arm 1:

        -  Safety of combination of ruxolitinib with radiation

        -  Progression free survival (PFS)

        -  Overall survival (OS)

      Arm 2:

        -  Safety of combination of ruxolitinib with radiation and temozolomide

        -  Progression free survival (PFS)

        -  Overall survival (OS)

      STUDY DESIGN

      A phase 1 design will be used with cohorts of 3 patients treated at each dose level in both
      arms 1 and 2 and monitored for treatment-related toxicities. Escalation to the next dose will
      proceed in the absence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs).
