      risk factor for the maintenance and development of various disorders in childhood. When the
      child is diagnosed of a disease, disorder or difficulty, parents can develop a series of
      beliefs that will mediate their PEs, their barriers and their emotional repertoire. It can
      worsen the family climate, lead to maladaptive behaviors, and finally, lead to difficulties
      in adherence to treatment due to possible avoidance patterns. Several studies indicate that
      these patterns are mediated by a regulation of dysfunctional emotions in parents by not
      tolerating the discomfort caused by the suffering of their children.

      This project aims to validate a web-based clinical intervention for families with children
      suffering neurodevelopmental or behavioral disorders to promote psychological flexibility and
      emotion regulation strategies in parents. Clinical intervention is focused in improving
      emotion regulation and positive parenting strategies using third-wave/contextual therapies.
      The intervention consist in 6 sessions with a duration of 1.5 hours. This study compare a a
      face-to-face parenting intervention group with a web-based parenting intervention. The first
      hypothesis is that both parental interventions will improve the educational styles, emotional
      competencies and well-being of parents in pos-test and 3-month follow up assessment. Second,
      web-based intervention will be more efficient in comparison with face-to-face intervention.
