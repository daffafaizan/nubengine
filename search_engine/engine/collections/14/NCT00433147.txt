      storage disorder. Afegostat tartrate (also known as AT2101 or isofagomine tartrate) is
      designed to act as a pharmacological chaperone by selectively binding to misfolded
      Î²-glucocerebrosidase (GCase) and helping it fold correctly, intended to restore GCase
      activity. The study consisted of a 14-day screening period, a 28-day treatment period, and a
      7-day wash-out period. Participants received 1 of 4 dosing regimens for afegostat tartrate.
