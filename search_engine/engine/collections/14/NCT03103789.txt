      original single channel MI catheter advanced through the working channel of the endoscope.
      Measurements will be taken at 3 locations for 5 seconds each. The catheter will then be
      removed and a custom-designed balloon assembly will be inserted through the working channel
      of the endoscope. The balloon assembly will expand to a maximum diameter of 2 cm spanning
      from the distal to mid esophagus and contain external metal contacts to form 40 impedance
      channels made up by 10 axial channels spanning a 10 cm axial area and four radial
      channels.This design will allow us to measure mucosal impedance both axially and radially
      thus enabling us to assess the discriminating ability of the device for reflux disease. The
      balloon assembly will be held in place for 5 seconds. Once the mucosal impedance data have
      been recorded, the balloon assembly will be deflated and removed by the investigator. The
      study procedure will add approximately 1-3 minutes of procedure time for each research
      participant.

      Those participants who are diagnosed with Grade C or D esophagitis at the initial visit will
      return for a follow-up visit after treatment with proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy to
      determine whether or not esophagitis has healed as part of their standard of care. If no
      esophagitis is detected at the follow-up EGD, we will gather one final comparison MI reading
      during this visit. If esophagitis is still present, follow-up MI will not be performed.
