      RTXM83 combined with CHOP is non inferior to the response rate obtained with reference
      rituximab combined with CHOP.

      The present study is a non inferiority trial and the study hypothesis is the following: H0:
      pc ≥ pe + δ vs. H1: pc < pe + δ where, pe: proportion of successes in the experimental group
      (RTXM83+CHOP) pc: proportion of successes in the control group (Reference Rituximab+CHOP)
      Type I error: the difference pc-pe is less than δ when in fact the difference is greater than
      or equal to δ ie, the investigators choose the experimental treatment when the control
      treatment is actually substantially better.

      Type II error: the difference -pe is greater than or equal to δ when it is actually lest than
      δ ie, the investigators choose the control treatment when the experimental treatment is
      essentially just as good.
