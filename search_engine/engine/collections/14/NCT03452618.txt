    
      Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the most common motor neuron disease. The diagnosis of
      this diaphragmatic dysfunction in the ALS subject is done all too often on the occasion of a
      hospitalization for acute respiratory insufficiency, which aggravates then the prognosis of
      the patients.

      The presence of these factors at diagnosis will allow more surveillance to detect early
      diaphragmatic insufficiency and establish a NIV (Non Invasive Ventilation), the only
      therapeutic measure definitely improving the quality of life and survival of patients. A
      clinical score will be established to determine the risk of early Non Invasive Ventilation
      (NIV) equipment.
