      research objects are continuously recorded. The final subgroups are blind to neurological
      evaluators, data inputers and statisticians.

      The research is a continuous observational exploratory study. All patients with ischemic
      stroke admitted to Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science
      and Technology from April 1, 2017 to December 31, 2021 will be included. According to the
      current situation, it is expected to enroll approximately 5000 of eligible patients for
      long-term follow-up observation.

      We'll use multiple linear regression analysis model to study factors and confounding factors
      and their interaction. And we will control the confounding factors, and make a quantitative
      description of the relationship between factors and outcome variables.

      Missing cases will be treated as censored values, and the ratio of missing cases will be
      recorded. All samples will be analyzed by Intent-to-Treat (ITT) analysis. In the analysis, if
      the results are statistically significant, the missing cases in the exposed group will be
      deleted, and the missing cases in non-exposure group be added. If the results are still
      statistically significant, then the missing cases are defined as not affecting the analysis
      results.

      If the heterogeneity of data is large, the objects will be analyzed in subgroups according to
      age or sex.

      If the missing rate is greater than 20%, it is necessary to analyze the sensitivity of the
      whole sample.
