      ecchymosis are not complications, they are natural outcomes of surgical trauma. However,
      periorbital edema prevents pupil examination and causes the patient to experience fear and
      anxiety with accompanying ecchymosis. Periorbital edema rate after anterior craniotomy was
      36.8-100%, ecchymosis rate was 62.5%, and 30% of patients with edema did not have a pupil
      examination for the first 36 hours after craniotomy.The present study was carried out to
      determine the effects of the heparinoid creams and regular cold application performed using
      gel packs in controlling periorbital edema and ecchymosis after craniotomy.
