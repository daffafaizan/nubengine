    
      -  Principal Objective: comparison of peri-incisionnal dynamic hyperalgesia extend
           evaluated by Von Frey filament during the first postoperative week between the two
           groups.

        -  Secondary Objective: comparison of peri-incisionnal static hyperalgesia (pain threshold)
           extend evaluated by Von Frey filament, postoperative pain scores, morphine consumption,
           hemodynamic and respiratory parameters during the first postoperative week and incidence
           of chronic pain and dysesthesia at six month between the two groups. Ropivacaïne
           plasmatic concentration will be monitored, during infusion.

        -  Study design : monocentric, double blind randomized clinical trial comparing two groups
           of patients with a same intraoperative anesthetic management :

             -  Group 1: Ropivacaïne infiltration before skin incision followed by a 48 hours
                Ropivacaïne continuous infusion after surgery through a sternal fenestrated
                catheter

             -  Group 2: same protocol with pre and postoperative saline infusion

      Postoperative pain management is identical in the two groups based upon a Morphine sulfate
      PCA pump for the first 48 hours.

      • Number of subjects : 40 patients, 20 in each group
