      pyronaridine artesunate in Korea. A comparative study was implemented using chloroquine as a
      comparator. The comparator in this study, chloroquine, is recognized as an effective and
      well-tolerated anti-malarial therapy, and is standard blood-stage therapy for subjects with
      P. vivax malaria in Korea. It was anticipated that the study results would be pooled with the
      results of study SP-C-006-06 entitled "A Phase III multicenter, randomized, double-blind,
      double-dummy, comparative clinical study to assess the safety and efficacy of a fixed-dose
      formulation of oral pyronaridine artesunate (180:60 mg tablet) versus chloroquine (155 mg
      tablet), in children and adult patients with acute Plasmodium vivax malaria" for a formal
      non-inferiority analysis.
