      walking performance and fear of falling in older adults and to evaluate the feasibility of
      the virtual gait training. This prospective interventional study plans to include twelve
      residents of senior assisted living facilities in Basel, Switzerland, aged 65 years or older
      with no severe physical or cognitive disabilities, and who had fallen at least once in the
      preceding 12 months. Each participant will complete 14 12-minute virtual gait training
      sessions within a three-week period. Gait parameters will be quantified with the GAITRite®
      electronic walkway system, and fear of falling evaluated with the Falls Efficacy
      Scale-International version. The investigators hypothesize that 14 virtual gait training
      sessions in older adults over a three week period will both improve gait parameters as
      measured by a GAITRite® electronic walkway system, and reduce their fear of falling as
      measured by the Falls Efficacy Scale-International version.
