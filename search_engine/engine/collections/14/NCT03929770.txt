      catheter arrive exactly at the right ventricle or not.

      The hypothesis of this study is that the intended pause during advancement of Swan-Ganz
      catheter in the right ventricle induce failure in advancing of it into the pulmonary artery,
      and that it increase the required time for final placement of it into the pulmonary artery.
