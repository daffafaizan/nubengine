      peritoneal cancer is maximal cytoreductive surgery followed by intravenous chemotherapy with
      or without intraperitoneal chemotherapy (IP). Recently, the organizations of SGO and ASCO
      recommended that women with a high perioperative risk profile or a low likelihood of
      achieving cytoreduction to < 1 cm of residual disease (ideally to novisible disease) should
      receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

      Hyperthermia promotes chemotherapy to penetrate deeper into the cancer tissue. Therefore,
      hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) as neoadjuvant chemotherapy and
      postoperative chemotherapy after interval debulking surgery in the treatment of ovarian
      cancer could lead to higher response rate and better survival outcomes.
