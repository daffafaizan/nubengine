        -  Compare the effects of active stress reduction with transcendental meditation vs basic
           breast cancer education on quality of life and survival time in older women with stage
           II, III, or IV breast cancer.

        -  Determine behavioral mechanisms that may mediate the effects of stress reduction on
           survival in these patients.

        -  Determine baseline variables that contribute to predicting survival time in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, single blind (to medical staff), multicenter study. Patients
      are stratified according to age and participation in support groups. Patients with stage IV
      disease are also stratified according to type of metastases (visceral vs non-visceral) and
      timing of metastases (first diagnosis vs recurrence). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2
      treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive usual medical care and instruction on stress reduction using
           transcendental meditation (TM), which involves a standard 7-step course. Patients attend
           training for approximately 1-1.5 hours per session for a total of 6 sessions over 1
           week, while receiving usual medical care. Patients then practice TM twice a day for 20
           minutes. Patients attend group meetings for approximately 90 minutes once or twice
           monthly for 6 months to ensure proper technique and understanding.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive usual medical care and basic literature on breast cancer.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and then every 6 months for up to 3 years.

      Patients are followed monthly for up to 2.5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 166 patients (83 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 6 months.
