      (+8°C ) versus a external thermo neutral application (+32°C) up to 72 hours post application.

      The study is divided in two projects:

      Project A: This study is focusing on the recovery process after a max. jump performance (3x30
      counter movement jumps). Directly after the exercise subjects receive a cooling or
      thermo-neutral application. Recovery characteristics measured by vertical jump performance
      (objective) and delayed onset muscle soreness and rated perceived exertion (subjective) are
      measured in function of time up to 72 hours post cooling intervention.

      Project B: This study is focusing on the effect of 20 min. cooling or thermo-neutral
      application on the M. quadriceps femoris performance (MVC). After the thermo-application, the
      60% endurance MVC is measured by means of surface EMG (OT Bioelettronica 10-750 Hz) in a
      ergometer chair 90° degrees knee flexion (Cor 1 Bioelettronica). Muscle conduction velocity,
      MVC (objective), delayed onset muscle soreness and rated perceived exertion (subjective) are
      measured in function of time up to 72 hours post thermo-application.
