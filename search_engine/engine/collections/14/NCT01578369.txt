      incontinence (UI). Studies have found that Pelvic Floor Mucle Trainig (PFMT) is effective in
      preventing and reducing UI during pregnancy and after childbirth. However, in a recent study,
      no effect was found when PFMT were taught in a general fitness class without former palpation
      of the pelvic floor muscles (Bo y Haakstad, 2011).
