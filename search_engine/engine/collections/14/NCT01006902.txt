      patients age 65 or older will be asked to participate. Cancer patients asked to participate
      will be receiving cancer therapy with the intention of providing a cure. Functional change
      will be assessed from the time of diagnosis, through therapy to the early post therapy time
      frame. A comprehensive model explaining reasons for function change is used as the framework
      for choosing variables to measure. Components of function that will be measured include a 6
      minute walk test, lower extremity muscle strength, a Short Physical Performance Battery
      assessing function of legs and a test that simulates typical household activities. Surveys
      will be used to subjects own assessment of their activity and function. The four most common
      cancer-related side effects will be measured and include fatigue, sleep impairment, shortness
      of breath and pain. Some markers in the blood may be abnormal and be related to declines in
      function. They will also be measured. Differences in function over time will be determined
      and relationships between function, cancer-related side effects and quality of life will be
      assessed.
