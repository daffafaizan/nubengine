      adrenal cortex characterized by cortisol deficiency with or without aldosterone deficiency,
      and androgen excess. The severe or classic form occurs in 1 in 15,000 births worldwide, while
      the mild non-classic form is a common cause of hyperandrogenism. The discovery of
      glucocorticoid therapy as a treatment for CAH occurred in the 1950's resulting in patients
      with classic CAH surviving to live a normal lifespan. However, existing treatment is
      suboptimal and many unresolved clinical problems exist. Standard hormone replacement often
      fails to normalize the growth and development of children with CAH, and adults may experience
      iatrogenic Cushing syndrome, hyperandrogenism, infertility or the development of the
      metabolic syndrome. Chronocort, a newly-developed formulation of hydrocortisone, results in a
      slow release of hydrocortisone that is designed to mimic the normal cortisol circadian
      rhythm. This new medical strategy, physiologic cortisol replacement, offers the prospect of
      an improved outcome of treatment. Chronocort has been safely given to healthy adult males in
      pharmacokinetic studies. This first ever study in patients with CAH is a
      pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic study comparing Chronocort to Cortef, the conventional
      immediate-release form of hydrocortisone.
