    
      Subjects who were going to undergo bronchoscopy for hemoptysis or suspected lower respiratory
      diseases including endobronchial tuberculosis (Tb), NTM-PD, or endobronchial lung cancer (LC)
      were enrolled after informed consents.

      Subjects who were supposed to receive bronchoscopy to rule out endobronchial lesions were
      also enrolled as control group (ctrl) after informed consents. In those control group,
      endobronchial tuberculosis, malignancy or other certain respiratory diseases was not clearly
      suspected.

      Before acquiring respiratory specimens, bronchoscopic channels were washed to acquire
      negative control in all cases of groups.

      In Tb group and LC group, specimens of normal bronchial mucosa near suspicious endobronchial
      lesion were obtained with protected brush (PB), then specimens of abnormal bronchial mucosa
      in suspicious endobronchial lesion with PB. After acquiring respiratory specimens of PB,
      bronchial washing was done in suspicious endobronchial lesion.

      In NTM-PD group, specimens of bronchial mucosa in bronchus of suspicious NTM-PD with PB.
      After acquiring respiratory specimens of PB, bronchial washing was done in bronchus of
      suspicious NTM-PD.

      In hemoptysis group, bronchial washing was done in bronchus of ongoing bleeding.

      In control group, specimens of bronchial mucosa in predetermined random bronchus (not
      bronchus with suspicious endobronchial lesion) with PB. After acquiring respiratory specimens
      of PB, bronchial washing was done in the same bronchus.

      Microbiome in lower respiratory species was analyzed using 16S rRNA sequencing.
