      days. The cycle duration is 42 days. Patients will continue study treatment as long as
      clinical benefit is possible or until disease progression, unacceptable adverse reaction,
      patient's decision to stop treatment, or other reason of discontinuation. After study
      treatment discontinuation patients will return to the study site 30 days after the last
      administration of SAR440234 for end of treatment assessments. Patients without documented
      disease progression at the end of a treatment visit who have not yet started treatment with
      another anti-cancer therapy will proceed with monthly follow-up visits until initiation of
      another anti-cancer therapy, disease progression, or study cut-off date, whichever comes
      first.
