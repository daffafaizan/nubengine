      measurable disease, median 6 cycles of chemotherapy, there were 4 confirmed complete
      responses (CRs) and 23 confirmed partial responses (PRs), with the overall response rate of
      67.5% (95% confidence interval, 52.7 ~ 82.3) in intention-to-treat analysis. Ten patients
      underwent surgical resection after 4 ~ 9 cycles of chemotherapy. Four pathologic CRs were
      identified. With a median follow-up of 14 months (range, 1 to 28), median time to progression
      was 7.7 months, and median overall survival was 16.9 months. The DXP chemotherapy was highly
      active for the 1st-line chemotherapy of AGC (Kang et al, Proc Am Soc Clin Oncol 22,328.2003).
