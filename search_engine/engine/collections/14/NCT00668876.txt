      infectious complication in patients with gastrointestinal surgery. It has also been
      recognized that Th1/Th2 balance shifts toward Th2 by surgical stress. On the other hand, the
      change of Th17 status after surgery has not been established. Furthermore, The change of
      Th1/Th2 balance and Th17 status with immunonutrition on pancreaticoduodenectomy have not been
      reported yet.

      Objective of this study is to investigate the effects of perioperative immunonutrition on
      incidence of postoperative infectious complication, Th1/Th2 balance and Th17 status after
      pancreaticoduodenectomy.
