      surgeons replace the torn ligament during ACL reconstruction surgery. Surgical trauma
      initiates an acute inflammatory response, including swelling and pain, that leads to
      restricted joint motion and loss of function. Because of the dynamic nature, complexity and
      redundancy of the chemical mediators of inflammation and pain and their pathways, no
      currently available single drug has sufficiently broad spectrum of activity to effectively
      inhibit the inflammatory process. OMS103 provides a multicomponent approach to controlling
      the inflammation induced by arthroscopic surgery. It delivers three active ingredients, each
      with distinct pharmacological activities, directly to the site of surgical procedures to
      preemptively block the inflammatory cascade induced by surgical trauma.
