    
      This is a randomized, blinded trial in which 40 women, aged 18-30 years, will be randomized
      into 2 groups: Stimulation and Exercise Group (SEG) - will perform an exercise protocol
      associated with stimulation in the vastus medialis (VM) and gluteus medius (GM) muscles.
      Exercises Group (ExG) - will perform the same protocol of exercises of the previous group,
      however, without association with neuromuscular electrical stimulation. The intervention will
      occur twice a week for eight weeks. All volunteers will be submitted to the evaluation of the
      electromyographic activity of the VM, the GM and the vastus lateralis, the dynamometric
      parameters, the intensity of the pain and the functionality, in four moments: 72h hours
      before the beginning of the intervention; after 4 weeks of intervention; after 8 weeks of
      intervention; after 16 weeks from the start of the intervention (eight weeks after the end of
      the protocol). In this way, the investigators will investigate the applicability of the
      proposed trial with the use of neuromuscular electrical stimulation and identify the effects
      of this resource in the treatment of PFP.
