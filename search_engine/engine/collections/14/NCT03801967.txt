      ascending dose sequential-group design study. The study will be conducted in healthy Japanese
      participants and performed at a single study center. Fourth-five healthy Japanese
      participants are planned to be included in the study and up to 5 additional participants may
      be enrolled into the study if replacement participants are needed.

      Three cohorts consisting of 9 participants each will participate in the study. Depending on
      the findings, up to 2 additional cohorts may be added if the Safety Review Committee (SRC)
      considers it necessary to repeat a dose level or if additional dose steps are required.

      Within each cohort, 6 participants will be randomized to receive AZD9977 and 3 participants
      randomized to receive placebo.

      Each participant will receive AZD9977 at the selected dose level or placebo on Day 1 and from
      Day 3 to 9, with single dose on Day 1 and Day 9 and twice a day (BID) dosing on Day 3 to Day
      8. No dose will be given on Day 2.

      The study will comprise of:

        -  A Screening Period of maximum 28 days;

        -  A Treatment Period during which participants will be resident at the Clinical Unit from
           the day before Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) administration (Day -1) until at
           least 48 hours after IMP administration; discharged on Day 11, and

        -  A Follow-up Visit within 5 to 7 days after the last IMP dose. Each participant will be
           involved in the study for approximately 6 weeks.
