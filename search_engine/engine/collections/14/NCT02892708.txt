      radiation therapy.

      However in patients 70 and older, surgery is not systematic, before radiotherapy. Moreover,
      at these ages, surgery is likely to be less well tolerated in general terms.

      The aim of this study is to try to determine the best treatment between radiation therapy
      associated with the surgical treatment and care by radiotherapy alone, after a brain biopsy.
      This is a randomized, two arms, multicenter, open study.

      In the two weeks following the radiological diagnosis of a lesion highly suggestive of a
      high-grade glioma, patients will be randomized to either arm surgery (partial or complete
      excision) + radiotherapy or in the radiotherapy alone arm. Within 5 weeks after surgery
      (biopsy or excision), all patients will receive treatment with focal radiotherapy.

      A central review blades and MRI data will be organized after the inclusion of patients.

      A maximum of 135 patients will participate in this trial.
