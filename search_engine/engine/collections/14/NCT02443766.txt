      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in healthy subjects within one month of entering
      the retreat. The study uses DaTscan to measure the effect on serotonin and dopamine
      transporter binding, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure the effect
      on cerebral blood flow. The Ignatian Retreat is a weeklong retreat which involves meditation
      and prayer.

      Additionally, study participants will complete a variety of questionnaires and scales to
      measure psychological and spirituality states. The scans and questionnaires will be completed
      before and after the participant has completed the retreat. The ultimate goal of the study is
      to analyze and compare pre and post imaging and neuropsychological and spirituality changes
      in healthy controls who participate in this retreat.
