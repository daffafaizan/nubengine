      on their itch. Rumination is a maladaptive method of responding to distress, in which the
      individual thinks obsessively about the source of distress. The rumination on chronic itch in
      eczema can have detrimental effects on one's quality of life, as well as induce significant
      anxiety about when itch will return, how long it will last, and how it will affect physical
      and social functioning.

      Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is a frontline treatment for rumination, as it focuses on
      teaching strategies so that the individual can examine distressing thoughts objectively and
      determine their validity, replace negative thinking patterns with more adaptive thought
      patterns, and increase the individual's awareness to their problematic thought patterns.
      Additionally, CBT helps the individual to implement behavioral strategies to cope with
      possibly anxiety-inducing situations, such as scratching while trying to go to sleep.

      The investigators hypothesize that an Itch CBT intervention is an effective,
      non-medication-based, easy to implement strategy to improve itch in children with eczema.
