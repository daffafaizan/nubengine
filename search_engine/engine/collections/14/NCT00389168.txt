      echocardiography. Extensive echocardiographic examinations, ultrasonography of the carotid
      arteries, 24h Holter registrations, 24h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring monitoring,
      neurohormones and blood samples for inflammation and hemostasis markers and endothelial
      function were done at weeks 0, 12, 24, and 48. Matched control groups (1:3, i.e. 38
      normotensive subjects and 38 hypertensive subjects with no signs of hypertensive heart
      disease were examined at one occasion. All patients obtained irbesartan or atenolol for 12
      weeks; a diuretic and a calcium antagonist was added when needed thereafter in order to
      obtained a blood pressure below 140/90 mm Hg. All analyses were performed central in a core
      laboratory.
