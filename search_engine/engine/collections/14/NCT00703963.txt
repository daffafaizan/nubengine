      valves have excellent hemodynamic performance and durability. However, mechanical valves are
      thrombogenic, necessitating lifelong anticoagulation. Hazards of anticoagulation include
      bleeding when it is excessive or thromboembolism when the intensity of anticoagulation is
      below the recommended level. Monitoring the level of anticoagulation is accomplished by
      analyzing the International Normalized Ratio. Until recently, this was performed at medical
      laboratories or hospitals, but recent literature suggests that patient self-testing of oral
      anticoagulation improves patient compliance, medical outcomes, and quality of life.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the time in therapeutic range of patients who
      self-test their INR compared to patients receiving the usual care. Additionally, we will
      evaluate the educational components and corollaries of self-testing.

      Two hundred consecutively enrolled adults, having undergone implantation of a mechanical
      heart valve, will be randomized to either self-testing or usual care. Those randomized to the
      self-testing group will undergo self-testing instruction prior to hospital dismissal. For
      three months after hospital discharge, subject will record their INR results obtained by
      self-testing or as prescribed by their primary physician. They will then submit the record of
      the INR results and complete a survey.
