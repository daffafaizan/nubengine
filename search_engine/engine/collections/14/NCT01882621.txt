      Patients are randomly assigned into the experimental group and control group based on
      segmented block randomized method. After enrollment, patients should complete four or six
      chemotherapy and GM1/placebo injection. During the 3w per cycle chemotherapy, cisplatin
      injection is conducted in D1/D1-3, GM1/placebo (80mg+250ml N.S) is injected from D0 to D3.
      Neurotoxicity evaluation and quality of life (FACT-NTX and EROTC scale) assessment will be
      conducted every cycle and 3w/11w/19w after the chemotherapy.
