      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety
      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating
      Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT). "Investigational" means that the drug is being
      studied.

      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved bevacizumab for Hereditary
      Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT), but it has been approved for other uses.
