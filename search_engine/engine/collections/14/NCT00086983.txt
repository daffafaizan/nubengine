      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose of XL119 given in conjunction with oxaliplatin.

      II.To determine the dose limiting toxicities of this combination. III. To determine the
      pharmacokinetics of these 2 agents when given in combination.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive rebeccamycin analogue IV over 1 hour on days 1-5 and oxaliplatin IV over 2
      hours on day 5. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of rebeccamycin analogue and oxaliplatin
      until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose
      preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. At least
      6 patients are treated at the MTD.

      Patients are followed annually for survival.
