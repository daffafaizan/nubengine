      neurological disorder. The diagnosis of these diseases is essential because, unlike the
      so-called neurodegenerative diseases, metabolic diseases are often accessible to specific
      treatments.

      Conversely, many patients are followed for a complex neurological disease of unknown cause.
      We hypothesize that a significant proportion of these patients carry yet undetected inborn
      error of metabolism.

      Recently, the use of Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMRS) has uncovered new
      metabolic diseases leading sometimes to specific treatments. However, the place of this
      technique in the investigation of patients with complex neurological diseases remains to be
      determined.

      The primary goal of this project is to assess the interest of NMRS in urine and CSF to search
      metabolic abnormalities, not detected by conventional biochemical techniques. It is an open
      study. The study will be conducted in close collaboration between the neurology and genetic
      departments of the Pitié-Salpêtrière hospital, on the one hand and the nuclear medicine
      department of Poitiers in the other. 250 patients will be included over a period of 2-3 years
      and will be divided into 4 groups: Group 1: patients with complex neurological disease of
      unknown cause (200 patients) for whom urines and CSF will be collected. Group 2: positive
      controls (25 patients): patients with already known metabolic disease for whom we already
      have CSF or urines. Group 3: negative controls (25 patients): patients with non metabolic
      neurological disorders of known cause hospitalized for a lumbar puncture.
