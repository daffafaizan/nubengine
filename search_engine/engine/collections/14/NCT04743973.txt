      digital application to engage in structured digital mindfulness practices daily for 3 months.
      Subjects will be requested to use the device and practice daily, but the amount of time and
      frequency daily will be to their choosing. Subjects will also complete questionnaires and
      cognitive based testing throughout participation.
