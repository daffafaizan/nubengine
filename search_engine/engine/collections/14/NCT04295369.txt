      self-help smartphone-based lifestyle medicine for improving psychological well-being in
      Chinese population. Prior to all study procedures, eligible participants will be required to
      complete an online informed consent (with telephone support). Around 30 eligible participants
      will be randomly assigned to either smartphone-based lifestyle medicine (LM group) or the
      waitlist control group (WL group) in a ratio of 1:1.
