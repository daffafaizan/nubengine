      (intervention) patients commencing anticoagulation therapy with either warfarin,
      acenocoumarol or phenprocoumon will be dosed according to a drug-specific genotype-guided
      dosing algorithm, which is based on genetic information, clinical data and (in the monitoring
      phase) previous INR. For the other arm (control) patients will be dosed according to a
      non-genotype-guided dosing regimen which does not include genetic information. The follow-up
      period per patient is 3 months. Study population: Newly diagnosed patients of both genders
      and at least 18 years old who need anticoagulant treatment with either acenocoumarol,
      phenprocoumon or warfarin within the low intensity INR range will be included in the trial.
      Main study parameters/endpoints: The % time within therapeutic INR range in the first 3
      months of anticoagulation therapy. Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with
      participation, benefit and group relatedness: Six extra blood samples are taken from each
      participant at the start of the study. Patients also have to attend 8 scheduled visits within
      the 3 months study period and are asked to fill in questionnaires. The genotype-guided dosing
      algorithm is anticipated to improve the accuracy of coumarin dosing and thus improve the
      safety and efficacy of anticoagulation therapy.
