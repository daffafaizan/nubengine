    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Feasibility/biodistribution of 99mTc-HYNIC-IL2 (technetium Tc 99
      hydrazinonicotinamide-tricine-linked interleukin 2) scintigraphy in patients with metastatic
      melanoma undergoing immunotherapy with either ipilimumab (commercial source) or
      pembrolizumab.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Correlation of tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) invasion (scintigraphy/histology) with
      tumor burden; and description of any clinical side effects associated with imaging.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Correlation of TIL invasion assessed by 99mTc-HYNIC-IL2 scintigraphy vs. histology (total
      and subsets of TIL), as well as screen for peripheral blood correlates.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 groups. COHORT I: Patients undergo technetium Tc 99
      hydrazinonicotinamide-tricine-linked interleukin-2 scintigraphy prior to receiving ipilimumab
      or pembrolizumab and at 12 weeks.

      COHORT II: Patients undergo technetium Tc 99 hydrazinonicotinamide-tricine-linked
      interleukin-2 scintigraphy prior to receiving ipilimumab or pembrolizumab, at 3-4 weeks, and
      at 12 weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30-45 days.
