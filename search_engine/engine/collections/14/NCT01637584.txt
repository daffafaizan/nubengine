      disruption of sleep, and heightened sympathovagal tone during sleep occurring early after
      trauma exposure increase the risk of developing PTSD up to one year later. (1-4). Insomnia is
      one the most common reasons for referral to mental health services in active duty personnel
      (5). In military personnel returning from Iraq and Afghanistan, more than 70 percent of those
      with PTSD report sleep problems and fatigue, whereas more than 25% percent of those without
      PTSD endorse these symptoms (6). Other disruptive nocturnal behaviors and sleep disorders
      including sleep terrors, nocturnal anxiety attacks, simple and complex motor behaviors and
      vocalizations, acting out dreams, sleep apnea, and periodic leg movement disorders are also
      frequently reported by PTSD patients (7-12). In PTSD, sleep disturbances independently
      contribute to poor clinical outcomes such as increased severity of daytime PTSD symptoms (8),
      depression (13), suicidality (13), general psychiatric distress (14), poorer quality of life
      and functioning (14), poorer perceived physical health (14), and increased substance use
      (15;16).
