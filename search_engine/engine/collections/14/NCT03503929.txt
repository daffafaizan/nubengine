    
      PHASE 1) LaparoGuard will be used as an adjunctive tool for maintaining safety during
      procedures performed by expert surgeons. The pre-operative instructions for use will be
      evaluated along with ease of procedural setup, as reported by pre-operative nurses. The
      intraoperative instructions for use will be evaluated along with system usability, as
      reported by the expert surgeons. The perceived clinical utility will be judged by expert
      surgeons. Postoperatively, the system data will be reviewed. This phase will include 4-6
      subjects.

      PHASE 2) Novice surgeons will conduct procedures alongside expert surgeons. Expert surgeons
      will establish the safe zone. LaparoGuard will record all deviations, speed and smoothness of
      tip movements. The training utility of LaparoGuard will be assessed by both the expert and
      novice surgeons. This phase will include 4-6 subjects.
