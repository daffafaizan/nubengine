    
      At the start of the study, inpatient and outpatient nurses, physicians and physicians
      assistants will be oriented to the intervention in the study and will be suggested that the
      intervention is standard of care based on the following study:

      Nagle D, Pare T, Keenen E, Marcet K, Tizio S, Poylin V*. Ileostomy Pathway Virtually
      Eliminates Readmissions for Dehydration in New Ostomates. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum
      2012; 55: 1266-1272.

      The intervention patients will be subject to a compliance surveillance and intervention
      strategy (CSIS) administered by study personnel to encourage the following and persist with
      telephone calls if the following have not been achieved.

        -  Prospective audits by study personnel to check and encourage teaching in the clinic,
           teaching on the wards, and telephone follow up occurred.

        -  A self-assessment tool for patients and families to confirm understanding of the
           education materials.

        -  Coaching of inpatient nurses taking care of ileostomy patients by WOCN and/or the
           inpatient nurse champion

        -  Call from the clinic nurse practitioner or physician's assistant within 7 days of
           discharge to review the educational materials and administer a screening questionnaire
           to identify patients at risk of dehydration. In patients randomized to CSIS, study
           personnel will ensure this phone call is made.

      The usual care arm will include no such surveillance.

      The randomized study will be powered to detect a decrease in hospital readmission rates
      (all-cause) from 25% to 5%. Secondary outcomes include readmission due to dehydration and
      patient satisfaction (Surgical-CAHPS survey)
