      precise methodology of a case-control study designed for testing the impact of environmental
      and professional exposures on the tumoral risk in SDHx-mutation carriers.

      Patients will be selected from subjects with a mutation in one of the SDHx genes. The cases
      will have developed a tumor, while the controls will be tumor-free. Controls will be matched
      to the cases according to sex, age and type of gene affected. Past exposures will be sought
      through a telephone questionnaire.
