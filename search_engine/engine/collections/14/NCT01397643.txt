      treatment in displaced olecranon fractures are the restoration of function and stability to
      the elbow joint4. The technique employed should allow preservation and reconstruction of the
      articular surface with minimal associated complications. Tension-band wiring (TBW) is the
      most recognised and commonly used fixation method, although plate fixation and intramedullary
      screw fixation are noted alternatives. Potential problems with the TBW technique are wound
      breakdown, infection, prominent metalwork, malunion and non-union. Furthermore, plate
      fixation is considered to be superior in distal/comminuted/oblique fractures and
      fracture-dislocations, with superior fracture reduction and fixation results, as well as a
      lower rate of re-operation.

      The above described fixation techniques can be employed in elderly people, although
      difficulties associated with fixation in osteoporotic bone, wound breakdown and other
      complications is reported. In these patients, fracture excision with advancement of the
      triceps is a viable option if fixation is deemed inappropriate. However, there is limited
      evidence to suggest that non-operative treatment of displaced olecranon fractures in these
      elderly patients may provide adequate functional results. In a case series of 13 patients
      (mean age 81.8 years, >5 mm fracture displacement) treated non-operatively for a displaced
      olecranon fracture, outcome scores were excellent in 11 patients and poor in one.

      Research Aim To determine if any difference exists in outcome (primary measure - DASH score)
      after one year between non-operative management AND operative treatment for olecranon
      fractures in patients 75yrs or older (≥75yrs).

      Methodology This trial involves identifying patients over the age of 75yrs (≥75yrs)
      presenting to the Edinburgh Orthopaedic Trauma Unit and Fife Orthopaedic Trauma Unit with an
      isolated olecranon fracture. Patients who consent to enrol in the trial will be randomised to
      one of two recognised treatment techniques - non-operative management in a collar and cuff
      for two weeks OR operative management using tension band wire fixation or plate fixation. The
      trial will commence once ethical approval is granted by the Lothian Research Ethics
      Committee.

      All statistical analysis was/will be performed by Dr Rob Elton. Prior to the study a power
      analysis determined the number of patients required in each trial. The primary outcome
      measure will be the DASH score, a continuous variable that follows a normal (Gaussian-shaped)
      distribution. This study is designed to determine a clinically relevant mean difference of 10
      points between the two cohorts at one year after enrolment. A power analysis indicated that a
      total sample size of 50 (25 in each group) subjects will provide 80% statistical power to
      detect significant differences (0.05) in DASH scores, assuming an effect size of 0.8 (mean
      difference of 10 points, standard deviation of 12 points) using an unpaired t-test. To
      account for a possible loss to follow-up of up to 25%, we anticipate enrolling 35 subjects in
      each cohort for a total sample size of 70 subjects. A p value of < 0.05 was considered
      statistically significant.

      All patients presenting to the units with a fracture of the olecranon that satisfy the
      inclusion criteria will be invited to participate in our study. Vulnerable populations will
      not be recruited.

      A qualified member of the on-call team will introduce the study to the patient and initiate
      informed consent. If the patient agrees, a research fellow (Trauma and Orthopaedic StR3
      level), not involved with the patient's care will review the study protocol in detail and
      address any questions the patient may have. If the patient is willing to participate, the
      research fellow will complete the informed consent with the patient. Patients will be given a
      copy of the consent form, and be informed that their participation is voluntary and that they
      can withdraw at any time during the study without detriment to their normal care in any way.
      Patients may take as long as they like to consider participation, provided that they still
      meet all the eligibility criteria documented above. Patients that are willing to participate
      in this study will get the same care of their fracture as patients that decide not to
      participate in the study.

      On enrolment, a data collection form will be started with demographic and injury-related
      information collected. Patients will be randomised (performed by Dr Rob Elton using closed
      opaque envelopes) into one of the two groups (non-operative or operative). Patients in the
      non-operative group will be placed in a collar and cuff for two weeks and allowed to mobilise
      under supervised physiotherapy as per normal protocol. Patients in this group can be placed
      in cast (~60 degrees of flexion) if pain is too severe. For those patients in the operative
      group, tension band wire of plate fixation will be employed depending on the choice of their
      supervising consultant. Following surgery, the post-operative assessment and course will be
      as per normal protocol for patients who are not in this study. Patients in the operative
      group will be immobilised depending on fracture fixation during surgery and the decision will
      be made by the treating surgeon. Physiotherapy will be arranged when required

      All follow-up assessment will take place during follow-up visits initially with the treating
      consultant surgeon's team and a dedicated member of the research team. Radiographs and other
      diagnostic studies will be obtained at the discretion of the treating surgeon and will not
      differ from routine clinical care.

      Follow-up assessment will be collected over a one year period (2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6
      months and one year). Routine follow-up in our institution for patients who have sustained an
      olecranon fracture that is managed operatively involves outpatient clinic reviews with
      radiographs at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, three months and six months. Therefore, one additional visit
      at 1 year is required for this study with no additional radiographs. Radiographs will only be
      performed at one year on clinical indication.

      At each visit physical examination, treatment, complications and re-operation (e.g. hardware
      removal), for each patient will be recorded. A member of the research team, blinded to the
      treatment method by sticking plaster over the entry position, will undertake functional
      testing and assessment.

      By statistically analysing the outcome scores in the two groups, I aim to better determine
      the optimal management of this fracture in this age group. Using univariate analysis and
      multivariate regression analysis I will determine significant (p<0.05) predictors of outcome
      in relation to functional outcome score (DASH at one year).
