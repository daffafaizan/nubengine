    
      This is a single center, placebo-controlled, randomized study assessing the safety and
      tolerability of two dose levels (low and high) of TDV administered subcutaneously or
      intradermally in two doses separated by an interval of 90 days. Initial dosing of low dose
      cohort will be performed and Day 21 safety assessed prior to administration of second dose to
      low dose cohort on Day 90 and initial dosing of high dose cohort. Day 21 safety for the high
      dose cohort will be assessed prior to administration of second dose for this cohort. Safety
      (local injection site reactions and solicited and unsolicited adverse events) will be
      assessed through Day 120 post-first (1 month after the second dose). Immunogenicity will be
      assessed at specified time points up to Day 120 post-prime (1 month after the second dose)
      and again on Days 180 and 270 (6 and 9 months post-first).
