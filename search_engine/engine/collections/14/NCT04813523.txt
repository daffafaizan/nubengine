      guideline. But many patients refused or abandon radiotherapy because of the intolerable
      adverse effects. We designed a single-arm, open-label, phase II trial of pembrolizumab plus
      cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) followed by radical surgery for locally advanced
      adenocarcinoma of esophagogastric junction. The purpose of this study is to observe and
      evaluate the efficacy and safety.
