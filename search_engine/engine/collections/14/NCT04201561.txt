      anti-inflammatory effects. Selenium has also been shown in pre-clinical studies to inhibit
      chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy through reactive oxygen species mechanisms in
      cells. Therefore, the investigators aimed to confirm the effect of preventing high dose
      intravenous selenium prior to chemotherapy and to prevent neuropathy caused by chemotherapy.
      In this study, the investigators will identify the frequency and severity of CIPN according
      to World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. Also, the investigators will assess the
      patient's quality of life (QoL), evaluate the effects of the administration of inorganic
      selenium on CIPN and QoL, and confirm the safety of high-dose selenium. I would like to.
