      hypoperfusion, systemic inflammatory response, and oxidative stress. Dexmedetomidine has been
      known to protect the kidney against inflammation and oxidative stress in diverse clinical
      settings. It may also enhance a renal perfusion by inhibition of renal sympathoexcitation. We
      hypothesized administration of dexmedetomidine might protect the kidney in patients
      undergoing cytoreduction and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy.
