      of symptoms via smartphone app. Those who screen positive for COVID-19 will be triaged to
      emergency or non-emergency medical treatment and will receive a study supplied device to
      measure their oxygen level and heart rate and be instructed in the device's use. They will be
      prompted to enter vital signs data (such as oxygen level) daily (and as indicated by changes
      in status) and questions from the app will change to assess the severity of COVID-19 related
      symptoms and inform changes in level of care, to emergency or non-emergency medical
      management as indicated by self-reporting. The proposed study will assess the impact of
      heightened symptom and vital sign monitoring on the early identification of severe
      manifestations of COVID-19 in this high-risk population (Aim 2). It is hypothesized that this
      will significantly improve COVID-19 related morbidity and mortality compared to the national
      and international rates currently reported in the literature.
