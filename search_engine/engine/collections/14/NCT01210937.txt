      CEA, there is little chance that the patient suffer from severe hypoperfusion or stroke. So
      we use TCD to monitor the blood flow of brain in the surgery and keep the blood pressure
      stable. The sudy is designed to find out whether the index which we found in previous work is
      more sensitive to show the blood flow of middle cerebral artery.
