      Adult patients with a diagnosis of reduced ejection fraction HF, who are being treated at a
      specialized HF clinic are being recruited. Those with indications for loop diuretic dose
      adjustment during routine clinic visits will be randomized to take part in the trial.
      Participants in the intervention group (IG) shall have their diuretic doses adjusted in
      accordance with the AAD and receive four telephone calls (one per week) over 30 days to
      reinforce guidance on nonpharmacological management (fluid and sodium restriction).
      Participants in the control group (CG) shall have their diuretic doses adjusted by a
      physician during the first trial visit and shall not receive any telephone calls. Patients in
      both groups shall return at 1 month for face-to-face reassessment. The study endpoints shall
      comprise readmission and/or emergency department visits due to HF decompensation within 90
      days and clinical instability. All participants shall be required to have a scale at home (or
      easy access to one), a telephone number, agree to telephone-based follow-up, and be available
      to return for a 1-month trial visit. Overall, 135 patients are expected to be enrolled in
      each group.
