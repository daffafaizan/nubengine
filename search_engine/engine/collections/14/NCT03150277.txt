      enrolled in this study. The study will be performed in 3 separate sessions.In the first
      session, participants will be familiarized with the experimental conditions and 1RM will be
      calculated. Participants will then be randomized to receive either heavy resistance or
      plyometric exercise first in the second session and then will be crossed over to receive the
      opposite intervention in the third session. The objective of the study is to compare the
      acute effects of plyometric and heavy resistance exercise on post - activation potentiation
      by measuring physical performance and blood lactate level.
