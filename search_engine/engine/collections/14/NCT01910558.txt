      stable emulsion with dietary fat in the ratio of 1:9, with a higher affinity for saturated
      fat compared to unsaturated fat. In humans, supplementation with Î±-cyclodextrin has been
      shown to lead to a significant weight loss regardless of whether energy intake was maintained
      or increased.The aim of this study is to evaluate the results of a 72 hour fecal fat test
      using stool markers on the last three days of each of three six-day feeding periods. Subjects
      will be served a weight maintaining diet containing 40% fat (of which 40% will be saturated),
      30% protein and 30% carbohydrate for 18 days. Subjects will also consume 1 gram alpha
      cyclodextrin with 1 gram of starch, 2 grams of alpha cyclodextrin, or 2 grams of starch in
      capsule form before breakfast, lunch, and dinner every day in each of the three six-day
      feeding periods. At this dose, alpha-cyclodextrin is recognized as safe by the FDA. All
      stools will be collected over a 72 hour period at the end of each feeding period and analyzed
      for fecal fat excretion.
