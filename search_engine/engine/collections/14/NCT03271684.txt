      intervention on South African stroke patients' functional activity, self-efficacy, and
      participation. Method: This experimental study will make use of a randomized controlled
      design (RCT), consisting of one hundred and sixty eight stroke survivors recruited from
      different health care facilities within the Cape Metropolitan area. The study participants
      will be divided randomly into two groups, with one receiving the intervention - the
      experimental group - and the other receiving an educational booklet - the control group.
      Participants will be assessed at baseline, immediately post-intervention (six weeks), three
      and sixth-month post intervention, using standardized outcome measures (both subjective
      outcome measures and objective clinical tools). Ethical clearance and permission to conduct
      the study will be obtained and patient information will be kept confidential. Analyses will
      be conducted using descriptive statistics of frequencies and percentages for categorical
      variables and mean and standard deviation for continuous variables. Given the assumptions of
      equal variance, a two-way full factorial ANOVA will be computed in order to assess
      interaction between groups and intervention type.
