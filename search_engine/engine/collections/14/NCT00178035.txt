      and difficult to predict reliably before 4-5 weeks of treatment. The delayed onset of
      antidepressant activity is particularly problematic in the elderly, prolonging the duration
      of suffering and disability, reducing compliance, and increasing the risk for attempted and
      completed suicide.

      This study seeks to develop a method for effective rapid treatment of major depressive
      episodes in the elderly and to improve early identification of treatment non-responders, by
      combining sleep deprivation (for one night) and paroxetine as probes of treatment response
      and treatment resistance.

      This is an experimental study that is randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled. We
      will recruit 158 elderly depressed patients with current major depressive episodes and
      randomly assign 36 patients to each of three interventions: 1)TSD + paroxetine; 2)TSD +
      placebo; and 3)paroxetine alone without TSD). The duration of the experimental phase of the
      study is 17 days: 3 days for pre-treatment sleep studies and 14 days for initial paroxetine
      or placebo treatment under double-blind conditions.
