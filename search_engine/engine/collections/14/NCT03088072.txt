      are clinically indicated for a Left Atrial Appendage (LAA) closure with the commercially
      available WATCHMAN device. Subjects will be enrolled if they meet study inclusion/exclusion
      criteria and have a successful LAA closure. All patients enrolled in the study will receive 6
      weeks of edoxaban therapy. At 6 weeks post LAA closure a Transesophageal Echocardiography
      (TEE) will be performed. If the result is acceptable, edoxaban will be discontinued and the
      patient will be treated with dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin and clopidogrel) until 6
      month follow-up. After study completion, patients may be treated with aspirin monotherapy
      according to the FDA instructions for use for the WATCHMAN device, or according to operator
      discretion.
