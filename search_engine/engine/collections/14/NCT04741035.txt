      regarding sternal precautions and restrictions of upper limb movement in cardiac patients and
      will help to evaluate the effect of modified sternal precautions on patients' pain and
      functional activity. As physical therapists are the ones who have maximum exposure to
      practice and teaching of sternal precautions, therefore this study will help to formulate the
      guidelines regarding the use of upper limb during cardiac rehabilitation exercises and making
      standards for sternal precautions and its management following cardiac surgery.
