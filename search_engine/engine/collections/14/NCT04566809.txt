      treatment, for both CG and EG, lasted about forty minutes.

      The FES devices chosen for this research stimulated "grasp" or "pinch" function: the NESS
      H200 (NESS Ltd., Ra'anana, Israel) was used if patient needed to improve the grasp functions,
      otherwise the Microstim (Microstim, Medel, Hamburg, Germany) was used to increase pinch
      functions. In order to provide FES, the five electrodes of NESS H200 were first humidified
      with warm water and then inserted in the right size place of the rigid splint worn by the
      patient, while Microstim was used with four standard electrodes, two for each muscle treated.
      In both case the stimulation was triggered by the therapist clicking a button (Table 1).

      The participants of CG received only FES to improve their manipulating skills without the
      interaction with objects, but only with the muscle contraction induced by the devices.

      The participants of EG executed FES and CBA treatment which means that during the stimulation
      they manipulated different tools. In particular, for the first ten sessions the participants
      were invited to manipulate specific objects: squares, rectangles and pyramids of different
      sizes; touch on plastic test tubes coated with materials of different consistency; these two
      exercises were performed both with open and closed eyes. Finally, for the last ten sessions
      the participants were asked to execute specific tasks, depending on person's life before the
      lesion.
