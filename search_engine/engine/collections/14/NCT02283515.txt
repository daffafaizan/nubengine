      statin, a highly efficient competitive inhibitors of HMG CoA Reductase having important role
      in reducing serum cholesterol concentrations and lowers the risk of cardiovascular disease.
      It has potent anti-inflammatory effects, mediated via vascular endothelium derived nitric
      oxide (eNO) that inhibits P selectin synthesis by endothelial cells. This protective action
      is evidenced by reduced levels of high-sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hs-CRP) , a clinical
      marker of inflammation produced in response to proinflammatory cytokines such as
      interleukin-6 (IL-6), therefore it contributes to the prevention and remission of
      inflammatory diseases. Recently, an in-vivo study demonstrated that RSV promotes osteoblast
      differentiation, by regulating the expression of solute carrier (Slco1a1), which may
      constitute the transport system for RSV across the cell membrane in mature osteoblasts.
