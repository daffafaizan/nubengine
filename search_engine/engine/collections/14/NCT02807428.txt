    
      This is a multi-center, Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of AYX1 Injection administered intrathecally before surgery
      in patients undergoing primary unilateral total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Subjects will be
      randomized on the day of surgery to receive either intrathecal AYX1 Injection or intrathecal
      placebo just prior to surgery. Study assessments will be conducted during the inpatient
      period through 48 hours; follow-up visits will be performed through Study Day 90.
