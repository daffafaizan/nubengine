    
      This study is a prospective observational study for the Helicobacter pylori (HP) infected
      patients on typical gastroduodenoscopy (EGD) at Boramae Hospital, Seoul, Korea.

      The presence of antibiotic resistance genes of HP and the diversity of the pharmacokinetic
      genotypes of the subjects will be investigated by performing single next-generation
      sequencing (NGS) analysis using gastric mucosal tissue samples of the HP infected subjects.

      The purpose of this study is to collect data on the antimicrobial resistance mutation of HP
      (23S rRNA gene, pbp1 gene, rdxA, frxA, frxB gene, 16S rRNA, gyrA, gyrB gene, and Cag A gene)
      and to investigate the genetic diversity on the metabolism of antibiotics and proton pump
      inhibitors (CYP enzyme) in a Korean population.

      The investigators are going to compare the results of standard eradication therapy according
      to the resistance mutation of HP and drug genetic diversity of subjects.
