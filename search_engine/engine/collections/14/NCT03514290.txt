      left maxillary/mandibular quadrants were randomized and allocated to one of two groups:
      GPLACEBO - the laser tip was positioned without the emission of light (placebo effect) +
      tooth bleaching with 35% hydrogen peroxide (HP); GLASER - treated with LLL + tooth bleaching
      with 35% HP. To assess tooth sensitivity, a modified visual analogue scale (VAS) was used
      after an evaporative stimulus (stimulated pain) and a daily pain questionnaire (unstimulated
      pain) was also applied. A spectrophotometer was used to measure the color. Three bleaching
      sessions were performed, with intervals of 7 days.
