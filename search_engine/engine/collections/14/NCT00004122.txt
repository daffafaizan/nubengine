      superficial bladder cancer. II. Determine the relative local and systemic toxicities of this
      regimen and its effect on quality of life in these patients. III. Evaluate the effect of BCG
      dose reduction during therapy on symptom tolerance and ability to maintain an extended
      treatment plan in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to prior BCG exposure
      and BCG tolerance (no prior BCG exposure vs prior BCG exposure, BCG tolerant vs prior BCG and
      interferon alfa treatment failure, BCG intolerant). Patients receive induction therapy
      consisting of varying strengths of BCG plus interferon alfa intravesically weekly for 6
      weeks. Patients with disease recurrence which is resectable and/or amenable to intravesical
      therapy following the first induction course may receive an additional course of induction
      therapy. At 3 months, patients undergo evaluatory cystoscopy and cytology. At 4 months,
      patients with no evidence of disease receive varying strengths of maintenance therapy
      consisting of BCG and interferon alfa intravesically weekly for 3 weeks. Treatment repeats
      every 6 months for 3 courses. Quality of life is assessed within 1 week following the last
      induction and maintenance treatment and prior to cystoscopy. Patients are followed every 3
      months for 6 months, every 6 months for 1.5 years, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 660 patients will be accrued for this study within 2.5 years.
