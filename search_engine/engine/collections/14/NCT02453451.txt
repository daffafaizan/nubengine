      established therapeutic alternative for patients with symptomatic mitral regurgitation and
      high operative risk. The MitraClip technology represent a catheter-based non-surgical
      procedure in which a metal cramp (clip) is transported to the place of the defective mitral
      valve. At the same time, it occurs also a 3-dimensional transesophageal echocardiogram
      (3D-TEE) with a transseptal puncture to control this procedure. After removal of the guiding
      catheter a new atrial septal defect can develop which can close spontaneously after weeks or
      months.

      In this study criteria for a standardized evaluation about the effect of the new ASD on
      hemodynamic parameters - before and after the MitraClip procedure - shall be validated for
      the first time. The investigators expect to obtain new findings through the exact analysis of
      the newly formed ASD for the planning, regulation and follow-up of the mitral insufficiency
      treatment.
