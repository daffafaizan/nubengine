      exercise right before or right after lunch in adolescents with obesity. 18 adolescents with
      obesity will be asked to randomly complete three experimental sessions: i) one control
      session (rest); ii) one session with an acute exercise realized right before lunch; iii) one
      session with an acute exercise realized right after lunch. Their ad libitum energy intake
      will be assessed during lunch as well as at dinner time. Appetite feelings will be assessed
      at regular intervals and their food reward in response to the lunch will also be assessed.
