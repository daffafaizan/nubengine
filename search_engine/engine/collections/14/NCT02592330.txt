    
      This is an open label, single center study to assess safety, feasibility, and efficacy of
      Cultivated Autologous Limbal Epithelial Cell (CALEC) grafts in 17 patients with unilateral
      limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD).

      Participants will have a corneal biopsy in their non-diseased eye, which will provide cells
      for the creation of the CALEC graft. The CALEC will be made at the Good Manufacturing
      Practice (GMP) Laboratory, Dana Farber Cancer Institute and transported to Mass. Eye and Ear
      Infirmary for application to the participant's diseased eye during their standard corneal
      reconstruction procedure. Subjects will be monitored up to month 18 post-transplant to assess
      for any delayed adverse events of the product (CALEC) or procedure as well as assessment of
      the durability of the transplant.
