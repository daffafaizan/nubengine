      mifepristone or matching placebo. Patients will be assessed by the investigator or site staff
      during screening and on study days. A single antidepressant selected from a list of approved
      drugs will be administered after the administration of investigational drug. Adverse events,
      laboratory assessments, electrocardiograms, and physical examinations will be used to assess
      safety.
