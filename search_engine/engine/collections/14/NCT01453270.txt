    
      Severe sepsis is a syndrome where the body develops organ dysfunction secondary to
      uncontrolled inflammatory response to infection. Various resuscitation bundles have been
      formulated and practised to treat severe sepsis, such as early goal-directed therapy (EGDT).
      EGDT involves the insertion of invasive catheters in patients with severe sepsis or septic
      shock using serial measurements to guide therapy and achieve hemodynamic goals, such as mean
      arterial pressure (MAP), central venous pressure (CVP) and central venous oxygen saturation
      (ScvO2) by 6 hours. The drawbacks include the invasive nature of inserting these catheters
      with its complications and tedium to set up the equipment. A non-invasive approach using the
      Non-Invasive Cardiac Output Monitor (NICOM) and passive leg raising (PLR) maneuver to guide
      fluid and vasoactive agent therapy targeting fluid responsiveness and MAP may be able to
      achieve better outcome, measured by lactate clearance at 3 hours and at a lower
      hospitalization cost.
