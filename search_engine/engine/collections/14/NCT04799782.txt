    
      Randomized placebo controlled cross-over study. Each subject will be studied on two separate
      occasions: (1) Mirtazapine vs. placebo for one week; the participants will be blinded to
      whether they are taking Mirtazapine or placebo. After the one week treatment a sleep study
      will be repeated. Mirtazapine will be given at 15 mg dose before bed-time. (2) Cross over
      medication for one week will be followed by a second sleep study.
