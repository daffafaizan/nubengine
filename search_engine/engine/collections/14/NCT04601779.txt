      severe long-term prognoses regarding mental and physical health, social functioning, and
      premature death (1-6).

      The majority of child mental health problems have their origin within the first years of
      living (8, 27, 29, 32, 33) with increased risk in infants from families of psycho-social
      disadvantage (7, 13, 34-36) and in infants with perinatal adversities and cognitive and
      psycho-motor difficulties (13, 32, 34, 36-40). Problems of eating, sleep, and emotional and
      behavioural regulation may predict mental health problems and disorders (27, 39, 41, 42) and
      persistent dysregulation trajectories (40, 41, 43) are associated with attention deficit
      hyperactivity disorder, ADHD, eating problems, and emotional- and behavioural problems
      (44-47). Early parent-child relations (27, 48, 49) and the quality of parenting has a key
      position in the risk mechanisms (44, 50-54).

      The risk of overweight is highly increased in children, who are overweight in infancy (18,
      24, 20, 55-63). Psycho-social risk factors of overweight (24, 60, 62, 63) include young
      parental age, low maternal education, single parent families and a position among ethnic
      minorities (18, 21); the risk mechanisms include gene-environment interaction (23), maternal
      feeding pattern (64, 65); and higher risk among obese parents to introduce high energy and
      fat foods very early and have impaired responses to the infant's hunger and satiety cues
      (66-69).

      Mental health problems tend to precede the development of overweight in childhood (70, 74,
      77), with potential mechanisms including cognitive vulnerability regarding inhibitory
      control/reward, sensitivity and sustained attention (78-83) leading to impulsive eating and
      difficulties in delaying gratification (70, 71, 76, 84). Infants' problems of emotional
      regulation (49) and problems of maintaining an affective homeostasis confronted with
      stress-full experiences (41, 53) may result in emotional eating (83, 85) characterized by
      pathways of physiological stress responses and reward (86-89) in which appetite and
      attraction to sweet and fatty foods is considered to develop through poor emotional
      regulation and lower inhibitory control (6, 81, 86).

      Prevention of mental health problems and overweight has to start early and combine universal
      strategies and targeted interventions (24, 25, 27, 30, 55, 56, 90); to reduce risk exposures
      (26, 28) and optimize parenting (54, 91-94). Universal strategies include intervention
      towards pregnancy and perinatal adversities, and interventions to reduce exposures to
      psycho-socially disadvantage (95-97) and promote healthy weight (23, 24, 63). Targeted
      intervention may address healthy weight development (24, 31) and developmental and regulatory
      problems (95, 96, 98).

      The Video-feedback Intervention to Promote Positive Parenting,VIPP (99) has shown strong
      effectiveness in the reduction of child problems (100), also in families of psycho-social
      disadvantage (101, 102). Research in effective obesity prevention in early childhood is
      scarce (24, 30, 103-105), but the available evidence points to infancy dysregulation and
      parenting as potential targets (6, 104, 106).

      Parents' resources are a particular target of interventions (7, 21, 29, 35, 107-109) that
      target child mental health and healthy weight (24, 27, 33, 51, 110) with parents of
      psycho-soclal adversities being in a particular need (35, 111, 112) to benefit from universal
      intervention (26, 91, 113, 114).

      The general child health surveillance in Denmark includes scheduled home visits to all infant
      families (115, 116); all citizens are recorded through the civil registration system and
      Danish population registries (117), which ensures the valid tracking of children, parents and
      background information (116).

      The community health nurses, CHNs, function as a part of the municipality social services
      (27, 97); they assesses child health and development at mean four time between birth and age
      1 years, and they give parents advices regarding the physical and psychological care of the
      infant. In about 20% of infant families, the CHNs extend their services to target particular
      problems and needs of children and parents, e.g regarding infant problems of eating and
      sleeping, emotional reactions, or regarding the parent-child relation (118-120).

      The options and possibilities of prevention within the municipality child health surveillance
      have been systematically explored since 2000 (121), and needs and challenges regarding mental
      health and overweight have been mapped (13, 18, 27, 34, 40, 43, 61, 85, 121-123), predictors,
      mediators and moderators of developmental psychopathology have been identified (27, 34, 40,
      85), and a window of opportunity regarding intervention towards infants' cognitive and
      regulatory vulnerabilities has been determined at child age 9-10 months (123). A standardized
      measure has been developed, validated (33, 124-127) and included in the PUF-program, which
      comprises the education and training of CHNs and guidelines for their action within existing
      service settings (128).

      AIMS The study aims to develop an intervention to promote sensitive parenting of infants with
      cognitive and regulatory problems at ages 9-10 months, using the VIPP-method adapted to the
      PUF-program (the PUF-VIPP) within the settings of CHNs. Further, it is the aim to examine the
      feasibility, fidelity, and the effectiveness of the intervention with outcome measured at
      child ages 18 and 24 months.

      The PUF-VIPP intervention is hypothesized to be feasible within the municipality settings of
      the CHNs; and among infants with high levels of cognitive and regulatory problems at age 9-10
      months, the intervention is hypothesized to reduce mental health problems at ages 24 months
      (primary hypothesis). The secondary hypothesis is that the intervention will reduce infants'
      cognitive and regulatory problems, promote healthy weight development, reduce parents'
      experiences of stress, promote sensitive parenting and promote parents' feeling of competence
      and relatedness at age 24 months .

      METHODS The development, implementation and evaluation of the intervention is guided by the
      Intervention Mapping approach (129), guides for development of complex interventions from the
      UK Medical Research Council (130) and the RE-AIM-method (131, 132).

      The Infant Health Study includes four work-packages (WPs), the WP 1: Project planning and
      management; WP 2: Creating of the PUF-VIPP intervention; WP 3: The efficacy study; WP 4 the
      process evaluation, including an evaluation of what works for the vulnerable families), and a
      Pilot study prior to WP3 and WP 4.

      The study is anchored in the settings of CHNs in the municipalities of the Child Health
      Database (121) and conducted among municipalities who have implemented the basic PUF-program
      (128). These municipalities are overall representative of the Danish population regarding key
      background characteristics (133).

      DESIGN The stepped wedge cluster randomized design (135-137) is chosen because it is more
      feasible to randomize at the municipality level as compared to the level of the individual
      child or CHN. A randomized controlled trial based on randomization of the individual child or
      nurse would be associated with more logistical demand on the individual municipality or
      nurse, as compared to the stepped wedge design, as they would be having both the intervention
      and the control condition running simultaneously. For practical reasons, all municipalities
      cannot be trained at the same time but have to be split into three groups, and with the
      stepped wedge design, we utilize this and randomly allocate the 16 participating
      municipalities to the time at which their health nurses have been trained, and at which they
      start offering the intervention to families. Also, with the stepped wedge design, spill over
      is reduced by the randomization of clusters as compared to individual randomization.
      Moreover, in the stepped wedge design, interventions are introduced in a stepwise manner to
      all participating clusters (municipalities in this case) which encourages participation for
      those who would otherwise have been randomized to the control condition. Initial feedback
      from our interactions with the municipalities reveals that their motivation is strongly
      associated with being able to offer the intervention, as many municipalities prioritize early
      intervention highly. Further, with the stepped wedge design control families are recruited in
      the early phases of the trial, which enhances the recruiting of a control group with the
      level of usual care offered at the beginning of the trial. In the control period no
      participants receive intervention and sequential random crossover to the intervention cannot
      be reversed (138).

      According to the randomization of municipalities, all children assessed to have â‰¥3 problems
      will function as controls and receive care as usual from Step 0 until the municipalities
      initiate the intervention in Step 1- 3, respectively.

      RECRUITMENT Parents of children becoming 9-10 months in the study period are informed about
      the project by the CHNs, and via written folders and information on the study home page
      (httpp://www.sdu.dk/da/sif). At the the scheduled home visit at child age 9-10 months, the
      CHNs complete PUF-assessment and offer the parents feedback in accordance with the basic
      PUF-program and the existing routines. All parents of children who have been assessed to have
      three or more problems are offered extended service, and the CHN informs the parents about
      the Infant Health project, and if parents agree to participate, they are afterwards invited
      to participate by e-post or sms. Parents make their final agreement for participation by
      answering the web-based questionnaires at the study web-site.

      Parents who have difficulties in completing the questionnaires are offered assistance from
      the CHN.

      All participating parents join a lottery with gift certificate of about 40 euro.

      In the control phase of the study, the CHNs deliver the extended service as as she is used to
      do, treatment as usual. In the intervention phase, the CHN offers parents the PUF-VIPP
      intervention.

      PROJECTPLANNING AND MANAGEMENT (WP 1) A participatory planning group of the principal
      investigators and the leading CHNs is systematically involved in the planning and management
      of the project. We have a well-established collaboration with the leading CHNs from
      participating municipalities (121, 124, 128) which facilitates their function as primary
      municipality stakeholders in WP 2-4.

      The informations already available from our close collaboration with the CHNs is currently
      updated in WP 1, and they will be taken into account when developing the PUF-VIPP
      intervention, and in the strategies necessary to ensure fidelity and deliver valid results
      for the efficacy trial.

      PREPARING THE PUF-VIPP intervention (WP 2) The overall goal is to adapt the VIPP method to
      the basic PUF-programme to address infants of particular vulnerability regarding mental
      health problems and the development of overweight, which can be delivered by CHNs, and is
      feasible within the municipality settings.

      Initially, a group of CHNs are educated in the orginal VIPP method to enable them to
      contribute to the adaptation of the VIPP into the PUF-VIPP intervention. Further, these CHNs
      participate in the pilot testing of the PUF-VIPP, and they function as co-trainers and
      supervisors of the next generation of CHNs educated in the PUF-VIPP during the project
      period.
