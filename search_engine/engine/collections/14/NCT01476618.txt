      will participate in a semi-structured interview developed specifically for this study, which
      serves as the outcome measure. Up to 30 providers will be interviewed.

      Data Analysis Interviews will be transcribed in their entirety and de-identified. Dr.
      Signoracci and 4 additional MRIECC researchers will independently code each interview for
      themes. Finally, group meetings with Dr. Signoracci and MIRECC researchers will be held in
      order to achieve larger consensus regarding such unique and universal themes (Rubin & Rubin,
      1995).

      Any reporting of information regarding: a) length of time employed at Denver VA; b) length of
      time employed within VA system; c) provider professional title; d) provider degree; f)
      professional licenses held; g) clinic/service in which provide services will be done in the
      aggregate, across clinics. No individual data will be reported with respect to these items.
      Also, any selected quotes that are reported will remain de-identified.

      Power analyses will not be conducted because no hypothesis quantitative testing is being
      done, and therefore there are no parameters to estimate. With qualitative designs one
      conducts interviews until reaching the saturation point. In other words, subsequent
      interviews do not yield any new information (Rubin & Rubin, 1995). Previous experience
      (Brenner et al., 2008) suggests that 25 completed interviews should provide a wide enough
      range of responses for important themes to emerge.
