    
      LifeCourse is a late life care approach that promotes whole person care through a structured
      approach built upon an expanded set of palliative care domains and chronic illness care
      practices. It includes a trained lay healthcare worker as the primary contact who follows the
      patient across care settings and over time. The care guide asks patients and caregivers to
      articulate individualized goals and take part in decision making, and uses a family-oriented
      approach to understand needs, leverage strengths, and empower families to effectively support
      the individual living with serious illness.
