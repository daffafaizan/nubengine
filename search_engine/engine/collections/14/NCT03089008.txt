      exercise regimens. Exercise is performed daily for a 3-month period. Symptom severity is
      evaluated by tendon tenderness, ultrasonography, a questionnaire on pain and other symptoms,
      and a global assessment of improvement. Follow-up is performed at time points 3, 6, 9, 12
      weeks and 1 year.
