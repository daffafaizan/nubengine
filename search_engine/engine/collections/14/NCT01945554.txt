      in patients suffering from disc herniations of the spine. Using health-related quality of
      life questionnaires (SF-12 and Neck Pain and Disability Scale and Oswestry Disability Index)
      and the visual analogue scale the patients will be categorized into ultra-early-, early-,
      mid-term-, late-responders and non-responders. A two year follow-up of up to 250 patients is
      planned. With the anonymized participation of this study no patient will experience a change
      in his treatment plan. Valuable therapeutic management considerations might be drawn from the
      published results of this study for future patients.
