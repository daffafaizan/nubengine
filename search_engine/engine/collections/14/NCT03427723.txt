    
      Children admitted to pediatric emergencies, pediatric day hospitals and the general pediatric
      ward, who are less than 3 years old and whose care requires the placement of a cannulation
      will be identified by the caregivers as potentially included.

      The DIVA score will be carried out by the nurse who takes care of the child thanks to the
      dedicated form. If the child has an EmlaÂ® patch, this score will be achieved after removing
      the patch. The nurse that will achieve the score will be the same that will pose the
      intravenous cannulation. Children with an assessment score <4 will not be included in the
      study but will still be counted.

      The nurse must perform the randomization by inquiring about the randomization week: standard
      method or AV400 method.

      The information will be made to the parents and the information form given. The parents'
      consent regarding the care of their child will be collected by the same nurse.

      The means of prevention of pain and distraction will be set up in box with the nurse and / or
      the auxiliary childcare and the parents. Peripheral intravenous cannulation will be performed
      by the nurse in collaboration with the auxiliary childcare.

      Caregivers and parents will evaluate the care. The documents concerning the practical
      realization of the study will be grouped together and made available in each service in
      dedicated bins.
