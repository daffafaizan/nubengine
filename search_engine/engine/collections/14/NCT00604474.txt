      recipients in a cohort of children, ages 12 to 36 months at time of surgery, who receive two
      implants in the same operation or in two different surgeries with the initial fitting of the
      devices separated by no more than six months. Acquisition of auditory milestones and speech
      recognition skills, which underpin the development of spoken language, will be assessed on a
      battery of outcome measures typically used to quantify implant benefits. In addition, global
      quality of life and communicative performance will be assessed by parental proxy. Performance
      will be tracked after 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months of device use. The study also will identify
      variables that may predict the degree of bilateral implant benefit in young children (e.g.,
      age at implant, pre-implant hearing thresholds, communication mode, family socioeconomic
      status, post-implant aided thresholds, simultaneous vs. staged placement of devices).
