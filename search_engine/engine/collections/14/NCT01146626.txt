      obtaining sustained virologic response (SVR) in 80% of naïve patients with genotype 2,3.
      Studies rarely address the issues of improving host factors. The current study examines
      whether adding vitamin D, a potent immunomodulator, could improve viral respons.The working
      hypothesis is that Adding vitamin D to conventional Peg/RBV therapy for naïve, genotype 2,3
      patients with chronic HCV infection significantly improves RVR, EVR, and SVR
