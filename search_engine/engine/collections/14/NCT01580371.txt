      carcinogenesis has been clinically validated with several inhibitors of histone deacetylases
      and DNA methyltransferases. It has long been recognized that epigenetic alterations of tumor
      suppressor genes was one of the contributing factors in carcinogenesis. Inhibitors of histone
      deacetylase (HDAC) de-repress genes that subsequently result in growth inhibition,
      differentiation and apoptosis of cancer cells. CKD-581 is developed for HDAC inhibitors. Such
      as to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), dose limiting toxicity (DLT), safety and
      pharmacokinetics (PK) profile of a single agent CKD-581 injection in patients with Lymphoma
      failed to standard therapy.
