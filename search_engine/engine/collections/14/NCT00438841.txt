      Primary

        -  Determine the response rate in patients with newly diagnosed, previously untreated
           multiple myeloma treated with bortezomib, cyclophosphamide, dexamethasone, and
           thalidomide.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.

      Patients receive bortezomib IV on days 1, 4, 8, and 11; cyclophosphamide IV on days 1 and 8
      of courses 1-3; oral thalidomide once daily on days 1-21 beginning in course 4; and
      dexamethasone IV or orally once daily on days 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, and 12. Treatment repeats
      every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 43 patients will be accrued for this study.
