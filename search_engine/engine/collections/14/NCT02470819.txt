    
      To explore the impact of targeted therapy for breast cancer suggested by proteomic and
      genomic profiling using RPMA, targeted resequencing, IHC analysis, WGS, RNA-seq, and Exome
      sequencing on progression-free survival. When a molecular target cannot be identified, the
      patient will be treated with a therapy selected on an empirical basis by the
      investigator/treating physician at the individual site and will be followed for survival
      status. Only available, FDA-approved agents will be used.
