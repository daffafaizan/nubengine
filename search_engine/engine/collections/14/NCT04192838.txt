      hernia repair (LVHR) are scarce. We carried-out a long-term extension of a previous trial
      comparing both approaches, assessing recurrence, reoperation, intraperitoneal mesh-related
      complications and self-reported quality-of-life with 10-15 years of follow-up.

      Patients will be followed to assess recurrence (main endpoint), reoperation, mesh
      complications and death, from the date of index surgery (between 2003 to 2006) until
      recurrence, death or study completion with a clinical revision (between 2017 to 2019)
      whichever was first. By intention to treat, incidence rates of recurrence, reintervention and
      death by 1000 person-year of follow-up will be estimated, and also rates of mesh
      complications by 1000 person-year for the LVHR group excluding conversions. Quality of life,
      using the European Hernia Society Quality of Life score (EuraHS-QoL), will be assessed for
      survivors no reoperated patients
