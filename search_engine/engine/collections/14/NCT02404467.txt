      valve replacement for patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis.

      Considered as being at unacceptable surgical risk. Despite its widespread utilization, there
      are procedure specific complications and hospitalization associated costs that limit TAVI
      expansion into patient populations with lower risk.

      Cost-effectiveness of TAVI has been investigated either compared with standard therapy for
      patients who are not candidates for surgical valve replacement or with conventional surgical
      replacement in high-risk patients.

      Formal economic evaluation in inoperable patients demonstrated that the benefits of TAVI were
      achieved at an acceptable incremental cost to society, at least in the context of the U.S.
      and U.K. health systems.

      In patients with severe, symptomatic AS who are at high but not prohibitive surgical risk,
      the PARTNER A trial demonstrated that TAVI appeared to be an economically attractive strategy
      compared with aortic valve replacement, provided that patients are suitable for a
      transfemoral approach. On the other hand, results for trans-apical TAVI compared with
      surgical replacement were economically unfavorable.
