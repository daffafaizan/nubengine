      be randomly assigned to Gabapentin ER or placebo, with a 1 in 4 chance of getting placebo.
      The total study investigational treatment duration after screening and baseline will be 13
      weeks. The primary endpoint of the trial is to compare the number and severity of hot flashes
      during the investigational treatment compared to baseline. Sleep quality will also be
      evaluated.
