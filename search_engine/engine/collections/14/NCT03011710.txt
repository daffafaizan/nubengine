      e-cigarette-selling websites and on other forums dealing with this topic.

      The main outcome of interest was whether or not e-cigarette use helped people to quit smoking
      or reduce the number of conventional cigarettes. Participants were also asked about the
      reason for starting e-cigarette use. Nationality, habitation, citizenship status were
      included as demographic predictors in analyses.
