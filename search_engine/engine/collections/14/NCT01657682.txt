    
      This is a Phase II open label study of crenolanib besylate. This study will enroll subjects
      with relapsed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with FLT3 activating mutations. Two cohorts of
      patients will be enrolled: those whose AML has recurred after prior chemotherapy without a
      FLT3 TKI, and those whose AML has progressed after prior therapy with FLT3 TKIs. Subjects
      will take Crenolanib besylate at 100 mg TID until disease progression, death, or unacceptable
      toxicities. Concurrent hydroxyurea is permitted during the first 28 days of study therapy.
