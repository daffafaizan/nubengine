      cases in France in 2018, however its mortality decreases with a survival rate of 87% at 5
      years.

      Therapeutic options are surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy and hormone therapy. Hormone
      therapy is one of the major treatments for hormone-sensitive tumors with a prescription made
      in around 70% of breast cancer cases. These different hormone therapies cause a hormonal
      imbalance with in particular an important anti-estrogenic action. Hormonal deprivation and
      menopause can be responsible for the occurrence of pelvic statics disorder.[5-9] Pelvic
      static disorder (PTS) is a common problem for women, which can occur at any age.

      These disorders include urinary incontinence, stress or urgency, anal incontinence, genital
      prolapse.

      Hypothesis's investigator is that hormone therapy may be responsible for PTS. In this study,
      investigator propose to assess the prevalence of pelvic static disorders in women undergoing
      adjuvant hormone therapy for localized breast cancer and to assess the overall quality of
      life in these patients.
