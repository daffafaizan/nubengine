      nasopharyngeal carcinoma (staged as II-III with SD/PD according to RECIST criteria or EBV DNA
      of >0 copies/mL after 3 cycles of GP induction chemotherapy and staged as IVa) are randomized
      into camrelizumab plus chemo-radiotherapy arm and chemo-radiotherapy arm. The efficacy and
      safety of patients between these two arms are compared.
