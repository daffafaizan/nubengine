      the developed and developing world. In Middle East countries, particularly in the Gulf
      Council countries, the diabetes pandemic along with the rates of obesity have risen due to
      the adoption of a modern lifestyle. In the Qatari population alone, T2D is highly prevalent
      as 18% of the Qatari adults are estimated to suffer from this disease. Consanguineous
      marriages, sedentary lifestyle, obesity and bad dietary habits are cited as the main causes
      for this high incidence rate. Chronic hyperglycemia caused by long-term uncontrolled diabetes
      state can lead to devastating complications such as cardiovascular diseases, neuropathy, and
      retinopathy. Such complications are also highly prevalent in the Qatari population, perhaps
      due to the relatively low adherence to clinical guidelines but vary among Qatari individuals
      based on their genetic predisposition and shared family environment.It is already known that
      inflammation is part of the complex biochemical process of initiating and further developing
      cardiovascular complications of diabetes. Experimental models have showed that exposure to
      hyperglycemia induces epigenomic changes in inflammatory pathways, which subsequently
      regulate gene expression leading to the development of vascular inflammation. The
      investigators therefore hypothesized that chronic hyperglycemia leads to altered DNA
      methylation and dysregulation of gene expression in peripheral blood monocytes and
      lymphocytes in patients with type 2 diabetes.
