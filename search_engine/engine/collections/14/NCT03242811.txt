    
      Swedish Age Assessment study is conducted with the aim of

        -  Deepening the knowledge of age-assessment methodology with magnetic camera examinations
           among born and registered in Sweden aged 14.0 through 21.5 years

        -  With a magnetic camera, investigate whether five selected growth zones in the knee joint
           and ankle joint (distal femur, proximal tibia, distal tibia and calcaneus) and distal
           radius (wrist) individually or in combination can better determine the 18-year limit
           compared with previous research

        -  To investigate how gender and growing environment can affect the end of growth zones
