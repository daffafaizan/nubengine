      and older will be screened until 36 healthy (PPC-A) subjects and 36 subjects with severe
      periodontal disease (PPC-G) will be enrolled. Eligibility for study participation will be
      determined during the screening session. Barring dropout, subject participation will include
      1 to 8 visits lasting over a maximum period of 42 days. The last 3 visits (visit 5-8) will
      depend on the individual need of the subject for providing SRP. Clinical data and medical
      history data will be collected at the screening visit to ascertain eligibility. All subjects
      will have dental plaque and a gingival biopsy collected at baseline. Enrolled subjects will
      be included in an experimental gingivitis model Stent-Induced Biofilm Overgrowth (SIBO) for
      21 days. Individuals will return for safety checks every week during the 21-day period. At
      21-days, plaque samples and a gingival biopsy will be collected. For diseased individuals SRP
      will initiate during the 21-day visit at the SIBO quadrant. Visit 6 (28 days) will include
      the post-biopsy follow up, prophylaxis (for healthy individuals) and SRP (diseased
      individuals). Subjects receiving SRP may have 2 additional visits (visit 7 at day 35 and
      visit 8 at day 42) for completing the SRP of all quadrants and will be dependent on
      individual need. Medical histories, demographics, height and weight, clinical and biological
      data described above will be recorded and stored on a secure server located at the University
      of North Carolina. Each participant enrolled into the study will have a unique identification
      number that has been stripped of any information that could be used by non-study members to
      identify the subject.
