      wound closure in chronic wounds treated with processed amniotic fluid (pAF). We will include
      patients with lower extremity full thickness wounds that are greater than 3 months old and
      less than 12 months old. These wounds must have been unresponsive to other therapies, such as
      debridement, novel topical dressings, moist dressing, off-loading, and edema control, and the
      wound size must be greater than 5cm2 and less than 75 cm2. We will exclude anyone that has a
      thermal-related injury (burn or frostbite, etc.) or wounds over joints, requires skin
      grafting, or wounds with sinus tracts. Our primary objectives are to determine the safety and
      feasibility of using pAF to treat patients with chronic wounds by determining a reduction in
      wound size after application of pAF compared to standard of care.
