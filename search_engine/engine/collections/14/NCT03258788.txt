    
      The purpose of this prospective, multicentre, non-randomised translational study is to
      provide proof of feasibility of achieving paired biopsies for PD-L1 assessment in patients
      with NSCLC treated with palliative or radical radiotherapy. This is a non-CTIMP study.

      All participants will have a minimum of 1 mandatory biopsy (during radiotherapy [irradiated
      site]) and the potential to have a pre-treatment biopsy if archival biopsy does not meet the
      suitability criteria.

      Participants will have up to a maximum of 2 additional optional biopsies (during radiotherapy
      [within the RT field e.g supraclavicular fossa node], [outside RT field e.g. skin met]).

      Blood samples will also be taken on study at specified time points for immune monitoring
      (exploratory endpoints).

      The study will be carried out in two stages as follows:

      Stage 1:

      Following the enrolment of the first 15 evaluable participants, an interim analysis will take
      place by the Trial Steering Committee (TSC). The TSC will make a recommendation on whether
      recruitment should continue to the Trial Management Group (TMG).

      Stage 2:

      A further 15 evaluable participants will be recruited onto the study to achieve a total of 30
      evaluable participants.
