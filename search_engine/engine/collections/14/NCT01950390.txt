      I. To compare overall survival for patients receiving ipilimumab plus bevacizumab versus
      ipilimumab alone.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the progression free survival, response rate and safety in patients receiving
      ipilimumab plus bevacizumab versus ipilimumab alone.

      II. To evaluate the utility of immune related response criteria (irRC) in patients receiving
      ipilimumab plus bevacizumab versus ipilimumab alone.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM A:

      INDUCTION THERAPY: Patients receive ipilimumab intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes on day 1.
      Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      MAINTENANCE THERAPY: Beginning cycle 8, patients receive ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes on day
      1. Cycles repeat every 12 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      ARM B:

      INDUCTION THERAPY: Patients receive ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes and bevacizumab IV over
      30-90 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 cycles in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      MAINTENANCE THERAPY: Patients receive bevacizumab as in Induction Therapy. Beginning cycle 8,
      patients also receive ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat every 12 weeks in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 5 years.
