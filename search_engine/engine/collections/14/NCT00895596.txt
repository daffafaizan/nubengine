      activity against wild-type HBV. LB80380 is undergoing clinical development by LG Life
      Sciences for use in the treatment of chronic HBV infection and for treatment of
      lamivudine-resistant disease.

      In this study, the treatment period was divided into two parts: a 4-week treatment period
      with dose escalation assessment (Part 1), followed by an 8-week extension period (Part 2).

      During Part 1, patients received LB80380 and LVD 100 mg once daily for 4 weeks. Each patient
      was then given only LB80380 for an additional 8 weeks (Part 2) unless dose-limiting toxicity
      (DLT) was observed during Part 1. At each dose level, all patients were to complete at least
      Part 1 of the treatment period before enrolment into the next Dose Group could commence. Dose
      escalation to the next group was not to be initiated if more than two patients experienced
      DLT during Part 1 in the previous Dose Group. Additionally, patients enrolled in LB80380
      150mg and 240mg groups who agreed to participate in the pharmacokinetic (PK) analyses visited
      the study site the day before Week 12 for blood sampling. Follow-up period was 24 weeks, and
      patients were treated with adefovir dipivoxil during the follow-up period. During the study,
      patients were evaluated for changes from baseline in serum HBV DNA. Safety was evaluated on
      the basis of occurrence of AEs and changes from baseline in clinical laboratory parameters,
      physical examination findings, and vital signs.
