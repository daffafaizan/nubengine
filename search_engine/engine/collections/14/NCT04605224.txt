      the province of New Brunswick, Canada, who were enrolled in an optional culinary class were
      compared to students from those same schools who were enrolled in a social studies class. The
      culinary class is a hands-on course which teaches students how to measure and weigh
      ingredients, read and follow recipes, apply various food preparation, cooking and assembly
      techniques, as well as prepare meals. In contrast, the social studies class is a mandatory
      theory-based course which teaches students how to maintain positive relationships, how to
      become a productive member of society and how to make responsible and informed choices
      related to their health. Both classes are 55-70 minutes in duration and are provided daily
      over an 18-week semester.

      A questionnaire was developed based on two previously validated food literacy questionnaires
      and assessed food and cooking skills, as well as eating behaviours. This pen and paper
      questionnaire was completed by students in both the culinary class and the social studies
      class during the first and last week of the semester (September 2019 and January 2020).
      Multilevel regressions will be used to assess the effectiveness of the culinary class on
      students' food literacy and eating behaviours as compared to the social studies class.
