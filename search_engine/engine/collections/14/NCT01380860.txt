      prevent hernia relapse. However, mesh provides a good infection site, which is not a
      desirable characteristic for a material adjacent to a colostomy "port". Our goal is to
      implement a high-quality, randomized trial to demonstrate whether or not systematic mesh
      implantation upon primary hernia creation is an effective means of avoiding this common and
      troublesome complication.
