      know the identity of the treatments given. Some patients will receive a placebo, which
      resembles a medication, but does not contain an active substance. This helps to determine if
      the study agent is effective. Patients will receive placebo or sirukumab by injection under
      the skin. The expected duration of the study is 120 weeks, which includes 104 weeks of
      treatment. Participants who complete participation in the study will be eligible for
      inclusion into the long-term safety and efficacy study, if enrollment at a participating site
      is available to them. If they do not participate in the long-term study, they will continue
      into the safety follow-up for approximately 16 weeks. The placebo-controlled portion of the
      study is through Week 52, when placebo patients will cross over to one of two sirukumab dose
      regimens. Patient safety will be monitored throughout the study.
