      medium effect size (f=0.25) at 95% confidence level in line with the data of Lin et al.
      Participants were assigned to the experimental and control groups by the stratified block
      randomization method. The locks were assigned to layers using Microsoft Excel.

      The individuals in the experimental group received pelvic floor muscle exercises training
      from the researcher using the Roy Adaptation Model in addition to routine discharge training.
      The patients received a PFME training booklet prepared by the researcher. Face-to-face
      training was given to the individuals in the experimental group on the day before the
      operation, on the second and third postoperative days, and on the day of discharge. The
      training continued with phone calls at the first, second and third weeks and the first,
      second, third, and sixth months after the surgery. Data was collected a day before discharge,
      first, second, third, and sixth months after the surgery.
