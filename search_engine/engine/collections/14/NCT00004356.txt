      controls are entered in both parts of the study.

      In first part of the study, participants are given oral methionine; baseline and
      postmethionine studies include amino acid quantitation, analysis of rapidly deproteinized
      plasma, and total plasma homocysteine.

      In the second part of the study, participants (men and postmenopausal women only) undergo
      methionine tracer studies.
