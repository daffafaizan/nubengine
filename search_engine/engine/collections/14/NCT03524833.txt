      (5mg/1ml/amp), the vital signs will be closely monitored by physiological monitor (PHILIPS
      SureSigns VM6). The treatment will be terminated immediately if unstable vital sign detected
      or if patient asks for termination. Patients will receive test for UFT300 to evaluate H.
      pylori colonization in the gastric cardia. With endoscope apparatus, the gastric mucous is
      irrigated with acetylcysteine solution and the pH value of gastric juice will be measured
      with the pH test strips before irrigation and after irrigation. The investigators dispense
      medicaments containing Metronidazole powder (2 gm) on the surface of gastric mucosa and
      duodenal mucosa of duodenal bulb as evenly as possible. After the intraluminal therapy,
      patients will rest for 30 to 60 minutes and go home if the effect of sedation subsided.
      Patients can take meal if no abdominal discomfort. C13-Urea breath test (UBT) will be used to
      assess the existence of H. pylori 6 weeks after the intraluminal therapy. Patients fail to
      achieve intraluminal eradication of H. pylori will be assigned to the oral antibiotic rescue
      therapies with triple therapy which contains a proton pump inhibitor and two antibiotics (
      amoxicillin and metronidazole) for 14 days. C13UBT will be used to assess the existence of H.
      pylori 6 weeks after the rescue therapy. Overall eradication rates after the first line
      intraluminal therapy and the oral antibiotics rescue therapies will be evaluated.
