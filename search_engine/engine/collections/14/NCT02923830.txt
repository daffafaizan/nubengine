      maintaining patency (unobstructed flow) in BioFlo implanted port catheters. The complication
      rate in patients whose ports are flushed with saline only will be compared to the
      complication rate in patients whose ports are flushed with a combination of saline and
      heparinized saline. These complications include partial or complete obstruction, infection of
      the central line, and/or the onset of heparin induced thrombocytopenia.
