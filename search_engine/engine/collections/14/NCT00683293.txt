      specialties and experiences in gynaecological surgery are very limited.

      Several aspects like the wider range of motion of robot-instruments leading to more precision
      in surgery, the 3 dimensional optical system and the ergonomically designed console may offer
      some advantages. For better judgment these possible benefits as well as safety and outcome
      need to be evaluated and compared with conventional laparoscopic hysterectomy techniques.
      This randomized clinical trail intends to compare conventional with robot-assisted(da
      VinciÂ®-System) laparoscopic hysterectomy regarding specific parameters. The focus of the
      study will be to investigate if the robot assisted procedure shows significant advantages for
      the patient considering duration of surgery, complications, hospitalisation and costs.
