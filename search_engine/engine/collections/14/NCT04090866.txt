      the setting of heart failure, the heart shifts to increasing dependence on glucose
      metabolism. In this study, the investigators will perform cardiac positron emission
      tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI) scans to measure glucose metabolism in the
      heart before and after initiation of pulmonary vasodilator therapy for pulmonary arterial
      hypertension. By utilizing a rest-exercise protocol and continuous PET imaging acquisition,
      we can capture real-time changes in glucose uptake in the heart in response to acute
      exercise. By coupling these measures of dynamic glucose utilization with MRI-based cardiac
      function, we will determine cardiac metabolic efficiency.
