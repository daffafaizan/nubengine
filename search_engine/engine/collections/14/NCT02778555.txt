      magnification) (Sullivan 1995) measures trait catastrophizing in the context of actual or
      anticipated pain. Currently, there is no validated tool for measuring pain catastrophizing at
      the daily level. Lack of a validated daily measure stands as a barrier for studies that aim
      to characterize mechanisms of pain treatment and how PC adaptation / change occurs.
