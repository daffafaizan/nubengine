      world, but the incidence of adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction (AEG) has shown a
      significant upward trend, especially in Western countries such as Europe and the United
      States. The prognosis of AEG is poor, therefore, it is extremely necessary to establish AEG's
      best diagnosis and treatment strategies to improve the long-term outcome of AEG. Robotic
      surgery has been developed with the aim of improving surgical quality and overcoming the
      limitations of conventional laparoscopy in the performance of complex mini-invasive
      procedures. The study is designed to explore the clinical outcomes of the robotic assisted
      radical gastrectomy for advanced Siewert II/III esophagogastric junction adenocarcinoma
      (cT2-4a, N-/+, M0) by comparing with laparoscopic assisted.
