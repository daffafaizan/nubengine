      refractory ascites and will meet specified inclusion/exclusion criteria Informed consent will
      be obtained from all patients. All patients will have an alfapump surgically inserted and in
      addition will receive 8g of salt-poor Human Albumin Solution (20%) per 1 litre of Ascites
      drained. This Intravenous administration will be intermittent (every 2 weeks) and will take
      place as a day patient. Patients will also receive standard of care, which may include, but
      is not limited to, administration of diuretics, paracentesis and consideration for orthotopic
      liver transplantation.

      The primary objective of the study is to assess whether intermittent human albumin
      replacement in accordance with large volume paracentesis guidelines (8g/L ascites drained)
      can prevent the development of renal dysfunction at the 3-month assessment. This would
      potentially guide the clinical use of the alfapump system.

      The secondary objectives of the study are to address the objectives of a previous alfa pump
      study /sub study, to allow comparison of the proposed study data to that generated in the
      previous studies. These will be measured at the 1-month and 3-month time points.
