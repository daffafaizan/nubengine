      BES group (n=34). Every patient received 4 weeks treatment, and was evaluated at baseline
      (T0), 4-week post-intervention (T4) and 12-week follow-up (T12). The primary outcome was pain
      intensity. The secondary outcomes were degree in activation of MTrPs, surface
      electromyography (sEMG) levels, and Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I).
