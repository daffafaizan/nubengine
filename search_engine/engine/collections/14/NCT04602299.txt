      incidence/mortality of gastric cancer and esophageal cancer in China were 680000/500000 and
      220000/200000, respectively. Gastroscopy is the most important means to detect early cancer
      of gastrointestinal tract. However, due to various factors, the miss rate of clinical
      significant lesions by gastroscopy is innegligible. Our previous research results showed that
      the detection rate of early gastric cancer and early esophageal cancer in China was only
      about 15%. This study aims to include 2000 gastroscopic procedures and investigate the
      relationship between procedure time and lesion detection rate in tertiary endoscopic centers
      in China.

      At the first stage, the researchers observe the actual procedure time of gastroscopies
      without affecting the natural behavior of endoscopists. Then, researchers collect the data
      (including focal lesion detection rate, procedure time, detection rate of early upper GI
      cancer, biopsy rate and adverse event rate) and analyze the minimal procedure time. At the
      second stage, a minimal time limit will be set for each procedure. Every stage last two
      months, and potential correlations between lesion detection rate and procedure time will be
      investigated through subsequent statistical analysis.
