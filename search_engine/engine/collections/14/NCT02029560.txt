      reported that 25% of men over 60 years old suffer from both BPH and hypertension. Though
      these two diseases differ in nature, there is a hypothesis advanced from recent studies that
      for both diseases, increase in sympathetic tone plays an important role in pathophysiology.

      As a medical treatment of BPH, α-blockers are widely selected in clinical studies as a first
      line treatment in patients with LUTS, for its non-invasiveness and superior clinical efficacy
      [1, 5]. Such α-blockers increases urine flow and decreases residual urine by controlling
      excitement of the sympathetic nervous system distributed around smooth muscle of prostate and
      bladder neck. Through this, α-blockers improve conditions of clinical symptoms of patients
      suffering from LUTS due to BPH, and decrease need for invasive surgery related to BPH, and
      also have medical action to decrease morbidity rate of secondary complications of BPH such as
      acute retention of urine, deterioration of renal function, bladder stone and urinary tract
      infection.

      However, in the case of patients who are on hypertension medication, when considering
      concomitant administration with α-blockers, adverse events such as orthostatic hypotension
      and dizziness due to drop in blood pressure is most concerned. In this regard, silodosin, as
      an alpha 1A adrenoceptor antagonist, has been proven have low occurrence of adverse events
      related to cardiovascular system and have little effect on blood pressure compared to other
      α-blockers.

      Thus, in this study, we aim to see the effect on cardiovascular system(blood pressure)
      Thrupas® capsule is administered every day for 12 weeks in patients with LUTS suggestive of
      BPH.
