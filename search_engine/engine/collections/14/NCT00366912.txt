      unloading the respiratory muscles. Spontaneous modes of NIV are usually being used in these
      situations. Spontaneous modes have the disadvantage, that the patient has to trigger the
      ventilator. The work to activate the trigger (WT) is estimated to be as high as up to 50% of
      the total work of breathing dependent on the underlying disease. Elimination of WT would
      increase the degree of respiratory muscle unloading.

      A new pressure controlled mode incorporated into the ventilogic mechanical ventilator
      (Weinmann, Germany) is capable of self adjusting respiratory parameters in a preset range
      according to the patient requirements.

      After a short period where the patients spontaneous respiratory parameters are being
      analyzed, the ventilator slowly implements a pressure controlled mode that matches the
      patients requirements.

      This study intends to investigate if this new mode achieves a higher degree of respiratory
      muscle unloading compared to a spontaneous mode.
