      non-transplant chronic kidney disease (CKD), sodium bicarbonate treatment seems to delay
      progressive decline in kidney function in those with low serum bicarbonate levels (metabolic
      acidosis). This may be because sodium bicarbonate reduces renal ammonia production and hence
      fibrosis. Observational evidence suggests that people with CKD and low-normal serum
      bicarbonate levels might also benefit from sodium bicarbonate treatment. TGF-beta1 levels
      seem to be an important predictor of chronic allograft nephropathy, and alkalinizing agents
      may have an effect on TFG-beta1 excretion.

      Retrospective analysis of participants in the African American Study of Kidney Disease and
      Hypertension showed the lowest risk of CKD progression was among those having baseline serum
      bicarbonate levels in the range of 28-30 mmol/L. Recent studies in people with pre-transplant
      CKD have suggested that increasing low serum bicarbonate levels (< 22 mmol/L) with
      alkalinizing agents such as sodium bicarbonate and sodium citrate may reduce CKD progression.

      Design: this is an open-label randomized study testing the effect of a six-month intervention
      with sodium bicarbonate 650 mg orally thrice daily versus no sodium bicarbonate treatment on
      renal ammonia excretion and urinary TGF-beta1.

      Visits will occur at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. At each follow-up visit, the study
      coordinator or principal investigator will review a medical questionnaire with the
      participant and collect a sample of blood and urine for analysis of urinary TGF-beta1,
      metabolic panel, pH, urinary net acid excretion, urinary bicarbonate and urinary ammonia.
