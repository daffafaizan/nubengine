    
      This is a prospective cohort study of patients obtaining medication abortion via mifepristone
      dispensed from an online mail order pharmacy. After an initial pilot test with 25 patients,
      the investigators will identify 15-20 clinics and/or medical facilities not currently
      providing medication abortion to participate in the study. The study team will train primary
      care providers to provide medication abortion with the medications dispensed via mail order
      pharmacy. The investigators aim to recruit approximately 400 patients for this study across
      all the sites. Patients will come in for an initial consult visit at the study site and then
      receive their medications at a preferred address within 3 days of the initial visit. Study
      participants will fill out surveys about their experience and feedback about the
      acceptability of the process; this will occur at 3 and 14 days after the initial recruitment
      visit. The investigators will also collect clinic data from patients and clinic sites to
      track clinical outcomes. And the investigators will interview providers at the end of the
      study to better understand their experiences prescribing mifepristone via mail-order.
