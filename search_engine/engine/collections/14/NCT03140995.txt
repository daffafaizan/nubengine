      fewer than 5 hours sleep per day has been associated with cardiovascular problems, diabetes
      and obesity and can also be linked to depression and anxiety. Poor sleep is a common
      complaint among people with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with disturbed sleep and fatigue known
      to affect up to 70% in this population. Poor sleep quality may contribute to the feelings of
      pain, fatigue and poor psychological well-being which in turn may further deteriorate
      functional ability and reduced activity.

      It is known that exercise improves a person's psychological state which can also be an
      additional factor in improving or indeed disrupting quality of sleep. Exercise has been
      identified as an important part of the nonpharmacological management of poor sleep and in
      improving sleep quality however, people with RA were previously cautioned about undertaking
      exercise. Therefore, changes in sleep quality during exercise intervention should be
      evaluated so that society can understand more the potential for long-term changes in overall
      health status, in people who have RA. Indeed the intensity level of the activity in people
      with RA may be of additional importance.
