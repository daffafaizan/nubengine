    
      The Surgical Pleth Index (SPI) and ANI (Analgesia Nociception Index) has been developed for
      monitoring of adequacy of analgesia during surgery.

      The investigators want to compare anesthesiologist guided intraoperative analgesia with
      intraoperative analgesia guieded by ANI or SPI.

      The following hypotheses have been made:

        1. Anesthesiologist guided analgesia will result in lower surgical stress

        2. Anesthesiologist guided analgesia will result in more hemodynamic stability and faster
           recovery of the patient after anesthesia
