      weeks, but the home-based group will follow the exercise protocol individually while the
      telerehabilitation-based group will follow the telerehabilitation-based under the guidance of
      the physiotherapist.

      Exercises will be applied 3 times a day according to the specified protocol. An information
      leaflet will be distributed to the home exercise group. The telerehabilitation-based group
      will receive telerehabilitation-based pelvic floor muscle training under the guidance of a
      physiotherapist individually for 2 sessions a week, the patient will do the exercises twice a
      day in the days of the sessions with the physiotherapist, and the remaining days will
      continue to do it 3 times a day like a home exercise group. The control group will not
      receive treatment other than their routine treatment, and the patients will be informed that
      they will be treated if they wish at the end of the study.

      The progression in Pelvic Floor Muscle Training will be achieved by increasing the exercise
      volume and diversifying the positions. The assessments will be applied at baseline, 4, 8, and
      12 weeks.
