      I. Evaluate response of platinum-resistant ovarian cancer to stereotactic body radiation
      therapy (SBRT) using fludeoxyglucose F 18 (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography
      (PET)/computed tomography (CT) 3 months after therapy.

      II. Determine the rate of grade 3 or greater non-hematologic acute toxicity from SBRT using
      Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate response to SBRT using cancer antigen-125 (CA-125) and symptom assessment using
      Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT)-Ovarian Symptom Index (FOSI).

      II. Determine the rate of late and non-grade 3 acute toxicity using CTCAE version 4.0.

      III. Evaluate local control, progression-free survival, and overall survival following SBRT.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo SBRT 5 days a week for approximately 1 week in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6 weeks, 3, 6, 9, and 12
      months, and then every 6 months for 4 years.
