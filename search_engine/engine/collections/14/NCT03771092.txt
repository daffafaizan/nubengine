      Anemia is defined as a hemoglobin value <12.0 g/dL (7.45 mmol/L). Management of IDA is based
      on martial iron supplementation. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effects of
      martial therapy, comparing different formulations, sucrosomal ferric pyrophosphate,
      SunActive®Fe micronized and ferric gluconate and different ways of administration, orally and
      intravenous, in subjects affected by sideropenic microcytic hypochromic anemia identified by
      the simultaneous presence of anemia, microcytosis and hypoferremia.

      Trial Design, Methods and Findings: Clinical data from 106 outpatients (82.8% female and
      17.2% male, mean age 50.4 years) were collected at Department of Internal Medicine, National
      Relevance and High Specialization Hospital Trust, ARNAS Civico-Di Cristina-Benfratelli,
      Palermo, Italy. The study envisaged five arms (2 + 3). At the first two arms were assigned
      patients with non-severe anemia Hb> 10 g/dl (Hb <12 g/dl for women and Hb <13 g/dl for men),
      treated with SunActive®Fe micronized or Lipofer®. At the other three arms were assigned
      patients with severe anemia (Hb <10 g/dl) treated respectively with SunActive®Fe micronized,
      Lipofer® or with intravenous ferric gluconate infusions according to departmental protocols.
      The followed methodology is defined in the PROBE project (acronym of Prospective Randomized
      Open Blinded End-point). The end points will be blinded with respect to the three treatments,
      as it will be the statistical analysis.
