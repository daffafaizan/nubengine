      stop fluid therapy is lacking. So the purpose of this study is to find a 'stop' moment for
      fluid therapy before peripheral edema will be present.

      With sublingual measurements of the vessel density with the Cytocam-IDF, comparing the septic
      patients with fluid overload , euvolemic post-cardiac surgery patients at the arrival on the
      ICU and healthy volunteers we can determine if there is a decrease in vessel density during
      fluid loading.

      To give a accurate view on fluid overload we include a bio-impedance measurement of reactance
      and resistance. Fluid balances are recorded very accurate by our electronic patient record.
