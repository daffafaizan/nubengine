      328. An antibody is a substance in the body that fights infection. CNTO 328 is an
      investigational drug that has been shown to slow down tumor growth or shrink tumors when
      tested in animals. In a previous clinical trial in patients with multiple myeloma (blood
      cancer), CNTO 328 appeared to be a potent inhibitor of IL-6 . One study has been completed
      for kidney cancer. There are studies ongoing in humans with multiple myeloma and prostate
      cancer to see if CNTO 328 is safe and to see what effects it has on these types of cancer.
      This is an open-label, nonrandomized, dose-finding phase 1 study with CNTO 328 in patients
      with B- cell non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma, Multiple Myeloma, or Castleman's disease. The purpose of
      this study is to evaluate different doses and schedules of CNTO 328 to see which
      dose/schedule is safe. CNTO 328 will be given through a small tube that goes directly into
      your vein, called an intravenous (IV) infusion. Depending on when the patient enters the
      study, the patient will be assigned to receive one course of CNTO 328 in one of the following
      groups: Group 1: 3 mg/kg 2 hr IV infusion every 2 weeks for 4 doses. Group 2: 6 mg/kg 2 hr IV
      infusion every 2 weeks for 4 doses. Group 3: 12 mg/kg 2 hr IV infusion every 3 weeks for 3
      doses. Group 4: 6 mg/kg 2 hr IV infusion every week for 7 doses. Group 5: 12 mg/kg 2 hr IV
      infusion every 2 weeks for 4 doses. Group 6: 12 mg/kg 1 hr IV infusion every 3 weeks for 3
      doses. Group 7a: 9 mg/kg 1 hr IV infusion every 3 weeks. Group 7b: 12 mg/kg 1hr IV infusion
      every 3 weeks for Castleman's patients only. In Groups 1-5, the overall amount of study drug
      that will be given increases with each higher group. Group 1 will be filled before Group 2
      starts and Group 2 will be filled before Group 3 starts, etc. In this way, CNTO 328 can be
      tested more safely. Both the patient and the study doctor will know to which group the
      patient is assigned. Patients will remain in the group that they are assigned to for the
      entire time of participation in the study. Up to 70 patients may take part in this study.
      Patients in Groups 1-6 will be in the study for up to 34 weeks prior to Post Study Follow-Up.
      Screening: up to 4 weeks before the first dose schedule of CNTO 328. Treatment: up to 6 weeks
      of treatment with CNTO 328. Extended Dosing: Patients assigned to Groups 1-6, and their
      cancer or disease has become stable or better while receiving CNTO 328, may be able to
      receive additional courses of study drug. Patients in Group 7 will be in the study until
      their disease gets worse, they can no longer tolerate CNTO 328, the study doctor feels it is
      in their best interest to stop CNTO 328 or they longer wish to participate in the study. Long
      Term Follow-Up: Patients will be contacted by telephone every six months after the last
      infusion of study drug to assess the patient's disease status and survival. Dose (6-12 mg/kg)
      and frequency (weekly or 2 or 3 week intervals) of dosing depends upon Group assignment. CNTO
      328 will be given through a small tube that goes directly into your vein, called an
      intravenous (IV) infusion. The infusion will take about 2 hours to complete for groups 1-5
      and 1 hour for Groups 6 and 7. In Groups 1-6, CNTO 328 will be given once every 1, 2 or 3
      weeks from days 1 to 43 depending on treatment assignment. In Group 7a and Group 7b, CNTO 328
      will be given on day 1 of each 21 day cycle.
