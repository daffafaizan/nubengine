      Patients with unresectable large HCC (>5cm in diameter) and huge HCC (>=10cm in diameter) are

      into the combined group (treated with TACE and synchronous ablation) and the control group
      (treated with TACE alone) according to the proportion of 1:1, which means 140 patients in
      each group. The criteria of inclusion and exclusion, and the methods of lab tests, imaging
      modality and treatment procedures are the same.
