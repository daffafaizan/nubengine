      acupressure point location guideline. The patients lay in the supine position before
      treatment and the gallium aluminum arsenide LaserPan (RJ-Laser, Reimers & Janssen GmbH,
      Waldkirch, Germany) will be applied to each selected acupoints mentioned above. The
      experimental group (verum laser acupuncture) and control group (sham laser acupuncture) will
      receive laser acupuncture 3 times per week for 3 weeks, total of 9 sessions, based on
      clinical experience (Treatment could be extended if necessary). The basic patient data will
      be recorded at baseline and adverse effect will also be recorded during the clinical trial.
