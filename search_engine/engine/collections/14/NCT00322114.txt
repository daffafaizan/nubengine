      Primary

        -  Determine whether lycopene supplementation affects percent free and bound
           prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in healthy participants.

      Secondary

        -  Determine whether lycopene reduces oxidative stress in these participants, as indicated
           by lipid peroxidation assay.

        -  Determine whether a 21-day washout period is sufficient to return lycopene, PSA, and
           lipid peroxidation products to baseline.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, placebo-controlled study. Participants are randomized to 1 of
      3 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Participants receive an oral tomato dietary supplement containing lycopene twice
           daily for 3 weeks.

        -  Arm II: Participants receive an oral tomato dietary supplement containing lycopene at a
           higher dose twice daily for 3 weeks.

        -  Arm III: Participants receive oral placebo twice daily for 3 weeks. Urine and blood
           samples are collected on days 0, 21, and 42.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 150 participants will be accrued for this study.
