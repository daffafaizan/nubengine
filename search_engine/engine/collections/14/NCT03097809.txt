      labile mood, impulse control problems, anxiety, depression and increase in incidence of
      suicide. However, until present the neurobiological basis of mood dysregulation in epilepsy
      has not been clear and has been mostly attributed to a psychological reaction to the illness.
      This has severely limited our understanding of the impairments in mood regulation that people
      with epilepsy often experience and has also limited the development of effective treatment
      for ameliorating psychosocial dysfunction in people with epilepsy. The identification of
      these circuits will not only increase our understanding of mood-regulation in epilepsy but
      also possibly provide biomarkers with which the effectiveness of new treatments can be
      investigated. Developing better diagnostic measures and treatments for mood dysregulation
      will be highly beneficial to the quality of life of subjects suffering from epilepsy.
