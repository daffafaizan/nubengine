      SUBLOCADE® (buprenorphine extended-release) injection for subcutaneous use CIII in the ED,
      Clinical Decision Unit, or inpatient unit and after administration of a test dose of
      SUBOXONE® (buprenorphine and naloxone) sublingual film, for sublingual or buccal use CIII
      among treatment-seeking adults with moderate or severe OUD increases subsequent outpatient
      treatment engagement as compared to a historical control cohort and concurrent controls who
      decline treatment participation. The study will also assess whether rapid initiation of
      SUBLOCADE® reduces subsequent ED visits for any reason. As a exploratory aim we will examine
      whether rapid initiation of Sublocade in this patient group reduces opioid overdose events
      compared to historical controls and patients who decline Sublocade.
