      I. To establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), dose-limiting toxicities (DLT), and
      recommended phase II dose of chronically dosed single-agent ABT-888 (veliparib) in patients
      with either a refractory breast cancer (BRCA) 1/2- mutated solid cancer; platinum-refractory
      ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer; or basal-like breast cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To establish the safety and tolerability of single-agent ABT-888 in the above patient
      population. A dose expansion at the recommended phase II dose will be performed in 6-12
      evaluable patients with germline BRCA mutations.

      II. To determine the effects of ABT-888 treatment on the level of poly ADP-ribose polymerase
      (PARP) inhibition and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage in peripheral blood mononuclear
      cells (PBMCs) and tumor samples or cells in malignant ascitic fluid.

      III. To determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) of chronically dosed ABT-888. IV. To document any
      evidence of anti-tumor response.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive veliparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID)* on days 1-28. Courses repeat every
      28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      NOTE: *Patients receive veliparib once on day 1 of course 1 for pharmacokinetic and
      pharmacodynamic studies.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed for 4 weeks.
