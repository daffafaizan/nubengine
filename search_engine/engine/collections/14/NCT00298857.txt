      conducted to determine the appropriate doses of drugs for patients with different weights in
      order to find the safest and most effective dose for various weights. Valproic acid is a
      commonly used agent for the treatment of epilepsy, as well as migraine headaches and
      psychiatric disorders. This prospective study is designed to evaluate the effects of obesity
      on the pharmacokinetic parameters of valproic acid when compared to individuals at their
      healthy weight.
