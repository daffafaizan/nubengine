      1) standing anteroposterior radiographs of the full-length lower limb with patients in the
      standing position. ( HKA Long Film Radiographs ).

      Measurements :

        1. mechanical hip-knee-ankle axis (HKA) angle: the angle formed by the mechanical axes of
           the femur and tibia

        2. anatomical hip-knee-ankle axis (HKA) angle: the angle formed by the anatomical axes of
           the femur and tibia

        3. For condylar orientation : the mechanical lateral distal femoral angle (mLDFA) was
           defined as an angle formed by the mechanical axis of the femur and the line connecting
           the distal ends of the medial and lateral femoral condyles of the femur.

        4. For tibia plateau inclination : the mechanical lateral proximal tibial angle (mLPTA) was
           defined as an angle formed by the mechanical axis of the tibia and the articular surface
           of the proximal tibia .

        5. Coronal femoral bowing Using the method of Yau et al. : the femoral diaphysis was
           divided into four equal parts, . Because Yau et al. didn't exactly describe the femoral
           diaphysis, we had defined the femoral diaphysis from the lower border of the lesser
           trochanter to upper border of the distal femoral segment which is defined by a square
           whose sides have the same length as the widest part of the femoral condyle so called
           rule of square (from the lowest level of the lesser trochanter to 5 cm above the lowest
           level of the lateral femoral condyle), and the midpoint of the endosteal intramedullary
           canal was depicted in each quarter. The angulation between midlines drawn in the
           proximal and distal quarters of the femoral diaphysis will be measured
