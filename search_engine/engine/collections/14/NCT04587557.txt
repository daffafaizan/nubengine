    
      This was a 2 x 2 x 2 randomized controlled trial with 52 children (26 with ASD and 26 with
      TD) recruited in the community and randomized into four groups: 1) ASD Group 1 - storytelling
      with contextual information; 2) ASD Group 2 - storytelling without contextual information; 3)
      TD Group 1 - storytelling with contextual information; 4) TD Group 2 - storytelling without
      contextual information. All stories were photo-based and static in nature. The only
      difference between Group 1 and Group 2 was that the stories included and did not include
      social contextual information, respectively. Training was delivered in small groups, with
      eight sessions across four weeks, two sessions per week, and 30 minutes per session.
      Participants' total fixation duration (TFD), total visit duration (TVD), and total fixation
      count (TFC) on human faces from 20 photos and a video were recorded using the Tobii eye
      tracker.
