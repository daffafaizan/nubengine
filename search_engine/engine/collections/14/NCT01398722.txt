      reduced morbidity and mortality of surgical and medical intensive care patients. Blood sugar
      control with intravenous insulin may improve prognosis of patients undergoing cardiac
      surgery. It is not clear what the best insulin regimen is or what is the best blood sugar
      target in these patients. So far, most of researches have focused on adult patients but
      little on infants. The current prospective, randomized, controlled study will assess the
      impact of intensive insulin therapy on the outcome of infants undergoing cardiac surgery. On
      admission, patients will be randomly assigned to either strict normalization of blood glucose
      ( 110-150 mg/dl) with intensive insulin therapy or the conventional approach, in which blood
      glucose levels are maintained between 150 and 180 mg/dl.
