      management is to increase the amount of dietary fibres. In some IBS patients fibres have a
      deleterious effect on pain and bloating. It has been shown that butyrate can increase colonic
      sensitivity in rats. Our purpose is to study whether butyrogenic fibres can modify rectal
      sensitivity and symptoms in IBS and healthy control through a modification of colonic flora.
