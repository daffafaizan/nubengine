      is a molecule that is important to cartilage structure, and is lost as arthritis develops.
      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is one of the best ways to image cartilage, and an
      investigational MRI technique that has shown great promise in detecting proteoglycan amounts
      is called T1-rho.

      In this study, patients with hip dysplasia will undergo this investigational MRI in addition
      to a well validated MRI method (called dGEMRIC) to see if T1-rho is as good as dGEMRIC at
      detecting cartilage damage. The dGEMRIC MRI requires an injection of a contrast agent, while
      the T1-rho MRI does not. If the T1-rho is shown to be as useful as the dGEMRIC method it can
      then be used to look at cartilage damage in the hip without having to have an injection.
