      mild to critical spectrum. About 80% of laboratory confirmed infections presented with mild
      symptoms, usually not requiring hospitalization. Critical disease requiring respiratory
      and/or circulatory support was reported in 5% of the subjects. Acute respiratory distress
      syndrome represents the most common complication in patients with severe disease. Several
      cases of venous thromboembolism in patients with laboratory confirmed infection have been
      reported, but it is unclear if this occurrence is higher in this specific patients'
      population. The purpose of the present study is to assess the prevalence of deep venous
      thrombosis in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 admitted to the Intensive care Unit requiring
      invasive mechanical ventilation using vein ultrasonography.
