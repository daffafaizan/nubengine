      your cardiovascular and bone health are performed. The details and timing of the tests are
      explained below.

      VISIT #1 During the first visit, a research doctor or assistant explains the procedures in
      detail and answers questions. Blood is drawn (about 1-2 tablespoons) to confirm the diagnosis
      of hyperparathyroidism and get baseline blood values.

      VISIT #2-4 During the following visits, a variety of procedures are performed to evaluate
      cardiovascular and bone health. The details of the procedures and when they will be performed
      are outlined below.

        1. Blood tests are performed at each visit. Approximately 1-2 tablespoons of blood will be
           drawn at each visit.

        2. A 24-hour urine collection is done 3 times during the 2 year study.

        3. Bone mineral density testing (known as DXA) is performed at baseline, 12 and 24 months
           after enrollment.

        4. Carotid Ultrasound: At the baseline visit, 12 and 24 months after enrollment, carotid
           ultrasound is performed.

        5. Echocardiogram: At the baseline visit, 12 and 24 months after enrollment, an
           echocardiogram is performed.

        6. Endothelial Function: At baseline, 6 and 12 months after enrollment, flow mediated
           dilation of the brachial artery is performed.
