    
      This is a study to determine the safety and tolerability of cumulative dosing with
      levalbuterol tartrate HFA inhalation aerosol MDI using a valved holding chamber and facemask
      in pediatric subjects birth to ≤ 48 months of age with acute bronchospasm. It is a
      randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, multicenter, trial of 3 doses of levalbuterol
      tartrate HFA inhalation aerosol MDI in pediatric subjects birth to ≤ 48 months of age who
      present to either the Emergency Department (ED) or their physician's office with an acute
      bronchospasm. Subjects presenting to the ED or physician's office with an acute bronchospasm
      must have a history of reactive airways disease, based on subjects' parent/guardian report.

      Eligible subjects whose parent(s) or legal guardian(s) provide written informed consent to
      participate will be randomized to 1 of 2 treatments. Treatment 1 consists of 3 doses, with
      each dose comprised of 8 puffs (4 puffs of levalbuterol tartrate HFA inhalation aerosol 45
      mcg/puff plus 4 puffs of placebo HFA [cumulative dose of 540 mcg levalbuterol tartrate HFA
      inhalation aerosol]); Treatment 2 consists of 3 doses, with each dose comprised of 8 puffs of
      levalbuterol tartrate HFA inhalation aerosol 45 mcg/puff (4 puffs of levalbuterol tartrate
      HFA inhalation aerosol 45 mcg/puff plus 4 puffs of levalbuterol tartrate HFA inhalation
      aerosol 45 mcg/puff [cumulative dose of 1080 mcg of levalbuterol tartrate HFA inhalation
      aerosol]). For each Treatment, study medication will be administered every 20 minutes over a
      period of 1 hour for three doses.
