      two digital health interventions for adults with OCD recruited nationally. Eligible subjects
      (N=120) will be randomly assigned (50/50 chance) to 12 weeks of app-based CBT on their
      personal Smartphone or 12 weeks of web-based health and well-being education in addition to
      completing clinical assessments and questionnaires from home. All participants will have
      access to a coach to help guide them through their assigned program. Total participation time
      for the study is approximately 6 months, and all study appointments (5 total) occur over
      secure phone or video conference call.
