      has been shown to reduce either short-term or long-term mortality and morbidity, the risk of
      death therefore remains high for preterm infants. Study reported that 50% chance of death
      with neonatal intensive care appeared at 24 weeks in most high-income countries and 34 in
      low-income and middle-income countries. Among the survivors, bronchopulmonary dysplasia(BPD),
      neurologic impairment and retinopathy of prematurity(ROP) were the main causes of secondary
      death, rehospitalization and medical resource use. How to reduce rate of mortality and severe
      complications constitutes a challenge for neonatologists.

      An interesting result was that HFOV did reduce the incidence of mortality as compared with
      CMV(2:9 vs 3:3, 95%confidence intervel(CI) 0.09-0.89, P=0.03) (4:177 vs 13:179, 95%CI
      0.10-0.94, P=0.04). The results suggested that, excluding preterm infants with RDS, HFOV
      could also reduce other primary outcomes, such as the risk of death, BPD, IVH and neurologic
      impairment.
