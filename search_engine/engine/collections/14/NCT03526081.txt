      present in the human diet. Examples of FO-containing foods and beverages are parsley, celery,
      and chamomile. The study described below will provide initial information of apigenin derived
      metabolites in humans. The investigators suggest the information that will be obtained from
      the outlined work will be particularly timely given increasing interest in the putative
      health effects of FO intake in humans.

      This study consisted of two parts. The first part consisted of a probe study in which the
      investigators investigated the absorption and metabolism from four flavone-containing test
      products. The second phase investigated absorption and metabolism after the intake of a
      flavone-containing parsley drink.
