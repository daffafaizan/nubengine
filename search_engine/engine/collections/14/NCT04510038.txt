      a poor prognosis with currently no known treatment. Colchicine is a widely available,
      well-established, inexpensive, oral anti-inflammatory agent that has been FDA approved for
      the treatment of inflammatory disorders including gout and familial Mediterranean Fever.
      Trials have also shown its benefit to prevent post-cardiotomy syndrome, to treat acute and
      recurrent pericarditis, and reduce cardiovascular events after myocardial infarction. We
      extrapolate based on these indications and studies that colchicine may also help improve
      outcomes in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with evidence of cardiac injury.

      This is an unblinded and randomized study comparing the treatment of colchicine plus current
      care (per institution treating physicians) as the active arm vs. current standard of care
      alone (per institution treating physicians) as the control arm.
