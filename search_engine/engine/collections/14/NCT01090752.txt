      diabetes. Their use is however associated with fluid retention and an increased risk of
      congestive heart failure. We previously demonstrated that pioglitazone increases proximal
      sodium reabsorption in healthy volunteers. This study examines the effects of pioglitazone on
      renal sodium handling in subjects prone to insulin resistance, i.e. diabetic and/or
      hypertensive subjects.

      Methods: In this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, four-way, cross-over study, we
      examined the effects of pioglitazone (45mg daily during 6 weeks) or placebo on renal,
      systemic and hormonal responses to changes in sodium intake in 16 individuals, 8 with type 2
      diabetic and 8 with hypertension.
