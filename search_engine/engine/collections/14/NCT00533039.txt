      thrombotic lesion during angioplasty. In response to the ischemia sPLA2, possibly localized
      within atherosclerotic vascular tissue as well as from macrophages and monocytes, is
      released. Following ischemia-induced release, sPLA2 can bind to ischemically challenged
      cardiomyocytes and adversely affect their survival either directly through toxic effects on
      cardiomyocytes or indirectly by facilitating inflammation. It may be possible through sPLA2
      inhibition to salvage non-lethally jeopardized cells following an ischemic episode thereby
      reducing the infarcted area and amount of tissue damage. Previous studies in patients with
      unstable angina support this hypothesis, and conclude that sPLA2 levels can be used to
      predict clinical outcomes. We hypothesize that sPLA2 inhibition with A-002 will reduce
      myocardial injury post-angioplasty.

      Substudy - Peripheral vascular ultrasound should be done prior to receiving study drug and
      24h post-PCI. Coronary endothelial function will be assessed at the time of PCI.
