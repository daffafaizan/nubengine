    
      The purpose of this study is to obtain subjective feedback in a home use environment
      regarding usability and ease of use of the applicator and conception cap and the instructions
      for use. Data will be collected and evaluation to determine if the usability requirements of
      the conception system as determined by the usability specification have been met. The study
      will not involve sexual intercourse or delivery of any fluids to the cervix. The study will
      only involve use of the applicator to insert the cervical cap into the vagina, track it to
      the cervix and prepare and release the cervical cap (with removal string attached) onto the
      cervix. The conception cap will remain in place for no more than 6 hours.
