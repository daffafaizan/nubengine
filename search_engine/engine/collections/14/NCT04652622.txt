      delivery systems and sensor technologies. Mindful Garden delivers real 2-dimensional nature
      video layered with hyper-real 3-dimensional animations of growing and receding flowers and
      butterflies in flight which aims to reduce anxiety and agitation in the delirious critical
      care population. In doing so, a reduction in the need for reliance on pharmacological
      interventions and the use of physical restraints, which have been linked to adverse outcomes
      and significant side effects, may be achieved.

      Participants with a diagnosis of hyperactive delirium in the critical care units will be
      randomized to receive 4 hours of exposure to the MG platform in addition to standard care or
      to the control arm of monitoring with standard care only for the same time period.
