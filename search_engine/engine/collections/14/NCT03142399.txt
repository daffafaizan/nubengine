      high prevalence, morbidity and mortality. In Brazil, it is an important cause of
      hospitalization and one of the most important health challenges, since its prevalence tends
      to increase with the aging of the population and the increase in the survival of patients who
      have suffered acute coronary events. This is an ongoing epidemic problem, resulting in a high
      socioeconomic cost, represented by the expense of medications, repeated hospitalizations,
      loss of productivity, early retirements, possible surgeries and, ultimately, heart
      transplantation. In this sense, it is of great importance to carry out studies that evaluate
      the possible benefits of new clinical and nutritional interventions for HF patients, favoring
      the development of treatment strategies for these individuals and also for public health.

      Our hypothesis is based on the fact that whey protein supplementation associated with
      physical exercise in patients with heart failure could promote preservation of muscle mass,
      increase in muscle strength, and improve quality of life, Body composition and physical
      capacity. The volunteers will receive 30 grams per day of whey protein or maltodextrin in a
      double-blind, controlled clinical trial lasting 12 weeks. During this period they will
      perform supervised physical exercise 3 times a week in a cardiac rehabilitation program. They
      will also receive nutritional counseling.
