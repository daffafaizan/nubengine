      the administration of azacytidine (Vidaza®) combined to donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) could
      improve the response rate to DLI in the population of patients with relapsed acute myeloid
      leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell
      transplantation.

      Because the investigators focus our interest on relapsed MDS and low marrow blast count
      relapsed AML, the investigators postulate that one cycle at higher doses of azacytidine given
      at 100 mg/m² during 5 days is enough to induce temporary disease control, as suggested by the
      predictive value of the immediate response rate after the first cycle described in the study
      of Czibere et al. Starting with cycle 2, the investigators propose to administer DLI along
      with azacytidine to optimise the immunomodulatory effect. Because these immunomodulatory
      effects have been described at low dose, the investigators postulate that 35 mg/m² given
      during 5 days is enough to harness a graft-versus-leukemia effect and induce durable
      remissions without exacerbating GvHD. DLI will be given every other cycle following an
      escalated-dose regimen.

      The investigators have estimated a sample size of 50 patients to be recruited during 4 years
      with a 2-year follow-up and a 3-year long-term follow-up. The whole study will be completed
      within 9 years.
