      consumed as part of the human diet, many times in higher amounts than other flavonoid
      classes. Red wine is also an important source of anthocyanins, especially Mv3glc.

      Several epidemiological studies have suggested that the consumption of anthocyanin-rich
      foods, including the moderate consumption of red wine, is positively associated with the
      prevention of cardiovascular heart disease.

      It has become clear that the flavonoid bioactive forms in vivo are not necessarily those
      which occur in nature, but metabolites arising after absorption takes place.Therefore,
      studying the bioavailability of red wine ANT is very important to identify which metabolites
      (originated in vivo) can actually reach the target organs (and in which concentrations) and
      may be responsible for the postulated health benefits of red wine.

      Intervention protocol:

      Urine samples and peripheral venous blood (10 ml) will be collected from 10 h-fasting
      subjects. Afterwards, each volunteer will consume 250 ml of table red wine or 150 ml of young
      Port red wine and blood samples will be collected 15, 30, 60 and 120 min after wines
      ingestion. Another urine sample will be collected at 120 min.

      Table red wine 12 % (250 ml) and young Port red wine 20 % (150 ml), two different food
      matrices rich in ANT, provided the same amount of ethanol (24 g of ethanol).

      A thorough screening analysis for ANT will be performed in plasma and urine samples collected
      from the volunteers at different time points.
