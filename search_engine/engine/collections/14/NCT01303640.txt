      Biolimus-eluting stent is a new coronary drug-eluting stent, which is going to be approved in
      2011 by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare. It has been reported that
      biolimus-eluting stent had lower rate of target-lesion revascularization and stent thrombosis
      at 9 months as compared with paclitaxel-eluting stent. However, trial results comparing
      biolimus-eluting stent with everolimus-eluting stent are largely unknown. The purpose of this
      study is to evaluate whether the newly-approved biolimus-eluting stent is not inferior to the
      everolimus-eluting stent in terms of the rate of target-lesion revascularization at 1-year
      and death or myocardial infarction at 3-year after stent implantation in the real world
      clinical practice. The design of this study is all-comer design enrolling patients scheduled
      for percutaneous coronary intervention using drug-eluting stents without any exclusion
      criteria.
