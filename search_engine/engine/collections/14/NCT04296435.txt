    
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the impact of the schedule (day or night) and the day of
      admission (working or weekend / night) on the mortality of patients with non-varicose upper
      gastrointestinal bleeding after performing an early gastroscopy.

      A retrospective observational study will be carried out in patients admitted to the bleeding
      unit of the Santa Creu I Sant Pau Hospital, where we observed hospital mortality and 30 days
      after performing an early gastroscopy, the duration of admission, signs of hemorrhagic
      activity in a period of less than 12 h. After early gastroscopy and types of endoscopic
      treatments, data will be collected by reviewing medical records.

      The number of patients expected to be included in this study is 1320 patients. Patients will
      be included the day they enter the bleeding unit for an early gastroscopy.
