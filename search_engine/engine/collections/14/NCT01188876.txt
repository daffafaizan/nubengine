    
      -  Since we are looking for the highest dose of the study drug that can be administered
           safely without severe or unmanageable side effects, not everyone who participates will
           receive the same dose of the study drug.

        -  Each study cycle will last 28 days. On Day 1, participants will receive carboplatin
           intravenously. On Days 1 and 15 of each cycle they will receive pralatrexate
           intravenously. Participants will also be asked to take folic acid orally on a daily
           basis starting 7 days before the first dose of pralatrexate and continuing until 30 days
           after the last dose of pralatrexate. They will also receive a vitamin B12 injection no
           more than 10 weeks prior to the first dose of pralatrexate and every 8-10 weeks after
           the first dose of pralatrexate.

        -  Participants will come to the clinic on Day 1 and 15 of each cycle and have the
           following tests/procedures performed: Medical history; Vital signs; Blood tests,
           assessment of the tumor (every two cycles) and an EKG (before the start of cycle 2).

        -  In addition, during Cycle 1, participants will come to the clinic weekly for blood
           tests.

        -  Pharmacokinetic (PK) blood samples (to monitor how the body absorbs and breaks down the
           study drug) will be done at the following time points during Cycle 1: Day 1-3 and Day
           15-17.

        -  Participants will be asked to take the study drugs for up to 6 cycles. They may continue
           beyond 6 cycles as long as there is evidence that the tumor is not growing and they are
           not experiencing any unacceptable side effects.
