      activity is a relevant alternative to promote OSA decrease with ou without weight loss.

      Physical activity, beyond the improvement of body composition and exercise cardiorespiratory
      capacity, restricts fluid retaining in the lower limb of the leg by the activation of
      musculovenous pump. Fluid retaining is involved in OSA severity because of nocturnal fluid
      shift from legs to rostral zone which promotes pharyngeal oedema development and upper airway
      collapsibility.

      It has been previously shown that venous compression leads to beneficial fluid regulation in
      OSA subjects and appears as an efficient tool in OSA management.

      To the investigators knowledge no study assess the impact of the cumulative effect of
      physical and venous compression program on upper airway resistances in obese teenager with
      OSA.
