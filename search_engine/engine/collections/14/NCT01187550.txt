      considerable inter individual variability. This is particularly evident for the endpoint of
      paediatric GH administration, that is (i.e.) the growth response, which is pronounced in
      children who are affected by GHD. This is an open-label, multicentric study in which subjects
      pre-diagnosed with GHD were treated for 4 weeks with Saizen. Two hundred fourteen GHD
      evaluable pre-pubertal subjects were planned to be recruited in approximately 9 sites in
      China. Demographic data, medical history, tanner stage, physical examination, body weight,
      height, bone age measurement, body mass index, review of baseline medications and procedures
      and blood sampling were performed at baseline visit, end of treatment visit (week 4) and at 4
      week follow-up visit.

      OBJECTIVES

      Primary objective:

        -  To compare the response between GHD children born AGA and those born SGA after 4 weeks
           of Saizen therapy

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To explore the contribution of selected genes to the phenotype of GHD children

        -  To explore the impact of gene polymorphisms on the levels of specific serum biomarkers
           in GHD children after 4 weeks of Saizen therapy

        -  To explore the relationships between changes in gene expression and changes in serum
           biomarkers after 4 weeks of Saizen therapy and the spectrum of gene polymorphisms in GHD
           children
