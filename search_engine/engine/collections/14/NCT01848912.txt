      selected for continuous monitoring of heart rate, respiratory and temperate variability. Data
      is collected as per standard practice using the Zephyr Biopatch device, a highly compact
      wireless monitor with two small gel electrodes, that is much more comfortable than previous
      belt/strap-based monitoring devices.

      The patient is asked to wear the Zephyr Biopatch device for approximately 23 hours a day,
      beginning the day before he/she begins bone marrow transplant. The patient is asked to
      continue wearing the device for a period of up to 10 days or until he/she is no longer
      experiencing any fever. The Zephyr Biopatch device records heart rate, respiratory rate and
      temperature for calculation of heart rate variability (HRV), respiratory rate variability
      (RRV) and temperature variability (TV) using the Continuous Multiorgan Individualized
      Variability Analysis (CIMVATM) software engine. The variability outcomes will look at the
      presence, rapidity and severity of change in variability prior to the onset, diagnosis and
      treatment of infection. Bloodwork will also be performed to check for certain biomarkers that
      may indicate infection.
