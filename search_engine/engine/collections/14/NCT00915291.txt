      companies have expended increasing resources to market their products to the public. This has
      led to increased awareness of diseases and potential treatments, but it has also created more
      public demand for medications that may not be appropriate for a patient's clinical
      presentation. This study aims to provide physicians with the knowledge and skills required to
      help them address inappropriate DTCA medication requests from patients.
