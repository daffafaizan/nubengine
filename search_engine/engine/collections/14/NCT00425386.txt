      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of erlotinib hydrochloride when administered with
           sunitinib malate in patients with unresectable or metastatic renal cell carcinoma.

        -  Determine the 8-month progression-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the safety of sunitinib malate and erlotinib hydrochloride in these patients.

        -  Determine the duration of response in these patients.

        -  Determine the proportion of patients whose best overall response is complete response,
           partial response, stable disease, or progressive disease.

        -  Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the maximum percent reduction in tumor measurement in patients treated with
           this regimen.

        -  Collect blood and tissue from these patients for future correlative studies.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation study of erlotinib
      hydrochloride.

      Patients receive oral sunitinib malate once daily on days 1-28 and oral erlotinib
      hydrochloride once daily on days 1-42. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of erlotinib hydrochloride until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which 33% of patients
      experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, patients are treated with
      erlotinib hydrochloride at the MTD and sunitinib malate.

      Patients undergo blood and tumor specimen collection periodically during study for future
      correlative studies.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 49 patients will be accrued for this study.
