      I. To estimate the mean lesion stiffness in patients with radiation necrosis using magnetic
      resonance elastography (MRE).

      II. To estimate the mean lesion stiffness in patients with glioma recurrence using magnetic
      resonance elastography (MRE).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To investigate the mean lesion stiffness between radiation necrosis and glioma recurrence.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo MRE over 10 minutes and then undergo standard of care magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) of the brain with and without contrast at baseline. Within 4 weeks after the
      initial MRI and MRE scans, patients may undergo standard of care biopsy to check the status
      of the disease. Within 48 hours after biopsy, patients undergo standard of care MRI to check
      the status of the disease. Patients who do not undergo biopsy undergo standard of care MRI
      4-8 weeks after MRE scan to check the status of the disease.
