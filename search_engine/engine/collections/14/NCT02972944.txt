      disease. Currently, there is lack of good quality studies comparing risks and benefits of
      early laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the elderly patients. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is
      the only curative treatment for gallstone disease of acute calculous cholecystitis.

      Aim: The purpose is to find out the most effective treatment (laparoscopic cholecystectomy
      vs. conservative) with the least morbidity for elderly patients with acute cholecystitis.

      Study design: multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT).

      Patient allocation: Elderly patients with diagnosis of acute cholecystitis will be randomly
      allocated to either early laparoscopic cholecystectomy or treatment with antibiotics.
      Reasonably healthy elderly patients (ASA 2-3) are included in this study, excluding the
      patients with ASA-class above 4.

      Interventions: The study group of patients will undergo early laparoscopic cholecystectomy
      within 48 hours after hospitalization. The other group will be managed conservatively with
      intravenous antibiotics and elective cholecystectomy will not be scheduled later.

      Primary outcome: Assessment of morbidities and individual quality of life. Secondary outcomes
      include number of hospital admissions, length of hospitalization, pain, complications,
      mortality and cost analysis.

      Sample size and data-analysis: Based on data of previous studies the recruitment of 200
      patients in total is expected. Follow-up will be for 12 months.
