      treatment arm followed by an open label trial at 6 months for any sham treatment arm
      participants who do not meet treatment success.

      The primary goal is to compare the subjective success rates for the resolution of UI for the
      vaginal laser treatment at 6 months. Secondary aims include an assessment of complications,
      resolution of SUI symptoms (objective and subjective measures), patient bother from UI,
      quality of life and patient satisfaction. The proposed sample size is 182 patients. At the
      6-month post treatment evaluation, the treatment allocation will be unmasked. The trial will
      be of approximately 3 years in duration (1 year to recruit and 2 years for follow up).
