      of these medications get into the genital tract. Raltegravir is a new HIV medication that
      blocks HIV growth and lowers the amount of virus in the blood in a way that is different than
      all other currently available HIV medications. Raltegravir was recently approved by the Food
      and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in HIV infected patients, but there is very little
      information concerning how much raltegravir will reach the genital tract of men or women. The
      purpose of this research study is to determine how much raltegravir gets into the male and
      female genital tract.
