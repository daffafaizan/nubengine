      be conceptualized as "a set of complex emotional and attentional regulation strategies
      developed for a variety of purposes including the development of emotional well-being and
      balance". Affective (emotional) and cognitive (attentional) control are therefore the most
      likely mechanisms by which meditation could impact aging and AD. Specifically, meditation
      could enhance the controlling role of mid-brain structures and the executive network over
      structures involved in memory, emotions, and regulation of the immune system. This would lead
      to better emotional and cognitive control which in turn would be associated with improved
      mental and physical health.
