      and Molecular NeuroImanging (MNI) in New Haven, CT. Approximately 25 patients with mild to
      moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 20 healthy controls will be recruited to participate in
      this study. AD patients will be eligible to participate if they have a diagnosis of AD of
      less than 3 years duration. Healthy controls will be examined to ensure that there is no
      evidence of neurodegenerative changes including cognitive decline. All subjects will undergo
      written informed consent and a screening evaluation including baseline clinical laboratory
      testing, a baseline physical and neurological evaluation and baseline cognitive evaluations.
      Subjects will be asked to undergo either a bolus injection or bolus injection followed by
      continuous infusion of 123-I IMPY. Following injection, subjects will undergo serial SPECT
      imaging scans and serial venous plasma sampling for measurement of 123-I IMPY in plasma (both
      protein bound and free) over a 3.5 - 8 hour period. The imaging analyses will be performed by
      an image-processing specialist who will remain masked to the procedures employed with each
      imaging acquisition. The primary imaging outcome measure will be the brain regional
      distribution volumes expressed as a brain tissue to plasma ratio of the radioligand, 123-I
      IMPY.
