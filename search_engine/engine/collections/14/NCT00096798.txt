      will determine whether ethyl-EPA, an omega-3 fatty acid, can be used safely and effectively
      to treat major depression.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either ethyl EPA-containing pills or
      placebo daily for 8 weeks. Each week, participants will be asked to complete questionnaires
      which will be used to assess the severity of their depression.
