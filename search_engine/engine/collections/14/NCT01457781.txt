      (INOpulseÂ® DS) is safe and efficacious in treating Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH).
      Medical literature and clinical experience suggests that iNO at pulsed doses of 0.013 to 0.1
      mg/kg per hour for 1 month to 2+ years appears safe and suggests efficacy for the treatment
      of pulmonary hypertension.

      There are two parts to this study. In Part 1 (week 0 to week 16), the objectives are to
      determine the safety, tolerability, efficacy, and exploratory objectives of two different
      doses of iNO delivered by a pulsed delivery device in symptomatic subjects with PAH who
      remain symptomatic due to PAH on approved PAH monotherapy or combination approved PAH
      therapy. In Part 2 (week 17 to end of study Part 2 [EOS Part 2]), the objective is to compile
      data on the long-term effects of iNO on safety, tolerability, clinical and hemodynamic
      measures.
