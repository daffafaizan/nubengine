      of morbidity and mortality from cardioendocrine disease. Excessive accumulation of visceral
      fat after SCI is a serious risk component for cardioendocrine disease and results in part
      from pronounced hypertriglyceridemia following ingestion of fat-containing meals (i.e.,
      exaggerated postprandial lipemia; PPL). Although exaggerated PPL is well documented in
      persons with SCI, its etiology is unknown. Specifically, it remains to be determined to what
      extent exaggerated PPL in those with SCI results from impairments in the use of exogenous
      (dietary) and/or endogenous (stored) fats. Additionally, it is not known if exercise improves
      postprandial fat use in a manner that alleviates the exaggerated PPL in this population and
      reduces the risk of cardioendocrine disease.

      The objective of the this study is to examine the mechanisms of exaggerated PPL in those with
      SCI and the effects of an acute pre-meal exercise bout by employing novel stable isotope
      tracer techniques. In persons without SCI, it is well established that pre-meal exercise
      lowers PPL in part by improving the use of exogenous and endogenous fats. While muscle
      atrophy and blunted sublesional sympathetic activity following SCI may hinder fat use,
      preliminary data indicate that fat use is increased during recovery from exercise in the
      postabsorptive (fasted) state in this population. Thus, the investigators hypothesize that
      decreased use of exogenous and endogenous fats contributes to exaggerated PPL in SCI, and
      that pre-meal exercise will reduce PPL due to increased use of both fat sources.
