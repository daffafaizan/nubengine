      replication , but Peg-IFN-α also play an important role in immune regulation. In hepatitis B
      infection, CD8+T cells are the main effector cells in adaptive immune response.Peg-IFN-α
      recommended as the first-line treatment has a higher chance to achieve HBeAg seroconversion
      and even HBsAg disappearance than nucleoside analog(ue) drugs, which may be related to the
      functional activation of CD8+T cells in the case of hepatitis and the function enhancement of
      CD8+T cells during Peg-IFN-α therapy. This study was aimed at investigating the changes of
      CD8+T cells frequency and function, and the expression of costimulatory molecules during
      Peg-IFN-αand nucleoside analog(ue) therapy.Meanwhile, the investigators want to explore
      whether the decline of HBsAg and HBeAg resulted in recovery of CD8+T cells function, or
      recovery of CD8+T cells function led to the decrease of HBsAg and HBeAg. Several studies
      demonstrated that HBsAg and HBeAg could damage CD8+T cells function, and the loss of HBsAg
      and HBeAg led to recovery of CD8+T cells function.
