    
      Study specific aim is to Coagulate the tissue volume of a proven breast cancer with MRgFUS
      and Collect post treatment follow-up clinical and radiological data for a period of 5 years
      following MRgFUS for breast cancer.

      Safety of the treatment will be evaluated by recording and assessing the incidence and
      severity of device- related complications from the first visit through the 5 years follow-up
      period.

      Secondary objective of this study is to evaluate post treatment local recurrence in the same
      quadrant or less then 4cm from the periphery of the treated lesion, during a 5 year period
      following the MRgFUS treatment.

      Women with breast cancer in whom breast MR imaging identifies a single focal breast lesion up
      to 1.5 cm in diameter will be eligible for the study.
