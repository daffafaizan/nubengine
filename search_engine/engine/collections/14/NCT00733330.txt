      non navigated conventional TKA, specifically 3 months to demonstrate the variability of the
      mechanical axis.

      Secondary endpoints: to compare the precision of the long leg alignment of the Ci MiTKA vs.
      the non navigated conventional TKA specifically to demonstrate the proportion of procedures
      that fall within a satisfactory alignment window in either group.
