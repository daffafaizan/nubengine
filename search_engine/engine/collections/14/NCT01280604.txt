      levels as patients on 160mg of fenofibrate.

      The primary objective of this randomized trial is to measure the impact of converting
      patients on statin therapy from fenofibrate 160mg to 54mg per day compared to patients who
      continue fenofibrate 160mg per day for triglycerides. Secondary objectives include evaluating
      effect of the dosage change on low-density lipoprotein (LDL), HDL, alanine aminotransferase
      (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and serum creatinine (SCr), and the potential cost
      savings associated with prescribing 54mg instead of 160mg. Electronic medical records will be
      used to identify subjects and gather data on demographics, comorbid conditions, and
      concomitant lipid lowering therapy. Subjects will be recruited for enrollment via telephone
      by the principal investigator (PI), co-principal investigators (Co-PIs), or provider referral
      after eligibility screening and approval from their primary care physician. Subjects must
      provide written informed consent and Health Insurance Privacy and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
      privacy rule authorization prior to participation in this study. Subjects will be randomized
      to either the intervention arm (conversion to 54mg of fenofibrate) or to the control arm
      (remain on 160mg of fenofibrate). Subjects in both study arms will have fasting lipid panels,
      ALT/AST, and SCr evaluated at baseline. All subjects will have repeat labs approximately 8
      weeks after enrollment. All subjects will continue to receive standard care based on lipid
      values. The study period will begin approximately October 29, 2010 and run to June 30, 2011.
