      leucovorin and 5-Fu introduced by hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) may improve
      the survivals for advanced stage HCC. Thus, the investigators carried out this prospective
      randomized control study to determine the recommended dose as well as the safety and
      efficacy.
