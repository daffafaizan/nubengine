      infections. Rarely, they lead to severe infections like blood stream infections and
      meningitis especially in immunocompromised patients like preterm infants.

      Bacillus Cereus is the most common members of the genus Bacillus. Only few reports studied
      these systemic infections in premature neonates. In order to identify the risk factors for
      severe Bacillus Species infections, we studied retrospectively eleven cases of these
      infections in our NICU and reviewed series and report cases in literature.
