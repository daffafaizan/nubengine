      complications of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The main objective will be
      to see whether the addition of etanercept to standard preventative medicines will decrease
      the rate of acute graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) and the risk of death by 100 days following
      allogeneic HSCT from volunteer donors.

      GVHD is a common complication following a bone marrow transplant from another donor. GVHD
      occurs after transplant when the donor's blood cells recognize parts of the body as foreign.
      During this process, chemicals called cytokines are released that may damage certain body
      tissues, including the gut, liver and skin. Some of the main effects can include red skin
      rash, diarrhea, sometimes with blood, and yellow jaundice. It can range from mild to life
      threatening and often requires admission to the hospital for treatment. The standard
      treatment for acute GVHD is a combination of steroids and another drug that suppress the
      immune system, such as tacrolimus or cyclosporine.

      Etanercept is a drug that blocks a chemical called Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) from causing
      damage to your tissue. The purpose of etanercept is to help improve the response to standard
      treatment for GVHD. Previous studies have shown that less than 50% of patients respond fully
      to GVHD treatment. Without a good response, patients often have a prolonged treatment for
      this disease, often involving hospitalization and sometimes even death. Etanercept (Enbrel)
      will be added to the standard treatment to see if we can lower the rate of GVHD and the risk
      of death from GVHD by blocking TNF.
