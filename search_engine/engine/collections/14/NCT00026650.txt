    
      BACKGROUND

        -  This protocol acknowledges that it is in the interest of the NIH and ROB, as well as our
           participants, to continue to follow those who have been treated with radiotherapy at ROB
           and are not otherwise eligible for current active research protocols.

        -  It also provides a mechanism for the correlation and interpretation of disparate data
           for research into the long term side effects and outcomes for a variety of disease
           entities and treatments, such as combined modality treatment, MoAb, PDT, radiation
           modifiers,

      intraoperative radiotherapy, etc.

      OBJECTIVE

      -The primary objective of this protocol is to assess the late effects of treatment and the
      natural history of disease through collection of data from any standard procedures performed
      as part of follow up care on participants previously treated with radiotherapy in the
      Radiation Oncology Branch (ROB).

      ELIGIBILITY

      -Participants who received radiation therapy at the NCI and are not enrolled on an
      interventional research protocol at the time of enrollment.

      DESIGN

        -  This is a natural history protocol in which data will be collected from Radiation
           Oncology Branch participants receiving standard of care long-term follow up care and
           evaluation, including NIH consultation services as required.

        -  It will be made clear to participants in the consent form, that data collected during
           their follow-up may be used anonymously for publications concerning the natural history
           of disease processes and long-term effects of treatment.
