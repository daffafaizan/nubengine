      particularly S. aureus SSIs, in various adult surgical patient populations, and to identify
      the patient-related, pathogen-related, and contextual risk factors for the development of S.
      aureus SSI. Using this information, a SSI prediction tool will be derived for future clinical
      trials and public health interventions aimed at SSI prevention. Furthermore, immunologic
      features protective against S. aureus SSI will also be assessed.

      The knowledge obtained by this study will enable identification of the surgical patients most
      at risk of developing S. aureus infections, particularly S. aureus SSI, and who would
      probably benefit most from new interventions given prophylactically and specifically to
      prevent S. aureus infections.
