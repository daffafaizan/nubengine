      be removed by a diode laser (400μm fiber, 6-12W, laser pulse 1ms and intervals of1ms).The
      treatment will take place in the OPD in awaken patients. One hour prior to the treatment the
      patient will have Hexvix® (photodynamic substance) and Lidocaine 20 ml (pain treatment)
      installed in the bladder. Simultaneous pain treatment will be oral Paracetamol 1 g and
      Ibuprofen 600 mg. Biopsy from the tumor will be taken to confirm the histological diagnosis.

      Immediately after the procedure the pain assessed by the VAS score will be recorded and the
      patients are given a QOL questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-BLS24) and a stamped envelope and are asked
      to return it one week later. The patients will be telephoned after 5 days to remind on the
      questionnaire and to ash, whether they has had a urinary infection after the procedure.

      One month after the laser TURBT a flexible PPD and SPIES guided cystoscopy is performed in
      the OPD to evaluate the laser efficacy. To confirm that all tumour tissue has been removed a
      biopsy will be taken from the previous tumor place. The biopsy will be send to the
      pathologist according to the normal procedure for biopsies. Visual presentation of the laser
      treated area will be visualized using PDD and SPIES.
