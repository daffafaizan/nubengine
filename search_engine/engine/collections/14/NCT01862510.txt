      >1.5mcg/kg/day) of levothyroxine are more likely to have celiac disease than those who
      require smaller doses. It also looks to see if the prevalence of celiac disease in
      hypothyroid patients who require elevated doses of levothyroxine is high enough to warrant
      screening in that population.
