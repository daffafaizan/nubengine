      patients with advanced (stage IV) EGFR mutation negative nonsquamous NSCLC who respond to 4
      cycles of pemetrexed / cisplatin or pemetrexed/carboplatin as first-line therapy will achieve
      longer PFS than pemetrexed alone. We assume a median PFS of 4 months for patients receiving
      pemetrexed alone and the hazard ratio of pemetrexed alone compared to gefitinib/pemetrexed
      would be 0.42. It also indicates that the median PFS in gefitinib/pemetrexed group will be
      approximately 9.52 months. This is a 2-arm study in a 1:1 randomisation. Assuming an uniform
      accrual of 12-month with an addition of 12-month follow-up period, the total evaluable number
      of patients will be 52 to achieve a power of 80% and one-sided significance level of 0.025 to
      detect such difference between gefitinib/pemetrexed and pemetrexed alone.

      Assuming 60% of patients respond (CR/PR/SD) to 4 cycles of pemetrexed/gefitinib, and among
      them 60% are EGFR mutation negative, 144 patients need to be enrolled to receive 4 cycles of
      pemetrexed/cisplatin or pemetrexed/carboplatin as first-line therapy.

      Besides, the result of anaplastic lymphoma kinase gene (ALK) mutation will be retrospectively
      collected if the mutation is available for study patients during the study period.
