    
      This is a phase I, open label, multi-center study in which up to eighteen subjects with renal
      impairment and six healthy control subjects with normal renal function will receive a single
      dose of plerixafor (240 Âµg/kg) administered by subcutaneous (SC) injection.

      Eligible male and female subjects with renal impairment (aged 18-78 years) and healthy
      control subjects (aged in the upper age range of the renal impairment subjects) will be
      enrolled in the study. Subjects with renal impairment will be enrolled and stratified into
      three cohorts using their Screening 24 hour urine collection to measured creatinine clearance
      (CLcr) values (an estimate of Glomerular Filtration Rate): Mild Impairment (CLcr = 51-80
      ml/min), Moderate Impairment (CLcr = 31-50 ml/min), and Severe Impairment (CLcr <31 ml/min,
      not requiring dialysis). Control subjects will have normal renal function (CLcr >90 ml/min),
      as determined by a Screening 24 hour urine collection.

      The screening visits will occur within 14 days prior to plerixafor administration on study
      day one. Subjects will be monitored for 10 hours following administration of the study drug.
      In addition, subjects will return to the clinic at 24 and 48 hours after plerixafor
      administration for blood samples and safety assessments.
