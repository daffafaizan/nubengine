      this study. Participants must have cLBP and be able to perform all study procedures. All
      interested participants will report in comfortable clothing and sneakers. After explanation
      of the study and consent, participants will complete the demographics questionnaire, NIH cLBP
      Minimal Dataset, 10-point Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS), and the Roland-Morris Low Back
      Pain and Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ). Participants will then complete a 3-minute walking
      baseline assessment. Following the assessment, participants will rate their pain and be
      randomly assigned receive a blinded topical of either BiofreezeÂ® or a Placebo. Both the
      participant and the investigator will be blind to assigned products. The dose of both gels
      will be 5 mL per side of the low back. The participant will wait 15 minutes, rate their pain,
      and repeat the 3-minute walking assessment and rate their pain again. Next, there will be a
      minimum of a 24-72-hour washout period at which time the participants will return and repeat
      the same protocol using the other topical.
