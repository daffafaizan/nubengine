      than 65 in health district 7 of Madrid with acute (< 3 months) DIMS. Intervention group
      patients will be attended by rheumatologists acording with clinical (diagnostic and
      therapeutical) protocols. Control group will receive the routine attention from the Health
      System. Efficacy and costs variables will be collected through monthly structured telephone
      interviews performed by independent personnel blinded to the intervention group. Efficacy
      will be measured by differences between groups regarding: 1) time to improvement in the
      baseline DIMS episode, 2) number of subsequent DIMS, and 3) total number of DIMS days. An
      economic evaluation will be performed from a societal perspective.
