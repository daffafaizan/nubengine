      (BUN)/creatinine (Cr) ratio, a marker of hydration status, was an independent predictor of
      SIE among patients who had suffered acute ischemic stroke. The investigators found that
      patients who had a BUN/Cr ratio ≥ 15 were 3.4-fold more likely to experience SIE than
      patients who had a BUN/Cr ratio < 15. The ratio of SIE was 13.9% in all patients, with 20% in
      patients who had a BUN/Cr ratio ≥ 15 and 8.3% in patients who had a BUN/Cr ratio < 15. Among
      the patients presenting with acute ischemic stroke, 37% of them had a BUN/Cr ratio ≥ 15.

      The investigators' recent pilot study was designed to determine if providing hydration
      therapy, specifically intravenous saline infusion, to patients with a blood urea
      nitrogen/creatinine ratio (BUN/Cr) ≥15 reduces the occurrence of SIE after acute ischemic
      stroke. Patients in the hydration group received a significantly larger (all P < 0.001)
      median volume of infused saline than patients in the control group. And this allowed 82% of
      the patients to maintain their BUN/Cr ratio <15 in first 8 hours. The proportion of patients
      who experienced SIE was significantly lower in the hydration group compared with the control
      group.

      Dehydration, as indicated by an increased BUN/Cr ratio, is known to be relatively common
      among patients who have experienced stroke. According to the result of our pilot study, a
      hydration strategy with intravenous 20 cc per kilogram of body weight normal saline in first
      8 hours was safe and effective to prevent dehydration related early neurological
      deterioration.

      In this study, the investigators conduct a randomized double-blind control trial to test the
      hypothesis that whether BUN/Cr ratio based hydration therapy has clinical activity.
