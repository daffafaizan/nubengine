      psychosocial support while still facing challenges posed by breast cancer, but are unlikely
      to have access to professionally-led support groups. In this community-based project, we
      assessed the feasibility and acceptability of providing support groups to women with breast
      cancer in a large rural area using videoconferencing and a workbook journal, and we assessed
      the intervention's potential to reduce distress and increase emotional expression and
      self-efficacy for coping with cancer. Twenty-seven women in the Intermountain Region of
      northeastern California participated in 8-session support groups led by an oncology social
      worker by going to nearby videoconferencing sites. Feasibility and acceptability were
      demonstrated. Older as well as younger women were comfortable using videoconferencing and
      said the groups were valuable because they promoted information sharing and emotional bonds
      with other women with breast cancer. They emphasized the importance of a professional
      facilitator and identified advantages of using videoconferencing for support groups. Pretest
      and posttest comparisons showed significant decreases in depression and posttraumatic stress
      disorder symptoms. The results suggest that the intervention has the potential to provide a
      valuable service that is not readily available in rural communities.
