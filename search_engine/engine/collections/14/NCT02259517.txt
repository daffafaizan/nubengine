      of the study. In this first part of the study, MRI findings will be compared between the two
      groups to see whether brain functioning of children with ADHD differs from that of healthy
      children. In the second part of the study, the children with ADHD will meet weekly with the
      study doctor and be administered either extended-release guanfacine (Intuniv) or
      lisdexamfetamine (Vyvanse) for 6 weeks. Selection into either treatment group will be
      randomly determined. At the end of the study, the children with ADHD treated with either
      medication will have a second MRI scan. The findings of that second MRI scan will be compared
      to the first MRI scan in order to examine brain changes due to the medication. These second
      MRI scans will also be compared to the scans of the healthy controls.
