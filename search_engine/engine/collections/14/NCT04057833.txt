      re-tears after surgical repair and a slow rate of complete functional recovery, which limits
      daily functional tasks and has negative impacts on qualify-of-life. The frequency of failed
      healing and re-tear following repair is more pronounced in patients over age 60 due to
      age-related, intrinsic degenerative changes involving the muscle, tendon, and enthesis.

      Healing of the enthesis, the site of tendon attachment to the bone, can be compromised due to
      microvascular and vascular niche deficiencies resulting from various causes including aging,
      prior injuries, and/or tissue degeneration.

      There is currently no approved adjunct biologic therapy to improve surgical repairs of full
      rotator cuff tear, enhance post-operative recovery, and decrease the risk of re-tear. This
      trial will investigate the safety and feasibility of local implantation of E-CEL UVEC cells
      along with standard-of-care arthroscopic surgical repair of full rotator cuff tears. E-CEL
      UVEC cells are proprietary allogeneic human umbilical vein endothelial cells produced under
      cGMP and cGTP regulations.
