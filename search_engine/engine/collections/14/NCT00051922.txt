      resulting in tremendous diversity of virus envelope, the target of neutralizing antibody,
      such that antibody elicited to one envelope may not protect from virus with a distinct
      envelope; 2) envelope from infected persons differs from envelopes obtained from T-cell line
      cultures, the usual source of envelope for vaccines; and 3) envelope glycoprotein exists as
      oligomers on the virion surface, not as the monomers used in previous vaccines. This study
      will test a new vaccine that has been designed to meet these challenges by delivering
      diverse, patient-derived, oligomeric envelopes to induce multiple type-specific responses
      capable of recognizing native envelope on natural variants. The vaccine vector used in this
      vaccine trial is recombinant vaccinia virus based on the NYCDH vaccinia isolate.

      Participants in this study will receive the PolyEnv1 HIV vaccine and will be followed for one
      year. Laboratory tests will be performed at 10 study visits to monitor the participants'
      immunologic response and assess the safety of the vaccine. Patients will also have numerous
      HIV tests throughout the study period.
