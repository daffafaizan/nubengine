      secondary symptoms related to severe vision loss, such as sleep disturbances, negative mood
      states, fall risk and balance. This information will be important for determining safe,
      cost-effective and reliable practices for the benefits of yoga as an alternative means for
      improved health and well-being. A yoga intervention that is integrative and evidence-based
      will benefit the blind population through effective treatments and prevention of secondary
      symptoms as well as serve to inform rehabilitation specialists, educators, and clinicians in
      the future.
