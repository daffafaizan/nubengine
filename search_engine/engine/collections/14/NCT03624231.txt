      discontinuation due to toxicity and in terms of 1-year progression free survival of a
      PDL1-Inhibitor plus a CTLA-4 Inhibitor in combination with radiotherapy and a PDL1-Inhibitor
      in combination with radiotherapy as first-line therapy for patients with non-resectable
      locally advanced HNSCC in the poor prognostic subgroup.

      Secondary objectives are to investigate the benefit of the addition of a CTLA-4 Inhibitor
      and/or a PDL1-Inhibitor to radiotherapy in terms of overall progression free survival,
      overall survival and to investigate the approach in terms of safety, chronic toxicity and
      quality of life.
