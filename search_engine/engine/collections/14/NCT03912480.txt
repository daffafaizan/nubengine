      patients still had frequent hypoglycemia).

      Stem cell therapy:

      Dosage: Stem cells from human exfoliated teeth were calculated at 0.11IU/kg body weight .

      enrollment, and 6 weeks after enrollment.

      Note: at 1 month follow-up (V5) after the last transplantation of several cells, the subjects
      were still unable to discontinue insulin, and then began the second course of stem cell
      therapy.After the second course of treatment, the follow-up plan was resumed.
