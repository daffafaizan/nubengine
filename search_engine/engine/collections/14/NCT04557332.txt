      a two-way communication capability through which participants can: i) indicate "pill taken"
      in response to pill reminders, and ii) receive a positive visual icon as behavioral-economics
      based reinforcement for "pill taken" responses; 2) pharmacist counseling and medication
      support; and, 3) the addition of educational and motivational text messages. Overall aims are
      to: 1) expand mhealth intervention to incorporate new Phase II features; 2) evaluate
      effectiveness in an RCT of HIV+ African Americans; and 3) prepare marketing and
      commercialization plans. Our long-term goal is to increase ART medication adherence, thus
      decreasing health disparities, among HIV+, African-Americans.
