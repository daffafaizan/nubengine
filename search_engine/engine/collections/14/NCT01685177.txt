      in solving both morbid obesity and related co-morbidities, mainly diabetes mellitus. When the
      sleeve is not enough for the patient, due to alimentary habits or to an excessive initial BMI
      before surgery (usually over 50 - 55), a second-step operation should be performed to
      increase effectiveness. Some patients are submitted to a second restrictive operation, i.e.:
      a re-sleeve, a gastric plication or sleeve banding. Other group are offered a gastric bypass.
      And, finally, a subset of patients, generally those with higher initial BMI, are offered a
      malabsorptive operation. While re-sleeve is adequate for many patients, gastric bypass is not
      offering a greater weight loss rate, and it is a complex operation requiring sectioning of
      the sleeve and two anastomoses. We support the performance of malabsorptive operations which
      warrant a better weight loss result for "resistant" patients needing a second-step. As
      Single-Anastomosis Duodeno-Ileal bypass with Sleeve gastrectomy (SADI-S) has behaved as a
      good primary operation for morbid obesity, we decided to test this one-loop reconstruction as
      a second step operation. Results will be compared to those obtained with a Roux-en-Y duodenal
      switch performed as a second step after a "failed" sleeve.
