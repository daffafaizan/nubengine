    
      This is a multicenter, expanded access program protocol to provide access to melflufen for
      patients with RRMM in medical need, who have progressive disease after they received a
      minimum of at least two prior lines of therapy, are triple-class refractory to at least one
      PI, at least one IMiD and at least one anti-CD38 mAb or intolerant to a specific therapeutic
      drug class. Patients with primary refractory MM are eligible to participate as long as they
      meet the criteria of being triple class refractory. They may meet these criteria for triple
      class refractory MM if they have received at least one PI, at least one IMiD, and at least
      one Anti-CD38 mAb in their first line treatment or have had at least 2 prior lines of
      therapy.
