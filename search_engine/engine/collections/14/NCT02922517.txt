      is found in less than 1/1000 people, mainly linked to a mutation of a protein of the
      sarcomere (14 genes and 400 mutations identified nowadays). HCM occurs in about 50% of cases
      in young adults under the age of 30 years. Progress in the identification of the responsible
      mutation does not have allowed significant advances for the clinical management and
      evaluation of the prognosis of patients with HCM. In fact, the link between genotype and
      phenotype is poor in the HCM, so that identification of the mutation in approximately 60% of
      patients does not properly characterize the disease and its evolution. It is therefore
      necessary to identify new markers to better characterize HCM patients. Myocardial fibrosis
      could be a severity marker of the HCM but its consequences and determinants are little known
      or unknown.

      The objective of this work is to identify the determinants and consequences of myocardial
      fibrosis in HCM, particularly the relationship between fibrosis and left ventricular
      dysfunction assessed by the analysis of myocardial deformation and between fibrosis and heart
      failure. The study of fibrosis, which concerns 30 to 70% of patients and replace 1 to 70% of
      the myocardial tissue, is made possible in vivo by analysis of delayed enhancement gadolinium
      in MRI. This work aims to study the relationship between myocardial fibrosis, heart function
      assessed by myocardial deformation, heart failure, and biological profile (proteomics) of
      patients at rest and after exertion.

      This study is an observational research. Indeed, all examinations are done as part of usual
      care patients. Only additional tubes of blood are collected in the initial biological
      assessment.
