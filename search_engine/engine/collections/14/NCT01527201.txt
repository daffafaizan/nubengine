      time forming chondral lesions. Worn out cartilage is often found during knee surgery for
      other conditions. Typically, surgeons will remove any worn out cartilage that is found using
      a procedure called debridement. However, the investigators do not know if surgically treating
      the worn out cartilage is better than leaving the tissue untreated, so it is necessary to
      compare the two. Patients who are found to have worn out cartilage during arthroscopy, will
      be randomly assigned to either receive treatment (debridement) or non-treatment (observation)
      of their cartilage. Patients without worn out cartilage will also be included in this study
      and observed postoperatively.

      The primary objective of this study is to examine the effects of treatment of worn out
      cartilage (versus non-treatment of worn out cartilage and versus patients without worn out
      cartilage), on self-reported knee pain following arthroscopic meniscectomy using a
      double-blinded randomized controlled trial design. Secondary objectives of this study include
      examining the effects of treating worn out cartilage on other outcomes (subjective knee and
      general health scores and knee measurements including range of motion, presence of effusion
      and quadriceps circumference) and also to calculate the intra-operative costs associated with
      treatment, including the amount of time and instruments needed for debridement.
