    
      This is a Phase IIA study with two parts to the design.

        -  Part 1 is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled treatment of 7.5 mg/day
           LGD-4665 versus placebo in approximately 24 patients with ITP who have been treated with
           at least one prior therapy for ITP. Patients will be randomized in a ratio of 1:2
           (placebo: 7.5 mg/day LGD-4665) for 6 weeks of treatment. Platelet counts, bleeding
           scores, vital signs, physical exams and laboratory tests will be assessed weekly.
           Treatment groups will be analyzed for efficacy by the percentage of patients with
           platelet counts two times baseline and ≥ 50,000/uL at 6 weeks of treatment, and for
           safety by adverse events, vital signs, physical exams, laboratory tests and use of ITP
           rescue medications or transfusions.

        -  Part 2 is an extension of study treatment with open label LGD-4665. All patients who
           participate in the Part 1 randomized double-blind treatment of this Ph IIA trial are
           eligible to continue open label treatment with LGD-4665 for up to 3 months at an
           appropriate dose for the safe maintenance of platelet counts (≥ 50,000/uL to ≤
           200,000/uL). Assessments of effectiveness and safety will be made at 2 and 4 week
           intervals.
