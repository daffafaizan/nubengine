      metronidazole, ciprofloxacin and amoxicillin mixed with sterile glycole) or non setting
      calcium hydroxide applied to the pulp space with a sterile lentulospiral and then closed
      temporarily with a sterile sponge and temporary restoration for 2-3 weeks to allow
      disinfection of the canals teeth will be reentered under rubber dam isolation and all
      intracanal medicaments will be washed out from the canal using 10 ml of 2.5% sodium
      hypochlorite and 20 ml of Ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid (EDTA). Then, a sterile
      endodontic file will be inserted past the canal terminus into the periapical tissues to
      induce bleeding to fill the canal space as much as possible and subsequently sealed with a
      double coronal seal using bioceramic repair material and composite filling. All the teeth
      will be monitored clinically and radiographically on a biannual basis.
