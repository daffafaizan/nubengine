      bowel movements are insufficient. In summary, efficient measures are needed to help
      individuals consume enough dietary fiber from natural sources in daily life to improve their
      bowel movements, rather than to consume a fiber supplements separated or synthesized from a
      particular natural food. In this study, investigators compare and evaluate the effects and
      safety of eating rice-based diets (brown rice-based and white rice-based) and a wheat-based
      diet in terms of bowel health and bowel movements among young women with functional
      constipation.
