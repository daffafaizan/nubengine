    
      The study is an international, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled,
      parallel group study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of diacerein 1% ointment for the
      treatment of subjects with EBS. Participants were assigned to study groups receiving either
      diacerein 1% ointment or vehicle ointment for 8 weeks, followed by an 8 week follow-up
      period. Approximately 80 subjects were to be randomized to one of the 2 treatment groups.

      The primary objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of diacerein 1% ointment to
      vehicle ointment based on reduction in body surface area (BSA) of EBS lesions being treated
      when applied once-daily for 8 weeks in subjects with EBS. The secondary objectives are to
      compare the effects of diacerein 1% ointment to vehicle ointment in subjects with EBS in
      changes in Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) scores, pain, pruritus, mobility, and safety
      and tolerability.
