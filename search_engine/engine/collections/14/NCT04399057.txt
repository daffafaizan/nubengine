      the corpora cavernosa is fundamental. indeed, anatomopathological studies have shown that in
      patients with erectile dysfunction the elastic fibers are replaced by inextensible collagen.
      the aim of the study is the correlation between penile stiffness measured with this new
      non-invasive diagnostic method - elastosonography of the corpora cavernosa - and the
      correlation with validated questionnaires. the international Index of Erectile Function
      (IIEF5) short form and the erectile Hardness Score (EHS) will be used.
