      relapse is frequently detected. Tumor number, tumor size, T stage, presence of in situ
      carcinoma and tumor grade are risk factors for recurrence. The relationship between post
      voiding residual urine volume and bladder tumor recurrence and progression has not been
      clearly established. Participants who underwent transurethral resection for bladder tumor
      will be included in the study. The investigators aimed to examine the effect of high post
      voiding residual urine volume on recurrence and progression based on the hypothesis that
      tumor cells circulating in the bladder may increase with excess residual urine.
