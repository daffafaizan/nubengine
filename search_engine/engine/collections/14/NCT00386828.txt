      order to decrease local recurrence and increase the rate of sphincter sparing surgery.
      Capecitabine, oxaliplatin and bevacizumab represent new systemic agents and have been given
      safely in phase I and II trials concurrently with radiation with promising improvements in
      pCR rates of 15 -24% compared to historic rates of 8-14% achieved with 5-FU alone.
      Improvements in pCR rates have not been associated with an increase in post-operative
      complication rates. A trial of all three of these agents is justified due to their enhanced
      efficacy when given in combination as well as their non-overlapping treatment toxicity
      profile.

      This is a one-armed, multi-centred, Phase II study in patients with T3/4 locally advanced and
      T3/4 low lying rectal cancer, to study the efficacy and safety of the addition of bevacizumab
      to a regimen of capecitabine and oxaliplatin in combination with pre-operative radiation.
