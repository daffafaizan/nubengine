      Two centers specializing in diabetic foot management (located in Sesto S. Giovanni and Milan,
      Italy) participated to this open, randomized clinical trial. The ethics-committee approved
      the study on January 10th, 2008. Enrollment of consecutive patients began February 2008 and
      ended March 2009. Eligible patients were fully informed of the study aim and procedures and
      written consent was obtained prior to study participation. Patients were then randomly
      assigned to one of the two treatment groups by opening randomization codebreak envelopes
      containing one of the two options. Separate randomization was performed for each center, and
      a copy of all randomization envelopes was kept at the statistical department of the
      Multimedica center. The two arms were composed of patients managed with non-removable
      fiberglass off-bearing cast (TCC group) and patients offloaded with the Stabil-DÂ® (Podartis
      srl, Montebelluna, Treviso, Italy) walker cast (Stabil-D group).
