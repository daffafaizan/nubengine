      serum (treatment-response) and the relation between microRNA serum levels and changes of the
      bone mineral density will be investigated.

      These data will help to examine the use of microRNAs as novel diagnostic biomarkers for the
      diagnosis of osteoporosis and targeted therapeutic treatment of patients.
