      sequentially for use in the clinic. Currently, patients are routinely being treated with 3 or
      4 drug combinations including nucleoside/tide analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors
      (NRTIs/NtRTIs), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), protease inhibitors
      (PIs), and/or fusion inhibitors. New potent antiretroviral (ARV) compounds that work in
      people whose HIV-1 virus is resistant to available drugs are urgently needed. This is a Phase
      III, randomized (study medication is assigned by chance), double-blind (neither the study
      physician nor the patient knows the name of the study assigned medication), double-dummy,
      active-controlled trial to compare the effectiveness, safety, and ability to tolerate TMC278
      versus efavirenz (EFV). The study will last for 104 weeks which includes a screening period
      of 4 weeks, a 96-week treatment period, followed by a 4 week follow-up period. Patients will
      be randomly assigned (like tossing a coin) to TMC278 or to efavirenz in combination with two
      other anti-HIV drugs of the class nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors. The
      hypothesis to be provided in this study is that the investigational drug TMC278 will perform
      just like efavirenz (EFV) in terms of antiviral effectiveness (i.e., suppressing of the
      plasma viral load to a level < 50 HIV-1 RNA (ribonucleic acid) copies/mL, in ARV-naÃ¯ve
      HIV-infected patients. During the trial, patients' health will be monitored by physical
      examination, interview to assess health and well being, and laboratory testing on blood and
      urine samples. Experimental Group: One tablet of TMC278 25 mg daily; plus efavirenz (EFV)
      placebo; plus 2 nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors; Control Group: One
      tablet of Placebo daily that looks just like TMC278 plus EFV 600 mg daily plus 2
      nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors for 104 weeks.
