      mean total hours of awake time per day spent in the OFF state in patients with advanced
      Parkinson's disease (PD) treated with levodopa. Patients who meet entry criteria will be
      randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to double blind treatment with oral doses of 20 or 40mg/day
      istradefylline or matching placebo. Patients will be treated for 12 weeks and will have
