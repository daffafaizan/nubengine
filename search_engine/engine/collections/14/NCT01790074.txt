      spine; however, clinicians should consider that the upper cervical spine also receives
      afferent inputs from muscles. In fact, the role of referred pain to the head elicited by
      muscle TrPs has received particular interest in recent years. No study has investigated the
      effectiveness of TrP manual therapy in patients with CeH exhibiting active TrPs.
      Investigators hypothesized that patients receiving a real TrP treatment will exhibit a
      greater reduction in pain, sensitivity, cervical range of motion and neck endurance than
      those receiving a manual control non-therapeutic intervention.
