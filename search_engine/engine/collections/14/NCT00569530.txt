      in persistently ventilated preterm infants. We conducted a multi-center, randomized, blinded
      pilot study to assess the safety and efficacy of late administration of surfactant
      (Calfactant - high in protein B) in combination with prolonged inhaled nitric oxide in
      preterm infants < 1000 grams birthweight (BW). Calfactant is one of several types of
      exogenous surfactant. Calfactant has the highest % of surfactant protein B of the different
      types.
