    
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Zerenex™ (ferric
      citrate) as a treatment for hyperphosphatemia in patients with End-Stage Renal Disease. These
      patients will be switched to Zerenex™ from their current high dose of phosphate binder and,
      based on their serum phosphorus levels, will be titrated up from 3.4g/day of Zerenex™ to
      maximum tolerated and safe doses of Zerenex™. Doses will be adjusted weekly, based on serum
      phosphorus levels, with the maximum dose administered being approximately 12g/day.
