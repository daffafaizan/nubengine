    
      Randomization and double-blind study treatment period to either placebo or LDM (1:1) of
      willing and eligible patients will occur at the end of the open label run-in phase per the
      parent CIRT protocol, and will be stratified by time since the qualifying event (< 6 or â‰¥ 6
      months from the date of MI or most recent angiogram), type of event (MI or multivessel CAD),
      presence of either type 2 DM or metabolic syndrome, and site, which will ensure balance in
      the proposed study. Patients willing to participate in CIRT will be asked to enroll into the
      sub-study and may sign the CIRT-CFR informed consent at any point between signing the parent
      CIRT informed consent and completing the parent CIRT randomization visit (Visit 4). After
      giving informed consent for the ancillary CIRT-CFR, patients will undergo the baseline PET
      scan along with echocardiography at any point between the parent CIRT post run-in visit
      (Visit 3) and up to 4 weeks after randomization (Visit 4).

      Imaging will be performed at the 3 imaging centers (BWH, OHI, and UAB). To minimize
      participant and site burden, only a baseline and single follow-up imaging time point will be
      pursued. Imaging tests (PET and echo) will be scheduled on the same day for patient
      convenience if possible, and no more than one week apart. "Baseline" study visit imaging will
      follow the open label run-in period of the parent trial to enhance long-term compliance and
      eliminate risk of radiation exposure for any individuals with immediate intolerance to the
      LDM study protocol. The imaging tests proposed are non-invasive, routinely performed, and
      historically well tolerated by patients.
