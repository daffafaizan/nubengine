    
      This study will enroll a cohort of healthy individuals age 18-25 to volunteer for an
      esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy and will collect of gastrointestinal tissue biopsy
      samples, blood and stool samples.

      Research Procedures include:

        -  Screening questionnaires

        -  Medical records review

        -  Height, weight, blood pressure and temperature measurements

        -  Collection of urine sample for pregnancy test and banking

        -  Blood sample up to 50ccs(volume based on weight)

        -  Stool sample

        -  GI tissue from endoscopy (4-16 biopsies collected from esophagogastroduodenoscopy, 4 -16
           biopsies collected from colonoscopy)

      Data to be collected:

        -  Demographics

        -  Medical history

        -  Pregnancy test results

        -  Endoscopy results

        -  Pathology results

        -  Clinical data related to endoscopy

        -  Clinical lab values

      Study population:

      The study will enroll 10 participants who meet the following criteria:

        -  Age 18-25

        -  No signs or symptoms of present illness

        -  No known history of chronic illness

        -  Not on any medications other than birth control or vitamin supplementation

        -  BMI between 10-25 kg/m^2

        -  Negative pregnancy test result

      Objective/ Purpose:

      The samples and information collected from this cohort will be used to understand the mucosal
      immunity of the gastrointestinal tract in individuals without gastrointestinal problems or
      history of chronic disease. This information will be used to study the immunology of diseases
      such as Inflammatory Bowel Disease, Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders and Graft vs. Host
      Disease.
