      growth of the world population. More than 1.38 million women worldwide were estimated to be
      diagnosed with breast cancer in 2008, accounting for 23% of all diagnosed cancers in women.
      Given that the 5-year survival rate for breast cancer is now 90%, experiencing breast cancer
      is ultimately about quality of life. Women treated for breast cancer are facing a life-time
      risk of developing lymphedema, a chronic condition that occurs in up to 40% of this
      population and negatively affects breast cancer survivors' quality of life. It's becoming
      more and more important to do more research on the breast cancer-related lymphedema. Axillary
      reverse mapping (ARM) is a technique used to map arm lymphatic drainage during axillary lymph
      node dissection (ALND) and/or sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND). It's necessary for the
      investigators to understand the participants' upper limb lymphatic drainage before operation
      and what the investigators have done on it during operation. It can be easy to understand the
      influence of operation on the participants' upper limb lymphatic drainage, the possibility
      and safety of reserving lymph nodes draining the upper extremity lymph.
