      Program at Stony Brook University (SBU), the Epidemiology Program at North Shore-LIJ Health
      System (NSLIJ), and Rutgers University. The goal is to adapt and test the efficacy of the
      National Institute of Environmental Health and Safety (NIEHS) Disaster Worker Resilience
      Training (DWRT) Program for Sandy responders by leveraging data from the ongoing projects and
      the expertise of collaborators at these sites. The DWRT program was originally designed for
      and piloted with responders to the 2010 Deep Water Horizon oil spill. Knowledge from the
      ongoing Sandy projects will be used to tailor this intervention to address Sandy-specific
      risk factors and unique features of the responder communities in the New York Metropolitan
      area. Responders identified from ongoing projects at SBU (N=1500, 50% anticipated eligible)
      and other current local disaster responders will be targeted for enrollment. The objectives
      are to: (1) to adapt the DWRT program for this population; (2) recruit and randomly assign
      responders (N = 120) to the DWRT program or a waitlist control condition; (3) assess the
      efficacy of this intervention to enhance resilience over a three month period; and (4) host
      forums with community stakeholders to share information on this program and its outcomes. The
      expected outcomes are: (1) efficacy data on the DWRT program, and (2) qualitative data on the
      acceptability of this intervention to Sandy responders. The products are: (1) a final report;
      (2) articles for publication; (3) abstracts for national conferences; and (4) a training
      manual, participant workbook, and presenter materials.
