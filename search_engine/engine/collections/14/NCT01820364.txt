    
      This is a phase II two part multi-center, open-label study. Part I: LGX818 single agent
      treatment until progression Part II: Combination treatments of LGX818 + MEK162, or BKM120, or
      BGJ398, or INC280, or LEE01 to assess the clinical efficacy, to further evaluate the safety
      of the drug combinations in patients with locally advanced or metastatic BRAF mutant melanoma
      after relapse on LGX818, and to determine the maximum tolerated dose of the combinations
      (when not established previously). These drug combinations are selected and assigned to
      patients based on documentation of molecular resistance mechanism.

      Patients with BRAF mutant melanoma treated by LGX818 single agent in other studies can be
      enrolled directly in Part II of CLGX818X2102 after relapse.

      Dose-escalations in the combination arms for which no MTD has been established will be based
      on the recommendations of a Bayesian logistic regression model guided by an escalation with
      overdose control criterion.

      After careful evaluation of slow enrollment and the BRAF-mutant melanoma treatment landscape,
      recruitment was permanently halted on 26-Jul-2014.

      This recruitment halt was not a consequence of any safety concern and patients who were
      ongoing in the study continued to be treated as per protocol.
