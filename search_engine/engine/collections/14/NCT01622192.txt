      attachment loss is diagnosed in periodontal disease. The accuracy and reproducibility of the
      probing measurements is an essential part of diagnosis, treatment planning and assessment of
      the treatment outcome. There are inherent errors associated with probing that have been
      identified in the literature. These relate to the operator technique, the probe used and the
      state of inflammation of the periodontal pocket/crevice.

      The aim of this study is to compare the reproducibility of probing measurements using a probe
      tip with millimeter markings up to 15mm in the Florida probe ® handpiece. This tip will be
      used to allow conventional clinical measurements to be recorded at the same time as the
      electronic recordings on the Florida probe ®. The examiner would take the manual probe
      measurement and be blind to the electronic reading taken. The sites under question will have
      a second measurement recorded to allow assessment of the repeatability of the recordings.
      Therefore, from 2 probing passes 4 measurements would be obtained 2 manual and 2 electronic
      readings.
