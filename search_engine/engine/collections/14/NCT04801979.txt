      generated from Portuguese adults without disabilities of a new step test for the assessment
      of exercise capacity.

      The investigators will perform a cross-sectional study in Portuguese adults (over 18 years)
      without disabilities. The study will be advertised at the university campus, surrounding
      areas, and interested participants can contact the research team for participation. The
      participants who agree will be seen by the principal investigator who will explain the nature
      of the study and assess eligibility for the study. The participants will sign informed
      consent.

      For each participant, the study will be performed in one day. The participants will perform
      the incremental step test twice (30 minutes apart).

      In addition, socio-demographic information (age and sex), anthropometric measures (weight,
      height, and body mass index), and clinical data (smoking status, comorbidities, and level of
      physical activity) will be collected.
