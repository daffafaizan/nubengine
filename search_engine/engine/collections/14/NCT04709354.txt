      have a very important role in the early diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis, which is one of the
      most important comorbidities of psoriasis. Therefore, studies have been conducted on many
      factors predicting the risk of psoriatic arthritis and it has been concluded that nail
      involvement is closely related to psoriatic arthritis.For this reason, the importance of nail
      examination in the follow-up of psoriasis patients has increased significantly. Nail
      examination should be done carefully to predict the risk of developing psoriatic arthritis,
      especially at the beginning of the disease and subclinical types, and dermoscopy should be
      used to identify patients who may be clinically uncertain.

      In addition, rheumatoid arthritis and spondylopathy patients have a lot in common with
      psoriatic arthritis patients.In these patients, there is no clear distinction to diagnose
      joint involvement, and their distinction is mostly based on the presence or absence of skin
      findings.Nail findings have an important place among this skin findings in the diagnosis of
      these patients.

      Based on all these, this study questions the benefit of clinical and dermoscopic examination
      of nail findings in the early stages to differentiate these patients, as well as comparing
      the nail findings and revealing the differences and similarities.
