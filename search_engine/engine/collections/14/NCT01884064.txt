      enhance intracortical inhibition has motivated its use as a potential therapeutic
      intervention in focal hand dystonia (FHD). In this preliminary investigation, we assessed the
      physiologic and behavioral effects of multiple sessions of rTMS in FHD. Methods: 12 patients
      with FHD underwent five daily-sessions of 1 Hz rTMS to contralateral dorsal premotor cortex
      (dPMC). Patients held a pencil and made movements that did not elicit dystonic symptoms
      during rTMS. We hypothesized that an active but non-dystonic motor state would increase
      beneficial effects of rTMS. Five additional patients received sham-rTMS protocol. The area
      under curve (AUC) of the motor evoked potentials and the cortical silent period (CSP) were
      measured to assess changes in corticospinal excitability and intracortical inhibition,
      respectively. Behavioral measures included pen force and velocity during handwriting and
      subjective report.
