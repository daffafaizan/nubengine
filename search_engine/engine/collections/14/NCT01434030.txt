      experienced with insulin pump use for a two-week training period plus a one month active
      study period during which the DexCom SEVEN速 PLUS Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM) will be
      used in tandem with the OmniPod速 Insulin Management System. The OmniPod速 has a built in
      FreeStyle glucometer that allows tagging of food and activity-related treatment behaviors
      with each self-monitoring blood glucose (SMBG) value. The OmniPod速 personal digital assistant
      (PDA) also stores information about insulin delivery and meal size in relation to the
      carbohydrate content. Parallel recording of CGM and behavioral data, as well as psychometric
      instruments will produce a rich synchronized data set for each person that will ultimately
      lead to the development of a behavioral event generator for use in future open-loop and
      closed-loop control algorithms for intelligent insulin dosing.
