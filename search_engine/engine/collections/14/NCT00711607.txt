    
      This trial was designed to assess the pharmacokinetic profile of NOMAC, E2 and E1 after
      multiple dose (MD) and single dose (SD) administration of NOMAC-E2 in healthy female
      volunteers.

      In total 25 subjects were to enter the trial. These subjects were synchronized for menstrual
      cycle by taking 1 tablet NOMAC-E2 (2.5 mg / 1.5 mg) daily for a minimum of 2 weeks. This was
      followed by a 7-day pill-free interval. After this, all subjects were to be exposed to the
      open-label MD treatment with 1 tablet NOMAC-E2 (2.5 mg / 1.5 mg) once daily, during 24 days.
      This was followed by a second pill-free interval of 10 days, to allow for sufficient washout
      of NOMAC-E2. On treatment day 35, 20 subjects were to receive 1 tablet NOMAC-E2 (2.5 mg / 1.5
      mg) and 5 subjects were to receive a placebo tablet in a double blinded setup. After
      treatment day 35 and before follow-up, all subjects would again have a pill-free interval of
      7 days. After follow-up, all subjects could return to their own contraceptive schedule.
      Follow-up took place on treatment day 42.

      Bleeding pattern and tablet intake were assessed by means of a subject diary to be completed
      on a daily basis. Blood sampling for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic purposes were
      collected at several time points before, during and after the MD and SD period. In order to
      explore any possible influence of NOMAC-E2 on the QT/QTc interval, a small placebo group was
      designed within the SD period, to allow for comparison with the active-treated group. In
      addition several safety assessments (vital signs, ECGs, trans vaginal ultrasound evaluation,
      physical, gynecological and breast examinations, cervical smear, routine laboratory
      parameters and adverse events) were performed.
