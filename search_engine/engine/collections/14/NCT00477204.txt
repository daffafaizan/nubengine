      (T1DM) and since atherosclerosis begins in childhood, data to inform clinicians as to
      appropriate dyslipidemia treatment in this high-risk population are of great public health
      importance. In this trial of lipid-lowering medications (Zocor [simvastatin], a statin,
      compared to Vytorin [ezetimibe/simvastatin], a combination of a statin and Zetia, a
      medication that blocks cholesterol absorption) will be performed in patients ages 12-18 years
      with LDL â‰¥ 130 mg/dl, consistent with current ADA guidelines. The study hypothesizes that
      Zocor and Vytorin will be safe in adolescents with T1DM and will lower LDL-cholesterol at 6
      months compared to baseline. In a two-arm design, Vytorin will lower LDL-c more than
      monotherapy with Zocor.
