    
      This is a multicenter, upfront randomized phase III trial of patients with FLT3-ITD positive
      AML comparing quizartinib in combination with SOC chemotherapy versus treatment according to
      physician's choice (PhC). Efficacy is assessed by comparing EFS between the quizartinib and
      the PhC arm of the study.

      Primary objective To improve modified event-free survival (mEFS) with Quizartinib added to
      induction and consolidation therapy followed by single agent maintenance therapy compared to
      physician's choice (PhC)

      Secondary objectives To improve overall survival (OS) with Quizartinib added to conventional
      therapy compared to physician's choice; To improve remission (including CR/CRi/CRh) rate with
      Quizartinib added to conventional therapy compared to physician's choice To reduce measurable
      residual disease (MRD) with Quizartinib added to conventional therapy compared to physician's
      choice after induction (MRDind), consolidation (MRDcons), before allogeneic hematopoietic
      cell transplantation (MRDpre-HCT ) and maintenance (MRDmaintenance) therapy Assessment of
      patient reported outcomes (PRO) after induction, consolidation and maintenance therapy and
      after two years Evaluation of safety based on duration of neutropenia and leukopenia,
      incidence of infection, duration of initial hospitalization and number of transfusions (e.g.
      packed red blood cells and platelets) Cost-effectiveness analysis of the two different
      treatment schedules from health care payerÂ´s perspective.

      Budget impact analysis of introducing effective treatment schedule(s) in everyday clinical
      practice.
