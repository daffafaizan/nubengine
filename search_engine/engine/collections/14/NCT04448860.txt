      people: retinitis pigmentosa's patients ( 1st and 2nd phases) and healthy volunteers patients
      (2nd phase).

      The first phase's aim (named pilot phase) is to determine the optimal parameters to achieve
      the locomotion test. Fifteen RP's eligible patients will be requiring to 4 sessions of 3
      hours to perform tests (Two sessions on real conditions and the two others on virtual
      reality).

      The second phase's aim (named validation phase) is to validate tests to assess the impact of
      peripheral visual impairment on the sensory and motor performance of patients in their daily
      life. Firstly 15 RP's patients and 15 healthy volunteers will be included in this phase
      conducted according to a plan of Simon. 21 additional patients will be including on each
      group in view of the results on the first step in this 2nd phase.

      For each patient, the duration of participation will be of 3 months for the first phase and
      14 months for the second phase. The study duration is expected to be 50 months.
