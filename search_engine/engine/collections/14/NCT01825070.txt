      biomarkers will be measured in order to elucidate the effects of an acute dose of tart cherry
      juice on indices related to the condition of gout.

      Participants will be required to attend the laboratory at a range of time points over two
      periods of 96 hours, separated by a 7 day washout period, to provide blood samples. In order
      to provide a baseline sample, participants will attend the laboratory in the morning
      following an overnight fast and voiding of any urine. Following this participants will be
      given 30mls (30 mls provides 323 mg/380 Âµmol of anthocyanins) of tart cherry juice or
      placebo, diluted with 60 mls of water to consume within 10 minutes. Participants will be
      required to consume identical dosages of the supplement immediately prior to evening meals
      and breakfasts (or same time each morning following blood sampling if non-breakfast eater)
      over the next 96 hours. Further blood and urine samples will be collected at 1, 2, 3, 5, 8,
      24, 26, 48, 50, 72, 74 and 96 hours and will require participants to return to the laboratory
      at each of these time points. Following the first period of supplementation participants will
      complete a 7 day washout period in which they will not be required to attend the laboratory.
      Following the washout period they will repeat the supplementation period consuming the
      supplement they did not receive during the first period.
