      Clínicas de São Paulo (HC-SP)) is proposed. Treatment groups: Group 1: Elastic stockings +
      FlebonGroup 2: Use of elastic socks + Placebo de Flebon.1 Visit 1 - Screening and Selection
      (D-15) • Evaluation of inclusion and non-inclusion criteria • FICT signature • Clinical
      evaluation • Aberdeen questionnaire (without schematic design) • Randomization • Dispensation
      of medication (placebo and Pycnogenol) • Dismissal of use diary 2. Visit 02 D0 - Initiation
      of treatment (+/- 2 days) • Performing the procedure by Sclerotherapy • Record of adverse
      events • Pre-sclerotherapy photographic record • Clinical evaluation • investigational
      product (placebo and Pycnogenol) • Dismissal of new use diary (elastic stockings and
      investigational product) • Withdrawal criteria • Visit 03 - D7 - Return of 7 days (+/- 2
      days) • Evaluation of withdrawal criteria • Evaluated adherence to treatment by use diary •
      Return of control (eventual drainage) • Record of adverse events • Clinical evaluationVisit
      04 - D30 - Return 30 days after visit 2 (+/- 2 days) • Treatment adherence assessment by use
      diary • Photographic control I • Hyperpigmentation scale • Pigment size assessment, if any •
      Record of adverse events • Assessment of withdrawal criteria • Assessment clinical •

      adherence by use diary • Evaluation of criteria • Photographic control III •Pigment size
      assessment, if any • Aberdeen questionnaire application (without schematic drawing) •
      Medication suspension • Hyperpigmentation scale • Adverse event recording • Research
      participant satisfaction rating • Clinical assessmentPhotographic recording of the legs will
      be performed before 30, 60 and 90 days in 03 (three) incidences and evaluated by 01 blind
      observer. The photographic records will be made by camera following the same parameters,
      namely: 60 cm distance to 50 cm from the ground, not using flash, with artificial lighting
      (ceiling light), without zoom. All generated images will be archived in JPEG (Joint
      Photographic File Format) format. Images must be downloaded within 5 days of photographic
      registration and inserted into All images should be encoded as follows: IDENTIFICATION OF
      PARTICIPANTS + DATE OF PHOTOGRAPH REGISTRATION CO (00/00/0000) + VISIT. In addition, a
      sticker with the research participant's initials and date of photograph registration should
      be visible to the image. The blinded study medium will evaluate all photographs at the end of
      the study, making a comparison between them to inform the presence and the evolution of
      hyperpigmentation due to foam sclerotherapy, when they occur.For this, the Torok
      Hyperpigmentation Scale will be applied at D 30, D 60 and D90.
