      of two parallel substudies. The total subject population will be 190 subjects with 80
      subjects assigned to the Short Neck Substudy and 110 subjects to the High Neck Angulation
      Substudy.

      This clinical study will include fifty-six sites in the US. Each enrolled subject will
      undergo periodic follow-up evaluations involving physical exams and contrast-enhanced
      computed tomography (CT) scans at specific, protocol-defined intervals for a period of five
      years following the GORE® EXCLUDER® Conformable AAA Endoprosthesis implant. Each Substudy
      will be evaluated and reported independently from each other according to the Safety and
      Effectiveness Endpoints. No comparative analyses between these substudies are planned.
