      cancer. Therapeutic cancer vaccines are a form of immunotherapy designed to educate the
      immune system to recognise tumor cells as foreign rather than self. New Castle Virus (NDV)
      has a long history as a broad system oncolytic that can destroy tumor cells and stimulate the
      immune system. Up to 30 patients suffering from recurrent, refractory Glioblastoma
      Multiforme, soft an bone sarcomas and disseminated neuroblastoma will be enrolled in this
      trial and receive daily doses of NDV at least 5 days a week for a minimum of a year or until
      disease progression.
