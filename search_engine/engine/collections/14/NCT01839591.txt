      the studies through is not yet well understood yet. The only action on the denaturation and
      destruction of the smooth muscle layer of the bronchi at intermediate and high caliber
      perhaps not fully explain its action, taking into account that most of the smooth muscle
      loading of the small airways is minimally altered by the procedure. From the premises
      outlined in the section on the mechanism of inflammation we hypothesized that BT may have a
      strong influence on the destruction of nerve receptors TRPV1 and unmyelinated nerve fibers
      located in the mucosa going to stop reflections both central and local authorities
      responsible for the activation of bronchospasm. In support of this hypothesis, there are some
      anatomical studies4, which show that these receptors are more numerous at the level of main
      bronchi which are the main target of BT. Please note in this context that it is already known
      that in thermoablations commonly used in cardiology it is used a radio frequency with
      development of heat controlled to 65 Â°, as in the BT, able to interrupt the circuit nervous
      responsible for the activation of the circuit causing the abnormal 'arrhythmia.
