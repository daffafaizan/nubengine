      care in an oncology population in a low-resource setting in order to provide guidance for
      future public health policies surrounding the provision of palliative care in Ethiopia.
      Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that initiation of palliative care in this
      low-resource setting is a cost-reducing intervention that will improve patient-reported
      outcomes and quality of life. Preliminary data: This research will focus on adult patients
      with oncologic diagnoses as preliminary research in this setting revealed that this patient
      population had the highest depression and anxiety scores, the lowest palliative outcome
      scores, and reported the highest costs of medical care.
