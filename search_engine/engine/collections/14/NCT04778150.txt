      measured, Sv02 requires a central venous catheter. SvO2 gives knowledge about the balance
      between the delivery of oxygen and oxygen consumption in the body. Interest in SvO2
      monitoring in anesthesia and critical care has been debated. However, SvO2 is still
      recommended as a major hemodynamic target of early resuscitation of critically ill patients.
      SvO2 measurement through pulmonary artery catheter is accompanied with morbidity due to its
      invasiveness. During liver transplantation surgery, measurement of SvO2 is required to
      adequately manage hemodynamics of the patient, especially during portal venous clamping.

      VO 100 medical device from Mespere LifeSciences allows a non-invasive measurement of SjvO2
      using the NIRS technique. Jugular venous oxygen saturation (SjvO2) is a measurement of the
      amount of oxygen left in the venous system after the brain has removed the oxygen that it
      needs.

      On the same principle that a positive relationship between ScvO2 and SvO2 has been shown,
      what the investigators are trying to do is to show a positive relationship between SjvO2 and
      SvO2 in order to possibly use in the future SjvO2 measured by VO 100 as a noninvasive
      surrogate of SvO2 during liver transplantation surgery.
