    
      The objective of this randomized pivotal study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the
      AtriCure EPi-Sense®-AF Guided Coagulation System with VisiTrax® for the treatment of
      symptomatic persistent Atrial Fibrillation (AF) patients, refractory or intolerant to at
      least one Class I or Class III anti-arrhythmic drug (AAD). 153 subjects from up to 27 US and
      3 OUS sites. Randomized 2:1.

      The primary efficacy endpoint is success or failure to be AF/AT/AFL free absent class I and
      III AADs except for a previously failed or intolerant class I or III AAD with no increase in
      dosage following the 3-month blanking period through the 12-month post procedure follow-up
      visit.

      The primary safety endpoint is the incidence of major adverse events (MAEs) listed in the
      protocol for subjects undergoing the convergent procedure for the procedural to 30-day post
      procedure time period.
