      the so-called "surgical waist" and associated oncological problems, whereas the spread of
      extra-levator abdominoperineal resection (ELAPR) is still hindered by its high risk of wound
      complications and neurovascular injuries. Owing to the advancement of laparoscopic
      techniques, the investigators developed a laparoscopic APR with TILT procedure. During the
      procedure, a controlled incision of levators into the ischiorectal fat was performed
      transabdominally under direct vision; the meeting plane is therefore lowered and the perineal
      dissection is simplified without changing body position. This technique offers individualized
      transection of levator muscles, minimizes the risk of wound complications and prevents
      surgical waist to ensure oncological safety. This clinical trial is designed to evaluate the
      short-term and long-term benefits of this modified procedure.
