      I. To prospectively determine the sensitivity and specificity of dynamic susceptibility
      contrast (DSC)-MRI parameters in detecting tumor recurrence versus radiation necrosis for
      brain metastases treated with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To correlate radiographic diagnoses with pathologic diagnoses when surgical resection is
      clinically indicated.

      II. To correlate baseline relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) values and other hemodynamic
      parameters with tumor primary histology.

      III. To assess overall survival, local failure, distant brain failure and neurologic death.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants undergo a diagnostic MRI with and without contrast and treatment planning DSC
      perfusion MRI series before receiving SRS at 4-6 weeks after SRS, and then every 3 months
      unless clinically indicated sooner.
