    
      Purpose: The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of two theory-based behavior
      interventions on engagement of Veterans in advance care planning (ACP) by means of the
      following specific aim:

      Primary Aim: To conduct a randomized controlled trial examining the effects of: a) usual
      care; b) computer-tailored intervention (CTI); c) motivational enhancement therapy (MET); d)
      CTI + MET on the proportion of middle-age and older Veterans receiving primary care at the VA
      who complete the process of ACP, defined as completing a total of 4 key ACP behaviors,
      including selecting a health care proxy, communicating with the proxy about goals of care,
      communicating with the clinician about goals of care, and documenting proxy selection and
      goals.

      Primary Hypothesis: The proportion of Veterans completing ACP will be higher among those in
      each of the intervention groups compared to Veterans receiving usual care.

      All of 4 groups will receive their assessments and, if, their interventions, by telephone
      and/or mail. The veterans will from the VA Connecticut Healthcare System. Participants will
      be identified through a data query of the Regional Data Warehouse who have had a primary care
      visit in the past 12 months. We will then be able to oversample female and minority Veterans.
