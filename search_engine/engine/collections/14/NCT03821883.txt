      placebo-controlled study aiming at investigating the safety of terminating the use of aspirin
      since the sixth month after LAAO.

      Patients diagnosed with paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation with an age between 18
      and 90 years and have undergone LAAO will be enrolled in this study. Randomization will be
      performed at 6 months post-implant. The randomization program electronically assigns the
      patient 1:1 to either the Aspirin group or the control group. Study patients assigned to
      Aspirin group will receive enteric coated aspirin (100 mg/day). The control group receives
      placebo. After the randomization, subjects of both groups will have follow-up visits at 6 and
      12 months and then every 12 months until 24 months after the last patient recruitment. For
      each group, 560 patients will be included, with an estimated total number of 1120
      participants in this clinical study. Patients will be followed up until 24 months after the
      last enrollment.

      The primary endpoint is a composite consisting of stroke, systemic embolism, cardiovascular
      or unexplainable death, acute coronary syndrome, coronary artery disease or periphery
      vascular disease requiring revascularization and major bleeding. The secondary endpoints are
      all-cause death, device related thrombus, minor bleeding and rehospitalization due to heart
      failure.
