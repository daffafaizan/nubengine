      recruitment of CMP patients and the infrastructure provided by TORCH:

        -  Well phenotyped patients will be the starting point for comprehensive next-generation
           genotyping, leading to advanced estimates of genotype-phenotype relationship and its
           clinical impact.

        -  Functional analysis of novel genomic loci and their related molecular pathways will be
           based on our established in-vitro (e.g. iPS cells, yeast two hybrid) and in-vivo (e.g.
           zebrafish and mice) model systems.

        -  The integrated analysis of viral load and replication, inflammation, genotype and
           clinical variables will define risk variables for inflammatory and hereditary CMP.

        -  By longitudinal follow-up of patients, the role of genetic, epigenetic, metabolic,
           molecular biomarkers and histopathology for diagnosis and out-come prediction will be
           defined on a national level.

      The registry will also facilitate investigator initiated clinical trials.
