      including reduction of cardiovascular disease and improved satiety. The aim of this study is
      to determine the energy value of walnuts in the human diet and to probe mechanisms by which
      walnuts impart health benefits. The metabolizable energy value of walnuts will be calculated
      based on the chemical composition and energy content of the consumed diet and excreta. This
      will provide a better estimate of the energy value of walnuts than simply calculating energy
      value based on Atwater factors. In addition to determining the energy value of walnuts, we
      will evaluate the effects of walnut-rich diets on plasma phytonutrient levels and on gene
      expression changes to determine what protective mechanisms are activated by walnut
      consumption.
