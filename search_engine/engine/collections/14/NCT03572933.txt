      will enroll approximately 70 patients between the ages of 2 and 21 with a confirmed
      disease-related CDKL5 gene variant. Patients will undergo a baseline period before being
      randomized to receive, in addition to their existing anti-seizure treatment, either
      ganaxolone or placebo for 17 weeks. Following the treatment period, all patients that meet
      certain eligibility requirements will have the opportunity to receive ganaxolone in the open
      label phase of the study. The study's primary efficacy endpoint is percent reduction in
      seizures. Secondary outcome measures will include non-seizure-related endpoints to capture
      certain behavioral and sleep disturbances that have been seen in previous clinical studies
      with ganaxolone.
