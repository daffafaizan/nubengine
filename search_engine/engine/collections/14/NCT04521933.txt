      and the size of inferior caval vein using cardiac Point-of-Care ultrasound is commonly
      performed by intensivists and emergency medicine physicians during the management of the
      patients with shock and/or acute respiratory failure. However, very little data is available
      to define the reliability of this qualitative examination. The presented study aims to assess
      this reliability.

      Physicians meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria will be sent by a questionnaire
      consisting of 19 ultrasound cases. Participants will be asked to perform qualitative
      evaluation of ultrasound findings of each case. Then, the results will be compared with
      quantitative measurements made by conventional transthoracic echocardiography and validity
      testing will be performed.
