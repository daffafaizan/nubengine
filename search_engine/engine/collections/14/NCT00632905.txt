      (CTIBL). The current standard of care is the addition of Vitamin D and Calcium upon the
      initiation of ADT. Moreover, bisphosphonates are now being considered to treat and prevent
      CTIBL. However, bisphosphonates are costly, thus there is a desire to identify or target a
      specific subset of patients who would most benefit from the treatment.

      By obtaining baseline BMD and monitoring for Skeletal Related Events (SREs), we hope to
      identify that specific sub-set of patients who would most benefit from the treatment. Using a
      prospective, observational study design, we propose monitoring how physicians manage CTIBL in
      their patients.
