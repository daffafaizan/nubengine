      with two antibiotics) is the first-line strategy to eradicate Helicobacter pylori in China.
      However, it may cause a series of adverse reactions, such as nausea, diarrhea, abdominal
      pain, constipation, and abnormal taste, etc., which leads to a decrease in patient
      compliance, thereby affecting the treatment effect. Many studies have found that adding
      probiotics to traditional Helicobacter pylori eradication therapies increase eradication
      rates and reduce the side effects of the treatment. Bifidobacterium tetrad live bacteria
      tablet is a compound microecological preparation composed of bifidobacterium infantis,
      lactobacillus acidophilus, enterococcus faecalis and bacillus cereus. This study aims to
      observe the clinical efficacy of Bifidobacterium quadruple live bacteria tablets (Si Lian
      Kang) on reducing the incidence rate of adverse reactions in Helicobacter pylori quadruple
      eradication therapy and on the effects of gastrointestinal flora.
