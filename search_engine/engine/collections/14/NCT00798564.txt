      various provocative stimuli in athletes doing two different sort activities, Tennis or
      swimming. As controls are being used sedentary age-matched controls from the same region,
      exposed to the same school environment. Thus we wish to:

        -  explore the prevalence of positive mannitol reactivity among swimmers and tennis player
           and how this relates to symptoms, disease history and to a sport specific exercise
           provocation test.

        -  compare the results from sport specific testing with a standardized eucapnic
           hyperventilation test (EHV)

        -  compare the overall reactivity to mannitol or EHV among swimmers and tennis players
           compared to aged matched controls.

        -  explore the role by CC16 in airway reactivity to different provocative stimuli and to
           see whether there is a difference between different sport activities, different test
           protocols and between athletes and controls.

        -  explore evidence of eicosanoid related inflammatory reaction in athletes and controls in
           relation to different provocative stimuli

      The study population consists of 100 elite swimmers, 100 elite tennis players and 100
      non-elite, eged matched controls. In the latter group, 30 are aged matched non-atopic
      non-asthmatic controls.
