      prior to beginning treatment with either oral doxycycline or topical azithromycin solution.
      Doxycycline is dosed at 100 mg bid; topical azithromycin is delivered once per day as a 1%
      solution. Treatment with doxycycline is for two months; treatment with topical azithromycin
      is for one month. Following treatment, meibomian glands are again expressed and the lipids
      measured by spectroscopy (FTIR, MALDI-TOF, NMR)for characterization of structure and
      function. Analysis for presence of doxcycline or azithromycin is also performed. Changes in
      lipid parameters are correlated with clinical signs and symptoms of disease.
