      [CD]73) with durvalumab (anti programmed cell death ligand 1 [PD-L1]) will demonstrate
      adequate safety, tolerability, and antitumor activity in subjects with locally advanced or
      recurrent/metastatic: pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), non-small-cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC) and squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck (SCCHN), and that circulating free
      methylated DNA immunoprecipitation and high-throughput sequencing (cfMeDIP-seq) can yield
      cancer type-agnostic predictive biomarker(s) of response and/or toxicity in subjects
      receiving this combination.
