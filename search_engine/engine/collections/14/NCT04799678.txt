    
      Over 18 users of the Smart Asthma app (by Smart Respiratory Products Ltd) will be asked if
      they wish to participate in the study by recording voice samples. The question will be posed
      within the app and can be answered with a tap.

      Those interested in participating will be shown a short plain English description of the
      goals and methodology of the project before enrolled.

      A maximum of 9 voice sample recording session will be carried out on the phones of
      participants and take less than 2 minutes each, so participants will spend a total of fewer
      than 18 minutes during the entire trial.

      Sessions will be offered after participants have recorded their asthma symptoms, lung
      function and inhaler use in the normal course of using the app. Participants may accept or
      decline each individual offer to record their voice.

      Participants will have a chance to play each voice recording before sharing it anonymously
      with the investigators. Participants can discontinue their participation at any time and can
      ask investigators to delete all their data.

      The investigators will be analyse collected voice samples for changes in voice quality. The
      changes in voice quality will be compared against changes in lung function and asthma
      symptoms to determine what changes in voice quality, if any, are indicative of a change in
      asthma control.
