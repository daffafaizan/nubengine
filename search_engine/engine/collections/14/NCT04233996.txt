      malignancies. It is associated with an important morbidity and mortality. Nowadays the use of
      betalactam antibiotics (BLA) in extended or continuous infusion (EI, CI) instead of
      intermittent infusion (II), has demonstrated a therapeutic success and lower mortality rate
      in critically ill intensive care patients. Neutropenic patients are a particular population
      since FN is assoicated with pathophysiological variations that compromise pharmacokinetic
      parameters of BLA, and may therefore, diminish their clinical efficacy. Information regarding
      the usefulness of BLA in EI in neutropenic hematologic patients is scarce.

      The objective of this randomized clinical trial is to demonstrate the clinical superiority of
      the administration of BLA in EI compared to II in patients with FN.
