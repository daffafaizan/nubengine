      complete remission (CR) rates ranging from 50% to 80%. Nonetheless, the majority (60- 70%) of
      responding patients will eventually relapse.

      Patients with non-low risk leukemia according most diffuse risk scores have a poor prognosis
      and a short survival. For these patient traditional chemotherapy seems to be ineffective,
      even with BMT consolidation, probably due to activation of survival pathways in Leukemia
      cells, so that novel therapeutic interventions should be attempted.

      This study will test the effectiveness and safety of Venetoclax, a selective BCL2 inhibitor,
      in combination with standard induction regimen.

      Inhibiting anti-apoptotic pathway of BCL2, the investigators expect to improve success rate
      of standard chemotherapies.
