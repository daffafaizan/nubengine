    
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study to evaluate the
      effect of Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol DISKUS 250/50mcg (FSC) BID on arterial stiffness
      in COPD subjects. Following a 1 to 14 day run-in period, approximately 250 subjects will be
      randomly assigned to double-blind treatment for 12 weeks. After the 12 week treatment period,
      subjects in both treatment arms will receive open label Tiotropium bromide Handihaler18mcg
      (Tio)QD for 4 weeks in addition to their continued study drug (either FSC250/50 or placebo).
      The primary measure of efficacy is Pulse Wave Velocity (PWV) at Endpoint. Secondary efficacy
      measures include Augmentation Index (AIx), Biomarkers of cardiovascular disease, measures of
      lung function. (e.g. FEV1). Safety will be assessed through the collection of adverse events
      and COPD exacerbations. Exploratory endpoints include the effect of Tiotropium on PWV and AIx
      when added to placebo or FSC. Treatment groups will be stratified based on current smoking
      status. There will be a total of 6 study visits (screening, randomization, and after 4, 8, 12
      and 16 weeks of treatment). A follow-up phone contact for collection of adverse event and
      pregnancy information (if applicable) will be conducted approximately 14 days following the
      last study visit.
