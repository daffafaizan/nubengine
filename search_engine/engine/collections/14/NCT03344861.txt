      the potential to achieve a 20% reduction in death rates. Newly developed bronchoscopic
      technologies (such as navigational bronchoscopy) have been shown to enable physicians to
      safely reach lesions in peripheral regions of the lung and obtain diagnosis. This new
      technology may now potentially offer bronchoscopic therapeutic interventions, such as
      photodynamic therapy, to tumors that were previously unreachable due to their peripheral
      anatomic location.

      Photodynamic therapy (PDT) uses a combination of a photosensitizing drug (a drug that is
      activated by light), called porfimer sodium (PhotofrinÂ®), and a light from a laser that emits
      no heat. This technique works to allow the medical doctor to specifically target and destroy
      abnormal or cancer cells while limiting damage to surrounding healthy tissue. The activation
      of the drug is done by lightning the abnormal area using a fiber optic device (very fine
      fiber [like a fishing line] that permits light transmission) inserted into a flexible tube
      with a light, called bronchoscope for the lung. The light activates the porfimer sodium
      concentrated in the abnormal tissue, leading to its destruction.

      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety of using photodynamic therapy prior to
      surgical resection of tumors located in the periphery of the lung.
