    
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety of Zemplar® in the treatment of
      Secondary hyperparathyroidism (iParathormone>300 pg/mL) in subjects on hemodialysis treated
      in conditions of usual clinical care.

      The primary safety endpoints of this study are to evaluate the safety of Zemplar by recording
      the number of hospitalizations and days hospitalized.

      A secondary efficacy endpoint will be the proportion of subjects achieving therapeutic
      success. Therapeutic success with Zemplar® will be defined as:

        -  40% reduction in the base iPTH level is achieved, and/or;

        -  serum iParathormone level < 300 pg/mL.

      Additional secondary endpoints are the incidence (proportion of patients) of clinically
      meaningful hypercalcemia (defined as corrected serum calcium (Ca) > 11.0 mg/dL taken at 2
      consecutive measurements), hyperphosphatemia (defined as serum phosphorous (P)>6.5 mg/dL
      taken at 2 consecutive measurements), and elevated Ca x P product (defined as serum Ca x P>65
      mg^2/dL^2 taken at 2 consecutive measurements). Safety also will be assessed through adverse
      event monitoring and evaluation of laboratory variables and vital signs.
