      I. To determine in a Phase I study the toxicity of flurouracil (FU) when given in escalating
      doses in combination with fixed doses of phenlylbutyrate (PB), indomethacin and recombinant
      human interferon-gamma (rhIFNg) to patients with advanced colorectal cancer.

      II. To determine in a Phase II study the efficacy of FU in combination with PB, indomethacin
      and rhIFNg in patients with advanced colorectal cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of fluorouracil (5-FU).

      Phase I: Patients receive 5-FU IV over 24 hours on day 1; phenylbutyrate IV over 120 hours
      and oral indomethacin daily on days 2-6; and interferon gamma subcutaneously on days 2, 4,
      and 6. Courses repeat weekly in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of 5-FU until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which less than 2 of 6 patients
      experience dose-limiting toxicity (DLT).

      Phase II :Patients receive 5-FU, phenylbutyrate, indomethacin, and interferon gamma as in
      phase I at the MTD.

      Patients are followed for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 24 patients will be accrued for the phase I portion of this
      study and approximately 46 patients will be accrued for the phase II portion of this study.
