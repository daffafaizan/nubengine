      can not tolerate 30% of target energy, then she/he will be randomized to early PN group or
      late PN group at day 3. Patients in early PN group will receive supplemental parenteral
      nutrition at day 3 while patients in late PN group will not receive supplemental parenteral
      nutrition until day 8 after abdominal surgery. Both groups will receive SPN except 80% of
      target energy delivered by EN or oral or patients are discharged from hospital. The primary
      and secondary outcomes will be collected.
