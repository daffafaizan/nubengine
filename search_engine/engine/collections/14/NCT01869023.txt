      develops in people who were exposed to asbestos, with a latency period ranging from 20 to 40
      years. Most of these patients present with advanced disease, which are considered
      unresectable and combination chemotherapy is the treatment of choice. Currently the standard
      treatment is the combination of pemetrexed with cispaltin, this treatment showed benefit in
      overall survival and overall response rate in comparison with the treatment with cisplatin
      alone. This standard chemotherapy in our country is difficult to access due to the costs of
      the treatment and the poor economic situation of most of our patients. That's why determining
      the effectiveness of other treatment options that have shown activity in this disease that
      are less expensive, is of vital importance in our country. Phase I studies of gemcitabine
      showed that the maximum tolerated dose varies with time of infusion, 250 mg/m2 is the maximum
      tolerated dose when the infusion is carried out in 6 hours, as opposed to 1250 mg/m2 when
      gemcitabine is administered in a conventional manner . A phase III study in NSCLC, which
      compared the administration of gemcitabine infusion of 250 mg/m2 in 6 hours versus
      conventional administration of 1,250 mg/m2 in 30 minutes showed that both treatments were
      similar in efficacy and toxicity. The same group conducted a phase II study in unresectable
      malignant pleural mesothelioma that was published recently with promising results. That is
      why we decided to conduct a phase II study in patients with unresectable malignant pleural
      mesothelioma with the idea of validating the results previously obtained and to study factors
      and associated with resistance to chemotherapy as ERCC1, RPM1, thymidylate synthase.
