    
      Consecutive patients coming to our institution affected by benign prostatic obstruction (BPO)
      with indication to surgery and strong need of ejaculatory preservation will be enrolled in
      the present randomised controlled trial study after counseling. After an informed consent is
      obtained, uroflowmetry with calculation of the post-voiding residual volume (PVR), a
      transrectal ultrasonography to estimate prostate volume (PVol), the international prostate
      symptoms score (IPSS) questionnaire with quality of life (QoL) assessment, and the evaluation
      of the ejaculatory sexual function will be performed in all patients.

      Trans-Perineal Laser Ablation of Prostate (TPLA) will be performed using the EchoLaser
      combined system (Elesta, Italy).

      During the procedure, two 21G spinal needles are inserted transperineally in the
      peri-urethral area under ultrasound-guidance. By optical fibers, a maximum energy of 1800 J
      at a power of 3 Watts is delivered. If necessary, the fibers are eventually pulled-back.
      Immediately after the procedure, the patients will be asked to fill in the Visual Analogue
      Scale (VAS) for the assessment of the pain perceived. Perioperative data and postoperative
      data including assessment of ejaculatory function will be analyzed at different time points.
