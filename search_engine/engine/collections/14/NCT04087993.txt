    
      Randomised, active-controlled, open-labelled, parallel group, multicentre study to
      demonstrate superiority of Polyglucoferron i.v. compared to oral iron substitution for the
      treatment of iron deficient anaemic patients who need fast replenishment of iron stores as
      judged by the treating physician, e.g. if it is not appropriate to postpone surgery, before
      elective non-cardiac surgery and superiority of Polyglucoferron i.v. vs Ferric Carboxymaltose
      in short term safety monitoring.
