      locally advanced, but transorally resectable oropharyngeal cancer followed by risk-adapted
      adjuvant therapy versus primary radiochemotherapy (definitive chemoradiotherapy, CRTX). Both
      treatments are internationally accepted standards. The choice of the treatment strategy
      depends on the preference of the responsible attending physician and on the country of
      residence. Internationally, mostly definitive chemoradiotherapy is regarded as the standard
      of care for oropharyngeal cancer. In Germany, however, transoral surgical resection is also
      well established and commonly practiced. The key question therefore is whether one of the two
      therapies is more effective than the other in clinical daily routine under the given
      conditions of our health care system and with a realistic, non-ideal patient cohort. For this
      reason, a comparative effectiveness research (CER) concept will be applied in this setting.
      The aim of this trial is primarily to show a superiority of the surgical approach in terms of
      local and locoregional control and secondarily to compare functional outcome and quality of
      life.
