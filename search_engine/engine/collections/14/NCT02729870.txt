      (ED) care annually in the United States. Gastroenteritis treatment regimens have been
      outlined in guidelines endorsed by the American Academy of Pediatrics, European Society of
      Pediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN), and Center for Disease Control
      (CDC). A fundamental principle included in these guidelines is the administration of oral
      rehydration therapy (ORT) to the vast majority of children with gastroenteritis; however,
      surveys have shown that a gap exists between guidelines and practice. Fasting ketoacidosis is
      an increasingly recognized metabolic derangement for children presenting with symptoms
      suggestive of gastroenteritis and mild to moderate dehydration. Ketoacidosis frequently
      occurs and likely adds comorbid symptoms of lethargy, vomiting, and malaise. These symptoms
      likely impair successful oral rehydration interventions. These symptoms may also lead to
      overestimations of the severity of dehydration. Rapid recognition of ketoacidosis is now
      possible with point of care testing beta-hydroxybutyrate. This investigation will determine
      if an oral glucose gel intervention will improve the Point Of Care (POC) beta-hydroxybutyrate
      from baseline. Secondary outcomes measured will include net fluid volume intake estimates,
      need for IV hydration, and need for hospitalization.
