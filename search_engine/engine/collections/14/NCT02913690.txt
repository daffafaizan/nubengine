    
      This study is a multi-centered, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial where a
      total of 400 HD patients (200 supplemented; 200 control) will be recruited from government
      and private settings. Subjects will be randomized to either the intervention or control
      group. The intervention group will receive TRF (300 mg), daily for 12 months while the
      control group will only receive placebo, daily for 12 months. In addition, both groups will
      receive standard dietary counseling to ensure compliance to medical nutrition therapy
      guidelines for dialysis patients.

      Patients who consented will be first subjected to a screening for identification of eligible
      subjects. The screening will involve basic anthropometry measures (height, weight, BMI),
      routine biochemistry result obtained from medical record, assessment of nutritional status
      and dietary evaluation. About 15ml of pre-dialysis blood will be collected by respective
      nurses for additional laboratory parameters (hsCRP, atherogenic profile and other
      inflammatory markers).

      Patients who fulfill the inclusion criteria will be randomized to either control or
      intervention group. During the 12 months of treatment period, patients in both control and
      intervention groups will be assessed at baseline and 3-monthly intervals for laboratory
      results, medical condition, hospitalizations, nutritional status, dietary intake and
      compliance towards supplementation (intervention group only). A final measurement will be
      taken 3 months after study completion as a post follow up assessment upon cessation of
      supplementation. In all, patient data will be generated at 6 time points.

      (A similar study, following a similar protocol and using the same study design and
      intervention will recruit 400 patients total (200 for each group) in Michigan, USA).
