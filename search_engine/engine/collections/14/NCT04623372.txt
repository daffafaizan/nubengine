      concerning the subsequent healing procedure after a punch skin biopsy remains still poorly
      defined and harmonized, currently based on the physicians personal experiences and some
      preconceived considerations. The few studies available in the literature are supporting the
      assumption that the use of a directed wound healing could be as effective as the widely-used
      procedure of performing a suture while it does not downgrade the quality of care. However,
      due to their methodological quality and applicability, they have not led to a substantial
      modification of the common behaviours. Moreover, the development of some new and the
      improvement of the former resources could have changed the situation. Therefore, this study
      aims to bring some recent pragmatic data to assist the implementation of recommendations
      regarding the attitude to adopt for the healing procedure after a skin punch-biopsy.

      The protocol will consist in a monocentric, prospective, randomized and controlled,
      interventional study. It will be carried out with two parallel groups, in a non-inferiority
      setting. All the included participants will undergo a skin biopsy using a punch of 4 mm
      diameter. Then they will either get a suture by separated knots using a non-absorbable 4.0
      wire and a dry dressing, either get only a dry dressing. All the subjects will receive a
      phone call at five days after the skin biopsy in order to collect the self-evaluation of the
      maximal experienced pain during the healing period. They will also have a single follow-up
      appointment one month after the inclusion and a photograph of the scar will be taken during
      this medical consultation. This picture will be evaluated by a blind independent investigator
      without the presence of the patient.
