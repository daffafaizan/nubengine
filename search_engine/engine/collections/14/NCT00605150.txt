      to eligible patients with Hepatocellular Carcinoma of the liver who are not surgical
      resection candidates and to evaluate patient experience, toxicities and overall survival
      associated with TheraSphere treatment.

      This is an observational treatment use protocol that will provide Institutional Review Board
      (IRB) oversight and documentation of the clinical experience of patients undergoing treatment
      for liver carcinoma using TheraSphere. Participation involves no investigational or research
      procedures. Patients will be followed for treatment-related adverse experiences and will be
      monitored in accordance with institutional practices. Approximately 60 patients will be
      enrolled in a treatment protocol and the number may be expanded following completion of the
      first cohort. The total number of patients to be treated will be determined based on clinical
      experience and patient outcomes. There are no control subjects in this treatment protocol.

      The duration of the protocol will depend on patient experience with this treatment. An
      initial one year approval is sought at this time. Patient experience will be evaluated
      continuously and if the clinicians find that the treatment provides benefits to patients,
      renewal of the approval will be sought after the first 12 months.
