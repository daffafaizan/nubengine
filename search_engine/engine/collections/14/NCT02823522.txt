      diseases. Patients suffering from NCGS are diagnosed after carefully excluding celiac disease
      (CD) diagnosis by negative CD-specific serum antibodies and absence of intestinal villi
      atrophy, and excluding IgE-mediated wheat allergy, by negative serum specific IgE and/or skin
      prick test with wheat antigens. Then, in the absence of sensitive and specific diagnostic
      biomarkers for NCGS, a monitoring of the patient during elimination and re-introduction of
      wheat by a double-blind placebo controlled (DBPC) challenge method has been suggested as
      diagnostic hallmark. Obviously, this a cumbersome and time-consuming procedure which has been
      used in few studies.

      Despite an increasing percentage of the general population define themselves as
      "gluten-sensitive", and by the year 2017 the market of the gluten-free products will be worth
      6.6 billion of dollars, doubts persist about many aspects of NCGS. Some studies seem to
      suggest that wheat components other than gluten can cause the symptoms, and therefore the
      term "non-celiac wheat sensitivity" (NCWS) has been proposed instead of NCGS. Furthermore,
      while it is well known that CD is a long-life condition and a strict adherence to the
      gluten-free diet must be maintained, it is unknown whether this is valid for NCWS.

      On the year 2012, the researchers published a retrospective study, including 276 patients
      with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-like symptoms who had been diagnosed with NCWS using a
      DBPC challenge during a ten-years period (2001-2011).

      The present prospective study aimed to evaluate the persistence of the NCWS condition in that
      cohort and, consequently, the researchers estimated : A) how many of these patients are still
      following a wheat-free diet, and B) which percentage was still suffering from NCWS, diagnosed
      by DBPC wheat challenge, in a subgroup of that cohort.
