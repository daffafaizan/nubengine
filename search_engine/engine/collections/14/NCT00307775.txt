      as obstetric trauma. However in clinical practice many women report that their symptoms of
      faecal incontinence begin around the same time as menopause. A community survey examining the
      prevalence of faecal incontinence in menopausal women is in progress. If a correlation is
      found between the onset of menopause and the development of faecal incontinence, further
      investigation of effective treatment will be indicated.

      The investigators want to investigate whether vaginally administered oestradiol can alleviate
      or improve symptoms in women who have faecal incontinence after the menopause. This is a
      pilot study.
