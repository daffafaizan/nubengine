      testing period to assess cardiometabolic and emotional well-being and habitual diet, subjects
      will consume a Mediterranean-style, weight-maintenance diet that is either restricted or rich
      in lean, minimally processed red meat for 5 weeks. Following a 4-wk washout period and second
      2-wk baseline testing, subjects will consume the Mediterranean Diet with the alternate
      predominant animal protein sources for 5 weeks. Cardiometabolic and emotional well-being will
      be assessed during baseline and post periods.
