           ratio and postoperative pain levels and the incidence of postoperative adverse events
           and complications in patients undergoing knee arthroplasty.

        -  In this study only the laboratory tests that are routinely used for the operative
           patients are going to be used and no extra tests will be performed. The study will begin
           after the postoperative blood samples are collected for routine laboratory measurements.
           The patients will be allocated to 4 groups according to the type of anesthesia and VAS
           scores. Preoperative and postoperative peripheral blood total whole blood MPV and N/L
           ratio and 1st 6th 12th ve 24th hours VAS scores and complications, morbidities and
           mortality will be recorded. The patients will receive analgesics according to the
           routine practice in the ward and the doses of analgesics given will be recorded at 1st
           6th 12th ve 24the hours wil be recorded.

        -  Statistical analysis: the numerical variables will be analyzed tested with
           Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for normality. For the parametric variables that are normally
           distributed t-test will be used for the comparison between groups. For the parametric
           variables that are not normally distributed Mann Whitney-U test will be used. All the
           categorical variables will be evaluated with q- square tests. A p value < 0.05 will be
           determined as statistically significant.
