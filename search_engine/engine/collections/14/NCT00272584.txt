      with clozapine, at a dose of 400 mg or more, unless limited by side effects. After screening,
      subjects will be augmented with placebo for 7 days. Any subject with a reduction in PANSS
      total score of 20% or greater will be discontinued from the study. Beginning on day 8,
      subjects will be randomized to continued augmentation of clozapine with placebo, or to
      augmentation with risperidone. The initial daily dose of risperidone will be 1.0 mg,
      increased in 1.0 mg increments to a total of 3.0 mg/day over a two week period. Subjects
      unable to tolerate at least one tablet of study medication will be dropped from the study. At
      the end of 8 weeks following randomization, at the choice of the investigator, open-label
      risperidone augmentation can be started.

      The primary outcome measure is the PANSS total score at week 9. Subjects will be classified
      as responders if the improvement in PANSS total score is 20% or greater, and the proportion
      of responders in each group will be determined. Complementary outcome measures will be the
      CGI severity score, CGI improvement score, and SOFAS score. Safety and tolerance will be
      assessed by reports of adverse events and clinically significant changes in vital signs,
      weight, waist circumference, extrapyramidal side effects, metabolic and hematological
      measures.
