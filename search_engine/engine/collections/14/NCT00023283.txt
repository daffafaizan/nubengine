    
      A randomized trial, in a hospital primary care clinic, for 24 weeks, of 168 opioid-dependent
      subjects, maintained on buprenorphine 3x/week, and counseled with Standard or Enhanced
      Medical Management. SMM is a brief intervention similar to that provided by primary
      practitioners to patients with chronic medical conditions such as diabetes. EMM is an
      intervention that provides education about the recovery process and advice about lifestyle
      changes and 12-step participation. Outcome measures include reduction in opioid use and
      abstinence from opioids, documented by 3x/week urine testing and self report.
