      I. Compare the probability of clinical response in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive vs
      ER-negative patients with recurrent, persistent, or metastatic endometrial cancer treated
      with fulvestrant.

      II. Compare the relationship between response rate and intensity of receptor expression in
      patients treated with this drug.

      III. Determine the frequency and intensity of toxicity of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive fulvestrant intramuscularly on day 1. Treatment repeats every 28 days for at
      least 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually thereafter.
