      morphine disposition and/or response will provide the scientific basis for rationale and
      individualized morphine dosing schemes in neonates and young infants.

      60 preterm neonates ranging in gestational age from 22 to 32 weeks will be recruited from the
      NICU. Stratification by gestational age will be done to ensure broad representation. The
      decision to initiate morphine therapy will be based solely on clinical indications. Prior to
      morphine dosing, a biochemical assessment of hepatic and renal function will be obtained. A
      0.05 mg/kg loading dose of morphine will be given by an intravenous infusion over 30-minutes
      in preterm neonates with a gestational age of less than 29 weeks, followed by a continuous
      infusion of 0.005 mg/kg/h, whereas a loading dose of 0.1 mg/kg will be given in preterm
      neonates with a gestational age of 29 weeks or more followed by a continuous infusion of 0.01
      mg/kg/h. Pain assessment will be performed at baseline (prior to study medication
      administration) and at .5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24 hours after the dose. At each of these time
      points infants will be videotaped for two minutes with two cameras. Videotapes will be scored
      afterward using standard validated pain assessment tools for preterm infants.
