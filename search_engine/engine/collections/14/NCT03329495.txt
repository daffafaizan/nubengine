      (CME) and central vascular ligation (CVL) for the standardization of colonic cancer surgery.
      This concept has been widely recognized and accepted. This radical operation attempts to
      remove the mesocolon intactly by careful dissection along the embryologic tissue planes and
      transection of the supplying vessels at their origin. For right-sided colon cancer, this
      approach involves division of the vessels at their origin from the superior mesenteric artery
      (SMA) and superior mesenteric vein (SMV). In our opinion, full exposure of the SMA and SMV is
      necessary to make sure that the origin of the colonic arteries being truly exposed and tied
      centrally at their origin and a maximal harvest of the regional lymphnodes. For locally
      advanced colon cancer, SMA- orientated surgery may be more meaningful to recerve a radical
      lymphadenectomy and bring benefit for their survival. However, in the traditional practise,
      the lymph node dissection is orientated by SMV and SMA is not exposed, tissue around SMA is
      left behind.

      In this study, eligible patients with right colon cancer will be randomly allocated to
      receive either SMA- or SMV- orientated laparoscopic right hemicoloectomy. 100 patients will
      be enrolled in each group. In SMV- orientated surgery group, SMA is not exposed and the left
      boundary of resection is the left side of SMV. In SMA- orientated surgery group, the left
      boundary of resection is the left side of SMA and SMA is exposed.Artery sheath is not
      necessarily to be opened. Postoperative pathology will be analyzed with the number of lymph
      nodes retrieved. Postoperative recovery process and long term survival will be followed.
