      8). From Week 8, after the patient had received their third injection of study treatment, the
      visit intervals were determined by the patient's disease activity. If any of the
      protocol-specified signs of disease activity were present in the study eye, the subsequent
      injection visit interval was kept at 4 weeks. If none of the signs were present, the
      subsequent injection interval was extended by 2-week increments up until a maximum of
      12-weekly intervals was reached. If there were any signs of disease activity in the study
      eye, the treatment interval was reduced as specified in the protocol. The planned individual
      duration of study participation was 24 months.
