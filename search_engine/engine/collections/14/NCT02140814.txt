      fish, milk, eggs, green vegetables, beans, and cereal grains. Recent studies in mice have
      shown that niacinamide, at high doses, may slow kidney cyst growth from polycystic kidney
      disease (PKD).

      By doing this study, the researchers will determine if a larger, long-term study to test
      whether niacinamide slows progression of PKD is justified.
