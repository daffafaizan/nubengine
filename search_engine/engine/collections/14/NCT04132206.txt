    
      This is an explorative, prospective, monocentric open-label study qualified as interventional
      researches at minimal risks and constraints (called in French RIPH, category 2).

      This is a study of the gut microbiota and its characteristics in ScS patients, compared to
      control subjects (without ScS or other chronic diseases), matched on age and sex.

      Participants provided two stool samples: one collected the day of inclusion and a second, six
      months later.

      In parallel with the microbiota analysis, a clinical (digestive and extra digestive signs,
      severity) and biological characterization of the ScS will be carried out by the team of
      internists. This medical evaluation will be completed by an interview with a dietician to
      inform about the participant's eating habits, and any changes in the 7 days preceding the
      stool collection.

      Microbial profiles will be obtained from the sequencing data using the specialized tools
      DADA2 and Kraken.

      The search of characteristic signature of ScS will be performed by comparing ScS patients and
      healthy controls using a discriminant linear analysis (LDA) using the specialized tool LEfSe
      Main objective is to identify, through longitudinal follow-up, significant differences in the
      composition of the intestinal microbiota of ScS patients and healthy control subjects
      (matched on age and sex) in order to define a microbial signature specific to the ScS.

      Secondary objectives are to study the stability over time of the identified microbial
      signatures, and to determine a correlation between the composition of the microbiota obtained
      in the ScS patient and the severity of his symptoms (diffuse skin disease, pulmonary
      interstitial disease, digestive disease...)
