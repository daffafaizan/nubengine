      (T1DM) and insulin-treated type 2 diabetes (T2DM) a 40-50% faster absorption of rapid-acting
      insulin analogues when administered by jet injection technology rather than by conventional
      insulin pen. The faster insulin action of insulin administration by jet injection may be
      especially advantageous for correction of hyperglycemia.

      To investigate this, a open-label randomised controlled cross-over study will be performed in
      20 adult patients (18-75 years) with T1DM or T2DM on basal-bolus insulin treatment.

      The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of insulin aspart will be derived from the
      time-action profiles of insulin and glucose, respectively, in response to insulin (in a dose
      of 1.5 times the amount of insulin needed to reduce blood glucose to 6 mmol/l calculated by
      the insulin-sensitivity factor) after reaching hyperglycemia (18-23 mmol/l). All patients
      will be investigated twice, where on one occasion the jet-injector device will be used to
      inject insulin, and on the other occasion insulin will be injected with a conventional
      insulin pen. The order of these occasions will be randomised. Both devices will be operated
      by the patient after sufficient training. Ease of use will be evaluated.
