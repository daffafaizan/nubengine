      Determine on a homogenous population of scoliosis operated for an extended fusion of 4 or
      more vertebrae:

        -  the incidence of proximal junctional kyphosis

        -  Modifiable risk factors and non modifiable of occurrence of CJP.

        -  the rate of CJP leading to revision surgery and the surgical recovery factors.

      Methodology :
