      pathophysiology of psychotic disorders. Ketogenic diet (KD) is a high-fat, low-carbohydrate
      diet that restricts glucose and forces metabolism of ketones, which serve as alternative
      energy substrates for the brain. KD is an established treatment for intractable epilepsy.
      However, we lack the RCT evidence regarding potential effects of KD on psychotic symptoms in
      humans.

      This randomised, controlled pilot study aims to investigate:

        1. feasibility of a Modified Ketogenic Diet (MKD) intervention protocol in psychotic
           inpatients,

        2. potential impact of MKD intervention on psychotic symptoms, depressive and anxiety
           symptoms, and functioning in patients with psychotic symptoms / psychotic disorder.

      A 6-week randomised KD pilot study will be carried out in psychotic inpatients (aimed n=40)
      at Kuopio University Hospital, Finland. In the KD group, carbohydrate consumption is limited
      to 15-20 g/day to activate ketosis. The control group will have their ordinary hospital
      meals. The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM Axis I disorders (SCID-I), and the Positive
      and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) will assess current psychotic disorders and psychotic
      symptoms, respectively. Blood glucose, lipid, and ketone body levels, and weight will be
      measured. Background variables (socioeconomic factors, comorbidities, obtained treatments
      including medications, and health behaviours including diet) will be documented.
