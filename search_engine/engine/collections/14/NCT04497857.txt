      investigators will assess four important elements of engagement to determine which are most
      sensitive to TH treatment and mediates effects on hospitalization rates. The investigators
      will assess acceptability and satisfaction of CSC-TH compared to CSC-SD, and deliver a
      training manual for implementing TH in CSC clinics and for use in future research. Although
      this study has exploratory aims consistent with pilot projects, The investigators have
      incorporated methodological rigor where possible (randomization, powering for hospitalization
      rate) in order to achieve the most robust data to assess the main study questions and inform
      future trials.
