      mindfulness-based cognitive therapy self-help book ('Mindfulness: A practice guide to finding
      peace in a frantic world') relative to a wait-list control, in healthcare staff. It builds on
      a previous pilot RCT (http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN16486066). A battery of measures will be
      administered at baseline (week 0), post-intervention (week 9) and follow-up (week 21). This
      trial is designed to test the following hypotheses.

      Primary Hypothesis

      -Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy self-help (MBCT-SH) participants, in comparison to
      waitlist control participants, will show a reduction in symptoms of stress by the end of
      MBCT-SH (week 9).

      Secondary Hypotheses

        -  The improvement detailed in the primary hypothesis will be maintained at a follow-up 12
           weeks after the end of the MBCT-SH (week 21).

        -  MBCT-SH participants, in comparison to waitlist control participants, will show
           improvements in mindfulness, other-compassion, self-compassion, anxiety, depression,
           burnout and mental well-being by the end of MBCT-SH (week 9), and these improvements
           will be maintained at a follow-up 12 weeks after the end of the MBCT-SH (week 21).

        -  MBCT-SH participants, in comparison to waitlist control participants, will show a
           reduction in the number of sickness absence days from the three months preceding the
           intervention to the three months following the intervention.

        -  Increases in self-compassion and mindfulness from week 0 to week 9, will mediate the
           effects of MBCT-SH (relative to waitlist control) on levels of stress, depression,
           anxiety, wellbeing and burnout.
