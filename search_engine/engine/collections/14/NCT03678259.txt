      synthetic 45 amino acid peptide that binds many forms of amyloid, including human AL-, ATTR-
      and ALect2-associated amyloid, as well as human and murine serum amyloid protein A-associated
      (AA) amyloid. In preclinical studies, using SPECT and PET imaging, as well as
      microautoradiography, it has been shown that radioiodinated p5+14 binds rapidly and
      specifically to all amyloid deposits in abdominothoracic organs and tissues.

      This is a single site, exploratory, open-label Phase I PET/CT imaging and dosimetry study.
      The investigational drug product (designated 124I-p5+14 Injection) is an amyloid-reactive
      synthetic peptide, p5+14 (also known as APi1832), radiolabeled with iodine-124 (I-124 or
      124I). All patients enrolled in this exploratory trial will be outpatients with a confirmed
      diagnosis of systemic amyloidosis.

      The first three patients enrolled in the trial (Part 1) will take part in a dose-escalation
      dosimetry study and will receive a single intravenous (IV) dose of 11.1 Megabecquerel (MBq)
      (0.3 millicuries (mCi); n = 1), 37 MBq (1 mCi; n = 1) or 74 MBq (2 mCi; n = 1) of 124I-p5+14
      Injection for the purpose of determining estimates of organ-associated and whole body
      radioactive dosimetry. Thereafter, the trial will be opened to include another 40 patients
      who will be administered a single IV bolus injection of 124I-p5+14 Injection at a dose, to be
      determined in Part 1 of the study, based on the dosimetry data. Likely, 2 mCi will be used.
      Every patient participating will receive < 2 mg of peptide p5+14
