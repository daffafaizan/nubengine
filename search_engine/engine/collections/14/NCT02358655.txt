      retrospective chart review of all patients who presented to the emergency department (ED)
      with ECG documented AF during 1 year prior to study commencement. The main purpose of Phase 1
      is to determine if oral anticoagulants (OACs) were prescribed for eligible AF patients at ED
      discharge. In Phase 2 a low-intensity intervention will be applied in the ED during 6 months,
      involving physician education, distribution of an AF patient education package, short-term
      OAC prescription, and a follow-up letter to the patient's family physician. After a one month
      transition phase, a high intensity intervention will be applied during 6 months in Phase 3.
      Phase 3 incorporates the Phase 2 intervention, and adds immediate follow-up (within 48-72
      hours) in a community AF clinic run by a nurse/pharmacist who is supervised by a specialist
      in AF.
