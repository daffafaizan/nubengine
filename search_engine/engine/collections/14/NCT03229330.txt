    
      There are several therapeutics with different mechanisms of action to reach tissue repair.

      The conventional treatment of venous ulcers is based on the alternation of exercising the
      lower extremities with resting, the application of topical treatments associated with
      compressive therapy, and the use of medications.

      Despite the diversity of bandages available, there are still lesions with difficult prolonged
      healing process. Therefore, Low-level Light Therapy has been used as an adjuvant
      technological alternative therapy, due to its photochemical effects on the tissues, such as
      the modulation of inflammation, increase of granulation tissue, contraction of the wound,
      reduction of the inflammatory process, and reduction of pain. This therapy contributes to
      accelerate and improve the tissue repair process.

      Studies assessed by Nursing Outcomes Classification about the usage of the treatments above
      combined are not available. Consequently, more robust clinical studies over venous ulcers to
      evaluate the tissue repair must be proposed using reliable instruments.
