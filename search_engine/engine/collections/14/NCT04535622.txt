      hole or retinal detachment are going to be randomly assigned into two groups; exercise group
      and control group. All patients are going be admitted to the hospital prior to the surgery.
      After the surgery is done, the patients are going to maintain a face-down position in the
      ward until postoperative day 3. After returning to the ward after surgery and completed the
      pain scoring forms, exercise training is going to be conducted for patients assigned to the
      exercise group by a physical therapist. Three times of daily self-exercise sessions are going
      to be performed according to the training provided to the patients. Pain score will be
      measured on the first, second and the third postoperative days. Patients will be discharged
      on the third postoperative days.
