      evaluate the uterine cavity and to diagnose different intrauterine diseases. It is a safe,
      convenient and cost-effective procedure in aiding the management of abnormal uterine
      bleeding. However, outpatient hysteroscopy can be associated with significant pain which
      would have impact on the woman's satisfaction and pain is one of the most common reasons for
      failure of the procedure.

      Listening to music could be an easy and non-invasive way to reduce pain. A meta-analysis
      conducted on the effects of music on pain revealed that music interventions had statistically
      significant effects in decreasing pain on 0-10 pain scales. Researches on this topic in
      gynaecological office procedures, however, showed variation in the results. Some showed no
      positive effect of music on patient's level of pain, anxiety or satisfaction of patient or
      doctor for office hysteroscopy and colposcopy. On the other hand, some studies showed a
      positive effect of the use of music with a reduction of pain and anxiety during office
      hysteroscopy.
