      immunocompromised children. Many of the drugs used for fungal prophylaxis have been
      associated with renal and hepatic toxicity. Also, breakthrough infections have been reported
      with the use of some of the oral agents due to poor oral absorption. An alternative approach
      is the use of intravenous micafungin for fungal prophylaxis. Micafungin has a distinct
      advantage due to its better safety profile, specifically in terms of hepatic and renal
      toxicity. Currently, children who receive micafungin are given daily or alternate day dosing
      (based on their last Pk study, Mehta et al 2010). The investigators objective is to examine
      the pharmacokinetics of micafungin when it is given on a less frequent schedule. The
      investigators hypothesize that a single dose of micafungin (at 5mg/kg) every 4 days will
      provide drug exposure equivalent to daily dosing (at 1mg/kg) while reducing administration
      costs and improving patient convenience (with essentially twice a week dosing regimen). Both
      animal and adult data support the use of this approach. Fifteen patients will be enrolled on
      this study and will be given a SINGLE DOSE of micafungin antifungal prophylaxis (5 mg/kg).
      Blood samples will be drawn for pharmacokinetic measurements after administration of
      micafungin. Plasma concentration data will be analyzed by compartmental and non-compartmental
      pharmacokinetic analysis. The data will also be analyzed by a population pharmacokinetic
      approach.
