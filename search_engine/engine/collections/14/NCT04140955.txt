      Preoperative opioid-use is one of the strongest predictors for not tapering off opioids after
      discharge from surgery. In qualitative studies on chronic opioid use, patients call for
      further help and assistance in tapering opioids. The aim of this study is to investigate the
      effect of receiving a tapering plan at discharge and telephone counselling one week after
      discharge on short and long-term opioid-use in preoperative opioid-users who undergo
      scheduled spine surgery.

      Methods:

      One-hundred and ten adult patients scheduled for spine surgery will be included in an
      investigator-initiated, prospective, randomized, controlled trial with two arms: an
      intervention arm (receiving tapering plan at discharge and telephone counselling on opioid
      tapering 5-7 days after discharge) or a control arm (receiving no tapering plan or telephone
      counselling). The study is approved by the Danish Data Protection Agency (1-16-02-211-19) and
      the Central Denmark Region Committees on Health Research Ethics (1-10-72-138-19).

      Hypothesis:

      Our primary hypothesis is that a tapering plan and telephone counselling reduces the
      percentage of patients who exceed their preoperative opioid consumption from 25% to 5% one
      month after discharge.
