      Inflammation and primary mechanical derangements are thought to be the two major causes
      leading to low back pain (LBP) syndromes. Increasing evidence suggests that cytokines and
      hormones, including IFN-gamma, IL-17, IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, MMP10, NGF, PGE2, NO and
      IL-8, play critical roles in the pathogenesis of inflammatory LBP. This study will
      investigate the effect of acupuncture on LBP by measuring serum cytokine and hormone levels
      before and after treatment in participants. To define the molecular mechanism by which
      acupuncture affects LBP, histone modification, including H3K4me3 and H3K27me3, as well as
      methylation patterns of CpG islands on the promoters of selected genes in the peripheral
      CD4(plus) T cells will be also tested.

      Study Population:

      Five participants with chronic LBP will receive treatment.

      Design:

      In this non-randomized, single group pilot study, participants will be given sham acupuncture
      and subsequently treated with acupuncture for a total of eight visits over the span of 17
      days. Blood will be drawn and analyzed at scheduled intervals.

      Outcome Measure:

      The primary outcome is to investigate the potential effect of acupuncture treatment, as
      compared to sham acupuncture and quiet relaxation, on the regulation of IFN-gamma and IL-17
      in participants with LBP, including the serum level of these two cytokines, frequency of
      CD4(plus)IFN-gamma(plus) and CD4(plus)IL-17(plus) cells in the peripheral blood, and the
      patterns of H3K4me3, H3K27me3 and DNA methylation on their promoters in CD4(plus) T cells in
      response to acupuncture treatment. Secondary outcomes investigate the effects of acupuncture,
      as compared to sham acupuncture and quiet relaxation, on the following outcome measures:
      level of serum cytokines and hormones, including IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, MMP10, NGF, PGE2, NO,
      IL-8, IL-6, TGF-beta, IL-10, IL-22, IL-23 and IL-17F before and after acupuncture treatment;
      genome-wide gene expression profile of CD4(plus) T cells before and after acupuncture
      treatment; genome-wide patterns of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 modification in CD4(plus) T cells
      before and after acupuncture treatment; genome-wide patterns of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3
      modification in CD4(plus)T cells before and after acupuncture treatment; DNA methylation
      status change of selected CpG islands before and after acupuncture treatment; and the
      severity of LBP before and after two weeks of acupuncture treatment according to the Brief
      Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-SF) for pain severity, as well as the Randall Morris
      Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) for LBP-related interference scores.
