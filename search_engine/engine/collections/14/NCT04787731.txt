    
      This is a double-blind randomized controlled single-site trial. We aim to recruit 100
      subject, with an anticipated dropout rate of 20%; our goal is to enroll 40 subjects in each
      study arm based on the power analysis described in data analysis section as well as general
      feasibility for recruitment, and the ability to complete the study in within one year.

      After screening for eligibility based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria listed below,
      and after preoperative data collection, in the experimental arm, inferior alveolar nerve
      block (IANB) will be administered 0.5% bupivacaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine whereas in the
      control arm, IANB will be administered 2% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine for a
      standardized pulpectomy/endodontic debridement treatment as the 1st visit endodontic
      treatment for subjects with preoperative pain. Postoperative oral health related quality of
      life questionnaire (OHIP-14) responses at day 1 and 5 as well as 5-day postoperative pain
      intensity questionnaire will be collected remotely. In this way, we will be able to compare
      OHQoL change as well as postoperative pain resolution, pain medication use and postoperative
      soft tissue anesthesia reported by the patient in two study arms.
