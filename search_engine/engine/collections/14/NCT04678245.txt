      adult advisors. Peer Leaders learn skills and implement school-wide prevention campaigns
      informed by communication science.New York State has provided funds to support schools to
      implement ATI-V but no funds for efficacy research. With support from New York State and a
      strong team of investigators, our project has two aims:

      Aim 1. Efficacy. The primary aim of this study is to determine ATI-V impact in preventing
      vaping use (past 30 days any vaping, nicotine vaping, and regular use). Using an RCT design,
      20 schools will be assigned to (a) immediate ATI-V, or (b) wait-list for ATI-V training after
      24 months. Approximately 3,800 8th graders will be enrolled and followed for assessments in
      fall 8th grade, spring 8th grade, spring 9th grade, and mid-year 10th grade. We will test for
      which students ATI-V is most effective and in what school contexts (school climate).

      Aim 2. Mechanism. The second aim of this study to test the hypothesized mechanisms of ATI-V
      impact. To accomplish this aim we will conduct statistical analyses of a mediation model to
      determine (a) whether ATI-V improves students' perceptions that vaping is unacceptable to
      their peers (anti-vaping norms), connections to supportive adults to address EVP concerns,
      and social influence of non-vaping students; and (b) whether the impact of ATI-V on reduced
      vaping behavior is mediated by these improvements.
