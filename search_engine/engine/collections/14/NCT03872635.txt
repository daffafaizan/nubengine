    
      Fifty-one patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radical hysterectomy with
      bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection were randomized to receive 300mL of an oral
      carbohydrate liquid supplement 2 hour before surgery(CHO group) or to fast on standard
      hospital protocol (8 hour fasting for solid and 4 hour fasting for clear liquid)(FAST
      group).According to inclusion and exclusion standards, twenty-six patients undergoing the
      same surgery and standard fasting were selected as control group. Baseline and postoperative
      measurements of insulin sensitivity were assessed in term of fasting plasma
      glucose(FPG),fastingainsulin(FINS),HOMA-insulinaresistance(HOMA-IR),HOMA-insulin secretion
      function index(HOMA-IX) , HOMA-beta cell function index(HOMA-Î²),serum C-peptide and
      glucagon.Baseline and postoperative measurements of tumor immunity were evaluated using NK
      cell and T-cell dynamics.VAS score was introduced to assess preoperative comfort.
