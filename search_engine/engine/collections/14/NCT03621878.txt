      radiculopathy patients with peripheral sensitization, were divided into one of the three
      groups: slider, tensioner, and control. The primary outcome measurements were visual analog
      scale (VAS) for pain, hip range of motion (ROM) during SLR test, and knee flexion ROM during
      slump test. The measurements were taken at baseline, after 1st, 3rd, and 6th session.

      Statistical Analysis: A two-way mixed design analysis of variance (MANOVA) with post-hoc
      (Bonferonni Correction) was used to calculate the differences with Time (baseline,
      1st,3rd,6th sessions) as a within-group factor and Group (control, slider, and tensioner) as
      a between-group factor. The effect size was calculated with Cohen's d. Pearson's correlation
      was used for correlation analysis.
