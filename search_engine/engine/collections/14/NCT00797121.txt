      cholangiocarcinoma. Surgeons from Japan tend to perform PTBD(Percutaneous Transhepatic
      Biliary Drainage) before a definite operation until the total bilirubin(TB) lower than
      85μmol/L. For some patients needed to perform extended curative resection, PVE(Portal Vein
      Embolization) is performed and thus the duration of PBD may be around six weeks and the final
      TB is lower than 34μmol/L. Some tend to perform a definite curative operation in a short time
      after diagnosis. There is no RCT research on the effect of PBD for the resectable Hilar
      Cholangiocarcinoma patients to date.
