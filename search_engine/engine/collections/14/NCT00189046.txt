      complex task requiring mental alertness and a variety of cognitive functions such as
      perception, attention, learning, memory and decision making.Several studies have demonstrated
      cognitive impairments on laboratory tasks in patients with chronic pain, particularly on
      measures assessing attentional capacity, processing speed and psychomotor speed. These
      findings suggest that car driving performance might be impaired, and that chronic pain
      patients may therefore have an increased traffic accident risk. Unfortunately, no studies
      have investigated the impact of chronic pain on actual driving ability. The present study was
      designed to investigate the effects of chronic pain on actual driving performance during
      normal traffic. In addition to the on-the-road driving test, psychomotor, and memory tests
      measuring driving-related skills were conducted in the laboratory. Moreover, effects of pain
      on an attentional capacity test were tested using event-related potentials.
