      heart disease, especially after Fontan operation with univentricular physiology. Mild
      increase of pulmonary vascular resistance may lead to failure of Fontan circulation.
      Remodulin® has been approved for the treatment of adults with PH, but little is known about
      the effects in children with PH after Fontan operation. The study aim is to determine the
      safety and efficiency of Remodulin® to reduce the pulmonary arterial pressure and prevent PH
      in children after Fontan operation. Meanwhile pharmacokinetics of the drug were checked with
      or without the peritoneal dialysis.
