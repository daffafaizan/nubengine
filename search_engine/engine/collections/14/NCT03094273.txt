      Nevi (DN) with a defined 2 mm margin. This is a non-interventional study that will observe
      the pathology results following a standard of care biopsy. Principal Investigator (PI)
      hypothesize that the majority of lesions removed with this technique will have margins free
      of nevus cells on examination of histopathological sections. Hence, pathologists will not
      suggest that an additional excision be performed to remove any residual nevus. PI also
      hypothesize that if biopsy sites are followed over time, the rate of nevus recurrence will be
      low, because investigators would have removed the majority, if not all of the lesion at the
      time of initial biopsy.
