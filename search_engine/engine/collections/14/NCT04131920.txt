    
      This is a study in 3 phases that will assess the feasibility and utility of handheld home
      ultrasound (HHUS) in a patient's home to assess whether a painful episode in the elbow, knee
      or ankle is a bleed or not.

      Phase 1 will assess whether 10 subjects with severe hemophilia A can be trained to use HHUS
      in clinic to identify basic joint structures of the elbow, knee and ankle. It will then
      assess whether these subjects can identify these structures at home and transmit the images
      life via tele-ultrasound.

      Phase 2 will assess whether the determination of "bleed" vs. "non-bleed" made at home via
      HHUS can be confirmed/validated with a standard high resolution ultrasound machine in clinic.

      Phase 3 will then utilize HHUS during the EmiMSKUS study over 3 years to more objectively
      identify patient reported bleeding during the study.
