    
      Anlotinib is a new, orally administered tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets vascular
      endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR),
      platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFR), and c-kit. Toripalimab is a humanized
      immunoglobulin (Ig) G4 monoclonal antibody directed against the negative immunoregulatory
      human cell surface receptor programmed cell death 1 (programmed death-1; PD-1), with
      potential immune checkpoint inhibitory and antineoplastic activities. In the present study,
      we design a single-arm, single center Phase II trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      the combination of Anlotinib wiht Toripalimab in advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal
      junction cancer as first-line treatment.
