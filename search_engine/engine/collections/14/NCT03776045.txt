      advanced and metastatic prostate cancer. However, it is associated with many side effects
      such as increased fat mass and reduced skeletal muscle mass, cardiorespiratory fitness and
      metabolic health. Ultimately, these negative changes induced by ADT contribute to reduced
      health-related quality of life (HRQoL). This study evaluates whether 3-months of exercise can
      mitigate treatment toxicity in prostate cancer patients initiating ADT.

      In a parallel groups, prospective, randomised controlled design, participants were randomly
      allocated to a standard care control group or standard care plus exercise group. The exercise
      group completed 3-months of combined aerobic and resistance training. The standard care group
      did not receive any supervised exercise or specific physical activity recommendations.
      Outcomes were assessed at baseline, 3-month (post-intervention), and 6-month (follow-up)
      endpoints.
