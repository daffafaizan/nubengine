           will help to overcome the observed resistance to durvalumab and other PD1/PD-L1
           checkpoint inhibitors.

        -  Primary objectives To evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single intravenous
           injection of VCN-01 combined with durvalumab in two administration regimens (concomitant
           or durvalumab starting two weeks later "sequential schedule"), and to determine the
           recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of the combination.

        -  Study design This is a phase I trial, multicenter, open label, and dose escalation
           study. Patients will be entered at each dose level, according to a planned dose
           escalation schedule. Absence of unacceptable toxicity at the previous dose is required
           for entering a patient in the subsequent level.

        -  Number of Centers: up to 3

        -  Number of Patients: 15-20 patients

        -  Study Population: Patients with metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck
           who have progressed during or after treatment with immune-checkpoint inhibitors.
