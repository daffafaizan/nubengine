      pathophysiology. Infusions of PACAP38 can trigger migraine-like attacks in migraine patients.
      PACAP38 also induces flushing which may imitate rosacea-like flushing. We are investigating
      whether the flushing after PACAP38 resembles rosacea-like flushing, and whether treatment
      with sumatriptan has an effect on the headache and flushing effects of PACAP38.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate PACAP38-induced headache and flushing in patients
      with rosacea who have been treated with either sumatriptan or placebo using purpose-developed
      standardized interview. The investigators will use a double-blind, placebo-controlled
      crossover study design to investigate this.
