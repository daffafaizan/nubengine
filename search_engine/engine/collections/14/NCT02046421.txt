    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of
      mifepristone when given in combination with carboplatin and gemcitabine (gemcitabine
      hydrochloride).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of mifepristone in combination with carboplatin
      and gemcitabine.

      II. To describe the toxicities seen with carboplatin, gemcitabine, and mifepristone
      combination therapy.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To correlate expression of biomarkers (e.g. glucocorticoid receptor [GR], androgen
      receptor [AR], estrogen receptor [ER], and progesterone receptor [PR]) with treatment
      outcomes.

      II. To correlate serum and intratumoral mifepristone concentrations after two doses of
      mifepristone (in patients with easily accessible tumor who consent to an optional research
      biopsy).

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of mifepristone.

      Patients receive mifepristone orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 0, 1, 7, and 8, and
      carboplatin intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes and gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30-60
      minutes on days 1 and 8. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 18 months.
