      anesthesia for caesarean section" aims to introduce in other indications for rapid induction
      of general anesthesia common and safe, alternative method of combining short-acting
      intravenous anesthetics propofol and fast-onset non-depolarizing muscle relaxant rocuronium
      into the clinical practice and demonstrate the efficacy and safety in this indication. At the
      same time to demonstrate the benefits of using modern reversal of neuromuscular blockade by
      sugammadex in termination the caesarean section under general anesthesia. Both procedures
      will be monitored by clinical observation, monitoring instrumentation and laboratory
      examination of mother and fetus (newborn) in various stages of peripartal period. The main
      benefit of this procedure will be in particular risk groups of mothers which are indicated by
      Caesarean Section while neuraxial blockade is contraindicated.
