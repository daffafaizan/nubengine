      designed to evaluate the effects of oritavancin in patients with Opioid Use Disorder and/or
      Intravenous Drug Use and systemic S. aureus infections. In this study systemic infections
      refers to bacteremia or Infectious Endocarditis. Participants who meet inclusion and
      exclusion criteria will receive a single 1200mg infusion of oritavancin to complete 4 weeks
      of antibiotic therapy (including the inpatient phase) for isolated bacteremia and 6 weeks for
      IE. Participants will be evaluated weekly until completion of treatment and then at week 4
      and week 6 after the infusion of oritavancin. Participants will have blood drawn at each
      visit to monitor for toxicity and pharmacokinetics and will be evaluated clinically and by
      culture for the presence of relapse of the infection. At the last visit, participants will
      have an echocardiogram.
