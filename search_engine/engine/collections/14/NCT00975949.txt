      mortality. Mortality in infected infants < 1000 grams is between 26-66% and
      neurodevelopmental impairment occurs in 57%.1-13 Between 1998-2000 we conducted a randomized
      placebo controlled trial of fluconazole prophylaxis in 100 infants <1000 grams at
      birth(IRB-HSR #9389). Invasive fungal infections occurred in none of the fluconazole-treated
      patients compared to 20% of the placebo group. Following this study the efficacy has been
      confirmed in a multicenter randomized controlled trial and 7 retrospective studies. One major
      issue that has remained is whether the fluconazole-treated infants have better
      neurodevelopmental outcomes as well as if it is safe without an increase in
      neurodevelopmental impairment.

      Neurodevelopmental outcomes can be assessed by testing and examinations or by parental and
      child questionnaires. In addition, quality of life is an important context of outcomes.
      Recent conceptualizations of quality of life recognize the multidimensional nature of quality
      of life, including psychological and social functioning, consistent with the World Health
      Organization's definition of health as "not only the absence of disease and infirmity, but
      the presence of physical, mental, and social well-being." The World Health Organization
      subsequently emphasized the growing consensus that quality of life is a subjective
      experience, defined as "individuals' perceptions of their position in life in the context of
      the culture and value systems in which they live, and in relation to their goals,
      expectations, standards, and concerns."

      To address these issues, we aim to study and compare the neurodevelopmental outcome and
      quality of life between our fluconazole-treated and placebo-treated patients in our initial
      study
