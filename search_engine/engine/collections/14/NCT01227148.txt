      cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF-Î±), interleukin (IL)-1, and IL-6 which may be
      important mediators of insulin resistance and results in hyperglycemia. Altered glucose
      metabolism was caused by release of counter regulatory hormones such as glucagons;
      epinephrine and cortisol oppose the normal action of insulin, leading to an increase in
      skeletal muscle proteolysis. It did not know whether tightly glucose control had beneficial
      effect in urinary nitrogen excretion and nitrogen balance.
