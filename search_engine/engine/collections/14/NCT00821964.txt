      I. To evaluate the safety of chemoimmunotherapy with topical imiquimod and Abraxane in breast
      cancer patients with recurrent chest wall disease or cutaneous metastasis.

      II. To evaluate the anti-tumor effects of chemoimmunotherapy with topical imiquimod and
      Abraxane in breast cancer patients with recurrent chest wall disease or cutaneous metastasis.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To examine whether treatment with chemoimmunotherapy consisting of topical imiquimod and
      Abraxane augments endogenous tumor specific immunity.

      II. To assess the effect of chemoimmunotherapy on circulating transforming growth factor
      (TGF)-beta levels.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive Abraxane intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 and apply
      topical imiquimod to cutaneous lesions once daily (QD) on days 1-4, 8-11, 15-18, and 22-25.
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 3 cycles in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1, 4, 8, and 12 weeks.
