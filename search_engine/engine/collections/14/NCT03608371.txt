      approximate 28-day screening period. The study will consist of 4 sequential, ascending dose
      cohorts of 8 subjects each with a 6:2 randomization to BTRX-246040 or placebo. The planned
      dosing for each cohort will be 40, 80,120 and 160 mg. After enrollment of the first cohort
      has been completed, doses for subsequent cohorts may be modified based on review of the
      available data (safety, tolerability, efficacy, and PK) by an unblinded Dosing Review
      Committee (DRC). A similar review and determination of dosing for the subsequent cohort will
      be performed after completion of each cohort and based on all data available from previous
      cohorts.

      Subjects who meet entry criteria assessed at the screening visit (up to 28 days prior to Day
      1) will present to the clinic on the morning of Day 1 (treatment day) in the practically
      defined OFF state (having withheld anti-parkinsonian medications after 10:00 PM the evening
      prior). Subjects will be dosed with study drug and remain on site for an 8-hour observation
      period with UPDRS Part III motor response, dyskinesia rating and ON/OFF status assessed
      pre-dose, every 30 minutes for 4 hours post-dose, and then hourly for 4 additional post-dose
      hours (i.e., 8 hours total post-dose) prior to being discharged. Blood for pharmacokinetics
      will be collected 6 times at scheduled intervals within the 8-hour observation period. A
      follow-up safety visit is scheduled 7 days later.
