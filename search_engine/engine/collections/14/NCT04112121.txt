      an intervention by a chaplain. A passage from the Bible was read to the participants during a
      meeting with the chaplain at the bedside, or in the chapel of the hospital. No meeting
      occurred in the randomized control group, which was compiled in a way to get a group of
      participants with an approximatively similar pattern of diagnoses and treatment days than the
      intervention groups. The pace of enrollment was deliberately slow in order to assure the
      authenticity of the visits ("slow science"). Blood samples were taken 30 minutes prior, and
      60 minutes after the meeting to measure White Blood Cell (WBC)-, lymphocyte counts,
      interferon gamma (IFN-Î³)-, immunoglobulin M (IgM)-, immunoglobulin A (IgA)-, immunoglobulin G
      (IgG)-, and complement C3 levels. A subgroup of the visited participants was subjected to
      functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), where they were played an audiotape of readings
      of the same passage from the Bible. Associative tests, paired-samples t-test, network
      analysis was performed to search for any correlation between psychological and immunological
      parameters, completed with Statistical Parametric Mapping to search for correlations of the
      above with neurological parameters.
