      workers " The National Administration of Medicines, Food and Medical Technology authorized
      two emergency vaccines for administration, Sputnik V and Sinopharm vaccine. It is important
      to evaluate immunogenicity and its correlation with the long-term efficacy and safety profile
      of this vaccines.

      Objectives: To determine the variation in the levels of Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies in
      health workers who received a COVID-19 vaccine between the time before the first dose, and
      after 1 month, 6 months and 12 months after the completion of the immunization, depending on
      whether they have received the Sputnik V vaccine or the Sinopharm vaccine, and correlate the

      Methodology: Design: observational and analytical study of a prospective cohort of healthcare
      workers immunized with some COVID-19 vaccine. The presence of IgG will be determined
      qualitatively and quantitatively. The immunoglobulin G titer in each period will be compared
      globally and according to the type of vaccine administered.
