      high-doses of inhaled asthma medications. This difficult-to-treat group accounts for more
      than 50% of asthma related healthcare visits and hospitalizations. The purpose of this study
      is to see if a medicine called Cysteamine, given along with standard asthma care, will
      improve asthma symptoms and lung function.

      This study is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial of cysteamine. A placebo
      arm will be included to determine the comparative effectiveness of cysteamine in this
      population. Eligible participants will be assessed 1, 4 and 8 weeks post randomization and
      followed for an additional 4 weeks post treatment.

      In order to enroll in this study, participants must be between the ages of 18-45 and have
      uncontrolled asthma.

      This study will include 4 visits and weekly phone calls, and will be in the study for 3-4
      months.

      During the treatment period, participants will be placed in one of two treatment groups:

        -  Cysteamine

        -  Placebo

      Participants will not be able to choose which group they are assigned. This assignment is
      random and by chance, much like flipping a coin. Participants will not know if they are
      receiving Cysteamine or placebo. Investigators will compare the study results between the
      participants of each group.
