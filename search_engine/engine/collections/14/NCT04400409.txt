    
      Patients with PAD and elevated LDL-C who are cared for at the University of Colorado (UC) and
      who provide consent will be randomized 1:1 to Intervention A, a vascular care team approach
      including pharmacy and healthcare provider assistance with medication adherence, versus
      Intervention B consisting of standard care augmented with a single consultation with a
      Vascular Medicine physician who will provide the treating doctor with a personalized risk
      assessment for the patient and a summary of the 2018 American College of Cardiology
      (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) Guideline on Management of Blood. In order to
      investigate the efficacy of the CPC Endpoint Quality Intervention Program (EQuIP), subjects
      will additionally be randomized 1:1 to an investigative site conducted Six-Minute Walk Test
      or an EQuIP team led Six-Minute Walk Test. Quality of Life data will be collected from all
      subjects. There will also be an observational cohort (registry) to understand current
      practice patterns and outcomes in a non-interventional PAD population within the UC Health
      system in order to assess the potential impact of Intervention A after conclusion of the
      randomized study.
