      for fetal structural abnormalities at the first trimester are indeed possible. First
      trimester ultrasound scans are important and essential for detecting fetal structural
      anomalies, and they help provide optimized early antenatal management. However, ultrasound
      scans, during this period, are more difficult than routine mid-trimester ultrasound scans, as
      fetal organs are small and experienced operators are needed to use the transducer to obtain
      informative pictures. Practice guidelines for first trimester fetal ultrasound scans have
      been provided by the International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology (ISUOG)
      since 2013. Since then, the percentage of complete scans and the high detection rate of fetal
      structural abnormalities during first trimester ultrasound scans have been reported. From our
      perspective, ultrasound operators who have different experiences in mid-trimester ultrasound
      scanning might have equal ability to complete first trimester ultrasound scans using the
      ISUOG guidelines. The objective of this study is to compare the rate of completed scans
      regarding fetal structures at the first trimester ultrasound scan between two different
      levels of proficiency operators.
