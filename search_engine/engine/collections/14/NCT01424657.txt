      controversial. Both magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography(MRCP)and endoscopic
      retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) are used interchangeably in practice, with little
      literature to support the efficacy of one versus the other.

      The purpose is to assess the effectiveness of MRCP compared to ERCP in the initial work-up of
      patients at intermediate risk of suspected biliary obstruction following initial clinical
      assessment and ultrasonography.

      A randomized medical effectiveness study was conducted across three tertiary care hospital
      sites. Patients at intermediate risk of biliary obstruction were randomized to either ERCP or
      MRCP based on level of obstruction as seen by ultrasound (US).
