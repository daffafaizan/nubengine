    
      This is a crossover study assessing the immediate physiological effects of SIMEOX and a PEP
      device on the exhalation phase in healthy subjects and patients with COPD.

      Participants will perform (1) a slow vital capacity, (2) a maximal expiration from total lung
      capacity to residual volume with SIMEOX, (3) a maximal expiration from total lung capacity to
      residual volume with a PEP device.
