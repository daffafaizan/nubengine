      training or a combined strength and aerobic training group. Participants in the exercise
      group will attend exercise sessions over the course of 9 months at the YMCA. Participants
      will have opportunities to engage in other activities such as educational run-in visits that
      will allow for measurement of hemoglobin A1c and emphasize the importance of exercise in
      improving Type 2 diabetes.
