      spirituality a valuable resource for coping with the existential dimension of the diagnosis.
      This is an exploratory pilot study which examines reading as a contemplative practice to
      assist these women as they attempt to come to terms with the life altering aspects of living
      with the diagnosis. In this intervention, that we call Deep Reading, up to 15 participants
      will engage in six weekly sessions approximately sixty to ninety minutes in length in which
      they will receive instruction on aspects of Deep Reading, practice Deep Reading and process
      the experience. Between group sessions participants will be asked to practice Deep Reading on
      their own and be paired for mutual support and encouragement. For convenience participants
      will be recruited from among those already enrolled in NICHD Protocol, Ovarian Follicle
      Function in Patients with Primary Ovarian Insufficiency (91-CH-0127). We will use the
      FACIT-Sp and satisfaction questionnaires to measure participant response and feasibility for
      future study.
