      finish line on gingival position, bleeding on probing and marginal adaptation.

      Gingival bleeding on probing will be evaluated before treatment. Preparation for all ceramic
      full coverage restoration will be performed according to manufacturer instructions by one
      operator. Type of finish line (whether feather edge or deep chamfer finish line) will be
      selected randomly according to a computer generated randomization list. Restorative margins
      will be placed subgingivally. Zirconia crowns will be fabricated for the prepared teeth and
      cemented using resin luting agent. At 6 months and 12 months after the cementation,
      restorative margin position relative to the gingival margin will be recorded. Bleeding on
      probing and marginal adaptation will also be recorded.
