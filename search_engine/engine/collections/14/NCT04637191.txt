      20 years old, literate, of both genders and candidate for surgery under general anesthesia in
      the Hospital das Clínicas of the Faculty of Medicine, University of São Paulo. Reliability
      MentalPlus® analysis will be performed as the first part of the study with healthy
      volunteers. Later, in another study phase, we will include volunteers to assess cognitive
      functions, like memory, attention, and executive functions, using a usual psychological test
      battery. We will compare the psychological test battery results with MentalPlus® video game
      scores. The MentalPlus® digital game will be applied to all study phases. In a third project,
      we will use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to assess the association between
      brain response and cognitive training by MentalPlus®. The main purpose is to have a new tool
      that can provide health professionals, including anesthesiologists and surgeons with a fun
      and practical way to evaluate cognition.
