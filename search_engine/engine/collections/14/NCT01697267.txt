      x 4 and glucocorticoids.

      Those patients that achieve disease control (BVAS/WG ≤ 1 and daily prednisone dose ≤ 10 mg)
      by month 4 will be randomised to the rituximab or control remission maintenance groups.

      Treatment is protocolised for the entire duration of the study, until the common close date,
      when the final patient recruited has completed 36 months within the study or until the
      patient has completed 48 months on study whichever the sooner. Patients in the rituximab arm
      will receive treatment until month 20, and those in the azathioprine arm until month 27.
