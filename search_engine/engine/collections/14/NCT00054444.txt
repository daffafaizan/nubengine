      I. Determine the safety and tolerability of pelvic radiotherapy, cisplatin, and topotecan in
      patients with locally advanced cervical cancer.

      II. Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of topotecan when administered in this regimen
      in this patient population.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the site of recurrence (local vs distant) in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of topotecan.

      Patients undergo radiotherapy 5 days a week for 6 weeks. Patients receive cisplatin IV and
      topotecan IV over 30 minutes once weekly for a total of 6 weeks in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of topotecan until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which 1 of 6 patients experiences
      dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, an additional cohort of 20 patients
      receives treatment as above at the MTD.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 5 years.
