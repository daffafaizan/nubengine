      Primary

        -  To compare the progression-free survival (PFS) of patients with relapsed or refractory
           indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma treated with fludarabine phosphate and rituximab with vs
           without pixantrone.

      Secondary

        -  To compare the overall objective response rate (complete response [CR], unconfirmed
           complete response [CRu], and partial response [PR]) in these patients.

        -  To compare the CR and CRu rate in these patients.

        -  To compare the duration of response and time to progression in these patients.

        -  To compare the overall survival and disease-specific survival of these patients.

        -  To compare the safety (including cardiac safety) and tolerability of these regimens in
           these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified by Follicular Lymphoma
      International Prognostic Index (FLIPI) score (0 or 1 vs â‰¥ 2), number of prior treatments (1
      or 2 vs > 2), and prior anti-CD20 regimen (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2
      treatment arms.

        -  Arm I (control): Patients receive rituximab IV on day 1 and fludarabine phosphate IV on
           days 2-4. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses* in the absence of
           unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive rituximab and fludarabine phosphate as in arm I. Patients also
           receive pixantrone IV on day 2. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses* in
           the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

      NOTE: *Only patients achieving complete response, unconfirmed complete response, or partial
      response after 4 courses receive courses 5 and 6.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically for up to 5 years.
