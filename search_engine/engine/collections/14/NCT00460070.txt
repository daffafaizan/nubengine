      compared them with a control group. Here we have found that levetiracetam has a probable
      effect on the ovaries, since the treated animals had larger ovaries, fewer cysts, more
      corpora lutea and more secondary follicles than the untreated animals (Taubøll et al 2004).
      Blood tests on the animals showed that those treated with levetiracetam had higher
      testosterone levels and lower levels of estrogen and FSH, whilst LH and progesterone levels
      were unaffected by the treatment (Svalheim et al, 2005a, b). Studies on cell cultures from
      pig ovaries, as carried out by our group in collaboration with Jagiellonian University,
      Krakow, Poland, appeared to support these findings (Taubøll et al. 2006, submitted).

      Our wish therefore now is to study fertile men and women in order to look for any changes in
      the balance of sex hormones during use of levetiracetam in order to establish whether the
      findings in animal trials are clinically relevant to humans.
