    
      This is an 18-week, open-label, flexible-dose "proof of concept" trial where women with a
      diagnosis of vestibulodynia will be evaluated at baseline for eligibility. Eligible patients
      will be openly treated with 200 mg/d milnacipran (or the maximum tolerated dose) for a total
      of 12 weeks. The study design involves 4 phases: screening and washout, baseline assessment,
      dose escalation, and stable-dose phase (Figure 1). After completing a 2-week washout of
      prohibited medications, patients will enter a 2-week baseline period, where they will be
      trained in the use of daily diaries and the tampon test, and baseline safety and efficacy
      data will be recorded. Patients who continue to meet the eligibility criteria at the end of
      the baseline period will begin a 6-week period of dose escalation. All patients will be
      scheduled to receive a total of 12 weeks of stable dose treatment after the 6-week
      dose-escalation period for a total of 18 weeks of drug exposure.
