    
      This is a pediatric open-label Phase II clinical trial to assess the efficacy of a
      hematopoietic gene therapy consisting of autologous CD34+ enriched cells transduced with a
      lentiviral vector carrying the FANCA gene in pediatric subjects with FA-A.

      Enriched CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells will be transduced ex vivo with the therapeutic
      lentiviral vector and infused via intravenous infusion following transduction without any
      prior conditioning.
