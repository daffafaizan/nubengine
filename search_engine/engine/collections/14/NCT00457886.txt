      June 2003 demonstrated a 33% reduction in the rate of preterm delivery in patients with a
      previous history of preterm delivery who then used weekly 17-P injections in the subsequent
      pregnancy.

      This is a milestone in the prevention of preterm delivery and is the reason you have chosen
      to receive treatment with 17-P.

      However, how 17-P works to prevent preterm delivery is unclear. Knowledge of the mechanism of
      action of 17-P would help in selecting patients for treatment and may be useful in monitoring
      the efficacy of therapy.

      Studies have suggested that the timing of delivery depends on a type of placental clock,
      affected by levels of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and progesterone (P).

      CRH can be thought to act as an accelerator, and P as a brake. Serial injections of 17-P
      beginning in the second trimester of pregnancy may prevent preterm delivery by maintaining
      progesterone dominance, and be reflected in increased levels of progesterone and/or 17-P, or
      decreased levels of cortisol and/or CRH. These are the hormones that will be measured in this
      study.

      Results of the study will be important whatever the outcome. If there is no measurable change
      in the hormones measured, this is important to know and investigation of other markers can be
      pursued. If there is a measurable change in the hormones measured, then this pilot study
      could serve to support a larger more definitive study, which could lead to very valuable
      information relating to the practical use of 17-P for the prevention of preterm delivery.
