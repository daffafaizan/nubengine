      advanced non-small cell lung cancers who failed to standard therapy.

      The investigators previously identified three novel HLA-A*2402-restricted epitope peptides,
      which were derived from three cancer-testis antigens, as targets for cancer vaccination
      against lung cancer. In this phase II trial, we examine using a combination of these three
      peptides the safety, immunogenicity, and antitumor effect of vaccine treatment for
      HLA-A*2402-positive advanced small cell lung cancer patients who failed to standard therapy.
