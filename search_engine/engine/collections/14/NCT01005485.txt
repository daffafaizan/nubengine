      risk for catastrophic vascular events including acute myocardial infarction (heart attack)
      and stroke. We seek to accelerate scientific discovery through clinically meaningful,
      innovative translational research, and are collaborating in a trans-disciplinary effort to
      define the DNA sequence of CECs and that of germ line DNA, along with RNA sequencing, mRNA
      expression profiling, and ultrastructural characterization of CECs in order to better
      understand the mechanisms leading to acute arterial plaque rupture and embolization of
      arterial endothelial cells in patients with acute myocardial infarction. This will enable us
      to create a molecular fingerprint that could identify and preempt individuals from suffering
      from such debilitating vascular conditions.
