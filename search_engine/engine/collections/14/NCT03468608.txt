      varied patient satisfaction tool is required to ensure all concerns pertaining to sedation in
      each specialty are addressed, as well as allowing consistency between specialties to be
      examined. Therefore, the objective is to develop and validate a procedural sedation
      satisfaction tool for use with a variety of specialties requiring pediatric procedural
      sedation.
