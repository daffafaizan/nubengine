      months. They will be recruited in the 3 main University Hospitals of South West France
      (Bordeaux, Toulouse, Limoges) and followed-up for 24 months. Colposcopy (+/- biopsies),
      cytology, and virology tests will be performed at the time of conization and during the
      follow-up period (6, 12, 24 months). HPV expression will be assessed by centralized validated
      marketed tests (Hybrid Capture 2, RLA genotyping, PreTectÂ® HPV-Proofer) and by a real time
      PCR measuring E2, E6 and E7 viral load of HPV 1.
