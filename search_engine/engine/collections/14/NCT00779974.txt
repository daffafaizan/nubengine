      well documented. There is evidence of loss of subscapularis function shown through physical
      exam in up to 2/3 of patients following total shoulder arthroplasty. [1] Multiple techniques
      for subscapularis repair have been demonstrated with varying degrees of post operative
      function, ranging from 11-66% abnormal function on physical exam. [1-3] The belly compression
      test and the lift off test, which are the main physical exam tests used for evaluation
      following surgery, are of questionable reliability as indicators of the functionality of the
      subscapularis. [4,5] Through comparing ultrasound evidence of an intact subscapularis to
      physical exam findings it has been recognized that the belly compression test has low
      sensitivity and specificity for subscapularis integrity. [5] Internal rotation is often
      limited in many postoperative total shoulder patients, which could lead to false positive
      results. This questions the validity of the outcomes of the studies in which the standard of
      testing function was through exam.

      Ultrasound is a reliable exam for illustration of structural damage to the subscapularis
      tendon but additional testing is needed to evaluate the function of the structurally intact
      subscapularis. [5,6] Irreparable changes in the muscle function or nerve denervation could
      also result in false positive belly compression and lift off tests. The ability to accurately
      determine the functionality of the subscapularis following total shoulder replacement is
      imperative to clinic management. Although studies have shown functional abnormalities through
      physical exam, none have documented the functional status of the subscapularis using
      objective means such as EMG.
