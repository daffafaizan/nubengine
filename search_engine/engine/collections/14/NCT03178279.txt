      2. 1 version implemented via the 'IMPARTS' computerised 'tablet' based system that has been
      separately evaluated (REC Ref 12/SC/0422) and 3. 1 version on an iPad via the Healthlocker
      system via Mindwaves.

      The investigators wish to pilot the use of this PHP in two community teams in the South
      London and Maudsley (SLaM) Trust. The pilot will be done in three stages.

      Stage One: The investigators will undertake an initial qualitative study to refine the
      process of using the PHP using focus group consultations with staff and service users.

      Stage Two: The investigators will then undertake a six month study to evaluate the uptake and
      use of the PHP. This will involve collecting data on how many people complete the PHP and
      what actions are taken following the completion of the PHP.

      Stage Three: At the end of this six month period the investigators will undertake qualitative
      interviews with a selection of service users and staff to understand their experience of
      using the PHP.

      The investigators hope to be able to use the results of this pilot study to introduce the use
      of the PHP into routine care.
