      ultrasound predicts relapse after discontinuation of infliximab more accurately than does
      clinical index and to investigate the efficacy and safety of restarting infliximab after
      relapse in patients with rheumatoid arthritis in remission or low disease activity on
      infliximab treatment. Infliximab is discontinued in all enrolled patients. Patients are
      followed up for 48 weeks for monitoring relapse. If relapse occurs, patients receive
      readministration of infliximab and are further followed up for 24 weeks to determine the
      efficacy and safety of infliximab readministration. Primary endpoint is the difference in
      area under curve (AUC) of receiver operator characteristics (ROC) analysis between total
      power Doppler score and Disease Activity Score (DAS) 28 at baseline to predict relapse within
      48 weeks after discontinuation of infliximab.
