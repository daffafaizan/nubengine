    
      Specific Aims:

        -  To ascertain the long term success of non-surgical interventions intended to alleviate
           symptoms or slow progression of osteoarthritis of the knee.

        -  To ascertain if non-operative interventions for knee osteoarthritis improve patient
           pain, function, and quality of life.

        -  To ascertain if non-operative interventions for knee osteoarthritis affect the breakdown
           of articular cartilage and slow progression of osteoarthritis as evidenced by MRI or
           joint space narrowing on standing knee films?

        -  To ascertain the amount of time between the initial entry into care at HSS and the end
           point of total or partial knee replacement for patients with knee osteoarthritis of
           varying severity.

        -  To ascertain if non-operative interventions for knee osteoarthritis prolong time to knee
           replacement surgery.

        -  To implement at electronic data capture system (EDC) for osteoarthritis patients which
           will store validated patient reported outcomes, physical findings, and imaging results.
