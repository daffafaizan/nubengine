      we have designed a system capable to combine EMA and continuous monitoring of patients using
      the smartphone's and/or wearable's sensors and data entry in order to monitor and predict
      suicide risk. For example, both poor sleep quality and disturbed appetite are clinical
      markers of depression, with a bidirectional relationship. Their changes could precede the
      increase of suicidal behavior as sleep and appetite are both influenced by mood state and
      regulated by the serotonergic system. Our hypothesis is that tracking mental health simptoms
      regularly through self-report could serve as a consistent and non-biased shortcut to assess
      mood state, its biological underpinnings and could potentially predict suicidal behavior.
