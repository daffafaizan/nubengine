    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To compare the incidence of desaturation (oxygen saturation [SpO2] < 90%) between patients
      undergoing ERCP with LMA Gastro versus (vs) standard nasal cannula.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the incidence of additional airway maneuvers (jaw thrust/chin lift/placement
      of oral airway or/nasal trumpet/intubation).

      II. To evaluate the incidence of withdrawal of duodenoscope from the airway to facilitate
      airway support.

      III. To evaluate the incidence of adverse events. IV. To evaluate times related to anesthesia
      and procedure (defined as "anesthesia start to anesthesia end" and "procedure start to
      procedure end" respectively).

      V. To evaluate time from procedure end to anesthesia end. VI. To describe hemodynamics within
      the two groups (recorded blood pressures, heart rates, oxygen saturations, and end tidal
      carbon dioxide [CO2]).

      VII. To evaluate anesthesiologist placing the device (training video viewed, number of
      practice attempts, years of experience).

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients undergo ERCP with LMA Gastro.

      ARM II: Patients undergo ERCP with standard nasal cannula.
