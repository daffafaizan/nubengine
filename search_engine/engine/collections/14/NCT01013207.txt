      collapse of the upper airway during sleep. OSA comprises a continuous spectrum of severity
      ranging from simple snoring and upper airway resistance through mild to severe symptomatic
      obstructive hypopnoea and apnoea. The prevalence of sleep disordered breathing in the adult
      population is 24% males and 9% for females. The prevalence of symptomatic OSA in the adult
      population has been estimated to be 4% in males and 2% in females. These patients demonstrate
      behavioural and neuropsychological consequences to varying degrees, including excessive
      daytime sleepiness, intellectual deterioration and depression. More serious consequences
      include arterial systemic hypertension, arterial pulmonary hypertension and heart disease.

      The treatment of choice for OSA is Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP). CPAP acts as a
      positive airway splint, delivering a fixed positive airway pressure to the upper airway via a
      tube and mask. Humidification is used during CPAP therapy to improve comfort of the delivered
      air and alleviate nasal dryness/congestion.

      Compliance with CPAP is a known issue which is affected by many things, including negative
      side effects and issues with the equipment. The most common complaints involve nasal
      dryness/congestion and noise from the machine.

      The purpose of this study is to assess whether the improved humidification system, reduced
      noise, improved comfort of breathing and new user interface on the Nexus (S9) CPAP will
      improve compliance.

      Aims:

        1. To determine if compliance on the new Nexus (S9) CPAP is improved over the patient's
           usual CPAP

        2. To assess the usability of the Nexus (S9) CPAP.
