      and shoes. The purpose of the foot examination is to determine whether the patient is at risk
      of developing diabetic foot ulcers (DFU). Risk factors are: neuropathy, peripheral
      angiopathy, foot deformities, skin pathologies, earlier history of DFU/amputation. With
      effective control and examination of the feet, foot complications, such as DFU, can be
      prevented. In the study the feet are examined with the help of a new software, the D-Foot.
      D-Foot includes questions and surveys.

      The aim of the of the study is evaluate how the patients experience the visit at the
      department of Prosthetics & Orthotics based on the digital foot check.
