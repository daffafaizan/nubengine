      disease after resection of recurrent high grade glioma without compromising the demarcation
      between recurrent high grade glioma and postoperative bed normal tissue.

      Sub-goals:

        1. To determine the impact of the dose of 5-ALA in improving volumetric extent of resection
           in patients with recurrent high grade gliomas

        2. To determine the impact of the dose of 5-ALA in improving overall survival of recurrent
           high grade glioma patients

        3. To determine the impact of the dose of 5-ALA in improving progression-free survival of
           recurrent high grade glioma patients

        4. To determine the impact of the dose of 5-ALA on the neurological morbidity of recurrent
           high grade glioma patients.

      Patients with presumed recurrent glioma will be entered into the trial. Those with recurrent
      disease will receive study drug (5-ALA) in one of three dose-escalated cohorts (5 mg/kg; 10
      mg/kg; 20 mg/kg). Intraoperatively, patients will undergo resection with combined
      fluorescence microscopy and confocal microscopy. Resected tissue specimens corresponding to
      the presence of fluorescence will be sent to pathology for examination. Postoperatively,
      patients will have an MRI with and without contrast within 48 hours of surgery. Subsequent
      analysis of each patient will include assessment of the primary endpoint (volume of residual
      disease) by volumetrically quantifying the tumor before and after surgery using T1-weighted
      contrast-enhancement. Similarly, volumetric extent of resection will also be measured.
