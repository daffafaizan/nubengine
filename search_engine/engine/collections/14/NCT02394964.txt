    
      This is a combination of a defined pilot microbiome study as well as exploratory mechanistic
      research with candidate commensals identified based on known structures accessible in public
      databases. In the observational prospective two-center study, subjects will be followed for 8
      weeks. The study will consist of a total of 3 study visits (0, 4 and 8 weeks). Screening and
      baseline visits (week 0) will take place at the same time. A study window period of +/- 7
      days will be allowed for follow-up study visits. The mechanistic in vitro research with
      subjects' blood cells and candidate commensals will typically require between 2-4 visits for
      sampling, but will not be limited by the frequency of visits.
