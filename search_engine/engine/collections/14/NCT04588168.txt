      Primary: To evaluate whether multiparametric MRI can determine the sensitivity of modified
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy early in patient with muscle invasive bladder cancer（MIBC）.

      Secondary：To determine whether multiparametric MRI can predict the prognosis of modified
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy early in patient with muscle invasive bladder cancer.

      Patients may receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy (typically three 21-day courses of modified
      gemcitabine-cisplatin(GC) therapy) followed by radical cystectomy and lymph node dissection.

      Patients with primary bladder cancer or recurrence which is confirmed by pathology of
      previous biopsy or TURBT, undergo a multiparametric MRI(mpMRI) at baseline to stage the
      primary tumor. The mpMRI includes T2-weighted MRI, diffusion-weighted imaging, and dynamic
      contrast enhancement, which will be given a five-point VI-RADS（Vesical Imaging-Reporting And
      Data System） score by two radiologists specialized in urogenital radiology. Patients
      considered NMIBC（Non-muscle invasive bladder cancer） with mpMRI will be given TURBT, while
      patients with MIBC（Muscle invasive bladder cancer）will receive radical cystectomy and lymph
      node dissection after three 21-day courses of modified gemcitabine-cisplatin neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy. Patients also undergo an immediate mpMRI scan after one, two, and three cycles
      of neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

      Specimens from the radical cystectomy are then examined by the pathology department as
      standard routine.
