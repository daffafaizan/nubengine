      function, daily living ability and quality of life of Alzheimer's disease by using the
      international dementia certification scale.

      Methods/design: A total of 180 participants with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease will be
      randomly assigned to either an acupuncture combined with donepezil group or a donepezil group
      with a ratio of 1:1. Participants in the acupuncture combined with donepezil group will
      receive acupuncture treatment in combination with donepezil for 12 weeks and at same time
      taking donepezil. The main acupoints are DU 24, EX-HN 3, DU 20, EX-HN 1, GB 12, HT 7, KI 6,
      GB39, and then selecting other acupoints according to TCM syndrome. The electric stimulator
      will be applied to DU 24, GB 12, HT 7, and LR 3 or SP 6 with a disperse-dense wave of 2/50
      Hz, 0.5-1.0 mA. There are 3 sessions per week with each session lasting for 30 min. There
      will be 12 weeks of treatment for each participant in total. Donepezil 5 mg will be given
      once daily before bed-time for 12 weeks. After the clinical trial, participants will be given
      conventional treatment clinically. Participants in the control group will take donepezil
      only. A follow-up will be conducted 24 weeks after the treatment. The primary outcome is the
      change and effective rate from baseline in the ADAS-cog score measured at week 12. The
      secondary outcomes contains The change from baseline in MMSE score, ADCS-ADL score, QOL-AD
      score measured at weeks 12, 24 and 36.
