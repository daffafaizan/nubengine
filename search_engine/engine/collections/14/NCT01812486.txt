           Dose de-escalation in the elective nodal sites and off-target regions of the swallowing
           apparatus delivered by IMRT does reduce overall rate of late dysphagia and neck fibrosis
           comparing to the standard dose to the elective nodal sites.

        2. Primary endpoint

           To estimate the difference in overall rate of late dysphagia and neck fibrosis 1 year
           after the end of radiotherapy in patients receiving dose de-escalation to the elective
           nodal sites and off-target regions of the swallowing apparatus applying IMRT.

        3. Secondary endpoints

      Local, regional and distant control Recurrence and site of recurrence Overall, disease-free
      and disease-specific survival Acute toxicity Quality of life
