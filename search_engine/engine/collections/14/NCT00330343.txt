      pain. Regardless of method of administration, all opioids produce unwanted side effects,
      including pruritus, nausea and vomiting, constipation, urinary retention, cognitive
      impairment, tolerance, dependence, and (rarely) respiratory depression. Based on the results
      of a previously completed randomized controlled trial, children and adolescents with moderate
      to severe pain, are now routinely treated in the Children's Center of the Johns Hopkins
      Hospital with a low dose naloxone infusion (0.25 mcg/kg/HOUR) whenever morphine intravenous
      patient controlled analgesia (IVPCA) or parent/nurse controlled analgesia (IVPNCA) is
      initiated. Although the previous study showed a marked reduction in the incidence and
      severity of pruritus and nausea, approximately a third of the patients still experience these
      side effects. The primary purpose of this study is to reduce this failure rate by determining
      if there is an optimal dose of naloxone to prevent opioid induced side effects as determined
      by a dose finding classic up down dose escalation method. The second aim is to determine the
      pharmacokinetics of morphine and naloxone and their metabolites at each of the naloxone
      infusion rates attempted. The investigators will measure morphine, naloxone, and their
      metabolites using a liquid chromatographic-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometric
      method (LC/MS/MS). The final aim is to determine the pharmacogenetics of responders and
      non-responders using DNA isolated from patient blood. To accomplish this the investigators
      will need a single blood collection from patients currently being treated with IVPCA morphine
      and low dose intravenous naloxone.
