      I. Assess the activity of VEGF Trap in patients with recurrent or persistent endometrial
      cancer, in terms of the frequency of patients who have progression-free survival for at least
      6 months after initiating therapy or have objective tumor response.

      II. Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the duration of progression-free survival and overall survival of patients
      treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive VEGF Trap IV over 1 hour on days 1 and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.
