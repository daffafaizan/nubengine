      common protocol designed to evaluate outcomes following trans-nasal balloon dilation of the
      maxillary sinus outflow tract with or without concurrent balloon dilation of the frontal or
      sphenoid sinuses and without any concomitant conventional sinus surgery (ie, uncinectomy,
      complete or partial ethmoidectomy).
