      signing an informed consent form, all subjects will undergo medical examination which
      includes ECG, anthropometric measurements and Vo2max test.

      Afterwards, the subjects will perform randomly 3 experimental days, each consist of physical
      and cognitive performance evaluation before and after simulated road march using a virtual
      reality environment; once without additional load, once combining cognitive load during the
      road march, and once without physical load (without march, waiting between evaluations) as
      control.

      The experiment will take place in a dome room, and the systems being used are:

        1. CAREN high (Computer Assisted Rehabilitation Environment) which screens virtual scene in
           the dome.

        2. MOTEK (Motek MedicalÂ©, the Netherlands) which is a two track treadmill (for each leg)
           placed on a rotatable platform.

      cognitive tasks for example: navigation, identification and remembering cars/aircraft.

      Physical and cognitive performance will be evaluated at each experimental day, before and
      after performing the protocol. at the end of the march, cognitive performance will be
      evaluated by validated tests on laptop (SYNWIN activity research services) and executive
      function evaluation based on Trail Making Test (TMT), afterwards, Physical performance will
      be evaluated by HRV and time to exhaustion test (30 min after the end of cognitive tests).
