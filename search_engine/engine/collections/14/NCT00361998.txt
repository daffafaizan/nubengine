      treatment of women with uncomplicated UTI. Our design is to enroll 400 women with
      uncomplicated cystitis and divided according to a double-blind randomization in two groups (3
      days vs. 7 days). The women will be followed 7 days and 28 days clinically and
      bacteriologically.
