      decreased implantation rate, oocyte and embryo quality, obstructed utero tubal connection are
      most researched aspects of endometriosis-related infertility, etiopathogenesis of
      endometriosis-related infertility still remains controversial.

      Endometrial cell is a unique eukaryotic somatic cell with cyclic telomerase activity.
      Hormone-dependent cyclic variation of endometrial telomerase activity was stated in previous
      studies. On the other hand telomerase, activity was shown in endometriotic lesions, whereas
      this activity lacks in most of the somatic cells.

      In this study, assessment of possible relation to increased telomerase activity in infertile
      patients with endometriosis was aimed.

      Before published studies were assessed telomerase activity in benign and malign gynecological
      conditions and in endometriosis tissue, as well. But evaluation of ectopic and eutopic
      endometrial tissue and serum telomerase activity in infertile and fertile endometriosis and
      healthy control subjects was not performed.

      Correlation of telomerase activity and endometriosis-related infertility was aimed in this
      study.
