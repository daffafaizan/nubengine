      malnutrition will adversely affect outcomes. The investigators develop a dietary education
      intervention for PD patients to improve fundamental food knowledge that will increase protein
      intake to target level of 1.2 g/kg of protein intake per day. In additional the dietary
      intervention will provide information about sodium, phosphorus, calcium intake. To more
      effectively deliver the intervention, the investigators explored a technology using social
      media in China called wechat. The purpose of this study is to test whether a dietary
      intervention can be more effective when delivered using wechat compared to a traditional
      patient education intervention delivered during routing clinical visits.
