      disease course. Although these patients are recommended to participate in an early phase
      clinical trials, the response rate have reported be only 4 to 6 percent. Over several
      decades, a lot of cancer driving mutations has been identified, and targeted agents directed
      at the mutations are continuously developed and studied in many clinical trials. Most of the
      clinical trials recruited participants regardless of mutational status of them. Recently,
      however, participants has been recruited in recent clinical trials according to the presence
      of specific mutations. The response rate of these recent clinical trials is 12-75%.

      In this pragmatic clinical trial, cancer driving mutations in hematologic malignancy patients
      is identified using next generation sequencing, and assign patients to an appropriate
      clinical trial which is anticipated to exhibit the best response. The improvement of outcome
      of this biomarker-driven assignment is investigated.
