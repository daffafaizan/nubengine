      distal end of the radius. Distal radius fractures are associated with posttraumatic sequelae,
      which typically involve restricted forearm rotation. Diagnostics of dynamic traumatic
      pathologies are conventionally based on static (2D or 3D) imaging protocols using MRI
      (magnetic resonance imaging) or CT. However, interpretation of indirect suggestive findings -
      such as edema or abnormal bone positions - limits accuracy and inter-observer reliability.
      Dynamic 4D imaging (adding the fourth dimension of time) has the potential to discriminate
      whether forearm rotation deficit is due to an osseous deformity causing bony impingement or
      whether it is due to non-osseous pathology. Hence it may reduce unnecessary corrective
      osteotomies and guide the patient and surgeon towards the most effective surgical or
      conservative treatment choice - expectedly resulting in better outcomes and patient
      satisfaction. In addition, we aim to develop a classification based on the estimated motion
      patterns and assess its reliability. Furthermore we aim at acquiring knowledge of
      physiological mechanics of the radioulnar joint and to assess symmetry in radioulnar joint
      motions between two healthy forearms on 4D-CT-scans.
