      chemotherapy. This agent targets epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). EGFR sits on the
      outside of tumor cells and controls tumor cell growth. This agent has been looked at alone
      and with other chemotherapy drugs in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). It has shown to be
      safe and can shrink tumors. There is little information about the combination of this agent
      with both paclitaxel and carboplatin. This study combines cetuximab with monthly carboplatin
      and weekly paclitaxel.
