      postoperative discomfort. Whereas severe complications like cardiovascular events are rare,
      postoperative side effects like nausea and vomiting, pain, long-lasting pain and pain related
      interference of daily activities are frequent. The question arises which patient is at
      specific risk for this sequelae. Pre-exiting predisposing factors (e.g. patients' genetic
      background), surgery and anesthesia related variables (drugs, techniques administered for
      anesthesia and analgesia) as well as psychological and social factors might influence the
      outcome.

      In this prospective association study these variables will be investigated in a
      well-described patient cohort presenting for elective surgery.

      Objective

      The aim of this study is to associate perioperative and postoperative complications and side
      effects as well as long-term outcome after surgery to patient- and surgery-related variables,
      including genetic variants.

      Methods

      Prospective association study performed in two independent patient cohorts.
