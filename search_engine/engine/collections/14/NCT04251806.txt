      the spinal cord through a spinal defect. Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is common in
      children with MMC and is a risk factor for sudden death. Abnormal sleep physiology is likely
      multifactorial, related to MMC level, brainstem dysfunction, musculoskeletal factors, and
      pulmonary abnormalities. In infants, SDB may be treatable with oxygen, caffeine, or positive
      airway pressure. Yet, SDB screening is not routine, even in centers with specialized MMC
      programs.

      Evaluation of sleep in neonates who require intensive care is an emerging opportunity with
      potential for major impact on health and quality of life for affected children. As SDB and
      abnormal sleep are potentially treatable, early assessment and intervention could become an
      integral part of a multidisciplinary treatment strategy to optimize long-term medical and
      neurodevelopmental outcomes.
