    
      A Phase II, open-label, single-arm, two-stage, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of Lipotecan® monotherapy in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and
      had failed sorafenib treatment due to sorafenib intolerance or radiographic progressive
      disease (PD).

      Eligible patients received 40 mg/m2 of Lipotecan®, given as a 30-minute (+3 minutes)
      intravenous infusion, on Days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle for maximum 6 cycles.
      Inter-cycle and intra-cycle dose delays were allowed within 21 days of the scheduled date to
      be reduced to 35 mg/m2 and further to 30 mg/m2 if a treatment-related adverse event (TRAE)
      met the criteria for dose reduction.

      Tumor response was assessed every 2 cycles until Cycle 6, or at the early termination
      according to RECIST Version 1.1 judged by site investigator. The favorable response of CR, PR
      or SD would be confirmed within 28-35 days. Safety evaluations were conducted on a weekly
      basis from the day study treatment administered throughout each cycle.
