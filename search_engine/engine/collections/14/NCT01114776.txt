    
      A detailed iron burden, transfusion and chelation history will be obtained from chart review
      or from participant recall.

      Iron burden data will include: 1) documentation of liver iron, and 2) average annual ferritin
      values.

      Transfusion data will include: (1) age at onset of regular transfusions, (2) years of chronic
      transfusion therapy, and (3) pre-transfusion Hb calculated as average of all assessments for
      each year.

      MRI will be performed measuring pituitary, cardiac, and liver iron.

      Laboratory samples should be obtained pre-transfusion and mid-cycle.

      All interviews, exams, laboratory tests, study procedures and MRI assessments should be
      completed within a 0 to 12 weeks time span.

      In addition, a healthy control group will also be recruited with similar age, gender, and
      ethnicity as the disease groups.
