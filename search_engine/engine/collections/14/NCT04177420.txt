      oxidative stress in the body and is expected to contribute to the treatment of diabetes.
      Therefore, the team hopes to effectively reduce glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting blood
      glucose (GLU-AC), insulin (insulin), reduce the body's oxidative stress index, increase Total
      Antioxidant Capacity (TAC) inhibit the inflammatory response and reduce complications through
      4 months of IR-C intervention. Which expected to reduce the index of the nitrogen-type first
      collagen element (Procollagen-I N -telopeptide, PINP) and C-telopeptide of type I collagen
      (CTx) bone loss index, enhance Osteocalcin's index of bone growth indicators. Along with the
      Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI), numeric rating scale-knee (NRS-knee) and Geriatric
      depression Scale-15 (GDS-15) to reduce the number of times the elderly take medication and
      improve their health and quality of life.
