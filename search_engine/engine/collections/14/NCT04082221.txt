      commercially available stool sampling kits and fecal DNA extraction kits influence the
      apparent composition of the gut microbiome. Participants will be instructed to collect stool
      samples at two time points separated by one week using six different methods (na√Øve and Zymo
      DNA/RNA Shield kit on dry ice as well as OMNIgene GUT, RNALater, 95% EtOH, Zymo DNA/RNA
      Shield at room temperature). DNA extraction from all samples will be performed using QIAamp
      Power Fecal (Qiagen, N. V) and ZymoBIOMICS (Zymo Research, CA.).
