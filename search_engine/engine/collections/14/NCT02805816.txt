      of Celiac disease (CD). However, during the last decades evidence has accumulated on the
      diagnostic value of specific CD antibodies and has increasingly been used for diagnostic
      purposes. At the same time, the leading role of histology for the diagnosis of CD has been
      questioned for several reasons: histological findings are not specific for CD, lesions may be
      patchy and can occur in the duodenal bulb only and interpretation depends on preparation of
      the tissue and is prone to a high inter-observer variability. The diagnosis of CD may then
      depend not only on the results of small bowel biopsies, but also on information from clinical
      data and on results from specific CD antibody testing. ESPGHAN (European Society of
      Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition) guidelines for the diagnosis of CD which was
      recently published enabled diagnosis of CD based on classical symptoms and high titre levels
      (>10 times upper limit of normal) of tissue transglutaminase (TG2) and positive Endomysial
      Anti bodies (EMA) in separate blood samples.

      Due to these facts, it is important to use serological kit for TG2 with high specificity and
      sensitivity. The aim of this study is to assess in a prospective study the kit with the
      highest sensitivity and specificity among patients with suspected CD.

      The investigators will perform prospective observational multicenter study which includes
      children with suspicion of CD who referred to gastroscopy and intestinal biopsies (study
      group) and children without suspicion of CD who underwent gastroscopy for other reasons. The
      investigators will compare sensitivity, specificity and predictive values of several
      serological kits of TG2 (Bioplex 2200, Bioflash, Phadia 250, Liason-XL, Orgentec Alergia and
      Eurospital) compared with definitive diagnosis of CD according to histological findings.
