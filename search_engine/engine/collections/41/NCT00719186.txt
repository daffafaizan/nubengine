      women with PCOS. However the true magnitude of the effect of letrozole is difficult to
      discern from prior studies. Therefore we intend to determine the safety and efficacy of
      letrozole, an aromatase inhibitor, compared to clomiphene citrate, a selective estrogen
      receptor modulator, in achieving live birth in infertile women with PCOS.

      Treatment- After progestin withdrawal, 750 women will be equally randomized to two different
      treatment arms: A) clomiphene citrate 50 mg every day for 5 days (day 3-7 of cycle), or B)
      letrozole 2.5 mg every day for 5 days (day 3-7 of cycle), for a total of 5 cycles or 20
      weeks. Dose will be increased in subsequent cycles in both treatment groups for non-response
      or poor ovulatory response up to a maximum of 150 mg of clomiphene a day (x 5 days) or 7.5 mg
      of letrozole a day (x 5 days).

      Statistical Analysis- The primary analysis will use an intent-to-treat approach to examine
      differences in the live birth rate in the two treatment arms.

      Anticipated time to completion- A total of 4 years will be required to complete the study
      after start up; 31 month enrollment period, 5 month treatment period, with 9 month additional
      observation to determine pregnancy outcomes. This will be accomplished by enrolling ~3.45
      women with PCOS per center per month over the enrollment period (N = 7 RMN sites).
