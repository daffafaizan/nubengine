      randomized to hydroxocobalamin or saline. Patients will have blood samples drawn up to 3
      hours pre-dose and 3 hours post-dose to measure for hydrogen sulfide levels. Patients will
      also be followed for 3 hours after study drug infusion to monitor and record vasopressor
      dependence in norepinephrine-equivalent dose. Patients will then be followed through their
      medical record for 28 days to determine persistent organ dysfunction syndrome (PODS).
