      treatment with either monthly IM (intramuscular injection) Penicillin or daily oral
      Penicillin.

      This preventive treatment is recommended for years until the child is 20 y old or even later.
      The compliance rate for this treatment declines significantly with time (the injections are
      painful) and even with good adherence the prevention is not complete.

      In the last few years a new product licensed as "BLIS K-12" has been developed and approved
      by FDA as GRAS (generally recognized as safe) status from 2011.

      This probiotic treatment prevents the pathogenic Strep A from adhering to the throat of the
      child thus preventing the infection. This kind of prevention is better for the long run for
      the patient and for the surrounding, It is better tolerated, is effective even if a dose is
      skipped or missed is not painful and is tasty to the children.

      So the investigators assumption is that giving this product to children instead of Penicillin
      either orally or intramuscularlly will be better tolerated thus give a better protection
      profile with much less side effects.

      The investigators will be giving BLIS K-12 to those children on the trial on a daily basis
      for 6 autumn-winter months instead of Penicillin and will monitor the children by monthly
      throat swabs. The investigators will also obtain Anti Streptolysin blood test at the end of
      the period from all participants to evaluate possible Strep encounters.
