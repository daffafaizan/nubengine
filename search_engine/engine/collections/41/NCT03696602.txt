      Asthma was defined by a complaint of wheezing, cough, dyspnoea or chest tightness at rest or
      on exercising and a positive response to methacholine or exercise challenge.

      The response to exercise was considered positive when Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 s (FEV1)
      decreased at least 8% from Baseline.

      The response to methacholine was considered positive when FEV1 decreased at least 20% or Rrs
      increased at least 50% from baseline, at or below a cumulated dose of 1,200 Î¼g.

      Bronchodilator medications were discontinued at least 12 hours prior to the testing and
      provocation allowed when the child had been free of respiratory symptoms for at least 2 weeks
      and baseline FEV1 was larger than 70% pred. Exercise and methacholine groups were matched for
      age, height, baseline FEV1 z-score, a moderate level of airway response to challenge and DI
      amplitude ranging 40-60% of the predicted Forced Vital Capacity (FVC). Written informed
      consent was obtained from the children and their parents for the procedures. Procedures for
      spirometry, exhaled fraction of NO (FENO), GrsDI (Respiratory conductance response to a deep
      inhalation) and challenges have been described previously. Acceptable GrsDI's were analyzed
      at a 10-20% FEV1 decrease from baseline. Statistics were performed using Mann-Whitney, Chi
      square tests and multiple regression as required. Data are median and interquartile range.
