      ST-T wave changes in lead aVL in patients with chronic stable angina

      The ECG findings vary considerably, depending importantly on four major factors: (1) the
      duration of the ischemic process (acute versus evolving or chronic) ; (2) its extent (large
      versus small) ; (3) its topography (anterior versus inferior-posterior and right ventricular)
      ; (4) the presence of other underlying conditions (e.g. LBBB, WPW or pacemaker pattern) that
      can mask or alters the classic pattern.

      The resting electrocardiogram is normal in approximately half of patients with chronic stable
      angina pectoris, and even patients with severe CAD may have a normal tracing at rest. A
      normal resting ECG suggesting a normal LV function and it is unusual finding in a patient
      with an extensive previous infarction.

      The most common electrocardiographic abnormalities in patients with chronic CAD are non
      specific ST-Twave changes with or without abnormal Q waves. In addition to myocardial
      ischemia, other conditions that can produce ST-T wave abnormalities include LV hypertrophy or
      dilation, electrolyte abnormalities, neurogenic effects, and anti-arrhythmic drugs.

      In patients with known CAD, however, the occurrence of ST-T wave abnormalities on the resting
      ECG may correlate with the severity of the underlying heart disease. This association may
      explain the adverse association of ST-Twave changes with prognosis of these patients. In
      contrast, a normal resting ECG is more favorable long-term prognostic sign in patients with
      suspected or definite CAD.
