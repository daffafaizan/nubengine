    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the toxicity profile of the SVN53-67/M57-KLH peptide in Montanide ISA 51
      (Montanide ISA-51/survivin peptide vaccine) plus with GM-CSF (sargramostim).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To measure the immune responses induced by SVN53-67/M57-KLH with Montanide ISA 51 with
      GM-CSF.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To collect preliminary data on therapeutic efficacy of this combination against malignant
      glioma.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive Montanide ISA-51/survivin peptide vaccine subcutaneously (SC) followed by
      sargramostim SC on day 0. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for 4 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at weeks 12, 16, 20, and 24.

      TREATMENT EXTENSION: After completion of study treatment, select patients may receive
      additional doses of Montanide ISA-51/survivin peptide vaccine SC and sargramostim SC.
      Treatment repeats every 3 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of treatment extension, patients are followed up at 1 month.
