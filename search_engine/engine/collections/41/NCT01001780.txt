      standard immunosuppressive treatment for chronic GvHD. These standard treatments are given in
      relatively low doses over long intervals. Thus, in this study we are testing an alternate
      strategy, using a more intensive, combined therapy with the PCR combination to determine if
      it will improve outcomes. PENTOSTATIN, CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE plus RITUXIMAB ("PCR") are
      FDA-approved drugs for chemotherapy of certain lymphomas/leukemias, and although each has
      been used separately to treat patients with chronic GvHD, they have not been approved as
      immunosuppressant for the treatment of chronic GvHD, either separately or together. We will
      study the "PCR" combination in 9-17 patients with chronic GvHD who are refractory to, or not
      expected to respond to standard therapy. Response will be measured by the achievement of a
      documented complete remission (i.e., full resolution of all symptoms and signs), and thus, a
      shortening of the total duration of immunosuppressive (anti-chronic GvHD) therapy. This
      latter effect may reduce overall infections.
