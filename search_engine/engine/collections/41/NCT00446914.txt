      throughout Ontario. Each of the 11 clinic sites will be randomised to either intervention or
      delayed intervention 9 months later. The intervention is a systems change involving
      interprofessional education and management tools to bring together physicians, nurses and
      pharmacists with the patient. Patients will be monitored by their family doctor or nurse
      practitioner at scheduled follow-up visits during a period of 36 months for an effect of the
      intervention over time on the patient's blood pressure.
