      consensus. Firstly,only WBS planar images are considered. Secondly, a single-bed SPECT/CT
      chosen based on planar images is used if WBS demonstrated any equivocal or suspicious uptake.

      Finally, WBS and double-bed SPECT/CT images are used for interpretation.

      A per-lesion, a per-anatomical region and a per-patient analysis is performed. At each step,
      lesions, regions and diagnostic conclusions are classified using a 3-level scale, as negative
      for malignancy, equivocal or suspicious for metastasis
