      of children . Desmopressin is an oral medication that increases water reabsorption in the
      kidneys. Studies have shown that it is effective in decreasing bedwetting episodes in
      children without sickle cell disease. Chronic sickling episodes causing damage to the kidneys
      could cause permanent damage and may make this treatment ineffective in sickle cell disease.
      This trial will inform pediatric sickle cell doctors if desmopressin is an appropriate
      treatment for bed wetting in the investigators patients.
