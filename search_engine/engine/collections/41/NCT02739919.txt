      prevalence and increasing cost associated to treat this disease. While struvite stones
      (composed of magnesium, ammonium and phosphate crystals) have been associated with the
      presence of infection, the association between bacteria and non-infection stones is not well
      characterized. Previous studies have found bacteria present in stones of patients without
      active infection and with negative pre-operative urine tests.

      There are various compositions of kidney stones, including calcium oxalate, calcium
      phosphate, struvite and uric acid, with calcium oxalate being the most common. It is well
      known that struvite stones are associated with active infection, however the role of bacteria
      in the formation of other types of kidney stones, including calcium oxalate, is not well
      understood. The investigators hypothesize that bacteria present in the urinary tract of
      patients without active infection have the ability to facilitate calcium oxalate crystal
      formation by providing a surface for stones to grow. An understanding of the role of bacteria
      in the formation of non-infection stones could help prevent stone formation by altering the
      bacteria present within patients to decrease or eliminate their risk of kidney stone disease.
