      three-year-Testosterone replacement therapy in hypogonadal patients as well as the patient's
      compliance. The replacement therapy will be performed with a new Testosterone Gel examined in
      previous trials as Testosteron Gel Wolff (TGW).

      A minimum of 100 patients will be recruited and evenly distributed to two treatment arms. 1st
      arm: dermal (non-scrotal) application of TGW. 2nd arm: scrotal application of TGW.
