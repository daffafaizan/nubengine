      Tranexamic Acid (TXA) to the surgical wound as a means to decrease seroma and/or hematoma
      formation compared to placebo in post-mastectomy patients. This project is designed as a
      single-center pilot RCT to evaluate the feasibility of conducting a formal RCT (multicenter
      trial including more patients) to evaluate the effectiveness of topical TXA.

      Patients will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups for intraoperative
      treatment of their mastectomy wound before it is closed.

      The first group will consist of those who will be treated with the intravenous form of TXA
      that will be applied to the surface of the mastectomy wound area rather than being injected
      into a vein. The second group consists of those individuals who will be treated with a
      topical normal saline solution (a placebo, or inactive substance that looks identical to the
      study drug but contains no therapeutic ingredients).

      Both groups will receive the same number of drains and the same post-operative follow-up
      schedule consisting of visits 2 to 4 weeks and 3 months after the surgery, as well as a last
      12 months follow-up. Standard of care will be practiced with respect to all procedures and
      visits.
