      random half-sample of non-pregnant US adults, aged 20-69 who were examined in the NHANES
      mobile examination center were selected. Participants received instructions, started and
      ended the urine collection in a urine study mobile examination center (UMEC), and answered
      questions about collection. A random half of participants who collected a complete 24-h urine
      were asked to collect a second 24-h urine. Urinary sodium, potassium, chloride, and
      creatinine excretion were analyzed.

      Participation rates in two other post-examination components, the Physical Activity Monitor
      and the Dietary Recall, were monitored to determine whether collecting a 24-hour urine had an
      effect on response rates for the two components.
