    
      This is a single arm, phase II clinical trial designed to assess the impact of tumor and
      stromal molecular subtypes on the efficacy of neoadjuvant FOLFIRNOX in untreated subjects
      with resectable, borderline resectable and unresectable locally advanced pancreatic ductal
      adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Subjects will undergo an EUS-guided core biopsy of the pancreas prior
      to treatment and after cycle 8 of FOLFIRINOX. Imaging will be performed after every 4 cycles
      of chemotherapy (8 weeks) and reassessed for resectability after 12 cycles. If patients show
      a response to treatment that is deemed by the surgical oncologist to be amenable to
      resection, surgery can be pursued after 8 cycles of therapy. In this case, the remaining 4
      cycles of treatment will be given after surgery.

      Duration of Therapy:

      In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse events, treatment may continue until:

        -  Disease progression,

        -  Inter-current illness that prevents further administration of treatment,

        -  Unacceptable adverse event(s),

        -  Subject decides to withdraw from the study, or

        -  General or specific changes in the subject's condition render the subject unacceptable
           for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator.

      Duration of Follow Up:

      - Subjects will be followed for 36 months after removal from study treatment or until death,
      whichever occurs first. Subjects removed from study treatment for unacceptable adverse events
      will be followed until resolution or stabilization of the adverse event.
