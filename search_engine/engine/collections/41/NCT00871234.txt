      will have no effect on endothelial function. The primary objective of this study is to
      determine the effects of etravirine 200mg twice daily given for four weeks on endothelial
      function, measured as flow-mediated dilation (FMD) of the brachial artery, in HIV-uninfected
      subjects. Secondary objectives include determination of the effects of etravirine 200mg twice
      daily given for four weeks on safety measures, lipid fractions, HOMA-IR, blood pressure,
      inflammatory parameters, and endothelial activation parameters.
