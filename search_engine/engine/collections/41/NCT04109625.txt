      vitro diagnosis-medical device in point of care could alleviate this difficulty. It would
      identify whether or not the subjects are infected with the virus, whether they are immunized
      or not. Then, depending on the results, the subjects could be directly vaccinated or referred
      to a laboratory of medical biology for confirmation / invalidation of the diagnosis.
