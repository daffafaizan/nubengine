      effect of non surgical periodontal treatment in the form of scaling and root planing on
      coronary heart disease patients. 70 clinically defined coronary heart disease (CHD) patients
      with mild to moderate periodontitis, were allocated into two groups- experimental and
      control, in a ratio of 1:1. Scaling and root planing was provided as the intervention to the
      experimental group. To the control group no periodontal intervention in any form was
      provided. The primary outcome assessed is the changes in C-reactive protein level at baseline
      and after 1, 3, and 6 months of periodontal intervention. The secondary outcomes assessed are
      lipid profile, white blood cells (WBC) profile, and blood pressure (systolic and diastolic)
      at baseline and after 1, 3, and 6 months of periodontal intervention. Periodontal parameters
      including plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), bleeding on probing (BOP), periodontal
      probing depth (PPD), and clinical attachment loss (CAL) is also assessed at baseline and
      after 6 months. All these parameters were also compared with their corresponding values in
      the control group.
