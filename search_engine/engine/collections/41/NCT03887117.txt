    
      This study, with healthy adult smokers, is designed as a study without product use
      restrictions (ad libitum product use) in order to replicate as closely as possible "real
      life" conditions. Subjects randomized to the cigarette and IQOS arms will be asked to buy
      their own cigarettes or HeatSticks, respectively. Subjects randomized to the smoking
      abstinence (SA) arm will be instructed to stay smoking abstinent until the end of the study.
      Subjects in the SA arm will receive smoking abstinence support and, in order to prevent
      relapse to cigarette smoking during the training program, will also be allowed to use
      nicotine replacement therapy.

      Mobile health technology will be used in the study to explore the impact on switching from
      smoking to using IQOS on physical activity in daily real-world living conditions. The
      wearable will enable non-invasive recording of physical activity in an objective manner
      throughout the study.
