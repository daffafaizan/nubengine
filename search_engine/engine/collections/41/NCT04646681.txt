      Patients being treated for depressive symptoms at the University of Iowa, Department of
      Psychiatry are invited to participate. Participants will complete a remote (phone or video)
      visit. After being informed about the study and potential risks, those who consent to being
      in the study will be assigned to one of two groups. They will complete an online survey and
      receive some basic training on patient portals. After the visit. both groups will be followed
      for 6 months. Depending on their group assignment, they will complete:
