    
      This is a randomized, controlled, observer-blind Phase 2 study which aims to confirm the
      optimal dose and formulation of VLA84 in healthy adults aged ≥ 50 years of age. The study
      will be enrolled in two age strata, subjects aged 50 - 64 years and subjects aged 65 years
      and older, in a 1:1 ratio.

      500 subjects (thereof, 250 aged 50 - 64 years and 250 aged 65 years and older) will be
      randomized in a 3:3:3:1 ratio to receive either VLA84 75 µg w/o Alum, VLA84 200 µg w/o Alum,
      VLA84 200 µg w/ Alum (150 subjects each), or placebo (50 subjects). Vaccinations consist of
      two i.m. injections administered in close proximity to each other in the deltoid region at
      Day 0, 7 and 28, starting with the non-dominant arm and alternating arms between the
      vaccination days.

      The study will investigate the immunogenicity and safety of VLA84 up to six months after the
      last vaccination, i.e. 210 days per subject. The study includes eight outpatient visits on
      days 0, 7, 14, 28, 35, 56, 120 and 210. Serum will be collected to assess humoral immunity at
      days 0, 7, 14, 28, 35, 56, 120 and 210.

      The study is OBSERVER blind. This means only pre-defined study staff will be unblinded, e.g.,
      staff responsible for IMP accountability, preparation and administration, monitor responsible
      IMP accountability, or safety staff in case of safety reasons. All other persons involved in
      study conduct will remain blinded.
