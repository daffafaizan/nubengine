           flexion angles in order to evaluate the kinematic behaviour of the TKA.

           A full-length standing and a lateral radiograph as well as CT scans of the hip, knee and
           ankle joint were performed 5 to 7 days postoperatively before discharge.

        2. clinical outcome Patient sociodemographic and anamnestic data were collected. The
           written interview was complemented by the EuroQol questionnaire (release EQ-5D) and the
           assessment of the patients' functional status (Knee Society Score) one week before
           surgery and 18 to 24 month after surgery.
