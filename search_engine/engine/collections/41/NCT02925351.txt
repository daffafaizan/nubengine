      I. Determine how fluorine F 18 clofarabine (18F-clofarabine) is distributed in the body, in
      patients with autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.

      II. Determine whether 18F-clofarabine can be used to image patients with autoimmune and
      inflammatory diseases.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive fluorine F 18 clofarabine intravenously (IV) and undergo a single PET/CT
