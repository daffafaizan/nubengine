      collected and reviewed for this study. Next, a clinic visit will be scheduled with the
      patient's family and an observing MD/DO/MBBS from a sponsor site to confirm and clarify
      information in the medical records.

      A baseline evaluation of clinical status will also be performed during this visit to serve as
      visit one in this longitudinal, prospective natural history study. Subsequent visits will
      take place every 6 months, for up to 24 months. Key components of this prospective study at
      each visit include a neurodevelopment exam tailored for INAD, application of the CHOP-INTEND
      neurodevelopment scale, the Hammersmith infant neurological examination and the modified
      Ashworth spasticity scale as well as collection of monthly parental severity scoring and
      monthly home videos of activities of daily living (ADLs).

      Data from this study will be pooled and presented in aggregate, without identification of
      individual subjects.
