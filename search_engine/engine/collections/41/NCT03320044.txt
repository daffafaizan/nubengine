      will first analyse the features of immune repertoire and genetic mutations from tissue of
      benign and malignant pulmonary noduleï¼Œthen explore the feasibility of detecting these
      features from peripheral blood sample, and finally evaluate peripheral blood detection of
      lung cancer related immune repertoire and genetic mutations for identifying nature of
      pulmonary nodule.
