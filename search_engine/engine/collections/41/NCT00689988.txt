      Longitudinal follow-up of twelve months of speech-language therapy with AAC use was
      undertaken. A lexical evaluation was done at the beginning and the end of this follow-up.
      Correct responses in the lexical evaluation were increased, but not necessarily in the spoken
      modality. The comparisons showed significant results in use of substitutions processes, and
      to no-answers.
