      I. To determine the kinetics of soluble (s)PD-L1 removal and regeneration by plasma exchange
      in patients with melanoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To observe response at 3 months after plasma exchange plus immunotherapy. II. To observe
      ongoing response at approximate 3 month intervals after plasma exchange plus immunotherapy.

      CORRELATIVE RESEARCH OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the effects of plasma exchange on immune cell function. II. To observe the
      kinetics of extracellular vesicles (EVs) after plasma exchange in patients with melanoma.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo radiation therapy daily on days 1-5 (weekdays). Patients then undergo
      therapeutic plasma exchange over 1-2 hours on days 4-6 or 5-7. Beginning on day 7, patients
      receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) or nivolumab IV. Treatment with pembrolizumab
      continues every 3 weeks or treatment with nivolumab continues every 2 weeks in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3 weeks and then for up to 2
      years.
