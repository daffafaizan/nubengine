      will have beneficial effects on metabolic health; secondly do the traditional physical
      exercise and dietary approaches to managing obesity result in prolonged weight loss. The
      purpose of this study is to determine whether high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) and
      continuous exercise carried out in differing sequences within a day will have a beneficial
      health impact.

      Participants will complete two 8h experimental trials in a randomised cross-over design. Each
      participant will complete 60-min of exercise in both trial arms; HIIE-First or
      Continuous-First separated by a minimum of 7 days. One trial will consist of a 30-min HIIE
      cycling session (10 x 1min of peak power output followed by 2min rest). After completion of
      this bout of exercise, participants will ingest a standardised breakfast. Following a rest
      period of 3h before completing the remaining 30-min of exercise (50% peak maximal oxygen
      uptake), before consuming a standardised semi-sold lunch meal. The second trial will be
      identical other than participates will undertake the continuous exercise first followed by
      the HIIE. Regular appetite, breath and blood samples will be taken throughout the trials. In
      The 24 hours following the end of each trial, participants will be asked to record their
      dietary intake and record their feeling of well-being documented on a questionnaire. There
      will be no long-term follow up following completion of the study.

      Therefore, the aim of this research project is to identify whether the order of HIIE and
      continuous exercise separated within the day results in changes to gastrointestinal health,
      appetite, and metabolic responses.
