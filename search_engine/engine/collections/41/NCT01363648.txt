      functions in Alzheimer's disease and vascular cognitive impairment (VCI). These deficits,
      although are of different degree than those found in Alzheimer's disease, were suggested to
      be associated with VCI.To date, there are no approved treatments for vascular
      dementia(VaD)and the main therapeutic efforts in this field are aimed at controlling vascular
      risk factors for countering VaD development or progression.

      There have also been several trials of cholinesterase inhibitors for treatment of VCI.
      Available data suggest some evidence of benefit of cholinesterase inhibitors in subcortical
      vascular dementia and vascular cognitive impairment.

      Treated patients had modest benefits in cognition, attention, executive functioning and
      ability to perform instrumental activities of daily living, but the effect is too limited due
      to the small numbers of subjects examined and it is complex to establish the clinical
      relevance of these effects. The majority of clinical studies available on the effect of
      choline alphoscerate in neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular disorders were reviewed. A
      comparison of Alzheimer's disease assessment scale-cognitive subscale(ADAS-Cog)analysis with
      the results obtained on the same item in 4 trials with the cholinesterase inhibitor revealed
      a more positive trend with the cholinergic precursor choline alphoscerate than with this
      cholinesterase inhibitor.
