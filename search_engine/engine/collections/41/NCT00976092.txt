      patients with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Additional
      anticoagulation therapy prior or during intervention plays an important role in the short-
      and long-term outcomes after PPCI. Two separate studies have shown significant benefit
      against conventional therapy based on clopidogrel and heparin for two recently approved
      drugs: the direct thrombin inhibitor bivalirudin and the thienopyridine prasugrel. In the
      HORIZONS-AMI trial, bivalirudin after pretreatment with clopidogrel resulted in improved net
      clinical outcomes. However, during the first 24 hours after PPCI an increase in the stent
      thrombosis rate was observed with bivalirudin therapy. Prasugrel has been shown to be
      superior to clopidogrel in patients with acute coronary syndromes undergoing PCI. The benefit
      in reduction of ischemic complication was even greater in the subset of patients with STEMI
      without any increase in the bleeding risk and with a significant reduction in the stent
      thrombosis rate. Expectedly, the synergic actions of prasugrel and bivalirudin may maximize
      the benefit of antithrombotic therapy for STEMI patients undergoing PPCI.
