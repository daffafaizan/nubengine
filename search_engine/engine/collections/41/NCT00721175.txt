      polytetrafluoroethylene; and, 2) the metal stent braided in the form of a tubular mesh from
      surgical-grade stainless steel alloy and designed to expand to a maximum diameter of 10 mm.
      The main drawback of the plastic stent is the relatively high occlusion rate, but its
      advantage is the lower cost. The use of a metal stent for hilar tumor has many theoretical
      advantages: 1) the flexible open-mesh design should allow drainage of secondary duct
      branches; and, 2) its larger diameter may provide better drainage and longer patency (~3-9
      months).

      Whether one type of stent is superior in terms of adequacy of drainage or cost-effectiveness
      remains undefined. Therefore, we would conduct this study to assess the efficacy of drainage
      of endoscopically-inserted, unilateral, plastic stents vs. metallic stents in unresectable,
      complex, hilar cholangiocarcinoma patients.
