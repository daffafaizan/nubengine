      developed. As a consequence, the occurrence of acute renal failure (ARF), also known as
      contrast-induced nephropathy, is more frequently seen after the realization of these
      procedures, representing about 10% of all in-hospital ARF. The importance of preventing this
      complication is related with its strong association with higher morbidity and mortality rates
      in patients who present it. A number of drugs and interventions have been studied for
      preventing contrast-induced nephropathy, including intravenous hydration with normal and
      hypotonic saline solutions, oral hydration, mannitol, diuretics, dopamine and its antagonists
      (fenoldopam), calcium antagonists, theophylline, N-acetylcysteine, natriuretic atrial peptide
      and hemodialysis after or during contrast media administration.

      There is only one study in humans that demonstrates the utility of the sodium bicarbonate to
      prevent the contrast-induced nephropathy, showing a reduction in the incidence of this
      complication of about 13.6%. Although this result could seem convincing, its relevance has
      been questioned because the definition used by the authors as contrast-induced nephropathy
      was an increase of 25% from basal creatinine. Although when compared, the absolute
      differences between basal and after-procedure creatinines were not statistically
      significative, the sample size was small and the participants were low-risk patients to
      develop contrast-induced nephropathy. It is also important to note that the control group was
      hydrated with a dextrose 5% solution with 154 mEq of NaCl, although today's most accepted
      prevention therapy is intravenous hydration with normal saline solution.

      Comparison: Hydration previously, during and afterwards contrast media administration with
      normal saline solution (0.9%), compared to hydration previous, during and afterwards contrast
      media administration with a solution made of normal saline and sodium bicarbonate.
