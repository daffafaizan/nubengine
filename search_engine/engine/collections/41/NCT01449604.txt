      cranial nerve VIII.The treatment options for patients with VSs include active observation,
      surgical management, and radiotherapy. However, the optimal treatment choice remain
      controversial.

      Over the past 10 years, there has been rapid progress in the application of stereotactic
      radiotherapy to the treatment of VSs. The stereotactic radiotherapy program includes single
      fraction radiosurgery (SRS) and hypofraction stereotactic radiotherapy (HSRT) are commonly
      used for VSs treatment. Since SRS and SRT techniques differ significantly enough to raise
      questions of therapeutic advantage and until now, there is no prospective, randomized study
      comparing the outcomes for patients treated using both radiotherapy techniques. We designed
      the first prospective randomized protocol to compare SRS and SRT for answer this question.
