    
      Pain during cold pressor test (CPT) was scored at all dose levels of remifentanil on a visual
      analogue scale (VAS 0-100 mm). Ventilatory function was measured by spirometry registering
      respiratory frequency (breaths/min), minute volume (L/min) and expiratory end-tidal carbon
      dioxide tension (mmHg).

      Side effects such as nausea and sedation were registered.
