      dementia who are considered at high, medium, and low risk for developing AD from a community
      based register (referred to as the CHARIOT registry) in the United Kingdom. Participants will
      undergo a series of neuropsychological evaluations to characterize the patterns of cognitive
      change and their inter-relationship in the earliest stages of cognitive impairment. In
      addition, how such changes relate to the clinical presentation of cognitive impairment of the
      Alzheimer's type may be evaluated over time. The SubStudy will investigate the longitudinal
      change of components of the PACC and RBANS in ARAD individuals who have demonstrable amyloid
      in the brain by either PET or CSF compared with individuals not classified as ARAD. SubStudy
      participants will be followed every 6 months throughout the SubStudy and will alternate
      between completing the alternative forms of the PACC and RBANS for a period of up to 4.5
      years (54 months). Blood, urine, and saliva samples will be collected from participants
      during the study for biomarker analyses to assess risk factors for dementia, Alzheimer's
      disease or confounding factors of dementia risk. Adverse events experienced by the
      participants during their participation in the study will be monitored.
