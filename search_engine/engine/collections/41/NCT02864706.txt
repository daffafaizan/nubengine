      control visit of patients who participated in the 12-month SCHEDULE (NCT01266148) study and
      the following 3-year follow-up examination/visit. The aim of this 5 to 7-year follow-up visit
      was to examine the effect of long term treatment, i.e. 5, 6 or 7 years, with early initiation
      of everolimus (CerticanÂ®) and early elimination of cyclosporine (CsA), compared to standard
      immunosuppressive regimen including CsA, on renal and heart function. During the time period
      of this follow-up examinations, this visit was performed as part of a routine annual visit 5,
      6 or 7 years since transplantation (and inclusion in the original SCHEDULE study).
