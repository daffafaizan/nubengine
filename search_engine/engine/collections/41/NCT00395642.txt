      combined use of BIOTRONIK Home Monitoring (HM) and weight and blood pressure (BP) external
      telemonitoring (ETM) in the follow-up management of heart failure patients implanted with a
      Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (CRT-D). The
      BIOTRONIK Home Monitoring system will automatically and remotely collect device based
      information on a daily basis, and an external telemonitoring system will be used to determine
      the 'weight' and 'blood pressure' remotely at the patient's home on a daily basis. This study
      will evaluate retrospectively, if Home Monitoring parameters correlate with weight and blood
      pressure changes. The patient compliance rate of the two telemonitoring systems will also be
      assessed.

      Target enrollment is up to 100 patients at 15 U.S. sites. Patients will be enrolled within a
      period of 12 to 15 months. Based on the follow-up period of 6 months per patient, the study
      duration is 18 to 21 months from the date of first patient enrollment. All patients will give
      written informed consent prior to enrollment and will be implanted with the legally marketed
      BIOTRONIK Kronos LV-T, or an appropriate BIOTRONIK CRT-D, as well as legally marketed pacing
      and defibrillation leads. In addition, all patients will be receiving a legally marketed
      external telemonitoring system to determine weight and blood pressure at home.
