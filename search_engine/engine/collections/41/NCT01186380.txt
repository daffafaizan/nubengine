      Diagnostic Ultrasound Systems for the visualization of the heart (and other organs) as a
      real-time ultrasound image. It is inserted into the esophagus through the mouth to visualize
      a plane of the heart through the esophageal wall.

      The purpose of this Study is to demonstrate the safety of the PET-512MC TEE transducer and
      gather feedback from the investigators related to the insertion of the transducer. The data
      will be used to determine the usability of the transducer in the clinical environment.
