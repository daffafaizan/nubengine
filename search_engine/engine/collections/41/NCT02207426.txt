    
      This is an open-label, randomized, single dose, cross-over study in healthy subjects. Each
      subject receives tobramycin with 3 different inhalation devices:

        -  75 mg tobramycin delivered to the airways via TobrAir® 6.0.

        -  300 mg tobramycin (TOBI®) delivered to the airways via the PARI LC® PLUS/PARI TurboBoy®
           SX.

        -  112 mg tobramycin (4x28mg dry powder capsules) delivered to the airways via the TOBI®
           Podhaler™.

      Each dose is separated by a minimum washout of at least 68 h.

      Blood samples for PK analysis of tobramycin will be collected at regular time intervals until
      24 h post-dose. For TobrAir 6.0 and TOBI/PARI only, all dosed subjects will undergo
      scintigraphic assessments.
