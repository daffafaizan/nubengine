      incident cancers. In 2015, it was estimated there would be 221,200 new lung cancers diagnosed
      in the United States, with 158,040 lung cancer deaths. Approximately 85% of all lung cancers
      are characterized as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

      Repeated studies have shown neoadjuvant cytotoxic chemotherapy to be safe prior to surgical
      resection of NSCLC with no difference in extent of surgical procedures performed, operative
      morbidity and mortality. The debate remains as to whether neoadjuvant or adjuvant
      chemotherapy is the best approach, with advantages and disadvantages to each.

      The investigators propose that new therapies such as immune checkpoint inhibitors that
      demonstrate promising clinical activity in the advanced disease setting must be incorporated
      into the neoadjuvant setting, in order to maximize benefit early in a patient's treatment
      course, and with a suitable surrogate endpoint that can be used to establish a preliminary
      efficacy signal, prior to initiation of a large confirmatory study.
