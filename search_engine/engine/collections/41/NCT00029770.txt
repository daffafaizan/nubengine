      therapies appear promising, there are too few randomized clinical trials of sufficient
      quality to support the use of one therapy over another. This is especially true for
      acute/subacute neck pain. Although commonly treated with prescription medications, neck pain
      sufferers are increasingly seeking relief through complementary and alternative medicine
      therapies, such as chiropractic spinal manipulation. Little is known, however about the
      short- and long-term relative efficacy of these therapies and how they compare to giving
      patients simple advice on self-care.

      The broad, long-term objective of this research is to identify effective therapies for neck
      pain sufferers and to increase our understanding of neck pain conditions. This randomized,
      observer-blinded clinical trial is a unique collaborative effort by experienced chiropractic
      and medical researchers and will focus on patients with acute/subacute neck pain (<12 weeks
      duration). The study will determine the relative efficacy of chiropractic spinal
      manipulation, prescription medication, and self-care advice for neck pain in both the short
      term (after 6 weeks) and long term (after 52 weeks), using patient-rated neck pain as the
      main indicator of success.
