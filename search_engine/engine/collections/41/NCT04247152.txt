      surgically-induced astigmatism, the investigators will calculate "keratometry-based total
      astigmatism" for each patient. This will be compared to "aberrometry-based total
      astigmatism", i.e. the total astigmatism measured by ORA in each case. With this information
      the investigators will determine in what portion of patients keratometry-based total
      astigmatism vs aberrometry-based total astigmatism predicts a need for astigmatism
      correction, (i.e., total astigmatism is greater than or equal to 0.5 D) during cataract
      surgery.
