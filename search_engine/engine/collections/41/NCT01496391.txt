    
      This study is being conducted to compare two imaging agents (tracers): [I-123]-OIH and
      [Tc-99m]-MAG3 using gamma camera imaging in participants with different levels of kidney
      function. Gamma camera imaging is a non-invasive nuclear scan that is used to look at organs
      and tissues inside the body. An imaging agent or tracer is a radioactive chemical
      intravenously injected into your body which lights up cells, tissues and organs. The study
      will evaluate the safety of a single injection of [I-123]-OIH and compare the imaging results
      and the calculated renal function values (using blood tests) to those of [Tc-99m]-MAG3 . 90
      participants are required to complete this study.
