      effective treatments for neuropathic pain in children; however we do not know which drug is
      more effective for specific pain conditions or for specific children. This study will be the
      first prospective, randomized double-blind controlled trial directly comparing gabapentin and
      amitriptyline for the treatment of neuropathic pain in a paediatric population. We will also
      study the time course for pain reduction and evaluate changes in children's physical
      function, mood, and sleep. This information is needed to determine which drug is better for
      which children and which pain conditions.
