      Methods :

        -  Multicentric retrospective observational epidemiological study based on the collection
           of data from patient records.

        -  Selection of voluntary hospital sites in regions with excess mortality during the
           epidemic phase.

        -  Systematic identification of Covid-19 cases from coding data (PMSI) from the medical
           information departments which will be compared with the numbers of patients followed for
           lymphoma in the haematology departments of each site during the 6 months preceding the
           epidemic, identified through the PMSI.

        -  Establishment of an ad hoc CRF for cases only with collection of clinical data
           concerning lymphoma and Covid-19 and routine biological data: Cytopenia (and in
           particular depth of lymphopenia), hypogammaglobulinemia, inflammatory markers.

        -  Estimated total number of sites: 10-15 and number of cases to be collected: 50-60.
