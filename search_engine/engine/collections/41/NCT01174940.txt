      bone marrow transplant (BMT) or peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplant will prevent the
      development of GvHD. This study is not designed to detect a specific treatment effect.
      However, some statements about the outcome of the study are possible. A sample size of n = 21
      patients could detect a statistically significant difference between the expected rate of
      GvHD in an untreated population, 60%, and our hypothesized rate, 30%, for the
      matched-unrelated recipients. This calculation is based on a one-sample, two-sided chi-square
      test at the 5% level of significance with 80% power.

      Patients will receive ECP from day -10 and day -8 before transplant and then from day of
      engraftment absolute neutrophil count (ANC>500) until day 90 after transplant. Patients who
      enter the study will receive a BMT or PBSC transplant from a donor who is matched unrelated
      (8/10 to 10/10 match). Rates of acute GvHD and chronic GvHD that occur in patients are 50-70%
      for the matched-unrelated donor transplant.

      The choice of sample size is 21 patients. The analysis will determine if there are favorable
      trends for a treatment effect. Comparison on survival, and rates of acute and chronic GvHD
      will be made with historical controls who have undergone similar myeloablative transplant
      from an unrelated donor.
