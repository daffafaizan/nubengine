    
      The study aims to provide preliminary information on the performance of the peripheral
      intravenous catheter (PIVC) device,

        -  assess how blood collection through different catheters over time effects device
           performance, and

        -  assess the quality of the blood that is collected through those catheters. Four
           variations of the BD Nexiva PIVC will be used in this study. Participants will be
           randomised by gauge of peripheral intravenous catheter (PIVC) device into the lower arm
           cephalic vein of both arms. PIVC indwell time will be monitored up to 72 hrs (removal at
           72 hrs or upon inability to flush/aspirate). Blood will be collected Day 1 throughout
           the remainder of indwell time.

      Each participant will complete 6 visits: a Screening Visit (V1), PIVC in situ (V2-V5) and
      follow-up (V6).

      The in-situ catheter positions will be compared to the expected tip position based on the
      catheter lengths. Blood collected will be analysed for haemolysis.

      As both device length and gauge are expected to influence haemolysis the study design enables
      evaluation of both design features.
