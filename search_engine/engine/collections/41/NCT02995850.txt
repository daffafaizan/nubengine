      poor prognosis because systemic chemotherapy is unlikely to accumulate in peritoneal nodules
      in cytotoxic concentrations. Cytoreductive surgery (CRS) along with hyperthermic
      intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) has been suggested to improve survival in select
      patients with limited peritoneal spread, resulting in a median overall survival (OS) of 8 to
      14 months. It remains unclear, however, which regimen is best and who have benefits from CRS
      and HIPEC. Herein, we has conducting prospective phase Ib/II trial of CRC and HIPEC with
      intraperitoneal paclitaxel and cisplatin, and oral S-1 in gastric cancer with peritoneal
      metastasis.
