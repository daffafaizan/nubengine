    
      This is a randomized controlled trial to determine whether there is a difference in the rate
      of preterm birth among women with twin pregnancies whose clinicians are aware of transvaginal
      ultrasound cervical length measurements compared to those managed without this information.
      The study group had transvaginal cervical length ultrasound monthly from 16-28 weeks and were
      managed with a standard algorithm for activity restriction and cerclage depending on the
      cervical length. The control group had digital cervical exams and routine transvaginal
      cervical length ultrasound was not utilized. The primary outcome was the mean length of
      gestation. Secondary outcomes included percentage of deliveries < 35 weeks, maternal and
      neonatal outcomes.
