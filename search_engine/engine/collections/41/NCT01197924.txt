      according to the cognitive tasks. Among patients, the relative difficulty to carry out the
      tasks of working memory should be accompanied by a recruitment of the dorso-side cortex
      préfrontal, lower and parietal frontal cortex but also of the median frontal areas such as
      the additional driving surface, the former cingulum. Moreover, one deterioration of the
      engagement of the cérébello-cerebral network (left lower parietal cortex and cérébelleux
      cortex lower right) facilitating the execution of these tasks should be observed.
