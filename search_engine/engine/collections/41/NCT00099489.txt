      neuropathy of unknown origin. The etiology is not well understood but is presumed to be
      immunological. Evidence for this comes from observed similarities to Guillain-Barre syndrome
      and from the favorable response with immunomodulatory treatments.

      CIDP is a peripheral nervous system demyelinating neuropathy that is sometimes a corollary
      disorder to the central nervous system demyelination of multiple sclerosis (MS. The precise
      mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis are uncertain, but a number of those mechanisms
      support a potential role for immunomodulatory treatments such as interferon beta (e.g.,
      Biogen Idec Inc.'s AVONEX).

      The rationale for the use of AVONEX in CIDP derives from observations on the pathogenesis of
      the condition and its similarities to MS, the mechanism of action of AVONEX, clinical trials
      that have been performed in CIDP that support a role for IFN-beta, and the unmet need that
      currently exists because of availability and safety issues with existing therapies.

      This Phase 2b study is a dose-ranging study designed to provide scientific evidence regarding
      the safety and efficacy of AVONEX in CIDP. In addition, the study aims to demonstrate the
      responsiveness and clinical relevance of changes in the MRC sum score and ODSS in CIDP
      patients.
