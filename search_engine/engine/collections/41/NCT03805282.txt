    
      Ideal patient weight in kg will be considered.

      Initial dose will be 0.5mg/kg.h and dose-change steps of 0.5mg/kg.h will occur depending on
      the incidence of emergence cough in the previous patient of the same group:

        -  It will increase if coughed in a probability of 95%

        -  It will decrease if not coughed in a probability of 5%.

        -  It will remain the same otherwise. Maximum dose will be 3mg/kg.h. All patients will
           receive remifentanil 0.025mcg/kg.min continuous infusion until extubation.

      Patients groups will be determined by sex and age group (18-60 or >60 years old), therefore,
      four independent groups will be studied:

        -  Female 18 to 60 years old

        -  Male 18 to 60 years old

        -  Female > 60 years old

        -  Male > 60 years old
