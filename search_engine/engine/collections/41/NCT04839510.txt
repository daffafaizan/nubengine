      evaluate the safety and preliminarily efficacy of MRG002. Based on the initial safety and
      efficacy data obtained from the Phase IIa, the study design of second stage Phase IIb
      single-arm study either will be continued or the trail will be terminated. If the Phase IIa
      data support the continuation of the study, in the second stage, approximately an additional
