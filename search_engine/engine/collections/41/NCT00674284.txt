      response for stress. This homeostasis is maintained by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
      (HPA) axis. However, inadequate response as corticosteroid insufficiency in critically ill
      patients is reported with increasing frequency, especially in severe sepsis and septic shock.
      Thus, corticosteroids could be beneficial for septic shock or severe acute illness.

      Once considered as normal adrenal function, adrenal insufficiency may developed later with
      chronic critical illness as adrenal exhaustion syndrome. It is easily overlooked and is
      possible due to the chronic secretion of systemic cytokines or other HPA axis-suppressive
      substances. There is still no consensus how often adrenal function testing should be
      repeated, although a re-evaluation should be considered if clinical symptoms and signs
      suggest adrenal insufficiency or deteriorating clinical condition.
