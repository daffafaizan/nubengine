    
      This is a Phase 2, therapeutic-exploratory, adaptive design, open-label, multicenter,
      multinational study evaluating neratinib monotherapy and neratinib plus temsirolimus
      combination therapy in patients with NSCLC and documented somatic HER2 mutations. Patients
      randomized at study entry into 1 of 2 treatment arms:

        -  Arm A: neratinib 240 mg orally once daily

        -  Arm B: neratinib 240 mg orally once daily plus temsirolimus 8 mg once weekly by
           intravenous (IV) infusion

      In the case of disease progression, patients initially assigned to neratinib monotherapy arm
      given option to add temsirolimus 8 mg IV once weekly.

      Patients on combination therapy given option to dose-escalate temsirolimus to 15 mg/week at
      the end of first cycle of treatment, if well tolerated and at the physician's discretion. If
      neratinib 240 mg/day plus temsirolimus 15 mg/week dose not well tolerated, patient
      subsequently dose reduced back to neratinib 240 mg/day plus temsirolimus 8 mg/week.

      Dosing continuous on nominal 3-week cycles until evidence of progressive disease,
      unacceptable toxicity, or patient withdrawal of consent.

      Disease measured radiographically at baseline and every 6 weeks until disease progression or
      withdrawal from the study.
