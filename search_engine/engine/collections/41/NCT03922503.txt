      have been detected through clinical and radiographic examination in 18- 51 % of patients with
      periodontitis. They are often associated with persistent deep pockets and bleeding following
      conventional periodontal treatment. Complex regenerative periodontal therapy is advocated for
      management of these defects. The outcomes of regenerative periodontal therapy are positively
      correlated with the morphology of osseous defects. Non-contained defects are prevalent
      clinically and have been reported to have a low regenerative potential.
