    
      The UK FSHD Patient Registry (https://www.fshd-registry.org/uk/) aims to recruit any
      individual, from anywhere within the United Kingdom, with a diagnosis of FSHD who may be
      interested in becoming involved in future planned clinical trials. The registry is sponsored
      by Muscular Dystrophy UK. Participants may be referred to the registry by health care
      professionals, genetic testing/laboratory centres who are aware of the registry.
      Alternatively, a participant may have discovered the registry via promotional activities or
      by their own online searches. After completing the consent process, participants are able to
      enter information on to the registry platform (note all forms are also available offline as
      well). This is an ongoing database and all participants will invited to update their
      information on an annual basis.

      The dataset is divided into two main sections:

        1. Mandatory items (Demographic information, genetic test result, clinical diagnosis, motor
           function and wheelchair use) and

        2. Highly encouraged items (Use of invasive and non-invasive ventilation, age of onset,
           retinal vascular disease, hearing loss, scapular fixation, pregnancy, family history,
           ethnic origin and other registry participation).

      The database is designed to be self reporting, however where specialised clinical or genetic
      information is required, the neuromuscular specialist in charge of the participants care can
      be invited to provide some additional information. The participant is able to select a health
      care provider from a pre-populated list at registration stage, if they wish to (optional
      feature). This information is included in the patient information and consent. Relevant R&D
      approval has been sought.
