      study days about 4.5 hours each. After a simple-carbohydrate standard dinner, the subjects
      have to do an overnight fast until the next morning. Subjects will receive fixed equisweet
      doses of sucrose (33.5g), erythritol (50g), sucralose (0.0558g), or water as oral pre-loads
      in a blinded, randomized (counterbalanced) fashion (t = -15 min). Fifteen minutes after the
      administration (t = 0 min), a standard solid test meal will be presented and ad libitum
      calorie intake will be measured. The end of the test meal will be after 20 minutes or as soon
      as the subject stops eating for more than 5 minutes. Blood samples (to measure: glycemic
      control and GI hormones) will be collected at t = -16, t = -1, t = 15, t = 30, t = 60, t =
      90, t = 120, t = 150, t = 180 min and appetite-related sensation rating will be collected at
      t = -16, t = -1, t = 15, t = 30, t = 60, t = 90, t = 120, t = 150, t = 180 min. GI symptoms
      and nausea are assessed at t = -16, -1, 30, 60, 120 and 180 min. At t = -10 min subjects are
      asked to rate the perceived sweetness and liking of the pre-load and at t = 180 min the
      perceived liking of the test meal.
