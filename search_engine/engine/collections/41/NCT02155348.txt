      monofocal IOL implantation, aiming for emmetropia or low myopia, leads to high levels of
      patient satisfaction in distance vision, spectacle dependence for reading and other near
      vision tasks is the usual result.

      The current technique available to surgeons to reduce spectacle dependence is to use
      bilateral multifocal IOLs. However, a variable number of patients do complain of problems
      with glare, haloes and lights especially in the hours of darkness (dysphotopsia symptoms).
      Dysphotopsia symptoms may vary significantly from patient to patient. The real incidence of
      dysphotopsia like symptoms after cataract surgery and multifocal IOL is unknown 6 and the
      implantation of multifocal IOLs is a commonly accepted contraindication in patients who are
      night drivers.

      Another option to allow spectacle independence is monovision. Monovision is where one eye can
      see clearly in the distance and the other eye is intentionally made short-sighted so that it
      has either near reading vision (full monovision) or intermediate (arms length) or distance
      vision (limited monovision). Monovision has two major advantages, very little dysphotopsia
      and it is cheaper compared to multifocal IOLs. However, disadvantages are a reduced
      stereopsis and there is a need for neuroadaptation.

      The rationale of this trial was to compare bilateral multifocal intraocular lenses (MIOLs)
      with monovision after cataract surgery concerning visual function and spectacle independence.
