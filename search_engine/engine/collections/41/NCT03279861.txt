      ACC/AHA stage D congestive heart failure (CHF). Despite longevity and improved quality of
      life, LVAD-supported patients are plagued with adverse events, the most debilitating of all
      is stroke. Ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes have been associated with hypertension (mean
      arterial pressure, or MAP > 90 mmHg) in addition to out-of-range INR and aspirin doses.
      Strict blood pressure control has been shown in a recent randomized trial to confer a
      significant decline in stroke rates of patients implanted with the Heartware LVAD. Patients
      with poorly controlled hypertension are also at risk for inadequate left-ventricular
      unloading and worsening CHF due to the exquisite sensitivity to afterload of the continuous
      flow LVAD.

      There are no guidelines for the use of anti-hypertensives in LVAD patients. Most are started
      on standard CHF therapies, though this practice varies greatly across LVAD centers. The
      angiotensin receptor blocker-neprilysin inhibitor sacubitril-valsartan (Entresto) is a potent
      anti-hypertensive mediation that was recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration
      for the treatment of patients with heart failure and low ejection fraction. We aim to
      randomly assign patients to receive Entresto or usual anti-hypertensive therapy for blood
      pressure control, then crossover to the other arm after 30 days. Daily blood pressure
      measurements will be performed and correlated with LVAD pump flows and waveform analysis.
