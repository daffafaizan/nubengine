      neuromodulation technology, has been recommended for the treatment of patients with
      refractory OCD in multinational guidelines. However, due to the treatment setting and the
      patient's feature, nearly half of the patients have no significant changes after rTMS
      treatment.

      In order to better predict the outcome of rTMS and improve the treatment efficiency, this
      project intends to look for markers that have a predictive effect at baseline or early
      treatment. Electroencephalogram (EEG) is a cheap and fast method that usually occurs before
      the symptoms change, thus it is possible to determine whether the patient has responded to
      the intervention.

      In this project, the supplementary motor area (SMA) is selected as the stimulation target.
      The individual head magnetic resonance image positioning and navigation and rTMS compatible
      real-time EEG acquisition technology are used to monitor the resting state of EEG and rTMS
      single pulse stimulation and changes in neural networks before and after treatment. This is a
      preliminary exploration looking for effective predictive indicators of efficacy in EEG and
      the relationship between EEG and symptoms changes. In order to lay the foundation for further
      research and guide clinical treatment.
