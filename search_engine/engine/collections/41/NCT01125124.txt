      the procedure of choice for symptomatic control, with talc as the sclerosing agent of choice.
      However, the occurrence of severe adverse effects associated with its use has led to the
      search for other agents.

      Silver nitrate poses an option, presenting excellent results in animal models and having
      successful usage in pleurodesis in the past. Although important, the current literature on
      the effective use of silver nitrate for pleurodesis is still too scarce, and a deeper
      knowledge on the occurrence of adverse side effects, especially pain, is still necessary to
      allow the substance to be considered as an effective alternative to talc, as well as for the
      definition of an adequate dosage.
