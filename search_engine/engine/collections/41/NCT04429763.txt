    
      Objetive:

      Evaluate the effect of MSC derived from human umbilical cord compared with placebo, over the
      clinical progresion and mortality of hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

      Metodology:

      Fase II, controled clinical trial, double blinded, compared with placebo, with paralel
      groups, and one to one asignation. It will be included patients between 18 and 79 years old,
      hositalized in general room (respiratory isolation area) with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis.
      It will be excluded those who have indication for management in Intensive Care Unit, have any
      condition that seriusly affect their survival, pregnant whomen or breast feeding, those who
      have an advanced hearth failure, HIV infected, those who have a bacterial or fungal
      uncontroled infection, those who require permanent immunosupresive therapy or have had an
      organ trasplant, those who have no possibility to sign the informed consent format or are
      involved in another clinical trial with drugs or interventions.

      It will vinculate 30 patients randomly assigned, by centralized electronic assignation
      sequence, for the experimental group who will received 1*10^6 cells/Kg extracted from human
      umbilical cord or to placebo group.

      The primary result it will be a composed point of time to the occurrence of the clinical
      detriment or the death (the first that occurs) and the secondary result will be the
      components of each primary point, the clinical recovery, the time to the time to the
      discharge from the hospital, and the clinical follow-up, including respiratory function, and
      markers of inflammation, haematological and kidney, in addition of the safety markers.

      It will be done a comparison of the incidence rates, by ratio of incidence rates and their
      respective confidence interval. It will be construct Kaplan-Meier curves that will compared
      by the statics of logaritmic rank (log-rank test).

      It will be developed a multivariate analysis, with the Cox proportional risks methodology,
      estimating the Hazard Ratio epidemiologic.
