      approximately 40,000 Americans.Conventional chemotherapy has achieved limited control of this
      disease but studies have reported improved response rates for patients who are treated with
      dose-intense therapy and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. This Phase I/II
      study will investigate the potential of combination therapy of dose-intense melphalan with
      escalating doses of bortezomib.
