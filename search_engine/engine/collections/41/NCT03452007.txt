      consistently ranks as a top priority issue in the spinal cord injury population. Bladder
      dysfunction may manifest as detrusor hyperreflexia (bladder contractions at low volumes,
      causing incontinence and smooth muscle hypertrophy), detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia
      (uncoordinated bladder and external urethral sphincter contractions, causing inefficient
      emptying and smooth muscle hypertrophy), decreased compliance (unable to store urine under
      appropriately low pressures) and loss of continence, requiring lifelong management,
      maintenance, and health care visits. Current therapeutic approaches aim to manage both the
      storage and voiding phases of bladder function and include intermittent catheterization,
      pharmacologic and surgical interventions. While most of these strategies are necessary for
      urological maintenance post-injury they oftentimes are associated with side effects and
      therefore remain inadequate. Therapies addressing recovery of function are still needed. The
      use of spinal cord epidural stimulation is a promising alternative approach to addressing the
      primary phases of bladder dysfunction. Additionally, the effects of spinal cord epidural
      stimulation on bladder alone is not known as its use has been directed towards the locomotor
      system. Thus, the overall objective of this study is to perform functional mapping in order
      to identify the spinal cord epidural stimulation configurations (anode/cathode selection,
      amplitude, frequency and pulse width) at the lumbosacral level that can promote neural
      control of bladder storage (capacity) and bladder emptying (voiding efficiency) after spinal
      cord injury.
