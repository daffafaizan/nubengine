      Treatment as Usual. The SH+ has been developed by WHO and collaborators working in the
      humanitarian field, with expertise in global mental health and psychosocial interventions.
      SH+ consists of a pre-recorded audio course, delivered by facilitators in a group setting and
      complemented with an illustrated self-help book. SH+ was designed to be relevant for large
      adversity-affected populations: it is transdiagnostic, easily adaptable to different cultures
      and languages, and both meaningful and safe for people with and without mental disorders. The
      format of SH+ is innovative in that it seeks to ensure that key intervention components are
      delivered as intended without the burden of extensive facilitator training. SH+ programme is
      based on acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), a form of cognitive-behavioral therapy,
      with distinct features. SH+ programme has two components: a pre-recorded course and an
      illustrated self-help book. Pre-recorded audio material (culturally adapted) is delivered
      across five 2-hour sessions to groups of up to 30 people. The audio material imparts key
      information about stress management and guides participants through individual exercises and
      small group discussions. To augment the audio recordings, an illustrated self-help book
      reviews all essential content and concepts 19. Written manuals help briefly-trained,
      non-specialist facilitators to conduct the course using the pre-recorded audio. The SH+
      intervention will be delivered by briefly-trained, non-specialist facilitators.

      The control intervention will receive Enhanced Treatment as Usual.
