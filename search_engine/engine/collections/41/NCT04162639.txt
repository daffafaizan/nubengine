      the burns with grafts of the patient's own skin. This is the usual care for these types of
      burn injuries recommended by burn surgeons. This skin is applied in the operating room and
      removed after several days. During that time, the body's immune system will make antibodies
      to the skin. Normally, these antibodies are harmless. However, extra antibodies can make it
      difficult to find donors for transplants. The results of this study will be used to better
      understand how to treat a subset of burn patients with very severe burns in a way that allows
      them to receive tissue transplants (e.g. face transplants, hand transplants).
