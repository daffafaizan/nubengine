      physician has decided to initiate psoriasis treatment with anti-TNFs in accordance with
      Turkish Ministry of Health regulations and reimbursements. (Tumor necrosis factor inhibitors
      can be used for the treatment of moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis in adult
      patients who failed to respond to or who have a contraindication to, or are intolerant to
      other systemic therapy including cyclosporine, methotrexate or Psoralen Ultra-Violet A.
      Patients should be screened for latent tuberculosis and appropriate anti-tuberculosis
      prophylaxis must be initiated if latent tuberculosis is diagnosed). This is a national,
      multi-center, observational, prospective photographic atlas study in patients who are treated
      with tumor necrosis factor inhibitors for moderate to severe psoriasis in daily clinic
      according to Turkish regulations and reimbursement. Demographic data will be collected by the
      investigator at the beginning of the study. Every participant will be examined by the
      investigator and the Psoriasis Area Severity Index will be determined at the beginning of the
      study and at weeks 4, 8, 16 and 24. Each patient will be asked to fill out the Dermatology
      Life Quality Index at each visit. Each patient will be asked to fill out the Work
      Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire: Psoriasis at the beginning and last visit
      (week 24). A standardized set of photographs will be taken at the beginning of the study and
      at weeks 4, 8, 16 and 24 by a dermatologist trained about standardized photograph positioning
      and settings. Psoriasis Area Severity Index, Dermatology Life Quality Index and Photographic
      scores will be statistically analyzed separately in order to evaluate treatment response.
