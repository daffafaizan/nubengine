    
      The study will be conducted in subjects who qualify as "sub-responders" to Lucentis, Avastin
      or Eylea meaning that each subject has (i) residual subretinal or intra-retinal fluid
      observed on Cirrus or Spectralis Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT), (ii)
      leakage on fluorescein angiogram (FA), and (iii) an average central subfield thickness of
      ≥250 μm. Additionally, each subject will have previously received a minimum of 3
      intravitreous (IVT) injections of Lucentis, Avastin or Eylea within the 12-month period prior
      to screening. Screening must occur between 28 and 65 days from the subject's last Lucentis or
      Avastin treatment or between 42 and 79 days from the subject's last Eylea treatment. Subjects
      must be dosed within 14 days of screening, and as of the day of initial study treatment (Day
      0), meet the following criteria: (i) Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS)
      Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of ≥25 and ≤73 letters (approximately 20/320 and 20/40 on
      the Snellen scale), (ii) residual subretinal or intra-retinal fluid observed on Cirrus or
      Spectralis SDOCT, and (iii) leakage on FA.
