      min after reperfusion, at the end of surgery and the following morning. In addition the
      investigators are placing a renal venous catheter where blood samples will be up taken as
      mentioned above for the analysis of endothelial markers together with markers for kidney
      damage.

      The first 10 patient will act as part of a pilot study, where only measurement of the
      endothelial and renal failure markers will be performed.
