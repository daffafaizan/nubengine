      In addition to the water/fat ratio in bone marrow there are also other parameters for
      quantitative MRI assessment. These include the apparent diffusion coefficient (ACD), the T1
      relaxation time, mapping of the macromolecular proton fraction. The undoubted advantage of
      MRI is its non-invasiveness and the ability to assess any localization of the bone marrow.

      MRI may become a new non-invasive method for assessing the cellularity of the bone marrow in
      children with oncohematological diseases.
