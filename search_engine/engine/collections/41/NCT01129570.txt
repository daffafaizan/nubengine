      been shown to have antioxidant, anti inflammatory, and hepatoprotective properties. It may
      also have direct anticancer effects through inhibition of growth factors and promotion of
      cell cycle arrest. MT has been shown to improve LFTs in several studies of patients with
      cirrhosis. To our knowledge, there have been no published trials evaluating the clinical
      efficacy of MT in advanced HCC. We therefore propose a phase I study to identify the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) of silybinphosphatidylcholine (a commercially available preparation with
      increased bioavailability), in patients with advanced HCC. We will use a traditional dose
      escalation, open label design with a study intervention period of 3 months, followed by one
      year of observation, with a maximum total of 30 subjects, evaluating a dose range between 1
      to 12 gm Siliphos. The data obtained from this study will be utilized in the future to
      evaluate MT efficacy in reducing liver function tests in advanced HCC, which will have
      significant implications in its use as a potential adjunctive agent in patients with
      currently limited treatment options.
