    
      A total number of 120 healthy subjects (with an approximate 1:1 female:male ratio) are
      planned to be randomised.

      Day 1: a baseline ECG profile. Day 1: Group 1 will receive prucalopride, Group 2a will
      receive moxifloxacin, and Group 2b will receive placebo.

      On Day 5 (steady-state level is reached), a full ECG assessment day will be performed,
      enabling the comparison of prucalopride 2 mg with placebo.

      Subsequently, the number of tablets will be escalated in all groups (blinded) with 1 tablet a
      day up to 5 tablets.

      On Day 13 (steady state for the supratherapeutic dose level of 10 mg of prucalopride) another
      ECG assessment day will be performed, enabling a comparison of prucalopride 10 mg with
      placebo.

      Group 2b will receive a single dose of moxifloxacin on Day 15. All subjects will be
      discharged on Day 16. Subjects will remain in the CRU throughout the treatment period.

      All subjects will return for a follow-up visit on Day 30 (Â± 1 week) (approximately 14 days
      after the last dose).
