      ingest a sugar drink to assess gut permeability and gut function, and a protein meal to
      measure digestion/absorption and the anabolic response to food intake. Subjects will also
      receive a mixture of amino acids that are made a little heavier than normal, called stable
      isotopes. This stable isotopes is used to investigate protein behavior in the body (protein
      kinetics). Blood (100-120 ml in total) and urine samples will be collected over 7.5 hours.
