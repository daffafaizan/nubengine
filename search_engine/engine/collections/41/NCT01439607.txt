      defective activity of the glucocerebrosidase, leading to accumulation of glucocerebroside
      particularly in cells of the macrophage lineage. Clinical manifestations associate
      hematological, neurological and bone disorders.

      In this project, the investigators aimed to study the cellular and molecular mechanisms
      governing the biology of various cell populations of the bone marrow and blood in these
      patients in order to define their potential role in the physiopathology of the disease. The
      main research topics the investigators plan will then be focused on characterization and
      functional analysis of hematopoietic stem cells, mesenchymal stem cells (with a special focus
      on osteogenic differentiation), macrophages and osteoclastic differentiation, B lymphocytes
      and plasma cells.
