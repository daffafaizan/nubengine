      overconsumption. Snack foods can be substantial contributors to daily energy intake, with
      different types of snacks exerting potentially different effects on satiety per calorie
      consumed. The current study will compare the effect of consuming different snack foods on
      measures of appetite control including appetite sensations, energy intake and food hedonics
      in women with a weak satiety response.

      In a crossover design, female participants will consume three different mid-morning snacks:
      raw almonds, savoury crackers or water. Appetite sensations, energy intake, food reward and
      craving will be assessed under controlled laboratory conditions. Satiety responsiveness will
      be determined using the satiety quotient (SQ).
