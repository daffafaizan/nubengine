      training session with a modified waitlist control in a population of Hematopoietic cell
      transplantation (HCT) patients. We will secondarily explore effects of a brief storytelling
      intervention, with or without the prior HRVB training. Two group of 10 HCT patients over the
      age of 18 will be recruited and enrolled into the study. The time of participating in this
      study will be 2-week proposed activities from the time of enrollment to completion. Specific
      participation will include baseline data collection (about 30 minutes), HRVB training session
      (30 minutes), watching and discussing stories (15 min for each week= 30 minutes) and one
      final data collection (about 30 minutes) at the end. For HRVB group, participants will be
      instructed to practice their HRV biofeedback skills at home for 10 minutes each day for a
      two-week period (about 140 minutes). Lab visit is required only twice for baseline data
      collection and final data collection. Other works will be via internet.
