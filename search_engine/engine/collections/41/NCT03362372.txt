      benefits of the Mediterranean diet (DiMet) in preventing pulmonary dysfunction are not well
      known.

      Objective: To evaluate the effect of adherence to DiMet on the deterioration of lung function
      in smokers.

      Methodology: Design: Controlled, parallel, multicenter, cluster-randomized clinical trial.
      Participants: 566 active smokers with a cumulative consumption of more than 10 packets a
      year, within 25 to 75 year-old age group, without previous respiratory disease and who agree
      with the conditions of the study and sign an informed consent . Scope: 20 Primary Care
      Centers managed by the Catalan Health Institutes in Tarragona that will be randomly assigned
      to a control or an intervention group (1: 1). Intervention: During 2 years a nutritional
      intervention will be carried out to increase adherence to DiMet based on: 1) annual visit of
      personalized nutritional education, 2) annual telephone contact for intervention
      reinforcement, and 3) computer access to a dietary block designed ad hoc. The control group
      will follow their usual diet style. All participants will receive advice to quit smoking. It
      will be evaluated: a) pulmonary function by forced spirometry and b) adherence to the DiMet
      with a questionnaire of 14 items and biological determinations. Statistical analysis: For
      intention to treat. The unit of analysis will be the individual smoker. Parameters of
      pulmonary function and adherence to the DiMet of both groups will be compared.

      Expected results: DiMet prevents the appearance of altered lung function in smokers without
      previous respiratory pathology. Thus, DiMet will be key in pulmonary prevention, together
      with the fundamental recommendation of smoking cessation.
