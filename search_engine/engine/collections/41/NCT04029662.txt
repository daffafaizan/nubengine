      sensory, and autonomic blocks specifically for lower limbs by delivering local anesthetics
      into subarachnoid space. This technique is not difficult to perform and relatively
      inexpensive. However, spinal anesthesia may cause an intense pain during needle insertion.
      Valsalva maneuver is an attempt to force expiration by pushing a closed airway, such as
      covering nose or mouth. This maneuver can lead to anti-nociceptive stimulation and may
      decrease the pain. Thus, this study was aimed to observe the efficacy of Valsalva maneuver in
      reducing pain intensity during spinal needle insertion.
