      years old) who underwent sevoflurane or propofol general anesthesia for more than 3 hours
      from January 2018 to December 2018, and compare the preoperative and postoperative serum
      folate changes for retrospective analysis.

      Prospective studyï¼šTen infants and young children (less than 3 years old) who underwent
      general anesthesia from November 7, 2018 to December 31, 2018 in Shanghai Ninth People's
      Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine. Inhalation of 1-8%
      concentration of sevoflurane for general anesthesia induced intubation, followed by
      sevoflurane 2.0 ~ 2.5 Vol% inhalation maintenance, according to the intraoperative situation
      to add opioids. Patients maintained a bispectral index (BIS) monitoring between 50 and 60.
      After induction of general anesthesia in all patients, Serum folate levels were measured
      before the start of surgery, every 1 hour during surgery, and at the end of surgery.
