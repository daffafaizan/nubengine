      screening, consent discussion and MSPT test completion is estimated to take approximately an
      hour prior to the appointment with the treating physician. Participants begin with an
      instructional overview, which acquaints them with all elements of the MSPT. The tests will be
      performed in the same order and if a study participant elects to discontinue testing or skip
      a module, they will be asked to indicate the reasons on the screen. Each module has
      accompanying instructions.

      Upon completion of testing at first and last study visit, patients, research
      nurse/coordinator and treating physician will be asked to fill in a short satisfaction
      questionnaire related to the functionality of the MSPT.

      HCPs will have the ability to view de-identified longitudinal MSPT outcomes for each patient
      on the MSPT tool.

      De-identified data abstracted from each site will be stored in a cloud-based data repository.
      Access to the MSPT Cloud and data therein is restricted to the healthcare institution using
      the registered MSPT tool. The site will periodically send de-identified and encrypted
      aggregate data to Biogen.
