    
      This is an open label pilot study. Thirty patients with ESRD who qualify for emergent
      dialysis on the basis of serum potassium greater than 6mEq/L will be randomly assigned, using
      a random number generator in blocks of sixes, to standard-of-care (standard care) or
      patiromer group. Patients in the patiromer group will be given a single dose of 25.2g of
      patiromer in addition to standard-of-care treatment after randomization. Standard-of-care is
      defined as intervention or care provided by clinical provider according to individual
      practice pattern or hospital protocol. Each group of 15 patients will be observed with
      telemetry monitoring for 10 hours or till hemodialysis units become available for treatment
      (whichever comes first). Blood draws and electrocardiograms (ECGs) will be performed at
      enrollment and at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10hrs thereafter. Serum will be analyzed for basic
      metabolic panel and magnesium. Medications, including potassium lowering agents, administered
      during this period will be documented.

      1. Informed consent will be obtained. 2. Subject will be randomized. 3. A. Randomized to
      Standard of Care (SOC): data will be collected on SOC treatment. 3. B. Randomized to
      patiromer group: subjects will receive a single dose of 25.2g of patiromer. SOC data will be
      collected. 4. all subjects will have blood drawn and ECGs (1 12 lead ECG and 1 Lead I Rhythm
      strip) done at baseline, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 hours. Blood will be analyzed for basic
      metabolic panel and magnesium. 5. CRF completion-SOC data will be recorded in addition to
      current medications. 6. After subjects have received hemodialysis or reach the 10 hour study
      period, whichever comes first, the subject will be completed on the study.
