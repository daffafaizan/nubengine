      dose study to ascertain the Pharmacokinetics (PK) profile, safety and bronchodilator effect
      of RPL554 administered via dry powder inhaler (DPI). Five of the 6 treatment arms will be
      double-blind and one will be single-blind (due to the different number of capsules
      administered). Part B is a placebo-controlled, complete block cross-over, repeat dose study
      to assess the bronchodilator effect of repeat doses of RPL554 delivered via a DPI.
