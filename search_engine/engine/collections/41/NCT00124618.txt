    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

      * Determine the 11 month survival rate in older and/or poor performance status patients with
      stage IIIA or stage IIIB non-small cell lung cancer treated with cetuximab and radiotherapy.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the tumor response rate, overall survival, and time to disease progression in
           patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine whether fear of death is less severe in the oldest of patients treated with
           this regimen.

        -  Determine whether fear of death predicts survival of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive cetuximab IV over 1-2 hours on days 1,
      8, 15, 22, 29, 36, and 43. Beginning on day 8, patients receive concurrent radiotherapy once
      daily on days 8-12, 15-19, 22-26, 29-33, 36-40, and 43-47. Treatment continues in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed within 1 week, at 1 and 4 months,
      and then every 3 months for up to 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients will be accrued for this study within 20 months
