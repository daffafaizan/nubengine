      reservoirs remains a major barrier to curing human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)
      infection. Recently, the shock and kill strategy, by which HIV-1 reservoirs could be
      eradicated following reactivation of latent HIV-1 by latency-reversing agents (LRAs), has
      been extensively practiced. It is important to reestablish virus-specific and reliable immune
      surveillance to eradicate the reactivated virus-harboring cells.the VC-CAR-T cells
      effectively induced the cytolysis of LRA-reactivated HIV-1-infected CD4 T lymphocytes
      isolated from infected individuals receiving successful cART. Our previous study demonstrated
      that the special features of genetically engineered CAR-T cells make them a particularly
      suitable candidate for therapeutic application in efforts to reach a functional HIV cure. In
      this clinical trial, we intend to study the safety and effectiveness of CAR-T Cell Therapy on
      HIV patients whose plasma HIV has been successfully suppressed after cART, by observing the
      adverse events, HIV-1 reservoir and the immune index.
