      post-operative complications. It is estimated that between 25% to 80% of patients admitted to
      hospital for surgery experience pre-operative anxiety, and anxiety can negatively influence
      patient recovery.Physiologically pre-operative anxiety can lead to autonomic dysfunction and
      can modify inflammatory responses, platelet activity, and immunologic functioning. The Beck
      Anxiety Inventory(BAI), created by Aaron T. Beck is a 21 questions multiple choice self
      report inventory which measures the severity of an anxiety in adults and adolescents. It has
      been widely used in clinical research in mental health care mainly to measure general
      anxiety. The total score for all 21 symptoms can range between 0 and 63 points. A total score
      of 0 - 7 is interpreted as "Minimal" level of anxiety, 8 - 15 as "Mild"; 16 - 25 as
      "Moderate" and 26 - 63 as "Severe" level of anxiety.

      This study aims to compare the alleviation of Pre-operative anxiety in patients undergoing
      surgery with or without music.
