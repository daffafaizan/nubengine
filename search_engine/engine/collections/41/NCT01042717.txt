      This is a logistical problem, since plerixafor should be administered by a health care
      provider, given the risk of hypotension with administration. The primary purpose of this
      study is, in autologous donors with non-Hodgkins lymphoma and multiple myeloma undergoing
      hematopoietic progenitor cell mobilization with plerixafor and G-CSF, to determine whether
      the dosing interval can be increased to 16 hours prior to apheresis. Patients will be
      admitted to a special clinical research center on the 4th day of G-CSF administration, where
      the peripheral blood CD34+ count will be measured every 2 hours after plerixafor
      administration at 5 pm until 9 AM the following day, at which time apheresis will commence.
      The hypothesis is that plerixafor administration 16 hours prior to apheresis is as safe and
      effective as plerixafor administration at 11 hours prior to apheresis.
