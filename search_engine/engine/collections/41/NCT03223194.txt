      Syndrome. Subjects will receive a single dose of AT342 delivered intravenously. A maximum of
      3 dose levels of AT342 are planned for evaluation in this study. Up to four subjects will be
      enrolled at each dose level including up to 1 subject at each dose level randomized to
      control with delayed administration of the investigational product. Dose escalation to the
      next dose level will be considered after evaluation of at least 4 weeks of data from subjects
      dosed at the current dose level. One of the dose levels will be chosen for dose expansion,
      and the chosen dose will be administered to all delayed-treatment control subjects.

      The primary efficacy endpoint measure of change in total serum bilirubin will be assessed at
      weeks 12 (whilst still on phototherapy) and week 18 (after phototherapy has been weaned)
      after administration of AT342; and the primary efficacy endpoint measure of change in number
      of hours of phototherapy will be assessed at week 18

      This study will utilize an independent Data Monitoring Committee that will monitor subject
      safety and provide recommendations to Audentes regarding dose escalation, dose expansion, and
      safety matters.
