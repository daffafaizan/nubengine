    
      Primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of durvalumab + tremelimumab + EP
      treatment compared with EP and the efficacy of durvalumab + EP treatment compared with EP in
      terms of OS.

      All patients will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio in a stratified manner according to the
      planned platinum-based therapy for Cycle 1 (cisplatin or carboplatin) to receive treatment
      with durvalumab + tremelimumab + EP (Arm 1), durvalumab + EP (Arm 2), or standard of care- EP
      (Arm 3). Arm 1 and Arm 2 patients receive the treatment until confirmed disease progression
      while Arm 3 patients receive up to 6 cycles of EP and prophylactic cranial irradiation if
      clinically indicated, at the Investigators' discretion.Patients who have discontinued
      treatment due to toxicity or symptomatic deterioration, clinical progression, or who have
      commenced subsequent anticancer therapy will be followed up until confirmed disease
      progression and for survival.

      Targeted population are adult patients (aged ≥18 years) with histologically or cytologically
      documented extensive disease (American Joint Committee on Cancer Stage (7th edition) IV SCLC
      [T any, N any,M1 a/b]), or T3-4 due to multiple lung nodules that are too extensive or have
      tumor/nodal volume that is too large to be encompassed in a tolerable radiation plan.
      Patients must have WHO/ECOG performance status of 0 or 1.

      Tumor assessments will be performed at Screening as baseline with follow-up at Week 6 ±1 week
      from the date of randomization, at Week 12 ±1 week from the date of randomization, and then
      every 8 weeks ±1 week until confirmed objective disease progression.

      An independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) comprised of independent experts will be
      convened to confirm the safety and tolerability of the proposed dose and schedule of
      durvalumab ± tremelimumab in combination with platinum based chemotherapy at two early stages
      of enrolment.
