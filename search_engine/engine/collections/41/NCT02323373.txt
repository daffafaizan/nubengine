      dose and administration route of the drug in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is under
      investigation.

      The objective of this randomized clinical trial was to verify differences between topical and
      intravenous administration of TA in TKA regarding blood loss and coagulation variables.

      Patients undergoing TKA were randomized to receive TA intravenously (20 mg in 100 ml of
      saline), topically (1.5 g in 50 ml of saline, sprayed over the operated site, before closure)
      or intravenous saline (100 ml). Suction drains were maintained for 48 hours, in order to
      measure blood loss. Data analysis is being undertaken now, in order to compare the two routes
      of administration of the drug.
