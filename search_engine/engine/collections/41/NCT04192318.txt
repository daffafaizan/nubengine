      Care (CTC Plus) will see greater improvements than youth who either receive BTG only, CTC
      Plus only or no intervention. This study will allow researchers to learn more about the
      intervention's effectiveness for a range of violent outcomes. It will also help researchers
      understand if violence prevention efforts affect other behaviors, such as drug use and rates
      of violent re-injury.

      Participants will be asked to complete surveys about their behavior, personality, and
      experiences, and their parent/child's personality, behavior, and experiences. These surveys
      take about 45-60 minutes to complete. These questionnaires will be completed before the
      intervention has taken place and then again 6 months later. Participation in this study will
      last up to 6 months. Approximately 408 individuals will participate in this study.
