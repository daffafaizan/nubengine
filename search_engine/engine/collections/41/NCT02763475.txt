    
      Hypothesis:

      NK cells are the natural defence against cancer cells. Thus, supplementing compatible NK
      cells from a related donor might increase the probability to eliminate any residual
      chemotherapy resistant cell in Acute myelogenous leukemia patients.

      Description:

      NK cells will be donated from a compatible family member who has a certain genetic code in
      their blood, called HLA, which partly matches patient genetic code, reducing any potential
      rejection. Interleukin-2 is co administrated during NK cell treatment to improve
      effectiveness.

      Methodology:

      The day that patient receive first NK cell infusion is called day 0. The days before are
      called minus days (-D). Conversely, the days after NK cell infusion are called plus days
      (+D).

      Study administration

        -  After standard chemotherapy treatment against acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and
           restoration of haematologic normal levels, patients will receive a 60mg/kg of
           cyclophosphamide (day -6) and five daily intravenous cycles 25 mg/m2 of the
           chemotherapic fludarabine every day (day -5, -4, -3, -2, -1).

        -  Day 0 will be settled from 24h to 48h after fludarabine treatment completion. NK cells
           will be intravenous administered twice (day 0 and day 7). The first dose of NK cells
           (day 0) will contain up to 5x10^7 cells/kg with immunophenotype NK (CD3-CD56+). The
           second dose might be higher (up to 5x10^8 cells/kg) in case of no treatment related
           toxicity after first NK injection. In any case, no more than 1x10^6 cells/kg with an
           immunophenotype T (CD56-CD3+) will be administrated.

        -  From day 0, IL-2 1x10^6 UI/m2 subcutaneous will be administrated three times a week
           during two weeks.

      Study visits

      Before and after the treatment a bone marrow aspirate will be analyzed in order to evaluate
      minimal residue disease (cytology, cytometry and/or molecular studies) at least one month
      after NK injection. objective response rate will be reevaluated at least once a year.

      Before treatment starts:

        -  Birthday, gender and personal medical history will be recorded

        -  physical examination, including measurement of the vital signs (temperature, heart and
           breathing rate, etcâ€¦)

        -  Blood and urine test

        -  Bone marrow aspirate in order to evaluate the basal disease

      On every visit

        -  Physical examination and vital signs will be recorded

        -  Adverse event form

        -  Other concomitant drugs

      After NK treatment

        -  It will be 11 visits on days +30, +60, +90, +180, +270, +360, +480, +600, +720, +900,
           +1080 which included a blood and urine test and Lansky/karnofsky scale.

        -  Additionally on days +30, +360, +720 and +1080 a bone marrow aspirate will be performed
           to evaluate relapse.

      Length of the study:

      Up to 35 AML patients will be included in the study during a 32 months recruitment period
      with a patient follow-up of thirty-six months. The maximum length of the study will be six
      years.
