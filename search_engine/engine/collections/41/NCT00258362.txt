      Primary

        -  Determine the time to progression in patients with stage III or IV or recurrent
           endometrial cancer treated with induction chemotherapy comprising carboplatin and
           docetaxel followed by radiotherapy and consolidation chemotherapy comprising carboplatin
           and docetaxel.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive docetaxel intravenous (IV) over 1 hour and carboplatin IV over 30
      minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 3 courses. After hematologic recovery
      from chemotherapy, patients receive radiotherapy 5 days a week for up to 7 weeks. Beginning
      3-4 weeks later, patients receive another 3 courses of docetaxel and carboplatin.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 2 years.
