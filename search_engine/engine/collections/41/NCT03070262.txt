      patients were diagnosed with advanced disease and suffered from the poor outcome.With the
      development of target therapy among cancers,the overall survival and life quality of patients
      has been continuous improved recently.However,there had little reports focusing on target
      therapy in esophageal cancer . Caffeic acid as an ordinary drug is used for thrombocytopenia
      when patient received chemotherapy. Newly studies shown caffeic acid can target inhibit GASC1
      expression, and GASC1 is confirmed to be a new oncogene in esophageal cancer.

      Aim: to investigate the efficiency and safety of caffeic acid in chinese advanced esophageal
      squamous cell cancer.

      Methods: 240 advanced ESCC patients will be randomized to two arms: Arm A (receiving coffeic
      acid treatment) or Arm B (placebo group). In Arm A, patients will receive coffeic acid
      treatment: 300mg, tid, po, continue to progress disease (PD) or die or the intolerant adverse
      events; in Arm B, the same shape placebo tablets will be deliveried to patients. 1 years
      follow-up for both groups patients.Patients in both arms can receive any other ways of anti
      cancer therapy in the same time.

      Primary endpoints: OS Second endpoints: PFS
