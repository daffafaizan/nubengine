      rate ranged between 30% to 50% in patients after initial hemostasis. Endoscopic cyanoacrylate
      injection is currently the choice of endoscopic therapy of acute gastric variceal bleeding
      and prevention of recurrent bleeding. However, the rebleeding rate is still high in the
      patients undergoing repeated endoscopic cyanoacrylate injection.

      Non-selective β-blockers are frequently used for the secondary prophylaxis of variceal
      bleeding. In the case of esophageal varices, combination of non-selective β-blockers and
      endoscopic therapy significantly lowers the rebleeding rate compared with endoscopic therapy
      alone. However, propranolol failed to decrease the rebleeding rate as an adjunct to
      endoscopic cyanoacrylate injection and was associated with a higher incidence of adverse
      effects in gastric variceal bleeding patients. A more potent non-selective β-blocker than
      propranolol might further decrease portal pressure and decrease the rebleeding rate.

      Carvedilol is a potent non-selective β-blocker with both beta and alpha-1 blocker effect. It
      significantly lowers portal pressure even in propranolol non-responders. However, it is
      unclear weather carvedilol will play a role in the prevention of recurrent gastric variceal
      bleeding. The investigators conducted a randomized controlled trial to compare the efficacy
      of carvedilol combined with endoscopic cyanoacrylate injection with endoscopic cyanoacrylate
      injection alone in secondary prophylaxis of gastric variceal bleeding.
