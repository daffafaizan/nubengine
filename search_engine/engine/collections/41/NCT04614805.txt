      myocardial infarction is below the national average and below recommendations. The aim of
      this study is to monitor outcomes, especially time to reperfusion, in ST-elevation acute
      myocardial infarction patients. The study period is supposedly lasting for approximately 4
      months, the time estimated to observe the clinical course of 100 patients. Before and during
      the study period, clinical leaders are encouraged to improve guideline adherence and to
      closely monitor the results of their own and collaborating institutions.
