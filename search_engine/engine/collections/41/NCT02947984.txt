           neck support, back support, etc.) will be made for the participant. A treatment planning
           CT will be performed and a radiation treatment plan will be based on this CT scan.

        -  The radiation dose will usually be given once a day, five days per week. The radiation
           treatment will take between 7 and 8 1/2 weeks, including treatment planning.

           the basis of random assignment. Participants will either receive the usual dose of 55.8
           CGE in 31 treatments or 1.8 CGE, or 63 CGE in 35 treatments of 1.8 CGE.
