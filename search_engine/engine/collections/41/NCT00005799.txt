    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether stable allogeneic engraftment from unrelated hematopoietic stem cell
      donors can be safely established using a non-myeloablative conditioning regimen in patients
      with hematologic malignancies and renal cell carcinoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate whether donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) can be safely used in patients with
      mixed or full donor chimerism to eliminate persistent or progressive disease.

      OUTLINE:

      CONDITIONING REGIMEN: Patients receive fludarabine phosphate intravenously (IV) on days -4 to
      -2. Patients also undergo low-dose total-body irradiation (TBI) on day 0.

      TRANSPLANTATION: Patients undergo allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) or bone marrow
      transplantation on day 0.

      IMMUNOSUPPRESSION: Patients receive cyclosporine orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days -3 to
      100 with taper to day 177 and mycophenolate mofetil PO BID on days 0-40 with taper to day 96.
      Patients with mixed chimerism, persistent or progressive disease, and no evidence of
      graft-versus-host disease and who have been off immunosuppression for at least 2 weeks
      undergo DLI over 30 minutes. DLI may be repeated every 65 days for up to 3 doses.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are follow-up periodically for 5 years.
