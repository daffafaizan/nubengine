      feeding with the New Chicco Bottles and breastfeeding were reached; these results allow to
      conclude that, considering feeding features related to growth and development, bottle-feeding
      with the new Chicco bottles can biomimic the suction muscular dynamics of breastfeeding.

      A proper growth is confirmed in bottle-feeding groups also by means of evaluations of growth
      parameters, and it is guaranteed by the evaluation of the oxygen saturation during feeding,
      that is similar among groups.

      As regards evaluation of colic underlying causes in infants ages 0-4 weeks it is possible to
      state that no differences were found in bottle-fed and breastfed infants: given the lack of
      differences between the groups, whichever the underlying reason for colic symptomatology
      could exist, it is possible to infer that using one or the other kind of feeding does not
      have an impact on symptoms, or had a minor one.

      As regards the product satisfaction evaluated comparing the bottle-fed groups positive
      results were reached in all the evaluation, at V2, Week 5 and Week 9, reaching always a mean
      score > 8.

      Notwithstanding the positive results above outlined a confirmatory study, envisaging a bigger
      sample size, it is advisable, to confirm and emphasize the results already achieved.

      For each trial participant the adverse events/serious adverse events occurrences and a brief
      clinical examination were assessed during Visits. No special or unusual features of the
      safety evaluations were found.
