      study will evaluate the effect of curcumin food supplement on gut microbiota of children with
      irritable bowel syndrome. Curcumin is a commonly used spice in Asian cooking and has a very
      good safety profile. Developing preparation of this compound for targeted delivery in the GI
      tract would provide a novel way to treat common FGID. This study will provide preliminary
      data for future studies to evaluate the role of gut microbiota in the pathophysiology of pain
      predominant FGID and how food supplements can be used to manipulate the microbiota.
