    
      This study is a prospective, uncontrolled, multicenter study to evaluate the safety and
      performance of select occipito-cervico-thoracic posterior fixation systems in patients who
      undergo posterior fixation fusion surgery. Consecutive patients at a given site who meet
      eligibility requirements will be asked to consent to participate in the study. These patients
      will present with traumatic, reconstructive, and/or tumor conditions in the craniocervical,
      cervical, and/or upper thoracic spine that are amenable to surgical treatment and will be
      screened prior to study enrollment. Once enrolled in the study, subjects will undergo
      posterior occipito-cervico-thoracic fixation surgery using one of the NuVasive posterior
      fixation systems (Vuepoint II OCT or Reline-C) based on the surgeon's standard of care. At
      least 150 subjects (a minimum of 75 in each implant arm) will be enrolled and will be
      followed for 24 months after the surgery.
