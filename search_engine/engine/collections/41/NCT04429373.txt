      effect of PRF in primary stability and bone/soft tissue healing around mandibular implants in
      edentulous elderly adults.

      Aim and purpose

        1. To assess the effect of PRF on primary implant stability of mandibular implants in
           edentulous patients using resonance frequency analysis (RFA).

        2. To evaluate the effect of PRF on clinical parameters related to soft tissue healing,
           post-surgical pain/inflammation and early complications of mandibular implants in
           edentulous patients.

        3. To examine soft tissues volumetric changes pre and post- surgery using intraoral scans
           and bone changes using cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) around mandibular implants
           in edentulous patients.
