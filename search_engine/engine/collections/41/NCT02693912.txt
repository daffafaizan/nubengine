      of pathogens, initiation of host defensive ang protective inflammation,and in clearance of
      pathogens from the airways. However, macrophages are also responsible for efficient clearance
      of apoptotic neutrophils, termed efferocytosis, which is a prerequisite for the timely
      resolution of inflammation. In this study, the investigators aim to observe the change in
      alveolar macrophage function during acute lung injury.
