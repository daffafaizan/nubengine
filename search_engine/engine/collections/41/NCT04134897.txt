      neoadjuvant radiotherapy in moderate risk CRM-negative rectal cancer patients. This is a
      prospective multicenter open-label non-inferiority randomized phase III clinical trial.
      Patients will be randomized using an online randomization system to receive either 4 cycles
      of neoadjuvant CapOx (oxaliplatin 130 mg/m2 iv day 1, capecitabine 2000 mg/m2 per os bid days
      1-14) chemotherapy, surgery and 4 cycles of adjuvant CapOx chemotherapy or 5x5 Gy
      radiotherapy, surgery and 8 cycles of adjuvant CapOx chemotherapy. A stratification will be
      performed based on сN stage and clinical center. Patients with сT3c-T3dN0-1M0, cT1-T3dN2M0
      cancer in the middle rectum are included. Chemoradiotherapy (50 Gy with concomitant
      capecitabine 825 mg/m2 per os bid on radiation days) will be performed for patients with
      tumor progression after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The main hypothesis is that the 2-year
      local recurrence rate is non-inferior after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and neoadjuvant
      radiotherapy in moderate risk mid rectal cancer patients. The target accrual is 158 patients
      in each treatment arm (including 10% potential data loss) based on non-recurrence rate of 98%
      in investigated and 96% in the control group with a non-inferiority margin of 3%, α=0,05,
      power 80%. An interim analysis is planned after 50% of the patients will reach a 2-year
      followup. Pelvic Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is performed in all patients for staging
      before and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and before surgery. Pelvic MRI is subject to
      central review. Conduction of this study and data collection are controlled by a local
      institutional board.
