      post-treatment outcomes in head and neck cancer survivors and caregivers by implementing a
      nutrition-focused mobile-Support program to prepare and support caregivers after treatment.

      Head and neck cancer survivors and their primary caregivers (N=25 dyads) will be recruited to
      a single-arm intervention study to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability and short-term
      effects of a nutrition-focused mobile support system. The intervention includes 1) a clinic
      visit (offered in-person or virtually) with a tablet-based needs assessment at the end of or
      after completing treatment which will generate 2) a tailored care plan with messages,
      educational materials and referrals mapped to survivor and caregiver-endorsed concerns and 3)
      a caregiver App with encouragement, reminders and tips delivered through messaging and peer
      videos. Participants will complete baseline and 6-week follow-up surveys.
