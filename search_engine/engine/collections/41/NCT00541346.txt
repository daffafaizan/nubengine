      co-morbid for ADHD. The subjects will receive 7 days of 10 mg of Daytrana. The children will
      be seen weekly for assessment for 4 weeks then every two weeks until the eight week period is
      complete. After each week of treatment, response will be reassessed and the dose will be
      increased stepwise to 15 mg, 20 mg, 30 mg unless there are excessive side effects, in which
      case, the dose will be reduced to the previous dose or the patch wear time may be revised.
