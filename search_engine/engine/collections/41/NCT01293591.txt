      participants will be randomly assigned to a sequence of dietary treatments. There will be a
      17-day washout period in between diet periods. Participants will consume a garlic-free diet
      for the first 10 days of each diet period. The dietary treatments will be administered on day
      11 of each diet period. Dietary treatments will be incorporated into food as follows: 1) 5 g
      (0.175 oz.) of garlic mixed with 15 g margarine on top of 270 kcal white bread, served as
      breakfast, or 2) 15 g margarine on top of 270 kcal white bread, served as breakfast.
