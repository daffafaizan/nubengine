      detection in tears and in cerebrospinal fluid. We will include patients with primary
      progressive multiple sclerosis and we will compare results of oligoclonal bands detection by
      isoelectric focusing in cerebrospinal fluid and tears. Tears will be collected using a
      Schirmer strip. This would circumvent the practice of invasive lumbar punctures currently
      used in multiple sclerosis diagnosis.
