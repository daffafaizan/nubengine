      cancer disorder Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS), can promote mitochondrial function both in
      patients and mouse models. In the course of our follow up studies, we encountered a LFS
      patient with a long-standing history of fatigue and muscle weakness of unclear etiology.
      Notably, we observed in vivo evidence of markedly decreased mitochondrial function in her leg
      skeletal muscle during exercise using noninvasive phosphorus-31 magnetic resonance
      spectroscopy (31P-MRS), a technique that has previously been used to study patients with
      primary mitochondrial disorders. The decrease in mitochondrial function was also confirmed by
      the patients skin fibroblasts in vitro using standard biochemical measurements.

      There is growing evidence that nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) homeostasis plays a
      significant role in maintaining the mitochondria through various mechanisms and that it is
      possible to improve mitochondrial function by dietary supplementation with the vitamin B3
      analogue nicotinamide riboside (NR), an intermediate in the NAD+ salvage pathway. Remarkably,
      we observed that culturing the LFS patients fibroblasts in medium containing NR rescued the
      severe deficit in mitochondrial respiration. While continuing our investigations into the
      molecular mechanism(s) underlying the mitochondrial dysfunction observed in this patient, the
      in vitro rescue of the respiratory deficiency by NR presents a unique opportunity to
      investigate whether it can also be observed in vivo using skeletal muscle 31P-MRS. We propose
      to explore the effect of NR, currently available as a dietary supplement, on in vivo
      mitochondrial function in this LFS patient.
