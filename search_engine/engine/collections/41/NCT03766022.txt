      peri-implant health.A radiographically measured marginal bone loss of up to 1.5 mm during the
      first year of loading, followed by a marginal bone loss of up to 0.2 mm for each succeeding
      year, is an acceptable criterion to determine implant success.

      Smoking has been implicated in many adverse systemic outcomes, including tooth loss, alveolar
      bone loss and dental implant failure.

      Platform switching, also known as platform shifting, is whenever an abutment is used that is
      smaller in diameter than the implant platform. Platform switching can help prevent crestal
      bone loss.

      The hypothesis of the present study is that the use of conical abutment might reduce marginal
      bone loss around dental implants in both smokers and non-smokers alike.
