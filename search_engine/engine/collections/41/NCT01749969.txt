      up to 21 days, and at least 4 weeks of treatment in the absence of severe adverse reaction,
      dose limiting toxicity or disease progression plus up to 60 days post-treatment follow up.
      The treatment period may continue until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, or
      Investigator, sponsor, or patient decision to discontinue therapy. After study treatment
      discontinuation, an end of treatment (EOT) visit will be done at 30 days to assess safety,
      and at 30 and 60 days for anti-drug antibody (ADA) and PK. If the ADA is positive or
      inconclusive at day 60, then PK and ADA will be repeated every 30 days until ADA is negative.
      Patients who discontinue treatment for reasons other than progression of disease will be
      followed monthly until progression, initiation of subsequent therapy, or until the primary
      analysis cutoff date, whichever comes first.
