    
      Following the above general description, eligible children will receive 5-aminolevulinic acid
      (5ALA) prior to surgery.

      During surgery, careful attention will be payed to the fluorescence from the tumor, as well
      as the ability to differentiate between tumor and non tumorous tissue.

      Comparisons between fluorescence and pathologies will be performed. Additionally, careful
      documentation of side effects will be done, to increase the safety of 5ALA use.
