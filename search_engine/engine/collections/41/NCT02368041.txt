      enrolled into the study after obtaining informed consent on the day of their evaluation. The
      primary pediatric cardiologist following the patient will evaluate the need for regular
      investigations like blood work, electrocardiogram and echocardiogram. The study staff will
      use the InSpectraTM tissue oxygen saturation (StO2) monitor manufactured by Hutchinson
      Technology to measure the baseline StO2 level after applying the noninvasive probe to the
      thenar eminence. After a stable reading is obtained a blood pressure cuff will be inflated 40
      mmHg above the obtained systolic pressure and the rate of desaturation (Rdes; % × sec-1) will
      be recorded. After 3 minutes or once the StO2 level comes to zero (whichever is earlier), the
      cuff pressure will be released and the rate of reperfusion (Rres; % × sec-1) will be
      measured. Similar measurements will be obtained from an otherwise healthy cohort of children
      who present to the Pediatric Cardiology Congenital Heart Center for evaluation of a heart
      murmur or chest pain. The patient's treating physician and care providers will be blinded to
      the study test results. All clinical care will be at the discretion of the patient's treating
      physicians. Only StO2 levels will be obtained using the non-invasive probe placed on the
      thenar eminence for the purpose of the study.
