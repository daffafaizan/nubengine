      placed on mechanical ventilation for a median of 7 days, will be followed weekly until their
      discharge from hospital. We estimate we will need 500 determinations.

      Samples will be obtained according to usual clinical practice. Thus, rather than discarding a
      sample, it will be subjected to the two laboratory diagnostic techniques (conventional
      culture and the XpertÂ® assay). No patient will be subjected to any procedure outside that of
      routine clinical practice.

      Patient with a tracheal tube in whom nasal and LRT secretions can be simultaneously obtained.
      Patients may also be included if LRT samples can be obtained via a different approach
      (tracheostomy, fibrobroncoscopy etc.).
