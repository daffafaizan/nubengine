      effects of fluids. 24 adult ICU patients meeting objective criteria of circulatory impairment
      (hypotension, tachycardia, lactatemia etc) will be recruited upon decision to administer
      fluid bolus of 500ml of crystalloid. The fluid will then be randomized to be infused at
      controlled room temperature of 22 degrees or warmed to body temperature at 38 degrees. All
      patients will be monitored with either calibrated or uncalibrated pulse contour analysis.
      Hemodynamic measurements (Heart rate (HR), Systolic blood pressure (SBP), Diastolic blood
      pressure (DBP), Mean arterial pressure (MAP), Cardiac output (CO), Cardiac index (CI), Stroke
      volume (SV), Stroke volume variation (SVV), Extravascular lung water (EVLW) etc) will be
      registered for 2 hours following the bolus, and laboratory values such as lactate, creatinine
      will be noted, as well as fluid balances. Confounders such as levels of vasopressors,
      sedation, switches in positioning och or ventilation will be registered. The hypothesis is
      that part of the hemodynamic response will differed in response to cooling, and be larger in
      the cold group.
