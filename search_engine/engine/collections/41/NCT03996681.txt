      unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC ) at Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage
      A-B. While a number of studies demonstrate poor effect of TACE for patients with large
      hepatocellular carcinoma. The efficacy of TACE on large (â‰¥ 10 cm) stage A-B HCC is far from
      satisfactory. The median overall survival was only 6.5-9.1 months. Methylcantharidimide is a
      single molecule drug used for the treatment of primary liver cancer.

      Thus, the investigators carried out this prospective trial to demonstrate the efficacy and
      safety of TACE combined with methylcantharidimide tablets in patients with large and
      unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.
