      EFV-based antiretroviral therapy (ART) and using the etonogestrel implant have significantly
      lower systemic ENG concentrations than HIV-infected women not on ART. This finding has raised
      concerns regarding the contraceptive efficacy of the ENG implant for women on EFV-based ART
      and clinical studies have an increased rate of pregnancies for women on EFV-based ART and
      using a contraceptive implant. This study a randomized, open-label, longitudinal
      pharmacodynamic study to compare frequency of ovulation between a control group of
      HIV-infected women on efavirenz-based antiretroviral therapy receiving standard dose
      etonogestrel (ENG) implant and a treatment group receiving increased dose ENG implant. The
      overall goal is to assess the pharmacodynamic significance of the known drug-drug interaction
      between EFV and ENG and to determine if the increased dose will overcome this interaction.
      Overall, this study will improve long-acting reversible contraceptive treatment options for
      women living with HIV and prevent unintended pregnancy.
