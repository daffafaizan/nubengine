      high-risk early stage breast cancer: the addition of a dual HER2-blockade for HER2-positive;
      the implementation of carboplatin for TNBC and the use of dose-dense or dose-dense, dose
      escalated chemotherapy in all high-risk subtypes of breast cancer. Two regimen are currently
      considered to have highest efficacy: sequential treatment of high dose epirubicin, taxane,
      and cyclophosphamide (ETC) concomitantly with a dual HER2-blockade mainly based on the AGO
      ETC adjuvant study, and weekly treatment with paclitaxel/non-pegylated liposomal doxorubicin
      with dual HER2-blockade or carboplatin (PM(Cb)) based on the GeparSixto study. The aim of the
      GeparOcto study is to compare those two regimen/strategies.

      Both regimens are myelosuppressive with a significant incidence of chemotherapy induced
      anaemia. Anemia is often associated with impaired physical and cognitive function and
      consequently the patients suffer from a reduced quality of life. Surgical complications are
      higher in anemic patients. The second aim of the GeparOcto study is therefore to compare the
      use of parental ferric carboxymaltose versus physician's choice for the treatment of
      chemotherapy-induced anemia in patients with iron deficiency.
