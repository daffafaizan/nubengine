      patellar instability have been difficult to interpret, either because the study setting has
      included both first-time and recurrent dislocations, or because a lack of control group.
      Moreover, several studies have enrolled patients with a wide age range, and the majority of
      the studies have employed retrospective and nonrandomized study designs. Therefore the
      investigators designed a prospective, randomized study with the primary goal to compare the
      outcome after MPFL reconstruction with medial reefing for chronic patellar instability. The
      distance between tibial tubercle and trochlear groove is measured on MRI and corrected if it
      exceeds 17mm. Primary outcome measure is the occurrence of recurrent objective and subjective
      patellar instability. The second goal is to evaluate the development of articular cartilage
      lesions within the patellofemoral joint, and assess clinical scores.
