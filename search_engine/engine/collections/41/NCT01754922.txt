      Operation New Dawn (OEF/OIF/OND) have been exposed to high levels of particulate matter (PM)
      that exceeded environmental, occupational and military exposure guidelines. PM exposure is
      acknowledged as a risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and can increase
      the risk of and exacerbate airway disease. The reviewed epidemiology indicates a high
      prevalence of newly reported respiratory symptoms in OEF/OIF/OND Veterans that has
      significantly affected their deployment duties, including their physical exertion capability.
      Despite these retrospective data and limited air sampling reports, prospective studies are
      lacking. This pilot study will evaluate cardiorespiratory and autonomic function in
      OEF/OIF/OND Veterans as compared to Veterans never deployed to the region.

      To evaluate cardiopulmonary function, each Veteran will undergo a standardized exercise
      challenge and bronchodilator spirometry. To evaluate autonomic nervous system function,
      investigators will examine indices of heart rate variability and cardiovascular reflex
      regulation (e.g. baroreflex sensitivity and cerebral autoregulation) during a variety of
      tasks.

      Data derived from this pilot project will yield important insight on the extent and severity
      of cardiorespiratory and/or autonomic impairments - data that may provide intervention points
      for attenuating long-term adverse outcomes such as pulmonary and cardiovascular disease.
      Through early identification, treatment options (e.g. exercise therapy, pharmaceutical) may
      be implemented to enhance physiological function, with the goal of helping to alleviate
      symptoms and reduce chronic disease risk.
