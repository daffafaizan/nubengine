      2 phases separated by 14 days, 5 infant cereals containing either ferrous fumarate (4 meals)
      or ferrous bisglycinate (1 meal) intrinsically labeled with stable isotopes. The investigator
      will collect one blood sample at baseline and another sample at the end of each phase, thus 3
      samples total. In these samples, fractional iron absorption and markers of iron and
      inflammation status will be measured . In addition, infant and child acceptability of one of
      the infant cereals will be assessed by using a questionnaire.
