      and/or density). Chronic liver disease is associated with osteoporosis in both adults and
      children. Bone density is also decreased in the months immediately after liver
      transplantation, but improves to pretransplant values after 1 to 2 years. Immunosuppressive
      agents, most notably steroids, are a cause of osteoporosis. However, studies on adults have
      shown that bone densities afer transplantation continue to improve within the normal range
      for healthy adults. In the case of children, bone accretion is necessary for growth. Chronic
      liver disease and transplantation in childhood will have an adverse effect on bone metabolism
      and the outcome in terms of bone density after the growth period cannot be predicted on
      individuals transplanted as adults or other transplant groups.
