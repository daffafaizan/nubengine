      Respiratory failure after extubation is a relevant consequences of poor airway clearance due
      to respiratory muscle weakness. Respiratory failure is a major cause for reintubation which
      increase severity of illness, this is an independent risk factor for nosocomial pneumonia,
      increased hospital stay and mortality. Currently, respiratory physiotherapy includes, manual
      expiration assist often associated with nasotracheal aspiration. Despite of this care,
      respiratory failure occur in 30% of patients within 48 after planned extubation. MI-E has
      been evaluated for neuromuscular disease patient, and increase peak cough flow and the airway
      clearance. So the beneficials effects of MI-E should be confirmed in a trial in this specific
      population.

      We planned to conduct a study evaluating the efficacy of MI-E in the prevention of extubation
      failure and mortality in these patients. If no signs of respiratory failure appeared after
      120 min of a spontaneous breathing trial, patients will be extubated and randomly allocated
      after extubation to MI-E group or control group. The clinical follow-up will be as follow:
      the incidence of extubation failure, the reintubation, the ICU or 28-day survival,90-day
      survival, ICU length of stay.
