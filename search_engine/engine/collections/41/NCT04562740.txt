      problem is set to worsen globally with increasing prevalence of diabetes. Treatment of PAD in
      diabetic critical limb ischemia (CLI) primarily involves revascularisation of the limb.
      Angioplasty as a first line strategy of revascularization over surgical procedures has been
      adopted by most vascular centers.

      Arterial blockages for diabetic CLI patients occur predominantly in below the knee arteries
      which can be challenging to treat effectively. This is due to the high incidence of arterial
      recoil after conventional balloon angioplasty due the natural tendency of the vessels to
      maintain their original shape and the high restenosis rates of calcified lesions.

      To address these problems the novel ABLUMINUS DES system is specifically designed to
      withstand the mechanical recoil of diseased BTK arteries whilst delivering sirolimus to
      biologically inhibit restenosis.

      This study postulates that the application of the ABLUMINUS DES system will be safe and will
      result in better vascular patency in BTK arteries for CLI patients.

      The investigators aim to conduct a prospective, all comers, single arm, single centre
      registry of the ABLUMINUS DES system for the treatment of BTK disease.
