    
      Subject to inclusion and exclusion criteria, patients will be randomized 1:1 to the control
      and intervention groups:

      Randomization groups:

        -  Group 1 (control): Ileal Conduit

        -  Group 2 (intervention): Ileal conduit with concurrent mesh placement.

      Ethicon PHYSIOMESH composite mesh will be utilized for this study. This is a composite mesh
      with a reduced polypropylene content. It is a widely used, commercially available hernia
      mesh, and its use and placement are simple and well described. The mesh will be placed at the
      time of radical cystectomy and ileal conduit. A small circle of mesh, the diameter of the
      ileal conduit, will be excised to allow for fitment around the ileal conduit. The mesh will
      be placed so that it encompasses the ileal conduit in a non-constricting manner, and will be
      sutured to the anterior abdominal wall. Product will be stored in a secure, sterile manner at
      the UMH operating room sterile supply room, and in accordance with institutional policies.

      Patients from both groups will be followed up in a standard fashion. Follow up visits and
      clinical assessment will be at 6 weeks after surgery, 3 monthly during the first year, then
      every 6 months for at least 5 years. During each visit, patients will be clinically evaluated
      for the presence or absence of parastomal hernia, and any routine surveillance radiology
      imaging will be reviewed.

      Parastomal hernia is clinically defined as an incisional hernia at the site of the ileal
      conduit stoma. This may be clinically apparent by examining the patient during performance of
      abdominal straining or Valsalva maneuver, or may be evident on radiology imaging.
