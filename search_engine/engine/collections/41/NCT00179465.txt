      illness by tiagabine (Gabitril), a GABA transporter GAT-1-specific inhibitor and a
      FDA-approved anticonvulsant, will improve both clinical symptoms and working memory in
      schizophrenia. This improvement is postulated to be the result of tiagabine-mediated
      modification of the developmental synaptic pruning of prefrontal cortical circuitry. The
      occurrence of circuitry modification after tiagabine treatment will be assessed by the
      following independent methodologic approaches: MRI morphometric analysis of prefrontal gray
      matter volume and fMRI measurements of brain activity patterns during performance of tasks
      that probe working memory.
