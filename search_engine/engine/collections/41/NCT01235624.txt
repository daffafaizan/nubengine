      national reference center of rare disease in Montpellier and 100 recruited in the 9
      participating centers over a period of two years."To identify the missing genes, we proceed
      in two steps. A first step in selecting families negative for the 8 major genes genes, by
      systematic sequencing of exons most frequently involved. A second step in finding new loci /
      genes by locus exclusion using microsatellite markers and SNP genotyping.
