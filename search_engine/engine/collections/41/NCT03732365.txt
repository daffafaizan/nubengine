      UDD plus standard of care (SOC) with SOC alone for the treatment of skin and soft tissue
      infections in non-healing wounds. After review of screening results to determine eligibility,
      a patient will be randomly assigned to one of the two treatments:

      Investigational Group: This group will receive administration of a single dose of cefazolin,
      using a novel new drug delivery system called Ultrasonic Drug Delivery (UDD), to the site of
      infection, combined with SOC, followed by best available adjunct therapy. An optional two
      additional treatments will be available if needed.

      Comparator Group: This group will receive conventional standard of care treatment followed by
      best available adjunct therapy.

      Efficacy will be assessed by clinical response based on the presence of vascularized
      granulation tissue, reduction of pain, temperature, measurement of lesion size and
      temperature, culture and gram stain results, and clinical signs of infection (erythema,
      induration/swelling, fluctuance, purulent drainage, warmth/localized heat, and
      tenderness/pain). Additionally, efficacy will be assessed by resolution of infection and
      microbiological assessments.

      Safety will be assessed by reported adverse events, clinical laboratory tests (hematology,
      serum chemistry, fasting glucose, hs-CRP), and concomitant medication.
