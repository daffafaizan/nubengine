      recruited for this project. Eight (8) participants will complete user interviews in Spanish
      and thirty (30) participants will participate in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) for
      smoking cessation. Participants will be randomized to receive either the Impacto mobile app
      or a generic, Spanish language, smoking cessation, mobile app control (Dejar de Fumar
      Asistente).
