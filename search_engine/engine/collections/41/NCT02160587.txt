      agent when applied to human skin. The study, a modified Draize skin sensitization evaluation,
      will be conducted in three discrete phases: 1) induction, 2) rest, and 3) challenge. During
      the Induction Phase, skin sites are exposed to the test product repeatedly for 21 consecutive
      days. The Rest Phase, a 14-day period when no treatment is performed, serves to provide
      adequate time for the immune system to react to ZuraPrep™, given any of its components serve
      as antigens. During the Challenge Phase, the subjects' skin is re-exposed to the test product
      (ZuraPrep™) to determine if it is likely to be immunosensitizing.
