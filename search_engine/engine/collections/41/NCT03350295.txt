      nifurtimox 30 mg tablets exhibiting different in vitro dissolution profiles (slow, medium,
      and fast, whereby "medium" represents the drug product currently used in clinical Phase 3
      studies) under fed conditions in adult male and female patients with Chagas' disease.

      A secondary objective of the study is to assess the relative bioavailability of nifurtimox
      after a single oral dose of 30 mg and 120 mg To assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of
      nifurtimox To investigate the safety and tolerability of nifurtimox..
