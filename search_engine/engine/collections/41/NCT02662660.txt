      2012 and 2015 will be performed. Patients will be randomized using a computerized simple
      randomization scheme in a 1:1:1 ratio into 3 groups: those patients receiving only
      intravenous analgesia (Group 1), those ones receiving intravenous analgesia associated to
      epidural analgesia (Group 2) and those patients receiving intravenous analgesia associated
      with port-sites infiltration with bupivacaine. Pain quantification as measured by Visual
      Analogic Scale (VAS), ranging from 0 (absence of pain) to 10 (unbearable pain) will be
      evaluated 24 hours after surgery.
