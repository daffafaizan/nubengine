      be recruited to complete the experimental protocol. Participants will be randomized to one of
      the two beverage conditions (0.60 g/kg alcohol beverage, 0.00 g/kg placebo beverage). Blood
      samples will be collected at baseline (prior to beverage administration) and for three hours
      afterward. Cognitive performance and subjective intoxication will be assessed using
      standardized measures. MRI scans will be collected 4-5 hours after beverage consumption to
      capture neurobiological outcomes on the descending limb of blood alcohol.
