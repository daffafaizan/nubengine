      Primary

        -  Determine the response rate in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma and
           hepatic dysfunction treated with oxaliplatin, capecitabine, and cetuximab.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the safety of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the time to tumor progression in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is an open label, nonrandomized study.

      Patients receive oral capecitabine twice daily on days 1-14, cetuximab IV over 60-120 minutes
      on days 1, 8, and 15, and oxaliplatin IV over 120 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every
      21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 3-4 weeks and then every 3
      months thereafter.
