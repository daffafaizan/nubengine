    
      This study consisted of 2 parts.

        -  During the first part (Phase I) of the study, 6 subjects with biochemically recurrent
           prostate cancer (PCa) received the investigational product (IP) and remained at the site
           for approximately 6 hours post-administration in order to assess the PK, biodistribution
           versus time, and dosimetry for critical organs. Subjects received a single dose of 3
           MBq/kg, (>=150 and =<250 MBq), of 68^Ga-PSMA-R2 intravenously. Serial blood and urine
           samples were collected for PK characterization and dosimetry and whole-body PET/CT were
           acquired at selected time points (0 to 4 hours) to determine organ and tumor absorbed
           doses. Safety assessments were conducted after IP administration on Day 1, and during
           follow-up on Days 7 and 28.

        -  In the second part of the study (Phase II), 2 groups of 12 subjects were enrolled
           (subjects with PCa in biochemical recurrence [PCa-BR], and subjects with prostate cancer
           in the metastatic stage [mPCa]). Based on the preliminary data analysis from the Phase I
           part of the study provided sufficient dosimetry data, all subjects underwent the whole
           body PET/CT imaging optimized for time (up to 2 time points) according to the data
           analysis from the Phase I part of the study.

      This study was comprised of 4 clinical visits and conducted in 3 study periods: screening,
      administration/imaging, and safety follow-up period.
