      chemotherapy. Research shows that about 25% ~ 40% in patients receiving standard chemotherapy
      can appear neutropenia with fever. It can increase the risk of infection and Chemotherapy
      related death, and lead to the delay of chemotherapy, and maybe Reduce the curative effect of
      chemotherapy. RhG-CSF has widely used to prevent neutropenia, but its half-time is short, and
      need daily injections to maintain the effective blood drug concentration. Patients are with
      poor compliance, related adverse reaction and medical costs increase. At the same time, some
      patients appear neutropenia thought RhG-CSF is given. Therefore, how to reduce the frequency
      of RhG-CSF injections and more effectively prevent neutropenia more effectively, on the
      premise of ensure the safety of patients to achieve better effect of chemotherapy, has always
      been the focus of the clinical problem.

      Pegylated recombinant human granulocyte-colony stimulating factor(PEG-rhG-CSF) is a first
      class national new drug developed by domestic pharmaceutical companies. According to some
      phase Ⅱand phase Ⅲ clinical trials, PEG-rhG-CSF has a good effect. The patients need only one
      injection for PEG-rhG-CSF each Cycle of chemotherapy, and the effect of rising white blood
      cell is more smoothly, and it can avoid pain of repeated injection of PEG-rhG-CSF
