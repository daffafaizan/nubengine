      only 15% of admitted patients have a cardiac cause of their presenting symptoms. Observation
      units (OU) improve resource utilization, are endorsed by the ACC/AHA guidelines, but have
      seen limited implementation in non-low risk chest pain patients due to limitations of
      traditional cardiac testing. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) is sensitive and
      specific for ischemia, can simultaneously assess cardiac function and myocardial perfusion,
      and could revolutionize the diagnostic process for intermediate risk patients with chest
      pain. The superior accuracy of CMR could decrease testing resulting from false positive
      results. The high sensitivity for ongoing ischemia could allow imaging in parallel with
      cardiac markers.

      Research hypotheses:

      OU-CMR will have superior therapeutic efficacy to OU-conventional testing.

      An OU-CMR strategy will have higher diagnostic thinking efficacy than OU-conventional
      testing.

      Methods summary:

      To address the question of feasibility of a CMR approach to managing patients at intermediate
      risk for ACS, we propose a randomized clinical trial of 120 patients at intermediate risk of
      ACS that present to the ED of Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center (WFUBMC) for
      evaluation of chest pain. All patients will receive care in an OU, and will be randomized to
      CMR, or conventional testing. CMR participants will undergo cardiac markers and CMR testing;
      conventional testing participants will undergo serial cardiac markers followed by
      conventional cardiac testing. ACS (infarction, death, coronary revascularization, unstable
      angina) will be assessed by evaluation of hospital course and phone follow-up at 30 days.
      Cost of hospital care will be compared among groups.
