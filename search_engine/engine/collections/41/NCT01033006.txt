      patients, scheduled for hand surgery, were included in a randomised, blinded prospective
      study.

      In all patients a short axillary plexus catheter is positioned close to the median nerve
      using nerve stimulator.

      Technique 1 = 40 ml in catheter Technique 2 = 30 ml behind and 10 ml in front of the brachial
      artery (BA) Technique 3 = 20 ml behind, 10ml in front of the BA and 10 ml in catheter

      Clinical High Field MRI (3T) scanner has simplified the recognition of brachial plexus nerves
      in the axilla. After injection of local anaesthetic (LA), the identification of the nerve
      structures is nevertheless difficult. When all nerves are surrounded of LA in the axilla
      (MRI), it seems to be associated with a clinical complete brachial plexus block
