      patients newly referred to one of the three study centers within the Cleveland Clinic, Center
      for Brain Health network, for diagnostic workup. Only AclarusDx™ will be added to the panel
      of tests usually performed at the centers to establish diagnosis. AclarusDx™ will be used for
      investigational use only, not for diagnostic purpose. The ultimate goal is to define the
      clinical utility of AclarusDx™ to provide Primary Care Physicians (PCPs) with a tool that
      will help them in making the diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD).

      The primary objectives are :

        1. To obtain an estimate of the capability of AclarusDx™ to identify AD patients among a
           US-based population of newly referred patients suffering from objective memory
           impairment which maybe potentially related to multiple and different etiologies.

        2. To compare the performance of AclarusDx™ in a US-based population of newly referred
           patients with memory impairment with the performance of AclarusDx™ observed in one
           comparable European population.
