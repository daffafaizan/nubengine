      hand/s. Our current institutional standard of care is to use Xeroform Gauze (Coviden,
      Mansfield, MA) and Bacitracin Ointment (Fougera, Melville, NY) to promote a moist
      antibacterial healing environment with the ability to monitor the healing progress daily.
      However, silver (AG) based dressings that employ nanocrystalline technology with hydrofiber
      (Aquacel AG burn; ConvaTec, Princeton, NJ) or soft silicone foam (Mepilex AG ; Molnlycke
      Health Care, Dunstable, United Kingdom) have been well accepted as alternative dressing
      solutions. These dressings have longer interval times between changes, leading to a reported
      increase in patient comfort, diminished skin shearing/stripping, and rapid
      re-epithelialization.

      Given the anatomic intricacies, partial thickness burns to the hand present a challenge in
      dressing selection. Recently, ConvaTec unveiled the Aquacel AG Burn Glove for use on partial
      thickness hand burns. In line with this idea, our institution has now begun to fashion a
      novel burn glove out of Mepilex Transfer AG with good success. To date there are no known
      studies that compare Xeroform/Bacitracin, Aquacel AG burn glove or Mepilex Transfer AG
      dressing. The goal of this study is to compare these three burn dressings used to treat
      partial-thickness hand burns and their impact on pain, function, and aesthetic outcomes. We
      will also explore psychosocial issues related to hand burn dressing changes.
