      biopsies per year. All of these patients receive sedation, which is prescribed and supervised
      by the pediatric pain and palliative care team, with either ketamine or fentanyl and versed.
      Child life is involved; however, many children still experience anxiety and/or pain with the
      procedure. Use of a modality such as aculaser which may decrease these symptoms could enhance
      their experience.

      The term "laser" stands for light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation. In laser
      acupuncture, a low power, cold light produced by a low-level laser diode is used to stimulate
      an acupuncture point. As it is non-invasive, laser acupuncture is thought to be safer than
      needle acupuncture, especially in the setting of patients with blood-borne infectious
      diseases. In a systematic review analyzing the evidence to support the effectiveness of laser
      acupuncture, randomized control trials in which adults with soft tissue injury, acute or
      chronic pain condition, or any systemic illness were included. This review reports moderate
      level of evidence for treatment of myofascial pain and post-operative nausea/vomiting and
      limited evidence of the clinical effectiveness of treating chronic tension headaches. Of
      note, no complications of the use of aculaser were reported in this review (1).
