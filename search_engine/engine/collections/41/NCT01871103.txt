      discrimination test and Semmes-Weinstein monofilament test. We evaluate pain sensations of
      the reconstructed fingers and donor sites with a visual analog scale. The system consist of a
      10 cm line that is grouped into mild (0-3 cm), moderate (4-6 cm) and severe (7-10 cm). Active
      motion of the joints is measured using a goniometer. The motion arcs of the reconstructed
      fingers are compared with the opposite side.
