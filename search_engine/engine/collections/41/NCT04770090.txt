      pathology with increased death rate.

      Despite recommendations for coelioscopic treatment of < 4cm cervical cancers, recent studies
      showed that the risk of recurrence is higher for patients treated by coelioscopy in
      comparison with laparotomy. It could be explained by the spread of circulating tumor cells
      (CTC) due to tumor mobilization during coelioscopy.

      Hypothesis : Mobilization of the tumor during coelioscopy leads to CTC spread. This spread
      could explain the recurrence of cervical cancer.

      This pilot study will evaluate the possibility of CTC detection during surgery. The primary
      goal is to evaluate the spread of CTC during surgery on peripheral blood samples.

      The secondary outcome is to evaluation the disease-free survival at 3 and 5 years
      postoperatively.

      20 patients with early stage cervical (IA1 to IB2) eligible to coelioscopic surgery will be
      included.
