      Heart Failure (HF) patients (LVEF < 50%) with IDA (Ferritin < 100 ng/mL or 100-300 ng/mL with
      Tsat < 20%) at outpatient clinic of National Cardiovascular Center Harapan Kita from January
      to July 2016. Patients were randomized 1:1 to received FS or placebo for 90 days, the

      serum lactate levels as secondary end-points.
