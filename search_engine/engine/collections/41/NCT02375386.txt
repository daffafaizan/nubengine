    
      Participants will be enrolled from VA pain clinical at the North Florida/South George VA
      Medical Center.

      The investigators will collect functional magnetic resonance imaging data of resting state
      and pain-related events (i.i. during thermal pain sensitivity testing, as well as
      psychophysical data to determine pain sensitivity. Pain sensitivity will be measured using
      thermal and mechanical stimuli. These data will be collected before and after the
      interventions, in addition to two follow-up sessions after intervention.

      In addition, clinical measures of pain intensity in the low back, as well as trunk range of
      motion and strength will also be collected.
