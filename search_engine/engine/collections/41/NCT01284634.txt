    
      This study was conducted as a 10-week (eight-week treatment period and one-week safety
      follow-up), randomized, partially-blind study that evaluated the effect of GWP42003 in
      participants with raised liver triglycerides (liver fat ≥5%). Participants were clinically
      diagnosed with FLD and had liver fat levels ≥5% as measured by Magnetic Resonance Imaging/
      Magnetic Resonance Scanning (MRI/MRS), or were willing to undergo MRI/MRS scan at the
      screening visit to confirm a liver fat content of ≥5%. Eligible participants entered the
      study at a screening visit (Day -10 to -2) and then returned for a fasted baseline visit (Day
      1), a mid-treatment visit (Day 29) and an end of treatment visit (Day 57). Safety follow-up
      telephone calls took place throughout the treatment period up to Day 64 after completion of
      treatment or seven days after date of last dose/withdrawal.
