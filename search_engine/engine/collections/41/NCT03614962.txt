      patients with dementia to improve memory, orientation, calculation, and self-managing ability
      in patients having dementia and prevent decline of cognitive functions. Results of animal
      studies have demonstrated that electroacupuncture on the head region is effective in managing
      the symptoms associated with dementia, including vascular dementia.

      A review of 8 studies on effects of TENS on non-pain related cognitive and behavioural
      functioning in patients with Alzheimer's disease and non-demented patients concluded that
      TENS could improve memory, affective behaviour and rest-activity rhythm in patients having
      Alzheimer's disease.

      Passive body heating is another novel physical intervention strategy which potentially can
      relieve the symptoms of dementia. A previous study demonstrated that the attention function
      of 15 elderly, measured by the reaction time in the Rapid Visual Processing Test, improved
      after passive body heating via a thermal suit. Moreover, 30 minutes of hot-water immersion
      improved the sleep quality in 13 people with vascular dementia.
