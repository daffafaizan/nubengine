      is docetaxel + cyclophosphamide (TC). This study looks at a different schedule for giving the
      same adjuvant chemotherapy so that treatment can be completed faster (in 8 weeks rather than
      12 weeks). This study uses a growth factor drug, pegfilgrastim, to help build blood cells
      that are lowered because of chemotherapy, making it possible to receive TC treatment every 2
      weeks (referred to as "dose dense TC" or "ddTC") instead of the standard 3 week schedule. The
      main study procedures are blood draws, chemotherapy treatment, physical exams, and
      pegfilgrastim injections.
