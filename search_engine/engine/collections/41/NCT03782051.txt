    
      Background: To study the efficacy of the biodegradable collagen implant Ologen® as an
      adjuvant in phaco-viscocanalostomy in patients with coexisting cataract and primary open
      angle glaucoma.

      Methods: This prospective, interventional, randomized clinical study was done at Alpha Vision
      Center, Zagazig, Egypt. Patients with coexisting cataract and glaucoma were randomized to
      receive either phaco-viscocanalostomy (Phacovisco group) or phaco-viscocanalostomy with
      Ologen® implant (OloPhacovisco group). Follow-up period was 2 years. Nd:YAG laser
      goniopuncture was done in cases where the intraocular pressure (IOP) was elevated above 21
      mmHg after discontinuation of corticosteroid eye drops at any follow-up visit.
