      Primary objective:

      â€¢ Determine antitumor activity of ultrahigh dose dexamethasone (UHDD) as monotherapy in
      relapsed multiple myeloma.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  Characterize the safety and tolerability of UHDD as monotherapy in patients with
           relapsed multiple myeloma.

        -  Determine the progression free survival amongst responders.

        -  Determine the subset of patients in whom UHDD can be used as monotherapy for treatment
           of relapsed multiple myeloma

      STUDY ENDPOINTS

      Primary endpoint: To determine the anti-tumor activity of UHDD as monotherapy in patients
      with relapsed multiple myeloma as measured by the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG)
      response criteria:

        -  Change from baseline in M protein component.

        -  Objective response rate (complete response [CR] + partial response [PR]) assessed
           according to IMWG response criteria.

        -  Disease control rate (CR+PR+stable disease [SD]).

      Secondary endpoints:

        -  Safety and tolerability of UHDD

        -  Progression free survival.

        -  Characteristics of patients responding to UHDD.
