      Group' was not able to prove the benefits and advantages of vitrectomy for impending macular
      hole; however, during the interim period, notable improvements have been achieved with regard
      to diagnosis and efficacy of treatment.

      Therefore, we designed this study to identify the effect of current vitreous surgery for
      symptomatic impending macular hole.

      Characteristics of this study is as below

        -  Multicenter, prospective clinical trial. (early surgical intervention vs.surgical
           intervention when full-thickness macular hole occurs)

        -  Non-randomized study (decision was made by patients after full explanation)

        -  After 1 year follow up, functional change(visual acuity)and anatomical
           change(development of full-thickness macular hole) would be evaluated
