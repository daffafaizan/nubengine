      healthy women. Prior to watching an established trauma film paradigm that induces short
      lasting intrusions, participants received a single dose of either 10 mg yohimbine,
      stimulating noradrenergic activity, or 0.15 mg clonidine, inhibiting noradrenergic activity,
      or placebo. The number of consecutive intrusions of the trauma film, the mean vividness of
      the intrusions and the mean degree of distress evoked by the intrusions were assessed during
      the following four days. Salivary cortisol and alpha-amylase were collected at seven time
      points prior to, and after the trauma film.
