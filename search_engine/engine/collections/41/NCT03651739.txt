      wearable device. The device is an electronic goniometer connected to a smart phone
      application. Patients will be recruited from the "Patient Orientation Program" (POP) at the
      Sunnybrook Holland Centre. Data collection will occur preoperatively, at the end of each
      physiotherapy Knee Class session, and at the three month postoperative clinic visit. The
      research assistant will help fit and attach the wearable device to each patient's knee.
      Patients will be asked to bend their knee (flexion and extension) while wearing the device
      which will measure patients range of motion. The research assistant will also measure knee
      range of motion using a handheld protractor. Afterward, patients will be asked to walk 10
      steps, using any walking aids or techniques they typically use at home. There will be 15
      collections per patient requiring ten minutes per session. Chart reviews will also be
      conducted to determine patient reported outcomes which will be then correlated with the
      functional measures.

      All data will be extracted and input into an excel file. For both the ROM tests, the accuracy
      of the Knee Connect device will be compared against the plastic goniometer. This will be done
      by using a paired t-test and calculating interclass correlation coefficient. The data will
      then be analyzed using a repeated measures ANOVA and Bonferroni post-hoc analysis to
      determine differences in the variables week to week. Additionally, a regression analysis will
      be used to estimate the week by week improvements in these variables.
