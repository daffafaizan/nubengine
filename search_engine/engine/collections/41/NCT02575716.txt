      intubation, were studied in this prospective, double-blinded, randomized, clinical trial.
      Anesthesia was induced using fentanyl 1.5 mcg/kg, xylocaine 1.5 mg/kg and propofol 3 mg/kg.
      Patients were randomly assigned to one of the two groups to receive either rocuronium 0.6
      mg/kg or saline intravenously. The McgrathÂ® VL intubation was initiated after 90s, when the
      patients were fully relaxed. The primary outcome was to compare tracheal intubating
      conditions between two groups. The secondary outcomes were the success rate in the first
      attempt intubation, time to intubation, the required propofol dose for intubation and
      anesthetic complications. Statistical analyses were performed using the R program version
      2.14.2. The level of statistical significance was set at p < 0.05.
