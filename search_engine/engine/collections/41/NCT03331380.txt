      cardiac chamber volumes, cardiac function, blood flow, myocardial scar, myocardial
      extracellular volume as a measure of collagen content, myocardial iron content, and others,
      all without exposure to ionizing radiation. The prevailing wisdom is that CMR using high
      specific absorption rate (SAR) scanning modes produces highest image quality. We propose a
      method of CMR that can be performed with low SAR but that nevertheless preserves image
      quality because of efficient use of CMR signal. CMR using low SAR is attractive because it
      may reduce heating of metallic structures. This may allow safe CMR in patients with metallic
      implants, and it may allow MRI catheterization using metallic guidewires and catheter
      devices.

      The goal of this non-significant risk (NSR) medical device study is to test initial technical
      feasibility of low SAR CMR in healthy volunteers by technical optimization of scanner
      protocols, to test comparative accuracy of standard CMR measurements in healthy volunteers
      using low SAR CMR versus conventional CMR.

      A secondary goal is to assess the potential of this new low-SAR MRI system to perform
      cardiovascular diagnostic imaging and non-cardiovascular radiological diagnostic imaging by
      testing comparative diagnostic accuracy of standard MR measurements in adult patients with
      known disease using the low SAR CMR system vs conventional MR exam.
