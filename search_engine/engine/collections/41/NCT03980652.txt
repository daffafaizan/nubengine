      The aim of the 12-month internal pilot is to assess:

        1. whether hospitals adhere to their allocation

        2. what proportion of patients who are eligible for ChEETAh can be followed up successfully
           at 30 days after their surgery

      Main Study

      To assess whether the practice of using separate sterile gloves and instruments to close
      wounds at the end of surgery compared to current routine hospital practice can reduce
      surgical site infection at 30-days post-surgery for patients undergoing clean-contaminated,
      contaminated or dirty abdominal surgery
