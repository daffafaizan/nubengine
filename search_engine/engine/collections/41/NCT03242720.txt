      short periods during sleep, is a common condition in patients with atrial fibrillation.
      Studies have shown that up to 75% of atrial fibrillation patients undergoing catheter
      ablation procedure have obstructive sleep apnea. Obstructive sleep apnea increases the risk
      of atrial fibrillation recurrence after successful catheter ablation by 40%. However, whether
      treatment of obstructive sleep apnea with positive airway pressure (PAP, the current most
      effective treatment for obstructive sleep apnea that uses a machine to help breathe more
      easily) reduces the risk of atrial fibrillation recurrence is not fully understood. The
      purpose of this study, therefore, is to examine whether positive airway pressure therapy
      reduces atrial fibrillation recurrence after catheter ablation in patients with obstructive
      sleep apnea and atrial fibrillation.
