    
      The trial comprises a screening phase (4 to 12 weeks prior to first administration of
      veltuzumab), a 4-week treatment phase (weeks 1 to 4), a core phase from week 4 to week 24,
      and a follow-up phase from week 24 to week 48. The primary end-point, the American College of
      Rheumatology 20 (ACR 20) response rate, will be evaluated at week 24.

      The objectives of this trial are:

        -  To investigate the efficacy, safety and tolerability at week 24 of three different sc
           dose levels of the humanized anti-CD20 antibody veltuzumab as an add-on treatment to MTX
           compared to MTX alone in subjects with moderate to severe RA

        -  To evaluate the durability of the clinical response and safety of veltuzumab over 48
           weeks

        -  To identify the dosage(s) of veltuzumab with the most favourable benefit-risk profile to
           be further evaluated in the subsequent phase II/III clinical program in subjects with
           moderate to severe RA.

      Current status of the trial: Following the voluntary temporary halt of the VELVET dose range
      finding trial, the sponsor has decided to redesign the protocol and start a new trial as soon
      as possible.

      All patients treated prior to the voluntary halt have completed their safety assessments. It
      was decided to terminate the VELVET trial and consequently not to recommence enrollment.

      In the VELVET trial, a total of 11 patients received trial medication prior to the voluntary
      temporary halt. No efficacy conclusions according to protocol can be drawn from the 11
      patients treated. Based on the collected clinical data from this trial, there is no clinical
      safety signal and no increased clinical safety risk observed to date that precludes continued
      clinical investigation of veltuzumab.
