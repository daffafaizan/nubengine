      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of oral irinotecan when administered with
           fixed-dose temozolomide and cefixime in pediatric patients with recurrent or resistant
           high-risk neuroblastoma.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the response rate in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Correlate UGT1A1 genotype with the occurrence of dose-limiting diarrhea in patients
           treated with this regimen.

        -  Correlate BCRP genotype with pharmacokinetic phenotype in patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Correlate p53 status in tumor cells with response in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of irinotecan.

      Patients receive oral cefixime once daily beginning 5 days before the start of fixed-dose
      temozolomide and irinotecan and continuing for the duration of the study. Patients also
      receive oral temozolomide once daily on days 1-5 and oral irinotecan once daily on days 1-5
      and 8-12. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of irinotecan until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. A maximum of 12 patients are treated at the
      MTD.

      Patients are followed for toxicity, response, and survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 1.25
      years.
