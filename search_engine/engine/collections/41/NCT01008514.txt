      Primary

        -  To examine the efficacy of MammoSite® Radiation Therapy System (RTS) in delivering
           partial-breast irradiation to women with early-stage breast cancer.

      Secondary

        -  To assess the toxicities associated with MammoSite® RTS in these patients.

        -  To evaluate the cosmetic results in the breast after brachytherapy with the MammoSite®
           RTS.

        -  To correlate the cosmetic results with the use of chemotherapy, volume of the implant,
           and distance from the implant to the skin.

        -  To correlate the local recurrence rate with time between surgery and implant.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo placement of the MammoSite® Radiation Therapy System (RTS) device
      into the cavity where the tumor was removed either at the time of surgery or percutaneously
      under ultrasound guidance after surgery. Within 2-5 days after the device implant, patients
      undergo partial-breast irradiation delivered by MammoSite® RTS twice daily for 5 days.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up periodically for 5 years.
