      hospital admission for between 10-21 days. These episodes cause substantial disruption to
      people's lives and impact on lung function, quality of life and lifespan.Robust evidence to
      support current treatment approaches is lacking with awareness that current regimes could be
      optimised.

      As yet there is no model for predicting how patients with CF will respond to IV antibiotic
      treatment- other than clinical judgement and lung function response.This is due to lack of
      robust measures to identify clinical response at the time of treatment and safely predict
      later clinical outcomes. The heterogeneity of the 21st Century CF population means a
      multi-dimensional composite measure is needed. This study has therefore been designed to
      provide an overall picture of people's response including clinical, biochemical and patient
      related outcome measures. Using multi-dimensional assessment we hope the measures assessed in
      this study will give a better picture of how people feel and how they respond to treatment.
