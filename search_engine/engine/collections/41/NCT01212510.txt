      metastatic colorectal cancer. The chemotherapy monitoring is currently based on radiological
      evaluation (RECIST criteria) and clinical evaluation. Circulating markers as CEA, free mutant
      DNA, CTC represent an alternative approach. A previous study on usefulness of the serum
      Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) kinetic for chemotherapy monitoring in patients with
      unresectable metastasis of colorectal cancer has been published (J Clin Oncol
      2008;26:3681-6). The present study is designed to validate the previous data. The secondary
      purpose is to evaluate variations of free mutant DNA and CTC during the chemotherapy.
      Patients will be included prospectively in 4 centers in Normandy. All systemic chemotherapy
      and biotherapy validate in this clinical situation by the French National Cancer Institute
      (INCa) is accepted. Evaluation of response based on RECIST criteria will be performed every 3
      months. Blood samples for CEA and CA 19-9 levels will be performed every courses of
      chemotherapy during first 3 months. Blood samples for detection of free mutant DNA and CTC
      will be performed at day 1 and 42 of chemotherapy.
