      biopsies are performed. The reason for CXR is to find out if pneumothorax occurred or not.
      CXR is required patient transportation and interpretation by the radiologist as well as time
      consuming. Instead, we are planning to perform bedside ultrasound to determine if
      pneumothorax occurred or not
