      pre-screening dermatology referrals in a clinical setting by a qualified nurse using a
      dermatoscope, triaging suspicious lesions vs. benign lesions. The long-range goal of the
      proposed program is to improve referral wait times for patients to see a dermatologist for
      lesions suspicious for melanoma in comparison to normal standards of care in NS. If
      effective, this screening program would decrease wait times for those patients with lesions
      suspicious for melanoma providing earlier diagnosis and expedited treatment, and potentially
      reducing mortality rates.
