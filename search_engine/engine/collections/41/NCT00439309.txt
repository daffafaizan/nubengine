      reduction of blood loss and creation of suture line is of utmost importance to the surgeon.
      Bleeding at the suture line may require transfusion, as well as prolonged operative and
      anesthesia time. Suture hole bleeding is common following using synthetic and biological
      grafts for vascular repair. Several topical hemostatic ans sealing agents have been developed
      to control suture line bleeding. This new vascular sealant possess high bonding properties,
      minimal tissue reaction, is biodegradable and absorbed by the body quickly. The primary focus
      of this study is to compare the safety and effectiveness of the vascular sealant with
      standard of care methods used today, specifically gelfoam/thrombin and sponge like material.
