      I. To determine if this regimen improves the time-to-progression for patients with advanced
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) compared to historical controls.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess response rate and median survival. II. To evaluate tumor biomarkers that could
      predict response and survival for patients treated with this regimen including endothelial
      growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression, EGFR Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and
      k-ras mutations.

      III. To evaluate genetic polymorphisms as markers of response and survival for patients
      treated with this regimen including polymorphisms in XPD, XRCC1, XRCC3, and cyclin D1.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive docetaxel intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on day 1, cisplatin IV over 1 hour
      on day 1, and pegfilgrastim subcutaneously (SC) on day 2. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for
      4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning 2 weeks
      after completion of docetaxel, cisplatin, and pegfilgrastim, patients receive erlotinib
      hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily (QD) in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and
      every 6 months for 2 years.
