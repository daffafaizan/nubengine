      of fullness in the ear, otalgia and hearing loss and can lead to recurrent acute otitis
      media, development of chronic otitis media with effusion and cholesteatoma. Endoscopic
      transnasal balloon ET dilatation is a novel surgical technique for ET dysfunction. The main
      goal is to restore ET function by dilation its cartilaginous part leading to better
      ventilation and drainage of the middle ear. However, its real effect in the treatment of
      particular subgroups of patients with ET dysfunction remains unknown. Patients are mostly
      evaluated as one group.

      Adults with chronic ET dysfunction will be strictly divided into particular subgroups and
      included in the study. The otomicro(endo)scopy, symptoms severity according to VAS (Visual
      Analogue Pain Scale), ETDQ-7 (Eustachian Tube Dysfunction Questionnaire) questionnaire,
      tympanometry, audiometry and the possibility of Valsalva and Toynbee maneuver will be used to
      evaluate the effect of balloon ET dilatation. Only patients with standard treatment failure
      will be included in the study. Tuboplasty with and without myringotomy will be performed (and
      compared) in patients with chronic otitis media with effusion. Subgroups will be compared in
      order to find patients who could profit from the treatments the most.
