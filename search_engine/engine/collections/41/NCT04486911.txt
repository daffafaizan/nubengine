      triple-positive breast cancer (Simon's two-stage design). After providing written informed
      consent, the participants will undergo combined treatment of pyrotinib maleate, CDK4/6
      inhibitor SHR6390, and letrozole. The effectiveness of the combined treatment will be
      evaluated by MRI every two treatment cycles. If the disease progresses, the participant will
      withdraw from the trial. If the combined treatment has identified effectiveness, the
      participant will undergo surgical treatment within 4 weeks (over 2 weeks) after termination
      of the neoadjuvant treatment. The patients will be followed up for 5 years.
