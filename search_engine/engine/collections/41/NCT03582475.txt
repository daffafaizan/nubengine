    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the preliminary efficacy of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in combination with
      standard-of-care cisplatin-based chemotherapy by assessing the durable response rate (DRR),
      overall response rate (ORR), duration of response (DOR), and progression free survival (PFS)
      by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 and overall survival (OS) in
      Cohorts 1 and 2, and radiographic PFS (rPFS) by Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 (PCWG3) and
      prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response in Cohort 2.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of pembrolizumab in combination with etoposide
      and cisplatin/carboplatin or docetaxel and carboplatin assessed by parameters of adverse
      events (AEs).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine correlation of biomarkers including PD-L1 expression (PD-L1 positive >= 1% by
      immunohistochemistry [IHC] using 22C3 antibody), and serum and tissue molecular (including
      genomic, proteomic) biomarkers that may be indicative of clinic response or safety.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Courses
      repeat every 3 weeks for 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Participants also receive standard of care chemotherapy comprising either etoposide
      IV on days 1-3 and cisplatin IV or carboplatin IV on day 1 (Cohort 1), or etoposide IV on
      days 1-3, carboplatin IV on day 1, and docetaxel IV on day 1 (Cohort 2). Treatment repeats
      every 3 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 30 days, every 9-12
      weeks for up to 2 years, and then every 12 weeks thereafter.
