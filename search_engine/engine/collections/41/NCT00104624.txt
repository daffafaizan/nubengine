      Primary

        -  Determine degree of autonomy in instrumental activities of daily living on-therapy and
           at 6 and 12 months, as measured by Lawton's Instrumental Activities of Daily Living
           Scale, in older women with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the breast treated with
           docetaxel.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the response rate in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine overall and progression-free survival of patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the degree of autonomy in daily activities as measured by Katz's Activities of
           Daily Living Scale, in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine mood status, as measured by the Geriatric Depression Scale, of patients
           treated with this drug.

        -  Determine toxicity of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive docetaxel IV on days 1 and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6
      courses.

      Ability to perform daily activities is assessed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 53 patients will be accrued for this study.
