      are integral components of combined physical therapy (CPT), the recommended treatment for
      peripheral lymphedema (LE). According to the World Health Organization, LE afflicts hundreds
      of millions worldwide and probably millions in the United States. Effects of various forms of
      massage on lymph circulation have been postulated for more than a century, but the efficacy
      of MLD alone without CB has not been demonstrated. New data suggest that MLD alone reduces
      established LE volume as effectively as CB in combination with CPT and minimizes LE
      development.

      Patients will be randomly assigned to either treatment with MLD alone or a combination of MLD
      and CB. Patients will be treated in 10 one-hour sessions over 2 weeks. They will also undergo
      lymphangioscintigraphy (a nuclear medicine test) to depict the function of their lymphatic
      system. Patients will continue self treatment at home and will be followed for 6 months.
