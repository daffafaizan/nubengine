      local anesthetics) that are FDA approved for injection into muscles. The alternative is a
      noninvasive treatment option using pelvic rehabilitation which involves vaginal muscle
      massage. Both treatment options have been used and reported; however, rapidity of improvement
      and return to normal sexual function have not been assessed. This study assigns patients to
      either treatment option randomly and the sexual function is assessed based on standardized
      sexual function questionnaires as well as pain ratings.
