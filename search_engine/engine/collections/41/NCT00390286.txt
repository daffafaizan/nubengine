      audio images from a clinic or emergency room to a remote place where a physician can review
      images in real time (as they happen). The system uses site independent software to access the
      camera system from multiple locations. This research study will determine if it is feasible
      to obtain informed consent for various types of research trials (hypothetical, non-invasive,
      invasive trails) via telemedicine. Inpatient assessments on participants to complete clinical
      research case report forms by telemedicine will also by performed.
