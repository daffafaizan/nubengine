      treatment during the preceding 6 months were recruited. Exclusion criteria were : HIV
      infection and previous TB. Interferon gamma release assay (T-SPOT.TB, Oxford Immunotec) was
      sampled during the 2 first weeks of treatment, at the end of treatment and 6 months later.

      T-SPOT.TB was analysed qualitatively (pos/neg) and quantitatively (Spot forming units: SFU)
      to determine if there was a higher rate of negative tests at the end of treatment and 6
      months after treatment than initially. Paired samples were analysed to compare SFU counts
      between beginning of treatment and end of treatment, and SFU counts between end of treatment
      and 6 months later.

      Clinical response to treatment was recorded, as well as treatment failures and relapses.
