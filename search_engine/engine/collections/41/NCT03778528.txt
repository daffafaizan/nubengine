      increase is unclear. Normally, once cataracts become a significant impairment, an
      ophthalmologist will determine when cataract surgery should be performed. When this surgery
      is performed, cataractous tissues are cut out and discarded with medical waste. In this
      study, these tissue will be collected and protein analysis performed to determine what
      changes in different proteins are found in Down syndrome lenses as compared to normal
      cataractous lenses.
