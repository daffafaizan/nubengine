    
      Fun For Wellness is an online intervention designed to promote growth in well-being and
      physical activity by providing confidence-enhancing learning opportunities to participants
      [1]. The conceptual framework for the Fun For Wellness intervention is guided by
      self-efficacy theory [2]. Evidence has been provided for the efficacy of Fun For Wellness to
      promote self-reported physical well-being actions in free-living adults who comply with the
      intervention [3]. The objective of this feasibility study is to address uncertainties
      regarding the inclusion of accelerometer-based assessment of physical activity within the Fun
      For Wellness online intervention among free-living adults with obesity in the United States
      of America.

      Four specific aims will be investigated. Aim 1. To determine if accelerometer-based
      assessment of physical activity can be used within the Fun For Wellness intervention.

      Aim 2. To determine if accelerometer-based assessment of physical activity should be used
      within the Fun For Wellness intervention.

      Aim 3. To determine how to implement accelerometer-based assessment of physical activity
      within the Fun For Wellness intervention.

      Aim 4. To provide a preliminary effect size estimate for each direct effect in the conceptual
      model for the Fun For Wellness online intervention.

      Pursuit of these four specific aims is based on a general conceptual framework for
      feasibility and pilot studies in preparation for a future definitive randomized controlled
      trial [4-6]. Within this conceptual framework, a randomized pilot trial is a type of a
      feasibility study and a feasibility study may include a focus on the acceptability of an
      intervention [4-6].
