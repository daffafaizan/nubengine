      the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of a Web-based format of the PFH intervention, compared
      to a written Materials control condition. The study was conducted among childhood and young
      adult cancer survivors, who smoke, at four survivor clinics. Participants in both conditions
      received access to pharmacotherapy at no cost. Participants in the Web condition received
      access to an interactive Web site that focuses on survivorship, health, and smoking.
