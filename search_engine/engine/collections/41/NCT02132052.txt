    
      Specific Aim 1: Determine which features of resting Magnetoencephalography (MEG) brain
      activity most sensitively discriminate between PD with normal cognition, PD with mild
      cognitive impairment (MCI), and PD dementia (PDD). Investigators predict that frontal network
      slowing and connectivity will discriminate between normal cognition and MCI while
      visuospatial network involvement will distinguish the PDD group.

      Specific Aim 2: Determine which features of resting MEG brain activity most sensitively
      discriminate PDD from Alzheimer's Disease. Investigators predict that PDD will be
      distinguished from Alzheimer's (AD) on the basis of increased network connectivity,
      particularly in frontal and visuospatial networks.

      Specific Aim 3 Investigate how resting state MEG activity correlates with task related brain
      activity. Investigators predict that resting state slowing will be associated with decreased
      task related brain activity.

      Specific Aim 4: Determine which features of resting MEG brain activity most sensitively
      discriminate between motor subtypes of PD and also other relevant clinical populations
      (essential tremor and Parkinson plus syndromes). Investigators predict that frontal and
      parietal slowing and connectivity will discriminate PD from related conditions and that
      patterns of motor cortex connectivity and activity will differentiate among PD motor
      phenotypes.
