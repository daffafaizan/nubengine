    
      For purposes of this clinical study, the Sinopsys Lacrimal Stent is intended to provide a
      means of administering saline sinus irrigation via a transcaruncular-ethmoid sinus access in
      patients with moderate to severe chronic rhinosinusitis with ethmoid involvement. The purpose
      of the administration of saline irrigation is to reduce the intensity of symptoms of chronic
      rhinosinusitis in this patient population.
