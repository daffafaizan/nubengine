      Disease (NAVI-HF) study, the investigators propose to recruit 416 AA men with Heart Disease
      receiving inpatient care at UAB Hospital and randomize them either to Heart Disease self-care
      education plus a patient navigator-delivered self-care plan (Education + PN arm) or to Heart
      Disease self-care education alone (Educational Control arm). The investigators will compare
      participant outcomes such as all-cause and Heart Disease readmission rates, Heart Disease
      self-care adherence as well as cost effectiveness across the two intervention arms. Our
      Specific Aims are:

        1. To assess the 30-day all-cause readmission rates among male African American Heart
           Disease patients receiving Heart Disease self-care education plus a patient
           navigator-delivered self-care plan versus Heart Disease self-care education alone

        2. To assess the Heart Disease self-efficacy and heart failure self-care adherence among
           male African American Heart Disease patients receiving Heart Disease self-care education
           plus a patient navigator-delivered self-care plan versus Heart Disease self-care
           education alone

        3. To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of Heart Disease self-care education plus a patient
           navigator-delivered self-care plan versus Heart Disease self-care education alone
