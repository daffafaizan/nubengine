      sedation in most centers. Advantages over general anesthesia include facilitating arrhythmia
      induction, avoidance of intubation and ventilator related complications and shorter
      post-procedure recovery times for most patients. However, the cumulative respiratory
      depressant effects of fentanyl and midazolam during prolonged procedures can rarely cause
      hypoventilation resulting in hypercapnea and respiratory failure. Complex catheter ablations
      for atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia can exceed 3-5 hours in duration
      requiring large cumulative doses of midazolam and fentanyl. End tidal CO2 monitors,
      particularly in non-ventilated patients, have limitations and obtaining frequent arterial
      blood gas samples are often impractical. It remains unknown if contemporary trancutaneous CO2
      monitoring (TCO2)can provide a feasible alternative to avoid over-sedation and resultant
      respiratory complications during complex catheter ablations with sufficient agreement to
      invasively obtained PCO2 data.
