      characterized by slower information processing, associated with deficits in episodic memory,
      attention and executive functions. These disorders appear early, regardless of functional
      impairment, in "benign" forms and in clinically isolated syndromes of multiple sclerosis.
      These disruptions can have a significant impact in the socio-professional and personal life
      of patients and also in the quality of life (job loss risks, daily activities limitations).

      Even if these disorders are now well documented, remediation strategies remain less studied.
      Some studies show that the "training" methods, often used, do not seem suitable for clinical
      monitoring, with benefits that do not persist over time. Despite their impact on daily life,
      no specific care for planning abilities, mental inhibition and flexibility, or even social
      cognition, have been well studied until today. The same is true concerning metacognitive
      abilities. Finally, remedial techniques are time consuming and difficult to adapt to patients
      still in professional activity.
