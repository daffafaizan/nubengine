      body. Participants will be asked to drink 8 oz. of juice daily for 12 weeks. Biomarkers,
      which are indicators of health, will be measured throughout the study. They are present in
      blood and urine. The placebo is a juice that is not made from pomegranates, but resembles
      pomegranate juice in color and taste. Eating pomegranates has been shown to have a positive
      impact on certain biomarkers. Recent studies have shown that biomarkers can be indicators of
      general health. The investigators want to know if drinking pomegranate juice daily for 12
      weeks is effective at improving a variety of biomarkers in diabetic adults.
