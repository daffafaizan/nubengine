      reconstruction, and current rehabilitation approaches are not successful in optimizing
      quadriceps strength and knee function even years after the surgery. We hypothesize that
      suboptimal strength and functional outcomes after ACL surgery are due to the lack of
      task-specific exercise elements during strength training. This application seeks to assess
      whether progressive functional resistance training during gait will significantly improve
      quadriceps function, neural excitability, and knee mechanics during gait. The proposed
      studies will not only lay the foundation for a novel training paradigm, but will also improve
      our understanding of the mechanisms mediating neuromuscular and biomechanical changes after
      functional resistance training.
