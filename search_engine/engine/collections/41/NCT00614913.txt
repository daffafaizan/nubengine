      diagnosed in the U.S. population with increasing frequency. While surgery is the first line
      of treatment, many patients are not eligible for surgical removal. Current non-surgical
      treatments for HCC are not fully effective and can have substantial side-effects. This study
      utilizes a type of radiation treatment called proton beam that can deliver high doses of
      radiotherapy to tumors within the liver while minimizing damage to surrounding healthy
      tissues. The treatment is non-invasive and is given on an out-patient basis over a three week
      coarse. The study will evaluate the effectiveness and side-effects of this therapy by
      tracking patient's outcomes following treatment.
