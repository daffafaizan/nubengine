      included the following arms:

        -  oral midazolam + oral ketamine + inhaled sevoflurane

        -  oral midazolam + oral ketamine + inhaled oxygen So, the former protocol found in the PRS
           registry was called PedSed-III and included the aforementioned arms.

      However, there was a long delay in fund release from the funding agency (State of Goias
      Research Foundation - FAPEG). Although the grant was approved in the beginning of 2013,
      resources were released in November 2013.

      We could not wait for funding release because this study was part of the MS dissertation of
      the principal investigator that was supposed to be concluded in the first semester of 2013.
      Then we decided to develop a less robust study, including only two arms: oral midazolam
      versus oral placebo. The other variables of the study did not change. We finished this
      two-arms study and have the final results for that comparison.
