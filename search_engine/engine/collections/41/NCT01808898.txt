      as endometrial ablation have gained wider acceptance in the last decade. However, pain
      experienced during these procedures can be a disincentive and is the commonest reason for the
      use of escalating levels of analgesia post procedure, which results in prolongation of
      hospital stay and recovery. Various methods of LA have been studied including intrauterine
      topical lignocaine or cervical block using topical lignocaine, paracervical block or
      intracervical block. However, a single site block individually may not be sufficient to
      control the pain completely due to inability of the one site block to affect the sensitivity
      of the whole uterus, as the uterine fundus is effectively still unanaesthetised. This may be
      due to the uterus receiving complex innervations from different nerve routes such as the
      uterovaginal plexus, the Frankenhauser nerve plexuses, parasympathetic ganglia and the
      thoracic nerve.

      Therefore, it seems logical to use a direct cervical block to block the sensation through
      uterovaginal plexus and use an additional deep myometrial block adjacent to each cornua to
      directly block the thoracic nerve supply. To date, only one small observational study has
      looked at the effect of such a combined block in relieving pain during outpatient
      hysteroscopic procedures. Therefore, we propose to undertake a double blind randomised
      controlled trial to address this question by comparing effectiveness of a standard direct
      cervical block and intrauterine cornual block (ICOB) versus a direct cervical block and a
      normal saline intrauterine cornual injection (control).
