      Achilles tendinopathy. Patients who fail a standardized physical therapy regiment (eccentric
      training protocol) will be randomly allocated into two groups with one group receiving an
      injection of hypertonic glucose and Lidocaine (sclerosing solution) and the other receiving
      an injection of Lidocaine (control). Neovascularisation (growth of new blood vessels and
      nerves into a damaged area of the tendon) appears to be associated with pain and subsequently
      a decrease in function and use of the affected tendon. Results of an observational study in
      Sweden revealed that in all patients for which eccentric training was unsuccessful
      neovascularisation was present. Sclerosis of neovessels appears to be successful in removing
      the pain associated with Achilles tendinopathy in both mid-portion and enthesitis patients.
      However, there are no studies that have administered this technique to a homogenous patient
      population in a prospective, controlled and randomized manner. In addition, there are no
      studies that have compared the effects of eccentric training in healthy individuals versus
      patients with painful Achilles tendinopathy in a controlled longitudinal study. It is
      expected that patients for whom eccentric training is unsuccessful and who subsequently
      receive sclerosing therapy will show a statistically significant improvement in pain and
      function.
