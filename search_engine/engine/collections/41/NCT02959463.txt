    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of pembrolizumab administered after radiation
      therapy in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) who have not undergone
      extrapleural pneumonectomy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess progression-free and overall survival (progression free survival [PFS] and
      overall survival [OS], respectively) in patients receiving pembrolizumab after radiation
      therapy for malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate biomarkers of interest, including cytokines, measurements of T-cell
      activation, and serum exosome micro ribonucleic acid (RNA)s with the delivery of
      pembrolizumab after radiation therapy for MPM.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts.

      COHORT 1: Patients undergo hemithoracic radiation therapy.

      COHORT 2: Patients undergo palliative radiation therapy over 1-3 weeks to only the region of
      palliation (a region that does not include the entire side of the chest or thorax).

      After radiation therapy, both cohorts receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over about 30
      minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 3 weeks for up to 2 years in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 6 weeks for
      48 weeks, then every 12 weeks for up to 5 years.
