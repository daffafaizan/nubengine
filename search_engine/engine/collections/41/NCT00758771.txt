      upon optimal mucus viscosity and elasticity. These mechanisms are severely impaired in cystic
      fibrosis. The physical properties of sputum can be measured using rheological methods,
      enabling comparison between mucus in health and in disease. Therapies which enhance mucus
      clearance from the airway and decrease the volume of airway secretions are collectively
      called "mucoactive agents." Therapies which specifically disrupt innate mucus architecture by
      breaking intermolecular entanglements and bonds are called mucolytic agents. Mucolytic drugs
      can be considered in three general categories: classic mucolytics (n-acetylcysteine), peptide
      mucolytics (PulmozymeÂ®), and non-destructive mucolytics (hypertonic saline). Using
      state-of-the-art rheological methods, we can characterize the physical properties of CF mucus
      and measure the rheologic effects of mucoactive drugs more accurately and reproducibly than
      what has been previously done in the literature. In this way, we will determine which of the
      current mucoactive agents are most effective in normalizing sputum rheology in CF, and we
      will gain important insights about the limitations of current mucoactive drugs.
