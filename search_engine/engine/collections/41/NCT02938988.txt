      reduction of periodontopathogenic bacteria with absence of systemic side effects and minimal
      bacterial resistance. Therefore, a good adjuvant alternative for periodontal disease
      treatment arises, especially for patients with Down syndrome (DS) who present greater
      severity and high prevalence of periodontal disease. Usually aPDT is used as an adjunct
      therapy to scaling and root planning.
