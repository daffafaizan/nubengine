    
      This was a Phase III, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, multicenter, repeat dose
      study of the safety and efficacy of 2 dose levels of Acurox™ Tablets versus placebo for the
      treatment of moderate to severe postoperative pain following bunionectomy surgery.

      Patients underwent a primary unilateral first metatarsal bunionectomy with or without
      ipsilateral hammer toe repair during standardized local anesthesia with intravenous (IV)
      sedation. Eligible patients who reported moderate or severe pain within 6 hours after surgery
      entered the Treatment Phase and were randomized to 1 of 3 double blind treatments: placebo
      tablets or 1 of 2 dose levels of Acurox™ Tablets (ocyxcodone HCl/niacin). The Treatment Phase
      continued with study medication every 6 hours (irrespective of rescue medication use) for 48
      hours (8 doses of study medication). Toradol (ketorolac tromethamine) was available as a
      rescue medication upon request.
