      68Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC PET/CT or 68Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC PET/MRI over MRI alone, using histologic
      confirmation or serial follow-up for up to 2 years as the gold standard for determination of
      primary prostate cancer or prostatic cancer recurrence/metastasis. It is hypothesized that
      this will demonstrate the superiority of 68Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC PET to MRI for sensitivity, and
      the non-inferiority of 68Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC PET to MRI for specificity.This is a paired,
      case-control design that is appropriate to statistically evaluate the difference in
      sensitivity and specificity between the two imaging modalities. Therefore, the estimation of
      population prevalence is not a study objective, and estimation of clinical utility through
      calculation of positive and negative predictive values is not appropriate. Imaging studies
      and follow up subject scans will be organized so that a panel of independent readers will
      evaluate the MRI and PET studies to assess the level of suspicion for prostate cancer.
