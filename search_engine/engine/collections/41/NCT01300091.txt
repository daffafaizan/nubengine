      individuals consulting for a new episode of shoulder problem is surprisingly poor. The
      objectives are to characterize the consumption of medical care and outcome of shoulder pain
      and disability in primary health care.

      A composite questionnaire consisting of demographic information and ASES questionnaire was
      used to measure the shoulder function. The patients were sent a second questionnaire after
      one year.
