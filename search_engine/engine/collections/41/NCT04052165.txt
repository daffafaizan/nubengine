      primary outcome is IOP reduction. The secondary outcome is glaucoma medication post surgery
      and complication that occurred during the follow up. The subjects are refractory glaucoma
      patients that need glaucoma drainage device implantation. The measurement are collected on
      first day, first month, third month, sixth month and twelve month. The IOP will be measured
      using GAT (Goldmann applanation tonometer), but if the subjects are not cooperative, they
      will be measured using i-care. On the follow up, the glaucoma medication needed will be noted
      and also for the complication and the need for other surgery, e.g. AC formation using
      viscoelastic, repair tube/plate exposure, cyclo photocoagulation, etc.
