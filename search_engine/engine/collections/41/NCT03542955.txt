      breaking down, losing fluid, and becoming stiffer over time. As obesity and age increase, the
      likelihood of cervical osteoarthritis increases as well. When the pain caused by the broken
      down discs becomes severe, it may result in a loss of mobility in the neck region. Chronic
      neck pain has a serious impact on not only quality of life, but can also negatively affect a
      persons ability to lead a healthy active lifestyle. Standard analgesic therapy it limited in
      efficacy and can result in serious adverse effects specially with long term use.
