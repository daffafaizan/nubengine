      increasingly established. However, the presence of atrial fibrillation (AF), mainly in its
      permanent form, makes the clinical picture of these patients more compromised. The literature
      has not yet demonstrated studies involving indication of physical exercise therapy when AF is
      associated with HF. Thus, the hypothesis is that physical training improves functional
      capacity, cerebral oxygenation, autonomic aspects, vascular aspects, cardiac function, plasma
      markers, quality of life and cognitive function of these patients.
