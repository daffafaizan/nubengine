      70% people with diabetes have died of cardiovascular diseases.

      Framingham 's study has proven the increase of the congestive heart-failure (2.4:1 in male
      patients and5:1 in female patients), which has no association with the age, hypertension,
      obesity, cardiovascular disease and Hyperlipidemia[1]. Other prospective studies also showed
      that the patients with diabetes in the early stage may be subject to abnormal echocardiogram
      and their probabilities of suffering from heart failure in the lifetime and Q-wave and non-Q
      wave myocardial infarction will be increased[1,2]. Early in 2000, American Heart Association
      issued a statement that "diabetes is a cardiovascular disease" [3]and in 2007, with reference
      to the joint guidelines concerning diabetes, pre-diabetes and cardiovascular disease,
      European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the European Diabetes Research Institute (ESAD)
      clearly pointed out that hyperglycemia and cardiovascular disease (CVD) are closely related
      and the danger of CVD can be raised notably for those whose blood glucose is normal when
      fasting but tend to increase postprandially[4]. In the pathogenesis study of cardiovascular
      complications of diabetes, the promotion of oxidative stress and declination of the heart
      antioxidant reserves have close associations with the cardiovascular complications in animal
      and human body[5]. A number of cytokines and inflammatory signaling pathways are involved
      including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (HsCRP),
      adiponectin, IL-6, NF-κB[1,6]. Accordingly, this study analyzes the echocardiography,
      high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and tumor necrosis factor-α of the patients with
      diabetics in our hospital in order to find early warning indicators of the cardiovascular
      complications of diabetes and provide prevention and treatment for cardiovascular
      complications of diabetes.
