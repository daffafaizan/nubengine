      I. Estimate the antitumor activity of ABI-007 in patients with persistent or recurrent
      squamous or nonsquamous cell carcinoma of the cervix who have failed on higher-priority
      treatment protocols.

      II. Determine the nature and degree of toxicity of ABI-007 in this cohort of patients.

      III. To determine the expression of the SPARC (secreted protein, acidic and rich in cysteine)
      protein in the tumor tissue and plasma (exploratory study) of patients treated with this
      regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.

      Patients receive ABI-007 IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Blood samples are collected at baseline and periodically during study for SPARC protein
      expression analysis by ELISA. Archived tumor tissue samples are also analyzed.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 5 years.
