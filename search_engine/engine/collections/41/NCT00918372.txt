      up to 100 female athletes who are competitive long distance runners, and have been so for a
      minimum of 10 years. Multi-slice computed tomography (MSCT) will be used to characterize the
      amount, severity and type of atherosclerotic lesions. MSCTA will be performed per usual
      practice using a minimum X-ray dose protocol.

      The study will determine whether moderate to high intensity, long term athletic training and
      competition is associated with enhanced coronary artery disease in women. Each participant
      will complete a life-style, training volume and risk factor questionnaire. These participants
      will be compared to an age, gender and risk factor matched cohort.
