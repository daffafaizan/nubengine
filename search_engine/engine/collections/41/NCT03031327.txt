      Lubricin 50 µg/ml eye drops solution or sodium hyaluronate (HA) 0.18% eye drops solution will
      be enrolled.

      As the primary objective of this study is to evaluate the tolerability and safety of Lubricin
      (20 and 50 μg/mL) eye drops solution administered over 2 weeks in patients with ocular
      discomfort following ocular refractive surgery, sample size was calculated based on clinical
      feasibility and no formal sample size calculation has been performed.
