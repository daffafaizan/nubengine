    
      Background

        -  Ixabepilone (Ixempra (Trademark), BMS-247550, NSC 710428) is a semi-synthetic analog of
           the natural product epothilone B.

        -  The epothilones are a novel class of non-taxane microtubule-stabilizing agents obtained
           from the fermentation of the cellulose degrading myxobacteria, Sorangium cellulosum.

        -  Ixabepilone is active against cancer models that are naturally insensitive to paclitaxel
           or have developed resistance to paclitaxel, both in-vitro and in-vivo.

      Objectives

      Primary-

      - Establish the efficacy of the investigational agent ixabepilone in patients with cervical
      carcinoma when administered as a daily one-hour infusion on days 1 to 5 every three weeks, as
      measured by overall response (PR (partial response) +CR (complete response)).

      Secondary-

        -  Assess pharmacodynamic endpoints to determine the extent of tubulin polymerization and
           whether or not there has been activation of cellular death pathways distal to the
           target.

        -  Estimate progression-free survival and duration of response.

      Eligibility

        -  Age greater than 18

        -  Histologic or cytologic confirmation of cervical carcinoma; either squamous cell or
           non-squamous consisting of cervical adenocarcinoma, cervical adenosquamous carcinoma or
           cervical carcinoma, non-squamous type.

      Design

        -  Phase II study, open, non-randomized

        -  Ixabepilone will be administered at a dose of 6mg/m^2 daily on days 1 through 5, every
           three weeks.

        -  Restaging will be done every two cycles using RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in
           Solid Tumors)

        -  Planned maximum enrollment 76 persons
