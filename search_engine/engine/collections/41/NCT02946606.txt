      sequentially assigned starting with Group 1. Each group will be comprised of subjects who
      will receive both GX-H9 and Genotropin, and subjects will be randomly assigned to either
      GX-H9 and Genotropin in the ratio of 4:1. The treatment will proceed as the proposed group
      order (Group 1, Group 2, Group 3), and safety and insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) will be
      reviewed six weeks after each treatment by the safety monitoring committees before proceeding
      to the next group.
