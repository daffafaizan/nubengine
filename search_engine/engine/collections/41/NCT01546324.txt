      gestation. Subjects will received $200 reimbursement for providing this blood sample. The
      collected samples will be used to help develop non-invasive prenatal diagnostic testing using
      Natera's Parental Support technology which is already commercialized for genetic diagnosis of
      in-vitro embryos. In this study, the technology will be tested for it's ability to analyze
      fetal-specific pieces of DNA isolated from the mother's blood. No results of the maternal
      blood testing will be reported to the subject or to their physicians.
