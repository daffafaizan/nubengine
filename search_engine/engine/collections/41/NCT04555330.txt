      hospital in Copenhagen, Denmark. Patients admitted to Department of Respiratory Medicine (2
      wards), Department of Cardiology, and Department of Geriatrics will be included, and they
      will have their physical activity level measured either with or without a bedside monitor
      providing visual feedback of time spent bedridden, sitting, standing and walking.

      All participants will have their physical activity measured during hospitalisation.
      Approximately half of the participants will receive visual feedback about the amount of
      physical activity from a mobile device placed on the bedside table.
