    
      OBJECTIVES:

      I. The study's primary goal is to assess the ability of Cu-64-TP3805 (copper Cu 64 TP3805) to
      detect primary breast lesions as determined by the F-18-FDG (fludeoxyglucose F 18) scan.

      II. The study's second goal is to determine the ability of Cu-64-TP3805 to detect primary
      breast lesions as determined by histology (sensitivity).

      III. The study's third goal is to determine the ability of Cu-64-TP3805 to detect metastatic
      lesions as identified by the F-18-FDG whole-body scan.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-finding 2-stage study.

      STAGE I: Patients with a positive biopsy and abnormal (positive) fludeoxyglucose F18-labeled
      PET whole-body scan undergo a whole-body copper Cu 64 TP3805-labeled PET scan.

      STAGE II: Patients with a positive biopsy, but no fludeoxyglucose F18 scan undergo a breast
      fludeoxyglucose F18-labeled PEM scan followed by a breast copper Cu 64 TP3805-labeled PEM
      scan.
