      CFTR modulators is correlated to in vitro responses to these drugs of epithelial cells
      derived from the patients, as assessed by CFTR-dependent Chloride secretion. Epithelial cells
      will be derived either from nasal or rectal epithelia, and consist both of cultured cells and
      organoids. The drugs tested will be Ivacaftor, or Lumacaftor/Ivacaftor, according to
      patient's treatment. Results of these assays will be compared with response to treatment at 6
      and 12 months, assessed by clinical response and in vivo assay of CFTR function.
