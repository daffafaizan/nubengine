      carnitine in patients with Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) 2 to 17 years of age. Cohort 1 is a
      double-blind placebo-controlled randomized intention to treat protocol for SMA "sitters" 2 -
      8 years of age. Subjects will undergo two baseline assessments over 4 to 6 week period, then
      will be randomized to treatment or placebo for the next six months. All subjects will then be
      placed on active treatment for the subsequent six month period. Cohort 2 is an open label
      protocol for SMA "standers and walkers" 3 - 17 years of age to explore responsiveness of
      efficacy outcomes. Subjects will undergo two baseline assessments over a four to six week
      period, followed by one year active treatment with VPA and carnitine. Outcome measures are
      performed every 3 to 6 months, and include blood chemistries, functional testing, pulmonary
      function testing, electrophysiological evaluations, PedsQL quality of life assessment,
      quantitative assessments of survival motor neuron (SMN) mRNA from blood samples, growth and
      vital sign parameters. Six centers will enroll a total of 90 patients.
