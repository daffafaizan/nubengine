      ADHD and determine whether sleep extension improves inhibitory control, a primary deficit in
      ADHD.

      Design: Children with and without ADHD completed two 5-day assessments: a baseline condition
      in which children followed their normal bedtime routine and a sleep extension condition in
      which children were instructed to go to bed 90 minutes earlier than their habitual bedtime.
      Sleep was assessed with actigraphy and, on the final night, polysomnography. A Go/No-Go task
      was used to assess inhibitory control.

      Setting: Participants slept in their home on nights 1-4 and in the sleep laboratory on night
      5 of each condition.

      Main Outcomes and Measures: Of interest is actigraph measurement of total sleep time for the
      baseline compared to the sleep extension condition. Polysomnography will be used to compared
      changes in sleep physiology. The primary behavioral outcome is inhibitory control, indexed by
      accuracy on No-Go trials in the Go/No-Go task.
