    
      This is an single-blind, randomized, comparative multicentric, phase III study to evaluate
      the safety and efficacy of DA-3803(r-hCG) in comparison with Ovidrel in the induction of
      final follicle maturation and early luteinization in 180 Korean female subjects undergoing
      superovulation. The study is organized on an outpatient basis in subjects undergoing assisted
      reproductive technologies (ART). The subjects are randomized into 2 groups. One group receive
      DA-3803(r-hCG) 250mcg and the other group receive OvidrelÂ®(r-hCG)250mcg. Each subject in both
      groups receives a single injection of hCG when the follicular development was judged to be
      adequate. Oocytes are retrieved 34-38 hours after r-hCG injection and fertilized in vitro.
      Not more than 4 embryos are to be replaced. Progesterone is administered daily according to
      center's normal practice, starting after the oocyte pick up and continuing until appropriate
      time. The subject is followed up and the treatment outcome (negative pregnancy test or
      pregnancy) is recorded.
