      subjects with cystic fibrosis. Many studies could not find an association between delta F 508
      and severity of pulmonary disease . The most important factor in CF lung disease is an
      inflammation driven by leukocytes and cytokines. The investigators have provided evidence in
      former studies that cytokines (Interleukin-8 (IL-8), tumour necrosis factor (TNF) alpha,
      Lipopolysaccahride binding protein (LBP), transforming growth factor (TGF) ÃŸ)measured in
      blood correlate negatively with lung function in delta 508 homozygous patients.

      The question arises, what other factors influence recruitment of proinflammatory leukocytes
      from blood capillaries into the lung .

      Connexins are a family of transmembrane proteins, which oligomerize into hexameric structures
      to form a hemichannel (connexon) and ultimately pair with a partner hemichannel in an
      adjacent cell to form gap junction intercellular communication channels (GJIC) . There is
      evidence of expression of connexin 37 (=gap junction protein A4 (GJA4)) on macrophages in
      humans. Moreover there is evidence of expression of connexin 37 on vascular endothelia in
      humans . Connexin 37 is expressed on human neutrophils . Pulmonary disease in CF is dominated
      by a leukocyte driven inflammation. GAP junction proteins might be of importance for the
      influx of blood cells into the lung. In this regard, the hypothesis was that Cx37 or Cx43
      genotypes have an impact on clinical disease phenotype in CF patients homozygous for delta
      F508. The first analysis (Horn et al 2020) has shown a clinical phenotype linked to the GJA4
      genotype is very similar to MBL variants. In this regard the question arises whether there is
      a link between the MBL variant alleles and the GJA4 variants.
