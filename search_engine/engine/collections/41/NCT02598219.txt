    
      1. Routine exams required for diagnosis:

             -  Endometrioid biopsy or product of a dilatation-curettage under hysteroscopy for
                diagnosis of histologic typing

             -  Tumor assessment: Lombopelvic MRI (1.5 or 3T) with gadolinium injection, studied by
                steady and dynamic sequences. US and CT-Scan in case of intolerance to MRI should
                be discussed. FDG-PET may be an option.

        2. Tumor board: The completed chart will be reviewed to confirm the risk group and
           indication.

        3. Complete physical and gynecological examination by surgical oncologist followed by a
           consultation of anesthesiology to confirm the operability of patient.

        4. Informed and signed consent form.

        5. Study baseline assessment.

           Then,

        6. Surgery should be performed within a maximum of 4 weeks from the first consultation,
           according arm allocated:

           Arm A: Sentinel node policy*

           Arm B:

             -  Bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy (intermediate risk endometrioid)

             -  Or Ilio-infrarenal paraaortic lymphadenectomy (high risk endometrioid)

             -  Or Pelvic + paraaortic lymphadenectomies (high risk non endometrioid)*

                  -  along with a peritoneal staging for each arm (cytology, random biopsies,
                     infracolic omentectomy)

        7. Second tumor board: after definitive pathological results of the
           hysterectomy-annexectomy and node (sentinel or not) specimens.
