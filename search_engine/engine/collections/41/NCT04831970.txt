      features or rising PSA after radical prostatectomy proposed for receiving 31 Gy in 5 sessions
      each of 6.2 Gy to the prostatic bed delivered in one week, and up to 32.5 Gy in 5 sessions
      each of 6.5 Gy delivered in one week, respectively, in case of clinical relapse.

      Patients will be treated by means of image guided volumetric modulated radiotherapy
      (IGRT-VMAT). A real time non-ionizing target monitoring might be used to account for
      intra-fractional errors, if deemed appropriate. Whether the dose constraints to the normal
      tissues are at risk, these will be prioritised over the prescription dose to the target. The
      primary endpoint of the trial is to assess the treatment related toxicity measured by the
      CTCAE v5.0. Secondary endpoints are quality of life in different domains (sexual, rectal ,
      urinary) and biochemical outcome.

      Patients will be followed at approximately one month, then every 3 months for the first 12
      months and every 6 months thereafter. Quality of Life will be prospectively evaluated through
      validated tools (ECOG, EPIC, IIEF-5, ICIQ-SF) at various timepoints. Percentage or total mean
      score will be reported according to the questionnaires, whether they grade values in a scale
      or use descriptive statistics. Kaplan-Meier curve analysis of biochemical relapse free
      survival (b-RFS) at 2 and 5-year bRFS for all patients will be estimated.
