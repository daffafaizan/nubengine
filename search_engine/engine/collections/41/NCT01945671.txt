    
      All women undergone IVF-ICSI cycles will be recruited in the study. They will be divided into
      3 subgroups according to their BMI: 18.5-24.9 -normal; 25-29.9 - overweight ; ≥30 - obese.

      i. A blood sample will be collected on the day of OPU and several markers will be checked-
      triglycerides, free fatty acid, cholesterol (HDl, LDL), insulin, glucose, lactate, IGF-1,
      Leptin E2, Progessterone, IL-1, Il-6 and TNF-α.

      ii. After isolation of the oocytes from the follicular fluids - a blood free fluid from the
      leading follicle will be collected in a container for further evaluation of metabolic markers
      including triglycerides, free fatty acid, cholesterol (HDl, LDL), insulin, glucose, lactate,
      IGF-1, Leptin E2, Progessterone, IL-1, Il-6 and TNF-α , ROS.

      iii. Cumulus cells will be collected after denudation of oocytes for ICSI and will be
      analyzed for apoptosis marker - Caspase 3 staining , Tunnel iv. Oocytes diameter - all
      denudated oocytes will be captured in the inverted microscope and the diameter will be
      measured.

      v. GV oocytes, M1 and M2 that fail to fertilize will be analyzed for triglycerides, FFA and
      cholesterol concentration.

      vi. GDF-9, BMP-15, BMP-6, TNF-α, SMAD family will be analyzed by western blott as marker for
      oocytes quality.

      vii. Number of oocytes, mature (M2) oocytes, fertilization rate, cleavage rate, number
      embryos transferred, implantation rate, and pregnancy rate will be followed as well.
