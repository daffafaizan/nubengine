    
      This is a 6-month, 100% remote study that will collect a broad range of data that may provide
      insight into the COVID-19 global pandemic. All data will be collected by participant entry
      into a mobile app designed for this study.

      Upon entering the study, participants will be asked a series of questions about their prior
      exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus including reporting prior test results, and identification
      and description of contact with known or cases or other high risk encounters. Participants
      will also provide a detailed medical history.

      On on ongoing basis, participants will be asked to report any symptoms associated with
      COVID-19 that they develop, and any new contacts they experience with known cases. Some
      participants will be sent an at-home SARS-CoV-2 antibody test and asked to report the
      results. In addition, participants will be asked to report the result of any other test they
      receive for COVID-19 outside of the study.
