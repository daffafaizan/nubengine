    
      Phase 1 study will recruit a total of 172 healthy children who are matched by sex and age.
      Aside of being stunted, children must have normal weight for length z-score (not wasted or
      overweight). Data collection will be performed as follows:

        1. Dietary intake of the children will be collected by 9 days Estimated Food Record by
           visiting the respondents house

        2. Urine will be collected once to measure intestinal permeability profile using Lactulose
           Mannitol ratio indicator.

        3. Dried blood spot from finger prick will be collected to essential blood amino acid.

      To collect information on locally available and culturally accepted protein rich food
      sources, series of focus group discussion (FGD) and market survey will also be implemented.

      Food-based approaches will be developed according to the information attained from phase 1
      study. Problem nutrients that are identified from dietary assessment will be fulfilled
      through optimization of locally available food by using linear programming approach. Problem
      nutrients that are not able to be fulfilled by CFR will be use as a basis to develop a Food
      multi-mix (FMM) formula. Data of intestinal permeability profile will be used to add other
      locally available food in FMM that are potential to improve intestinal permeability.
