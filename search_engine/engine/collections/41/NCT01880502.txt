      within 4 weeks (-28d~-2d) prior to the day scheduled for taking the investigational product
      (1d). The final subjects determined eligible for this clinical trial through screening tests
      are randomized to the dose groups with Belviq 10 mg and 20 mg. Twelve subjects are assigned
      to each group (9 subjects to study drug and 3 subjects to placebo), and the study drug or
      placebo are administered to the corresponding administration group. The subjects are
      discharged on the morning of 4d after completing the set study schedule at 72 hours after
      administration. The subjects then visit for the final tests on the last out-patient visiting
      day. Belviq is progressed sequentially from the low-dose group to the high-dose group.

      The blood sampling time for the pharmacokinetic evaluation is as follows. Blood sampling for
