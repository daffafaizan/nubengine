    
      Using a web based tool, the clinicians of the two study centers will review 24 hours of
      recording (raw EEG data + derived qEEG variables).

      The intensivists will evaluate:

        -  symmetry,

        -  sedation level,

        -  seizures activities and

        -  artefact on continuous cEEG/qEEG tracings. The same tracings will be blindly reviewed by
           a certified neurophysiologist (using the app). The neurophysiologist evaluation will be
           considered as "reference".

      The results of the evaluation will be compared (intensivists vs. neurophysiologist) in order
      to understand if the intensivists are able to adequately identify the pathological findings.

      The study period will be:

        -  before a formal training

        -  after a formal training by neurophysiologist in order to understand if the training is
           able to improve the intensivists performance.
