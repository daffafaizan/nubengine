      normally used biomarkers (c-reactive protein - CRP, interleukin 6 - IL6, procalcitonin - PCT)
      in the early diagnosing of sepsis in the critically ill patients A broad range of clinical
      and laboratory parameters are combined (Surviving sepsis campaign, international guidelines)
      for early sepsis identification: white blood cells (WBC), C-reactive protein (CRP),
      interleukin 6 (IL-6), procalcitonin (PCT).

      An ideal biomarker should be a fast and specific increase in sepsis, short half-life, rapid
      decrease after administration of an effective therapy and fast (bed-side) method of
      determination. None of the current biomarkers have all of these characteristics.

      We investigate the diagnostic accuracy of presepsin compared to other biomarkers (WBC, PCT,
      IL6, CRP) for infection or sepsis, defined according to Sepsis-3 definition (Singer, JAMA
      2016) in adult patients admitted to ICU with suspected sepsis.
