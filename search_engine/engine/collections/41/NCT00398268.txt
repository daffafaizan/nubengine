    
      children who arrive at the emergency unit with a dislocated both-bone distal forearm fracture
      will be asked to join the trial.

      After an unstable reposition, the fracture will be fixated with 2 Kirschner-wires. The arm
      will be immobilised in above elbow cast during 4 weeks. Outpatient clinic visits till a
      follow-up of 6 months. During these visits we will investigate: consolidation and dislocation
      on X-ray, function of both arms, complains in daily living and complications.
