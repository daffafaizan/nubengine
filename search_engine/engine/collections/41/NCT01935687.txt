      spinal cord lesions, neurological and muscular diseases, lower limb trauma, age …etc.

      Although the wheelchair help to regain mobility, this made of displacement is nor natural nor
      well-to-do.

        -  The CIC-IT and TSR (Transmissions Services Roulements, Mérignac, France) improved the
           instrumented wheel, adaptable with all wheelchairs, with information wireless
           transmission.

        -  The primary objective of study is to validate the instrumented wheel of manual
           wheelchair such as a new device of evaluation of capacities of displacement in ecologic
           situation.

        -  The primary criteria is to compare the mechanical power calculated using instrumented
           wheel versus the power calculated using ergometer roller during protocol of standard
           cardio-respiratory stress test.

      This study is interventional, mono-centric, controlled and crossover. The population
      concerned is patients with spinal cord injury (SCI) and users of manual wheelchair.

      Number of subjects projected for the entire study: 62 patients The total duration of
      participation of each patient: 7 days ±2days
