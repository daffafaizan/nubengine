      Primary

        -  Evaluate the 6-month overall survival rate in patients with gemcitabine
           hydrochloride-refractory metastatic pancreatic cancer treated with bevacizumab and
           erlotinib hydrochloride.

        -  Determine the safety and toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Evaluate the objective response rate in these patients.

        -  Evaluate time to tumor progression in these patients.

        -  Determine the efficacy of this regimen, in terms of the proportion of patients with â‰¥
           50% decline in carbohydrate antigen 19-9, also called cancer antigen 19-9 (CA19-9)
           biomarker, in these patients.

        -  Obtain sequential measurements of circulating tumor cells (micrometastases) and
           endothelial cells in serum and correlate these variables with clinical outcomes (in
           patients enrolled in UCSF site only).

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, nonrandomized, multicenter study.

      Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1 and oral erlotinib hydrochloride
      once daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo blood collection at baseline and periodically during study for
      biomarker/laboratory analysis, including the CA19-9 biomarker. Circulating tumor
      micrometastases and endothelial cells are also measured in patients enrolled in University of
      California San Francisco (UCSF) site.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 30 days and at 6 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study.
