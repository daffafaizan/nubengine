      newborn. For that purpose, a lot of factors are strictly interconnected each other's and have
      to be carefully evaluated. The choice of embryo culture system and of embryo selection
      strategy plays a crucial role in obtain and identify the embryo with the highest implantation
      potential. One really important key factor is the choice of the culture media. Currently,
      there are numerous commercially available culture media showing very different compositions.
      Essentially two strategies have been applied for the design of culture media: 1) "Back to
      nature" for sequential media, based on the physiology of the embryo and the measured
      concentration of substances present in its natural environment and 2) "Let the embryo choose"
      for single step media, where none a priori assumption of the concentration of a component is
      made. In the literature, there are a lot of studies analyzing the effect of culture media on
      human preimplantation embryos development and comparing biological and clinical outcomes
      among different media compositions. Several studies performed a comparison about the
      development of human zygotes in either a one-step or two-step culture system. Usually there
      were no significant differences between the two culture media systems regarding biological or
      clinical outcomes. Anyway, a greater number of blastocysts were generally obtained by the
      continuous single medium culture if compared with sequential culture media, even if the
      implantation and clinical pregnancy rates are comparable.
