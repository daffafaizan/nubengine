    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES I. Evaluate whether the factor structure of the adapted Eating
      Questionnaire-Ecological Momentary Assessment (EQ-EMA), which has been modified for real time
      assessment, will be similar to the factor structures for cognitive restraint (CR) and
      uncontrollable eating (UE) factors assessed by the Three Factor Eating Questionnaire-R18v2
      (TFEQ-R18v2) in a sample of adolescent and young adult (AYA) survivors of childhood central
      nervous system (CNS) tumors in the United States (US).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES I. To validate the original TFEQ-R18v2 in a sample of AYA survivors of
      childhood CNS tumors in the US.

      II. To determine the association of the original TFEQ-R18v2 with self-reported body mass
      index (BMI).

      III. To determine the association of the original TFEQ-R18v2 with fruits and vegetables,
      fiber, and fat intake.

      IV. To determine the association of EQ-EMA with self-reported BMI. V. To determine the
      association of EQ-EMA with fruits and vegetables, fiber, and fat intake.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Patients complete the TFEQ-R18v2 questionnaire, a dietary intake assessment, and the
      EQ-EMA questionnaire online.

      GROUP II: Patients complete the EQ-EMA questionnaire, a dietary intake assessment and the
      TFEQ-R18v2 questionnaire.
