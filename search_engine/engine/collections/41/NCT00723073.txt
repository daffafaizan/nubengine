      This retrospective cohort analysis of converting from caspofungin to micafungin as empiric
      antifungal therapy for cancer patients who are persistently febrile and neutropenic after
      receiving broad spectrum antibiotics at Brigham & Women's Hospital / Dana Farber Cancer
      Institute (BWH/DFCI) is designed to evaluate the following objectives:

        -  Safety of micafungin in this patient population

        -  Effective dose of 100 mg daily of micafungin compared to 70mg x1, then 50 mg daily of
           caspofungin

        -  Economic impact of converting or formulary echinocandin from micafungin to caspofungin

      Study Design

        -  Retrospective cohort analysis - limited to medical records

        -  Data to be collected include the following:

             -  Demographic information: including: gender, age, race

             -  Past medical history and admitting diagnoses

             -  Laboratory results: Liver function tests (LFTs), Including alanine aminotransferase
                (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), Total bilirubin, as well as serum fungal
                assays: Serum Galactomannan assay, 1.3-BD Glucan assay

             -  Concomitant medications and duration of therapy for all systemic: antibiotics and
                antifungals

             -  All invasive breakthrough fungal infection details, including speciation and
                outcomes during echinocandin therapy

             -  Dosing, duration, and adverse events associated with echinocandin therapy
