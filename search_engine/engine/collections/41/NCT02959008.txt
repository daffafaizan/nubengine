    
      Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a noninvasive technology that real-time monitors
      cerebral tissue oxygenation index (TOI). Investigators use Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)
      to monitor cerebral autoregulation of hypertensive participants and non-hypertensive
      participants.
