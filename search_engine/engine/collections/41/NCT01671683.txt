      with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) because of increased local control, enhanced
      sphincter preservation, and less toxicity.NCRT has enhanced down-staging of tumor and reduced
      local recurrence. However, survival benefit of NCRT has not been demonstrated and the rate of
      distant metastasis was still reported as high as 30%.

      Patients with pathologic complete remission (pCR) after NCRT have shown excellent survival
      benefit. We inferred that additional chemotherapy during the resting period could enhance the
      pCR rate. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of an
      additional 4-week chemotherapy with capecitabine after the conventional 6-week NCRT in
      patients with LARC.
