      between embryos with a normal set of chromosomes (euploid) and those with an abnormal set of
      chromosomes (aneuploid). In this study, we will apply a novel validated next generation
      sequencing technology called copy number variation sequencing (CNV-Seq) to comprehensively
      screen a trophectoderm biopsy sample from patient's embryos for chromosomal abnormalities
      that commonly arise in human embryos. The hypothesis is that PGS performed using CNV-Seq on
      embryos produced by patients with a poor prognosis for pregnancy (maternal age > 35),
      followed by transfer of chromosomally normal euploid embryos, will result in significantly
      higher implantation, pregnancy and live birth rates and lower miscarriage rates compared to
      patients having no PGS.
