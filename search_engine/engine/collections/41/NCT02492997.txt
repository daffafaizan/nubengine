    
      This is a multi-site, prospective, controlled, randomized, double blinded clinical trial.
      This study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a series of treatments using
      the Venus Versa Octipolar applicator. Up to 60 healthy subjects at 10 sites shall be
      recruited by the investigator from within the investigator's subject population. Subjects
      shall have abdomen circumference to reduce for the designated treatment area.

      Each subject will undergo 6 treatments at an interval of one treatment per week for six
      consecutive weeks. There will be a one month follow up which will occur 4 weeks after the 6th
      treatment.

      At the first treatment visit, the investigator will collect demographic and medical
      information and randomization will take place. Subjects have an equal opportunity to be
      selected for the treatment or the control group.

      The duration of the treatment session will be approximately 60 minutes. Expected immediate
      response includes temporary mild to moderate erythema and/or edema. Skin safety assessments
      will be conducted by the investigator after each treatment session and at the follow-up
      visit.

      Photography will be conducted at baseline, the beginning of 4th & 6th treatment and at 1
      month follow up visit. Subjects will be asked to complete a questionnaire after each
      treatment and at the one month follow up visit.

      Circumference measurements will be conducted at base line, before each treatment and at
      follow up visit. The treatment will be considered successful if the treated area
      circumference, reduces by at least 2.5 cm.
