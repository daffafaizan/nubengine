      (abbreviated NAMPT), which is involved with making energy for the cancer cell. OT-82 deprives
      the cancer cell of the energy that it needs to grow and divide.

      This is a Phase 1, non-randomized (all participants will receive the study medication),
      open-label (identity of the study drug will be known to the participant and the study staff),
      controlled (the methods of the study are not random) study. Approximately 45 -50 participants
      at approximately 10 study centers across the USA will take part in this research study. The
      starting dose for Stage 1 is 16.5 mg/m2 per day. Participants in Stage 1 will be assigned a
      dose dependent on when he or she entered the study. Doses will increase for each new group of
      3 to 6 participants until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or the maximum tested dose is
      reached. OT-82 is an oral liquid suspension that will be taken by mouth once per day for 3
      days followed by a 4-day rest period.. A participant may continue to receive treatment with
      OT-82 as long as the study doctor feels it is in their best interest; as long as the
      participant does not develop intolerable side effects; as long as the participant wishes to
      remain in the study; or as long as the sponsor does not close the study.

      Participants in Stage 2 of the study will receive either the MTD or the maximum tested dose
      of OT-82 determined in Stage 1. Assessment of anti-tumor activity will primarily focus on
      categorical objective response (Partial Response (PR) or Complete Response (CR)) as defined
      according to the consensus recommendations of the Lugano Classification criteria for
      malignant lymphoma (Cheson et al., 2014).
