      evaluating the efficacy and safety of dupilumab for the treatment of NS. Patients will be
      randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive dupilumab (2 doses of 300 mg), or placebo, at baseline
      and then 1 dose of dupilumab 300 mg, or placebo, every 2 weeks until week 14 (total of 8
      administrations).Moderate to severe NS were selected in order to be able to measure the
      improvement of skin condition.
