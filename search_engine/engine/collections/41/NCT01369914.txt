    
      OBJECTIVE:

      The study objectives are to study the development of ocular graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)
      in participants treated with stem cell transplantation (SCT) at the NIH, including exam
      findings prior to SCT, changes in ocular signs and symptoms following SCT and response to
      standard therapy in participants identified with dry eye and ocular GVHD; to develop clinical
      outcome measures for early onset and more advanced ocular GVHD and provide estimates of
      progression rates for these outcomes; to analyze tear fluid, impression cytology (IC) and
      serum samples from participants undergoing SCT, to identify biomarkers or other findings
      which may predict the onset of ocular GVHD or correlate with disease progression or response
      to therapy and to establish a cohort of participants with ocular GVHD in anticipation of
      future clinical trials.

      STUDY POPULATION:

      Up to 50 adult participants undergoing SCT at the NIH, and up to 50 healthy adult
      participants will be enrolled.

      DESIGN:

      This prospective, natural history study will follow participants through 12 months post-SC,
      with the option to extend follow-up for up to five years.

      OUTCOME MEASURES:

      The primary objective outcome variable is ocular surface staining using fluorescein and
      lissamine green dyes, as measured by the Oxford criteria, with the scale ranging from 0 to 15
      in each eye. The primary subjective outcome measure is the Ocular Surface Disease Index
      (OSDI), ranging from 0 to 100. Secondary outcome variables include best-corrected visual
      acuity (BCVA), tear film osmolarity, Schirmer s tear testing with anesthesia, meibomian gland
      function and tear break-up time. In addition, tear fluid biomarkers and/or IC will be studied
      as secondary outcome variables to determine whether changes in biomarker levels (tear fluid)
      or cell densities and morphologies (IC) correlate with the development or progression of
      ocular GVHD.
