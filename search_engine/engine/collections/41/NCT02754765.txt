    
      This is a Phase III, randomized, controlled, open-label, non-inferiority, multi-country trial
      evaluating the efficacy and safety of new combination regimens for MDR-TB treatment.

      Regimens examined combine newly approved drugs bedaquiline and/or delamanid with existing
      drugs known to be active against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (linezolid, clofazimine,
      moxifloxacin or levofloxacin, and pyrazinamide). The study will enroll in parallel across 5
      experimental and 1 standard-of-care control arms. Randomization will be outcome adapted using
      Bayesian interim analysis of efficacy endpoints. Experimental regimens will contain
      bedaquiline and/or delamanid and up to 4 companion drugs. Control-arm treatment may contain
      one of the following (bedaquiline or delamanid) and companion drugs, constructed and
      delivered according to local standard of care and consistent with WHO guidelines. Trial
      participation in all arms will last at least until Week 73, and up to Week 104. In the
      experimental arms, treatment will be for 39 weeks (participants in the experimental arms will
      be allowed up to 47 weeks to complete the 39-week treatment course) and post-treatment follow
      up for up to 65 additional weeks. In the control arm, treatment will be delivered according
      to local standard of care (in consistence with WHO guidance); duration may vary and will be
      approximately 86 weeks for the conventional regimen and 39-52 weeks for the standardized
      shorter regimen.

      Non-inferiority will be established for any experimental arm if the lower bound of the
      one-sided 97.5% confidence interval around the difference in favorable outcome between the
      control and experimental arms is greater than or equal to -12%.
