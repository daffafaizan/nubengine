      of febrile respiratory illnesses in Mexico and the United States. It rapidly spread to many
      countries around the world, prompting the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare a
      pandemic on June 11, 2009. Antiviral drugs, such as oseltamivir or zanamivir, may be
      effective in treating cases of swine flu, but large-scale immunization is an essential
      approach of controlling the pandemic.Although preliminary evidence from a matched
      case-control study suggests some protection from the 2008-9 trivalent inactivated vaccine
      against pandemic influenza A/H1N1 2009, particularly severe forms of the disease. A vaccine
      against H1N1 is expected to be the most effective tool for controlling influenza A (H1N1)
      infection.In response to the pandemic, novel vaccines against the virus strain
      A/California/07/2009(H1N1) have been developed and recently were approved for vaccination
      among specific populations in China.The primary safety objective of this study is to assess
      the safety of split- virion inactivated H1N1 vaccine without adjuvant when administered at
      the 15 ug dose.The primary immunogenicity objective is to assess the hemagglutinin antibody
      and neutralizing antibody response following split- virion inactivated A(H1N1) vaccine
      without adjuvant. Participants 148 healthy persons age 18-60 years who have no history of
      novel influenza H1N1 2009 infection or novel influenza H1N1 2009 vaccination. This is an
      observational, Phase II study in healthy males and non-pregnant females, aged 18-60
      years.This study is designed to investigate the safety and immunogenicity of an inactivated
      influenza H1N1 virus vaccine after approved by the Chinese Food and Drug
      Administration.Following immunization, safety will be measured by assessment of adverse
      events through 21 days. Immunogenicity testing will be hemagglutination inhibition (HI)
      assays and microneutralization (MN) assays on serum obtained on the day 0,7 and 21 after
      vaccination.In addition, we will take clinical researches on applying blood fix to treat
      critical H1N1 patients and collect blood of healthy persons who are inoculated with H1N1
      vaccines to cure critical H1N1 patients and further observe the effectiveness and safety, for
      the purpose of working out a new weapon against H1N1. According to the Blood Donation Law of
      the People's Republic of China, the blood donation shall follow principle of voluntary.The
      donors should be healthy persons inoculated with specific H1N1 vaccine and their titer of
      H1N1 hemagglutination inhibition antibody must be 1ï¼š320 or more than after examination (the
      kit shall be provided by the WHO) by Shanghai Municipal Center for Disease Control and
      Prevention.
