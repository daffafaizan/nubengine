      their previous CD-LD treatment to IPX066 over a 6-week period. Up to 40 subjects were to be
      enrolled in the study. Enrollment was defined as subjects who received study drug in Part 1 -

      Approximately 24 subjects were to enroll in Cohort 1 (non-OPDM subjects) and up to 16
      subjects at selected sites were to enroll in Cohort 2 (OPDM subjects). For the subjects
      enrolled in Cohort 2, along with the OPDM measurements, PK blood samples were also to be
      collected.
