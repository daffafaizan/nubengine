      in wheat-containing foods. Living with is far from easy and associated with restrictions and
      various dilemmas in daily life, leading to depressed mood and reduced well-being,
      particularly in women. We decided to include 100 celiac disease women on a gluten-free diet
      into a randomized controlled education trial in order to compare problem-based learning with
      usual care. Outcome measures will be two frequently employed questionnaires: PGWB
      (Psychological Well-being Index) to monitor Well-being and GSRS (Gastrointestinal Symptom
      Rating Scale) to measure the rate bowel symptoms as assessed at 6 months after the
      intervention.
