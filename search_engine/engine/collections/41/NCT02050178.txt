      evaluated. Depending on emerging safety data from the Phase 1a study 54F28-001 with
      continuing dose escalation, additional higher dose levels of OMP-54F28 may be evaluated in
      this study. No dose escalation of OMP-54F28 will be allowed within a dose cohort.

      Once the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum administered dose (MAD) has been determined,
      up to 10 patients may be enrolled in the cohort-expansion phase to better characterize the
      safety, tolerability and PK of OMP-54F28 combined with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine. Up to
      approximately 34 patients may be enrolled into the study.
