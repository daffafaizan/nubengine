      angiography and 2D echocardiography. Some of patients in the ICM-1 and ICM-2 groups undergo
      stress echocardiography with dobutamine.

      Coronary arteriography is performed using the Axiom Artis (Siemens; Erlangen, Germany) and
      transthoracic two-dimensional Doppler echocardiography (TTE) with the Acuson Sequoia 512
      (Siemens; Erlangen, Germany)).

      Besides, all of the ICM-1 and ICM-2 groups patients undergo myocardial perfusion imaging.
      Standard two-day stress-rest imaging protocol is used. Adenosine at a dosage of 140
      mcg/kg/min (for 4 min) is used as a pharmaceutical stress agent.

      ICM-1 group and Control group for GBPS undergo gated blood pool SPECT (GBPS) at rest and
      during increasing doses of dobutamine (5/10/15 Î¼g/kg/min) (n = 60) ICM-2 group and Control
      group for CFR undergo dynamic SPECT (n = 40). This investigation is combined with routine
      myocardial perfusion imaging so patients are not exposed to extra stress.

      Than ICM patients undergo surgical treatment of ICM in different volume. All of them receive
      coronary bypass grafting (CABG); some patients undergo the left ventricular reconstruction
      and intervention on the mitral valve.

      In the early postoperative period (7-14 days), the ICM-1 group undergo rest GBPS and ICM-2
      group undergo dynamic SPECT by two-day protocol. All patients undergo TTE too.

      After at least 12 month, all patients undergo TTE to assess the presence of left ventricular
      (LV) remodeling.
