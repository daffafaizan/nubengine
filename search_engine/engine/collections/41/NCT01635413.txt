      I. Compare the relative efficacy of tai chi and strength training to prevent falls in female
      cancer survivors.

      II. Determine the mechanism by which tai chi and strength training each reduces the risk of
      falls.

      III. Determine how well the benefits of each intervention persist after structured training
      stops.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Quantify and compare the relative efficacy of tai chi and resistance exercise on
      biomarkers common to both cancer progression and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in women cancer
      survivors. (Optional ancillary study) II. Quantify and compare the relative efficacy of tai
      chi and resistance exercise on biomarkers unique to CVD in women cancer survivors. (Optional
      ancillary study) III. Determine the influence of initial and changes in adiposity on changes
      in biomarkers from exercise. (Optional ancillary study) IV. Explore the effects of exercise
      training on a biomarker of accelerated aging in women cancer survivors. (Optional ancillary
      study)

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients attend strength training classes for 1 hour 2 days per week.

      ARM II: Patients attend tai chi classes for 1 hour 2 days per week.

      ARM III: Patients attend supervised stretching and relaxation classes for 1 hour 2 days per
      week.

      In all arms, treatment continues for 6 months.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 6 months.
