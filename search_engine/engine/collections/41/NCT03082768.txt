    
      The overall goal of this protocol is to evaluate [18F]MNI-968 (aka PF-06730110) as a D1
      receptor targeted radiopharmaceutical.

        -  To measure the dynamic uptake and washout of [18F]MNI-968 in brain using positron
           emission tomography (PET) in healthy volunteers.

        -  To measure blood metabolites of [18F]MNI-968 in the healthy volunteers and to perform
           invasive as well as non-invasive modeling to assess [18F]MNI-968 binding to D1 receptor.

        -  To acquire safety data following injection of [18F]MNI-968

        -  Evaluation of [18F]MNI-968 PET reliability (test/retest) of several outcome measures
