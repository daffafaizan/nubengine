      periodontal examinations, but the treatment group receives active dental procedure such as
      scaling and root planing. Both groups also receive post-myocardial infarction management.

      As part of a pilot study, this study used the primary outcome measure for changes in
      surrogate markers rather than clinical outcomes.
