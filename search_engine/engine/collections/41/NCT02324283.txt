      HPV) of OLV compare with propofol which is used in general anesthesia for lung resection.

      Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) wiill be used to measure pulmonary blood flow during
      surgery visible and successively. To confirm the effect of HPV by measuring the change in
      pulmonary blood flow. The correlation between the blood oxygen concentration and attenuation
      of blood flow will be investigated.
