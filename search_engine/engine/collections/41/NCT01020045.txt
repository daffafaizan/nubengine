      function, may play a key causal role in the bone loss associated with HIV/AIDS, by driving a
      "switch" from OPG production to overproduction of RANKL". The investigators propose to
      determine the role of perturbations in B and T cells on OPG and RANKL production and on bone
      turnover.

      This is a cross-sectional analysis of changes in BMD (DXA), and B cell and T cell function in
      HIV seronegative/seropositive subjects matched by known risk factors for osteoporosis. Serum
      will be collected for quantitation of total OPG and RANKL, and for biochemical markers of
      bone turnover (CTx, and TRAP5b), specific and sensitive markers of osteoclast activity, and
      for osteocalcin and P1NP, specific and sensitive markers of bone formation by commercial
      ELISAs. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) will be isolated and total and percentage
      frequency and absolute number (/mL) of B cells (CD19+) and T cells (CD3) and their subsets
      (CD4 and CD8). B cells (CD19) and T cells (CD3 and CD4 and CD8) will be immunomagnetically
      purified and OPG and RANKL mRNA and protein production quantitated by RT-PCR and ELISA
      respectively. As a secondary endpoint, B cells will be fractionated into subsets based on
      differential expression of the markers CD10, CD21 and CD27 and OPG and RANKL production
      quantitated by in each subset by intracellular staining and FACS analysis.
