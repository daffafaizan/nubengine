      subjects. All subjects will receive standard of care (SOC) per institutional guidelines for
      SARS-CoV-2 infection. Subjects will be randomly assigned in a 1:2 ratio to standard of care
      alone or standard of care plus brequinar. The brequinar group will receive 5 daily doses of
      brequinar 100 mg on Days 1 - 5. Physical examinations, vital signs, laboratory assessments,
      SARS-CoV-2 testing, and other observations will be conducted by experienced personnel
      throughout the study based on the Schedule of Events. Blood chemistry tests include blood
      urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine amino transferase (ALT),
      aspartate amino transferase (AST), bilirubin, total protein, albumin, glucose, serum
      electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride, carbon dioxide/bicarbonate, and calcium), lactate
      dehydrogenase (LDH). Plasma will be collected for inflammatory markers such as D-dimer,
      ferritin, CRP, and ESR. Pro-inflammatory markers will be measured. Serum is to be collected
      for research purposes. Hematology tests include hemoglobin, hematocrit, complete blood count
      with full differential, and platelet count. Nasopharyngeal swabs for viral load will be
      collected Days 1, 3, 5, 7, and 15. Survival will be assessed through Day 29.
