      there is only one drug approved by the US FDA for the treatment of female pattern hair loss
      (AGA) - topical minoxidil.

      5% topical minoxidil is the maximum dosage approved by the US FDA for the treatment of female
      AGA. While topical minoxidil exhibits a good safety profile, the efficacy in the overall
      population is relatively low i.e., 30-40% re-grow hair.

      Minoxidil is a pro-drug. To elicit a clinical response, minoxidil must be converted to its
      active form minoxidil sulfate by a sulfotransferase enzyme found in hair follicles. The
      investigators have developed an in-vitro diagnostic test that correctly identifies, prior to
      initiating therapy, 95.9% of non-responders to 5% topical minoxidil. The diagnostic test
      analyzes the sulfotransferase enzymatic activity in hair follicles to determine if a
      sufficient amount of minoxidil will be converted to the active form required to induce hair
      growth. Subjects with low enzymatic activity experience little or no therapeutic benefit and
      a reduced frequency of adverse events.

      Consequently, the investigators hypothesize that in subjects with low enzymatic activity
      (i.e., low minoxidil metabolizers) an increased minoxidil dosage will elicit a therapeutic
      response with little or no increase in the frequency of adverse events. It is thus the
      primary purpose of this study to assess if a higher dosage of topical minoxidil dosage (15%)
      will increase the number of responders among female subjects that have been identified
      through IVD testing as non-responders to 5% topical minoxidil.
