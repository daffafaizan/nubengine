      I. Establish a mechanism to bank specimens of tumor cells and host germline DNA from patients
      with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) at first and subsequent relapse.

      II. Make these specimens available to qualified researchers to study the biology of ALL.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients undergo collection of bone marrow and peripheral blood at diagnosis of relapse
      and/or at the end of the first month of treatment.

      Patients are followed periodically for up to 10 years.
