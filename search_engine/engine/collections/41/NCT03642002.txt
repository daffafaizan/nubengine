      randomly assigned to the music therapy group or control group and matched for diagnosis,
      co-morbidities, age, and gender. The music therapy group will utilize a certified music
      therapist to provide live music based on the patient's cultural preferences and entrainment.
      The primary outcome is a reduction in mechanical ventilation hours of 35% compared to the
      control group. Secondary outcomes include: Amount of sedation, Richmond Agitation-Sedation
      Scale (RASS), delirium and pain score, ICU and hospital length of stay. The researchers
      hypothesize that live entrained music therapy compared to control will result in a reduction
      in the time of extubation, amount of sedation administered, ICU and hospital length of stay.
