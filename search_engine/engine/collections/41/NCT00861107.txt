      anti-tumor vaccine within the body of patients with advanced cancers. The aim of the study is
      to evaluate the safety of administration and anti-tumor effect of a vaccine protocol that has
      three separate phases. Cancer patients generally present with an immune response to cancer
      biased to a Th2 response, while a Th1 response is considered necessary for mediating
      anti-tumor immunity. The first step of the study consists of three (3) weekly intradermal
      priming doses of AlloStim. The aim of this step is to create Th1 immunity to the alloantigens
      in AlloStim, thus increasing the number of Th1 cells in circulation. The second step of the
      protocol involves the cryoablation of a selected tumor lesion followed by an intratumoral
      AlloStimTM injection. The aim of this step is to generate tumor-specific CTL killer cells in
      the circulation. The final step is an intravenous infusion of AlloStim. The aim of this step
      is to activate circulating Th1 cells, killer cells, and natural killer cells The further aim
      of this step is to create an inflammatory environment that can break-down the ability of the
      tumor to avoid an anti-tumor immune response.
