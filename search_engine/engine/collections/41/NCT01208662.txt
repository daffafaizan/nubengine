      patient will be randomized into one of the study groups: lenalidomide, bortezomib and
      dexamethasone without autologous stem cell transplantation, followed by lenalidomide
      maintenance (Arm A) or lenalidomide, bortezomib and dexamethasone with autologous stem cell
      transplantation, followed by lenalidomide maintenance (Arm B). There is an equal chance of
      being placed in either group.

      All participants will receive one cycle of lenalidomide, bortezomib and dexamethasone
      treatment before being randomized to Arm A or Arm B.

      Participants in Arm A will receive two additional cycles of lenalidomide, bortezomib and
      dexamethasone prior to stem cell collection. If randomized to Arm A, the subject will undergo
      stem cell collection, followed by five cycles of lenalidomide, bortezomib and dexamethasone.
      This will be followed by lenalidomide maintenance treatment until disease progression.

      Participants in Arm B will receive two additional cycles of lenalidomide, bortezomib and
      dexamethasone prior to stem cell collection. If randomized to Arm B, the subject will undergo
      stem cell collection and autologous stem cell transplantation, followed by two cycles of
      lenalidomide, bortezomib and dexamethasone. This will be followed by lenalidomide maintenance
      treatment until disease progression.
