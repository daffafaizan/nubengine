      migalastat 150 mg; Stage 2 included migalastat 450 mg. Each dose of migalastat was selected
      to evaluate interaction with each of 3 doses of recombinant agalsidase: 0.5 mg/kilogram (kg)
      agalsidase beta; 1.0 mg/kg agalsidase beta; 0.2 mg/kg agalsidase alfa.

      Migalastat was administered orally. Agalsidase alfa was administered as a 40-minute
      intravenous (IV) infusion and agalsidase beta was administered as a 2-hour (hr) IV infusion.

      Stage 1 consisted of 3 treatment periods with 14 days intervening between each period.

      Period 1, Day 1: agalsidase was administered alone.

      Period 2, Day 1: migalastat was administered, followed 2 hrs later by agalsidase.

      Period 3, Day 7: migalastat was administered alone.

      Stage 2 consisted of two 14-day treatment periods in which the plasma exposure of migalastat
      was characterized when migalastat was administered with agalsidase solely to confirm the
      attainment of adequate migalastat plasma concentrations.

      Period 1, Day 1: agalsidase was administered as an IV infusion using a calibrated infusion
      pump.

      Period 2, Day 1: migalastat was administered, followed 2 hrs later by agalsidase.
