      detection of myocardial ischemia and viability during conventional Cardiac Magnetic Resonance
      (CMR) wall motion stress testing. Patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease
      and scheduled for cardiac catheterization will be consented for inclusion in the study and
      evaluated during stress testing with low dose Dobutamine as the stressor agent. Data obtained
      with the MyoStrain SENC CMR Imaging System will be for observational purposes and will not be
      used to alter patient management.
