    
      This study is a multicenter, open, single-arm Phase I/II clinical study, which is divided
      into two research parts, namely phase I dose exploration study and phase II dose extension
      study. In the phase I dose exploration study, the safety, tolerance and PK characteristics of
      FCN-011 in patients with advanced solid tumors were determined, the MTD of oral fCN-011 was
      determined, and the RP2D of FCN-011 in the phase II clinical study was determined, and the
      efficacy of FCN-011 was preliminarily evaluated. The phase II dose extension study evaluated
      the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of continuous oral ADMINISTRATION of FCN-011 in
      patients with inoperable NTRK fusion and advanced stage III or IV solid tumors, as well as
      the characteristics of population pharmacokinetics (PopPK).

      A total of 35-82 patients were enrolled in this study, 15-24 patients were expected to be
      enrolled in the phase I study, and 20-58 patients were expected to be enrolled in the phase
      II study.
