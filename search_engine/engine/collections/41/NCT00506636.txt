      based on redistribution of hair follicles without any new follicle formation. It has been
      long that a lot of researchers have focused on developing skills in regenerating hair
      follicles. However, cultured dermal papilla cells lose the ability of inducing hair follicle
      formation after several generations in vitro culture. Our study is aiming in culturing dermal
      papilla cells in vitro and maintain their spherical structure before transplanting into
      dermis in vivo. Meantime, this study may help clarify the actual mechanism of inducing hair
      follicle by dermal papilla cells.
