    
      This French multicenter prospective observational study is aimed at determining if the
      decision of transient circulatory support (TCS) in cardiogenic shock is pertinent, i.e. at
      least as effective as the medical treatment.

      All patients with cardiogenic shock for whom indication of TCS was discussed within the
      multidisciplinary heart team (cardiologist, intensivist and cardiac surgeon) are
      consecutively included in the study.

      Two groups of patients are defined:

        -  Patients with cardiogenic shock treated by medical treatement

        -  Patients with cardiogenic shock treated by TCS (extracorporeal circulatory life support
           and/or Impella).

      The main objective is to compare mortality between the 2 groups. Secondary objectives are ICU
      follow-up characteristics and quality of life questionnaire at day 180.

      Statistical analysis will include a propensity-matched method to compare the groups to avoid
      confounding factors. The number of necessary subjects (n=240, 120 in each group) was
      calculated assuming that TCS has a superiority of 20% in comparison with medical treatment in
      severe cardiogenic shock, with a study power of 80%, and an alpha risk of 5%.
