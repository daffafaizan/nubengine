      associated changes in psychosocial functioning and relapse status. By using an accelerated
      longitudinal design, competing neurobehavioral decision systems (CNDS) functioning (measured
      using delay discounting), psychosocial functioning, and relapse will be characterized over a
      12-year period for individuals in alcohol use disorder (AUD) recovery.
