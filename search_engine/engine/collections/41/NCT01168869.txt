      studies and electronic records) programme funded over 5 years from the NIHR and Wellcome
      Trust. The central theme of the CALIBER research is linkage of the Myocardial Ischaemia
      National Audit Project (MINAP) with primary care (GPRD) and other resources. The overarching
      aim of CALIBER is to better understand the aetiology and prognosis of specific coronary
      phenotypes across a range of causal domains, particularly where electronic records provide a
      contribution beyond traditional studies. CALIBER has received both Ethics approval (ref
      09/H0810/16) and ECC approval (ref ECC 2-06(b)/2009 CALIBER dataset).

      Using data from MINAP and GPRD, patients experiencing their first myocardial infarction (MI)
      will be separated into three categories:

        -  'Heralded MI': patients who have been diagnosed or treated for cardiovascular disease
           for more than 90 days before MI.

        -  'MI with premonitory symptoms': patients who have been diagnosed or treated for
           cardiovascular disease within the 90 days prior to MI.

        -  'Unheralded MI': patients without a cardiovascular disease diagnosis or treatment at any
           time before MI.

      Patients with MI will be identified in the linked GPRD-MINAP record. Using GPRD population
      denominators, this study will establish the absolute incidence rates of first 'unheralded' MI
      by calendar year, age, sex, season, MI subtype (ST-elevation MI and non ST-elevation MI) and
      region and compare these to the rates of first 'heralded' MIs and first 'MI with premonitory
      symptoms'.
