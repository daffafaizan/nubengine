      Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD) in children and adolescents with
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common clinical challenge and leads to
      severe impact and burden on both the patients and their family. Although methylphenidate
      (MPH) showed good efficacy in the treatment of ADHD, there is still lack of well-established
      pharmacological treatment for DMDD. Furthermore, little research focuses on the effect of
      pharmacological treatment on neural correlates of chronic irritability. Previous literature
      suggested the potential role of atypical antipsychotics in the treatment of DMDD. Therefore,
      this study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of adjuvant of aripiprazole (APZ) to MPH in
      patients with comorbid ADHD and DMDD. In addition, the investigators explored the clinical
      manifestation and neural basis of DMDD using inventories, neuropsychological tests and
      neuroimaging studies.

      Methods:

      The investigators enrolled patients with ADHD+DMDD (n = 31) and ADHD only (n = 27). Those
      subjects were evaluated with inventories of emotional and behavioral problems,
      neuropsychological tests, as well as fMRI with challenging tests which aimed to induce
      frustration at baseline assessment. Then, subjects of ADHD+DMDD group received 6 weeks'
      combination treatment of MPH+ APZ with flexible dosage according to clinical judgment. All
      the initial evaluations were administered again after treatment. The comparison of clinical
      characteristics and neuroimaging findings between ADHD+DMDD group and ADHD only group will be
      conducted. In addition, the effectiveness of treatment will be analyzed. The effects of
      pharmacological treatment on neural correlates of chronic irritability will also be
      investigated.
