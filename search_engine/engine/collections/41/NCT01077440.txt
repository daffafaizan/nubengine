        -  To examine semen samples from male survivors of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell
           transplantation for the presence of donor-derived DNA.

      OUTLINE: Semen samples are collected and assessed by flow cytometry and PCR. DNA samples are
      compared to previously analyzed DNA extracted from survivor and donor. Samples are also
      analyzed for sperm concentration, motility, morphology, and viability.
