      intraocular injections of ranibizumab under pro re nata treatment regimen for the patients
      with diabetic macular edema (DME). Mean change of logarithm of the minimal angle of
      resolution (logMAR) visual acuity (VA), central foveal thickness (CFT), as well as predictive
      factors including best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) were assessed.
