      trial wherein participants with unilateral transfemoral amputation will be randomized to
      using one of two socket conditions (i.e., sub-ischial or ischial containment) before crossing
      over to the other socket condition. Random allocation (computer-generated) utilizing blocks
      of random size will be used to assign the initial treatment condition. The trial will be
      balanced such that all subjects will receive all treatments (i.e., both socket conditions)
      and that all subjects will participate for the same number of periods (i.e., two). While a
      washout period is not strictly necessary, it is effectively included as subjects will need to
      transition back to their usual, pre-study socket/prosthesis while the second test socket is
      fabricated.

      Allocation of intervention will be concealed from the investigators until after a subject is
      enrolled. The starting socket design will be enclosed in sequentially numbered, opaque,
      sealed envelopes. Envelopes will be opened sequentially and only after the participant's name
      and other details are written on the appropriate envelope.

      Blinding of prosthetic interventions is challenging given that they are devices that must be
      custom-fabricated and donned each day by the subject. Hence, for this study only the assessor
      will be blinded. The blinded assessor will be responsible for administration of the clinical
      performance and patient-reported measures as well as processing of motion analysis data.
