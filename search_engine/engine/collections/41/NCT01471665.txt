    
      This is a randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled, two-way cross-over study to evaluate
      the effect of treatment with repeat dose GSK2190915, a 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein
      (FLAP) inhibitor, as an add-on to current therapy on the percentage of neutrophils in induced
      sputum in asthmatic patients with elevated sputum neutrophils. Approximately 20 subjects will
      be enrolled onto the study to ensure that approximately 14 evaluable subjects complete the
      study. All subjects will receive oral placebo and GSK2190915 100mg once daily for up to 16
      days. Sputum neutrophilia will be assessed prior to treatment and on treatment. Key
      assessments: sputum cell counts, biomarker samples in sputum, blood and urine, and
      pharmacokinetics. Safety will be assessed by vital signs, electrocardiograms (ECGs), clinical
      laboratory safety tests and collection of adverse events (AEs).

      GSK2190915 is a high affinity 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein (FLAP) inhibitor that
      attenuates the production of leukotrienes, through the blockage of the first committed step
      in the leukotriene pathway, 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) activation. Leukotrienes are potent
      inflammatory molecules produced mainly by mast cells, eosinophils, monocytes/macrophage and
      neutrophils in response to allergic or inflammatory stimuli. As GSK2190915 reproducibly
      inhibits the production of leukotriene B4 (LTB4) and cysteinyl leukotrienes (cysLTs) both in
      vitro and in vivo it has strong potential utility in the treatment of asthma.
