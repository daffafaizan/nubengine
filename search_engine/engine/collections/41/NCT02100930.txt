    
      This treatment uses 3F8/GM-CSF and isotretinoin for: Group 1 patients are in 1st CR/VGPR;
      Group 2 patients are in a ≥2nd CR/VGPR; and Group 3 patients have primary refractory NB in
      BM. All patients will receive 3F8/GM-CSF through 24 months.

      Road Map/Schema for Group 1 (1st CR/VGPR) and Group 2 (≥2nd CR/VGPR) patients:

      Cycle 1 3F8 (iv) + GM-CSF subcutaneous (sc) (1 wk) 2-4-wk interval Cycle 2 3F8 (iv) + GM-CSF
      (sc) (1 wk) 2-4-wk interval* - oral isotretinoin x14 days Cycle 3 3F8 (iv) + GM-CSF (sc) (1
      wk) 2-4-wk interval - oral isotretinoin x14 days Cycle 4 3F8 (iv) + GM-CSF (sc) (1 wk) 6-8-wk
      interval - oral isotretinoin x14 days on, 14 days off, 14 days on Cycle 5 3F8 (iv) + GM-CSF
      (sc) (1 wk) 6-8-wk interval - oral isotretinoin x14 days on, 14 days off, 14 days on (6th
      cycle) Cycle 6 3F8 (iv) + GM-CSF (sc) (1 wk) 6-8-wk interval Cycle 7 3F8 (iv) + GM-CSF (sc)
      (1 wk) Continue with 6-8-wk intervals through 24 months from 1st dose of 3F8. * assessment of
      BM status by standard histology

      Road Map/Schema for Group 3 patients (BM positive): The break between end of a cycle of
      3F8/GM-CSF and start of next cycle is approximately 2-to-4-weeks through 4 cycles after
      achievement of CR in BM; subsequent breaks are ~6-8 weeks. Please see roadmap below for a
      patient achieving CR in BM after cycle 1. Cycle 1 3F8 (iv) + GM-CSF (sc) (1 wk) 2-4-wk
      interval* - BM negative Cycle 2 3F8 (iv) + GM-CSF (sc) (1 wk) 2-4-wk interval* - oral
      isotretinoin x14 days Cycle 3 3F8 (iv) + GM-CSF (sc) (1 wk) 2-4-wk interval - oral
      isotretinoin x14 days Cycle 4 3F8 (iv) + GM-CSF (sc) (1 wk) 2-4-wk interval - oral
      isotretinoin x14 days Cycle 5 3F8 (iv) + GM-CSF (sc) (1 wk) 6-8-wk interval - oral
      isotretinoin x14 days Cycle 6 3F8 (iv) + GM-CSF (sc) (1 wk) 6-8-wk interval - oral
      isotretinoin x14 days on, 14 days off, 14 days on (6th cycle) Cycle 7 3F8 (iv) + GM-CSF (sc)
      (1 wk) 6-8-wk interval Continue with 6-8-wk intervals through 24 months from 1st dose of 3F8.
