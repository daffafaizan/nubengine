      linked to recurrent ankle pain, swelling, and even early degenerative change if not properly
      treated. Lateral ligament reconstruction using modified Broström-Gould procedure is the
      mainstream in treatment of CAI. Early mobilization is related to better functional outcome,
      and rapid healing of the repair is the key point to shorten the immobilization time.
      Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is a fraction of plasma that contains platelets and multiple
      growth factors concentrated at high level. Because activated platelets have the potential to
      release growth factors, PRP has been clinically used to accelerate wound healing and tissue
      regeneration. However, there is no conclusion regarding the efficacy of PRP on CAI. This
      clinical trial will investigate the effect of PRP on CAI. Eligible patients will be randomly
      assigned to receive PRP or whole blood during the modified Broström-Gould procedure. The
      postoperative imaging and clinical outcomes will be compared and analyzed.
