      more of intubation, is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Rapid identification of
      VAP is required to improve survival and to reduce avoidable treatment-associated side
      effects. Procalcitonin (ProCT), a blood test, is a reasonably specific marker of bacterial
      infection and its level increases early in sepsis. In this study, a ProCT serum level will be
      measured in 50 patients with clinically suspected VAP. We aim to show that the ProCT level
      will be high early in VAP and will stay high in patients with poor prognosis. This will help
      to address the potential role of ProCT as part of early diagnosis and management of VAP.
