      the treatment of aspirin-related ulcers.

      Patients with aspirin-related peptic ulcers are randomized to receive esomeprazole (40
      mg/day) plus aspirin (100 mg/day) or esomeprazole (40 mg/day) alone for 8 weeks. Follow-up
      endoscopy was carried out at the end of the eighth week. The primary end point was the
      healing of peptic ulcers.
