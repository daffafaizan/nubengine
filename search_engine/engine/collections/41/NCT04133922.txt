      microvascular insulin responses in both skeletal and cardiac muscle microvasculature in
      humans with T1DM. The investigators will study 20 participants with T1DM using a
      state-of-the-art technology, contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEU), to assess whether GLP-1
      augments skeletal and cardiac microvascular blood flow (MBF) as a representation of
      microvascular perfusion, flow-mediated dilation (FMD) as a measurement of endothelial
      function, and augmentation index (AI) and pulse wave velocity (PWV) as surrogates for large
      vessel compliance. The investigators will use the combined CEU and
      euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp approach to determine if microvascular and metabolic IR
      improves as a result.
