      the foot and ankle. The advent of 3D imaging under load (Scanner Cone Beam), less radiant and
      more precise, requires the development and evaluation of new measurement tools.

      The automated TALAS measurement tool, working with the Cone Beam 3D scanner under load,
      provides a reproducible measurement of the Foot Ankle Offset (FAO). It is possible to
      determine an average value and the standard deviation of FAO in the relevant population. And
      to differentiate significantly the populations with a neutral alignment, varus or valgus.
