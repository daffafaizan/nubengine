      Stroke Management Group, Stroke Monitoring Group or Stroke Supplementary Group. All three
      groups will receive usual care, in addition to the intervention. The Stroke Management Group
      will be provided with periodic information about their progress in the area of mobility using
      specialized activity monitors. The Stroke Monitoring Group will be progressed according to
      customized protocols using feedback from specialized activity monitors. The Stroke
      Supplementary Group will receive the same as the Stroke Monitoring Group, but will also
      receive one additional hour of daily (5 times per week) physical exercise
