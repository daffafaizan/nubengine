    
      This study consists of 2 parts. In first part, healthy adult participants will receive a
      single nasal dose of JNJ-43260295 or placebo in a double blind (both the participant and
      investigator do not know whether participant is assigned to receive study medication or
      placebo), randomized (study medication or placebo assigned to participants by chance), and
      placebo-controlled (study in which the experimental treatment or procedure is compared to a
      placebo) setting. In second part, which will be open label (participants and investigators
      are aware about the treatment, participants are receiving), atopic participants with mild to
      mild-persistent asthma will participate in 3 consecutive treatment periods (Period 1, 2, and
      3). In Period 1, each participant will receive a single nasal dose of JNJ-43260295 without
      prior nasal allergen challenge. In Period 2, each participant will receive a single nasal
      dose of JNJ-43260295, preceded by a nasal allergen challenge approximately 15 hours prior to
      the JNJ-43260295 dosing. In Period 3, each participant will receive single nasal allergen
      challenge without JNJ-43260295. There will be a washout period of at least 21 days between 3
      consecutive treatment periods. Cytokine levels in nasal lavage and gene expression in nasal
      scraping will be primarily evaluated during all treatment periods. Participants' safety will
      be monitored throughout the study.
