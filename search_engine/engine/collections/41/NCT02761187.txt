    
      This is a prospective, non-interventional, observational study. This study will look at
      contemporary, real-world patterns of patient characteristics, clinical disease presentation,
      therapeutic regimen chosen, and clinical outcomes in participants with MM. Participants will
      not be asked to change their routine clinical treatment. Participants will have to complete
      patient reported outcomes (PROs) surveys during on-site routine office visits.

      The study will enroll approximately 4200 participants. Participants will be assigned to one
      of the following cohorts based upon the diagnosis of MM:

        -  ND MM within 3 months from initiation of treatment

        -  R/R MM who have received 1 to 3 prior lines of therapy

      This multi-center trial will be conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this
      study is up to 8 years. Participants will be evaluated and followed-up for a period of at
      least 5 years, until death, are lost to follow-up, or the end of the study, whichever comes
      first.
