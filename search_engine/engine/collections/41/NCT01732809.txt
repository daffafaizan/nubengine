      recruited from a research center in Porto Alegre, Brazil, and provided written informed
      consent. The purpose of this study is to assess the fields of anhydrotic effect (FAE) of
      abobotulinumtoxinA and onabotulinumtoxinA at the same labeled unit dose (1:1 units),
      comparing both sweat gland and muscle activities. Nineteen patients were enrolled and
      evaluations were performed at baseline and 28 days after treatment.
