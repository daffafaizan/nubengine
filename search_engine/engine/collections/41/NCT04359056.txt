      with an observational period and will be followed by an experimental intervention period.
      Sixty-nine adult patients in each period will be included. During the observational phase, no
      clinical pharmacy activities will be performed. During the interventional phase, clinical
      pharmacists will be active during the entire patients' care pathways.
