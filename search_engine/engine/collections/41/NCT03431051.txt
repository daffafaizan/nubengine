      comparison to individuals identically assessed but not exposed to a HBI. Specifically, do
      those exposed to the HBI decrease in measures of adiposity, BMI, and sugar sweetened beverage
      (SSB) intake? Do they decrease more in those measures as compared to those not exposed to the
      HBI?
