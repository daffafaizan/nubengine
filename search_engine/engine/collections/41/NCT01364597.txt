    
      This is a Phase 3, open-label, single-arm, multicenter, long-term study to evaluate the
      safety and efficacy of brivaracetam (BRV) in children with epilepsy.

      This study was initially designed for pediatric subjects who had completed a previous BRV
      study.

      With protocol amendment 4, enrollment for "directly enrolled" subjects was modified from 'up
      to' an additional 100 subjects to "at least" 100 subjects, keeping the planned total
      enrollment of approximately 600 subjects to allow flexibility in the number of patients
      reaching 1 year of exposure.

      With protocol amendment 5, entry criteria for subjects coming for other pediatric core
      studies in development were included. Additional clarity was provided for subjects enrolled
      in N01266 that temporary roll over to one of those studies and resume participation in
      N01266.

      With protocol amendment 6, central EEG reading and entry visit EEG were removed. Some
      clarifications on study assessments (questionnaires, EEGs) was provided and inclusion
      criteria were aligned from an earlier local amendment.

      With protocol amendment 7, the pregnancy section was updated to clarify that Pregnancy Report
      and Outcome Form has to be completed in all pregnancies.

      With protocol amendment 8, re-categorization of study variables in compliance with reporting
      registries was performed. Modifications due to COVID19 pandemic were implemented and
      clarification provided that participants may transition to another BRV study.

      The primary objective is to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of BRV. The
      secondary objective is to assess the efficacy of BRV during long-term exposure.
