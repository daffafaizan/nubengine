      application to deliver content of the intervention. A licensed therapist (Meru Health
      employed) provides support to participants as needed and reviews practice logs within the
      app.The 8-week program teaches cognitive behavioral techniques and mindfulness skills with
      the aim of improving the user's mental health. The platform provides informational videos,
      skills practices, group discussion, and messaging with the therapist. The Meru Health program
      enrolls participants in treatment groups that work through the program at the same time and
      can provide support to on another on the discussion board within the app.

      We are conducting two studies in middle aged and older adults with elevated depressive
      symptoms to evaluate the Meru Health Ascend program. In the first study (study 1), we will
      examine the feasibility of the intervention in individuals aged 40 years or older with
      elevated depression symptoms using an iterative case series. Specifically, we will examine
      the usability of app and materials, dropout and reasons for dropout, and user perceptions of
      the program.

      We will then conduct a proof-of-concept study (study 2) using a nonrandomized pre-post design
      to examine whether individuals achieve clinically significant reductions in depressive
      symptoms.
