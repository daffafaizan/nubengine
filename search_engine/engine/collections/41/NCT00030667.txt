      I. Determine the response rate of patients with relapsed or refractory pediatric solid tumors
      treated with imatinib mesylate.

      II. Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients. III. Determine the time to
      progression in patients treated with this drug. IV. Determine the pharmacokinetics of this
      drug in these patients. V. Correlate response with c-kit and platelet-derived growth factor
      receptor expression in patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to disease (Ewing's
      sarcoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumor vs osteosarcoma vs neuroblastoma vs other).

      Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate once or twice daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat
      every 28 days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.
