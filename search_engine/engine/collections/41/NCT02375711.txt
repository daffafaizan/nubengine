      Hepatitis C Virus and HIV 1%) and dialysis patients are a population at risk. Vaccination
      against this virus, which is very effective in the general population (vaccine response: 90
      to 95%), is highly recommended in dialysis patients. However, numerous studies have shown
      that HBV vaccination was less effective in patients with chronic renal disease than in the
      general population. The reasons for low vaccine response are poorly understood. However,
      recent data suggest that renal failure could induce accelerated immunosenescence.

      The aging of the immune system, or immunosenescence, is a complex and profound phenomenon of
      the immune system during life. The gradual reduction of the generation of naive T cells in
      the thymus is the major cause of immunosenescence. But this process is also associated with
      an accumulation of lymphocytes at the end of differentiation.

      In this context, the decrease in vaccine response and increased infections in renal
      insufficiency might be correlated, as in the elderly population, with the aging of the immune
      system. The aim of this study is to investigate the role of immunosenescence in the HBV
      vaccination response in patients with renal insufficiency.

      Vaccination against HBV is not performed for the purposes of the study, but due to the
      existing vaccine indication for the subject. Included patients receive vaccination as routine
      care according to the recommendations and the vaccination schedule recommended by the Health
      Authority.
