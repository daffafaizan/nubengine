      ultraviolet wavelength to photoablate corneal tissue in order to achieve a refractive change.
      It is planned to enroll and treat up to 334 participant eyes, with an expectation that 300
      study eyes will complete post-surgical follow-up for 6 months or until the point of achieved
      refractive stability. When a cohort of at least 300 eyes has achieved refractive stability at
      6 months post-surgery, all other treated eyes that have not reached the 6-month examination
      may be discontinued at the Sponsor's request. Or, if 300 eyes achieve refractive stability at
      9 months post-surgery, all other treated eyes that have not reached the 9-month examination
      may be discontinued
