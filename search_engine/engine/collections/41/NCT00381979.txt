      has been well utilized with adult clients. To date, there is no known systematic study into
      the benefit of this method of therapy with adolescents who are depressed and/or anxious. It
      is thought that SET would be useful for this population as it is similar in principle to
      Interpersonal Relationship Therapy (IPT), which has been shown to be effective for use with
      depressed adults and youth. Both IPT and SET help clients explore the role they play within
      challenging relationships in their lives. SET, however, allows for the exploration of more
      relationships within the adolescents' circle. Moreover, SET explores the adolescents'
      perceptions of themselves, others, and their wish in relationships. Further, the SET method
      is more easily individualized in that it affords greater flexibility in design and
      possibility for change over time. Accordingly, the purpose of this study is to explore the
      feasibility of utilizing this method of therapy with adolescents who are depressed and
      anxious. We will be exploring the effectiveness of SET through the resolution of depressed
      and/or anxious adolescents' conflictual relationships thereby reducing their symptomatology.
