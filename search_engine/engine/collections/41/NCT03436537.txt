      to assess aesthetic conditions perceived by patients with periodontal problems.

      Methods: With patient interviews were identified a total of 22 statements that describe the
      non-aesthetic gingival appearance. These 22 items were reviewed by the dentists and then
      Periodontologists and the number of items in the survey was reduced to 7. Subsequently, three
      groups of patients were included in the study: Gingival recession (GR) group, gingival
      enlargement (GE) group and periodontal healthy (H) group. Consequently, the validity and
      reliability of the periodontal aesthetic perception scale (PAPS) were examined.

      Results: According to the results of the Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA), 1 item was
      removed from the scale. The final 6-item questionnaire was shown to have a two-domain
      structure. Cronbach's alpha for the whole scale was .766. The interclass correlation
      coefficients (ICCs) values were between 0.98 and 1.00, demonstrating excellent agreement.
      Overall, these findings indicated that the PAPS has good reliability.

      Conclusion: This reliable, valid and short questionnaire specific to aesthetic conditions
      perceived by patients with periodontal problems may serve as a valued instrument in future
      clinical trials.
