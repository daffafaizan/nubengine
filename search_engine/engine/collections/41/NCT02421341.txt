      visits.

      During study visit 1 you will be asked to get a blood draw, DEXA bone scan, perform pulmonary
      function tests, and exercise on a stationary bike at maximal exertion while breathing into a
      mouth piece.

      During study visits 2 and 3 you will be asked to again exercise at maximal exertion while
      breathing into a mouth piece. However, during these two visits you will be receiving an
      intrathecal injection of fentanyl one day and placebo the other day, randomly selected and
      you will be blinded as to which you are receiving. A catheter will also be placed in an
      artery in your arm and a vein in your leg, which will help us to measure blood flow, blood
      pressure and draw blood when need be. The investigators will also ask you to perform a brief
      chemosensitivity test, breathing in and out your own air, after you are done exercising.
