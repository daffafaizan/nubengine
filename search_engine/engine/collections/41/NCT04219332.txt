      imaging technology in laparoscopic equipment, scholars have found that ICG near-infrared
      imaging has better tissue penetration and can better identify lymph nodes in hypertrophic
      adipose tissue than other dyes under visible light, which makes ICG fluorescence imaging
      guide laparoscopic radical resection of gastric cancer lymph node dissection has become a new
      exploration direction. ICG near-infrared imaging technology has important research value,
      good application prospects, and broad development space in laparoscopic radical resection of
      gastric cancer. However, at present, the application of ICG near-infrared imaging technology
      in laparoscopic radical resection of gastric cancer is still in the exploratory stage, and
      there is no unified standard. Therefore, in the world, there is still a lack of high-level
      evidence-based evidence of large-sample prospective randomized controlled trials to evaluate
      the effectiveness, safety, and feasibility of submucosal or subserous injection of ICG in
      guiding laparoscopic D2 resection of gastric cancer. The investigator first carried out this
      study in the world to evaluate the lymph node dissection and perioperative safety of gastric
      cancer patients who received a submucosal injection of ICG and subserous injection of ICG
      during laparoscopic radical gastrectomy in the same period, to promote the standardized
      development of ICG near-infrared imaging in laparoscopic radical gastrectomy.
