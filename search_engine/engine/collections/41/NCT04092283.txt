      I. To evaluate whether there is an improvement in overall survival with concomitant
      chemotherapy/radiation therapy/MEDI4736 (durvalumab) followed by one year (12 cycles) of
      MEDI4736 (durvalumab) as compared to concomitant chemotherapy/radiation followed by one year
      (12 cycles) of MEDI4736 (durvalumab).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the difference in response using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
      (RECIST) 1.1 criteria to assess whether or not MEDI4736 (durvalumab) added to concomitant
      chemo/radiation results in an improvement in response rates.

      II. To evaluate any difference in progression free survival (PFS) with concomitant
      chemotherapy/radiation therapy/MEDI4736 (durvalumab) followed by one year (12 cycles) of
      MEDI4736 (durvalumab) as compared to concomitant chemotherapy/radiotherapy followed by one
      year of MEDI4736 (durvalumab).

      III. To evaluate whether the incidence of recurrence and recurrence pattern is affected by
      giving MEDI4736 (durvalumab) during chemo/radiation.

      IV. To evaluate any difference in toxicity when MEDI4736 (durvalumab) is added to concomitant
      chemo/radiation using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE).

      OUTLINE:

      STEP 1 (CONCURRENT THERAPY): Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive durvalumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on days 1 and 15 of
      cycle 1 and day 1 of cycle 2. Patients also receive 1 of 3 treatment regimens per
      investigator choice: 1) etoposide IV over 60 minutes on days 1-5 and cisplatin IV over 60
      minutes on days 1 and 8 every 28 days for 2 cycles; 2) pemetrexed disodium IV over 60 minutes
      and cisplatin IV over 60-120 minutes on day 1 every 21 days for 2 cycles; or 3) paclitaxel IV
      over 60 minutes and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1 every 7 days for 6 cycles.
      Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning
      on day 1 of chemotherapy, patients receive radiation therapy 5 days a week for 6 weeks.

      ARM B: Patients receive 1 of 3 investigator's choice treatment regimens and radiation therapy
      as in Arm A.

      STEP 2 (CONSOLIDATION THERAPY): Within 14 days after the last dose of radiation (from Step
      1), all patients then receive durvalumab IV over 60 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every
      28 days for 12 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months if less than 2
      years from study entry, every 6 months if 2-5 years from study entry, and then yearly for
      years 5-10 from study entry.
