      alveolar block injections (shots) consisting of; 1.) an injection of 1.8 mL of 3% mepivacaine
      followed by 1.8 mL of 2% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine, and 2.) an injection of 1.8 mL
      of 2% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine followed by 1.8 mL of 2% lidocaine with 1:100,000
      epinephrine, at two separate appointments spaced at least two weeks apart, in a crossover
      design. Whether the subject receives the mepivacaine or the lidocaine for the first injection
      will be determined randomly. The doctor will not know whether the subject receives
      mepivacaine or lidocaine for the first injection. The subject will not know which anesthetics
      he/she receives. A pulp tester will be used to test the lower jaw teeth (molars, premolars,
      and incisors) for anesthesia (numbness) in 4-minute time cycles for 60 minutes. The data will
      be statistically analyzed.
