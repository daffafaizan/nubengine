      common more cause of surgical failure of retina detachment.

      Despite the use of internal tamponades, the treatment of retinal detachments due to a
      progressed proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) is still a problem. At present, conventional
      silicone oil, having a lower specific gravity than water, is an excellent tool in advanced
      PVR retinal detachment especially of the upper circumference.

      In the past, to diminish the re-detachments diverse heavier-than-water density endotamponades
      were investigated by to use in in cases of inferior PVR. However,heavier-than-water density
      endotamponades have demonstrated adverse short term effects. (Example: silicon dispersion:
      hypotension and inflammation)

      Recently, two new long-term heavier-than-water internal tamponades were introduced: Oxane HD
      [oil-RMN3-mixture] and Densiron [mixture of 30.5 vol% perfluorohexyloctane (F6H8) with 69.5
      vol% polydimethylsiloxane (silicone oil)], showing satisfying anatomical results and good
      intraocular tolerance.

      In the present study, we will compare the anatomical outcome, functional results and
      intraocular adverse effects of two types of heavier tamponades.
