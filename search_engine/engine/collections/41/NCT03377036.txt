      synthesized 2D mammograms leads to a relevant increase in the detection rate of
      screening-detected invasive cancers compared to 2D full-field digital mammography in routine
      screening according to the European Guidelines. Furthermore, the incidence rate of interval
      cancers within a 24 months interval after screening will be compared between both study arms
      in order to investigate the potential for overdiagnosis.

      According to the pre-defined order of both primary endpoints and the primary objective of the
      study in the planning phase, the initial sample size calculation was based solely on the
      first primary endpoint (invasive breast cancer detection rate). Given the increasing national
      and international attention of interval cancers to assess the impact of potential
      overdiagnosis caused by tomosynthesis, we have planned a sample size increase from 80,000 to
      120,000 study participants to achieve a reasonable statistical power for the evaluation of
      both primary endpoints. The revised sample size calculation was carried out without knowledge
      of the data from the currently recruiting TOSYMA study, i.e. all planning assumptions were
      based on external data that do not belong to the ongoing study.
