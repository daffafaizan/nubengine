    
      This is a randomized open-label clinical study to test the efficacy of the treatment protocol
      using an optimized EDThi & EDTlo sequential approach in infected or high risk of infection
      burn/trauma/surgery chronic wounds against biofilm infection. This trial will determine the
      efficacy of EDT dressing against wound biofilm infection. subjects will be randomized to one
      of the two groups: 1) standard of care (SoC) only and 2) SoC + EDT dressing treatment. In
      group 2, in addition to SoC, the patients will apply the EDThi dressing (PED-10) on the
      wound(s) for the first 3 weeks following enrollment followed by ProcelleraÂ® for additional 3
      weeks. The use of dressings will be discontinued anytime if complete wound closure is
      achieved.
