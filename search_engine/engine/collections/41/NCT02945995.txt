      malformation has intraarticular damage to labrum and chondral structures.

      In DK, if the patients has persistent pain in the hip joint after PAO, they have been offered
      a hip arthroscopy, however we do not if their hip functions and pain improved by the surgery

      The investigator aimed to make a short to middle-term followup study to see if the patients
      had benefits of the surgery.
