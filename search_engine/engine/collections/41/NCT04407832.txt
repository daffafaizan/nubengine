      mortality. Endoscopic therapy significantly reduces further bleeding, surgery, and mortality
      in patients receiving intravenous Proton Pump Inhibitor (PPIï¼‰and is now recommended as the
      first hemostatic modality for these patients. In the past few years, adjuvant use of a
      high-dose proton pump inhibitor (PPI) after endoscopic therapy has been endorsed in some
      studies, including two consensus statements and two meta-analysis. To sustain a high
      intragastric pH, a high dose of omeprazole has been used in previous studies concerning
      high-risk peptic ulcer bleeding. However, in one recent published metaanalysis found that low
      dose PPI may be as effective as high dose PPI in preventing further bleeding in high-risk
      patients. Therefore, one double blind study is needed clarify this puzzle.

      We used two different doses of esomeprazole (40 mg IV q.d. and 40 mg IV q6h for three days
      followed by esomeprazole 40 mg q.d. orally in two groups) after successful endoscopic therapy
      with heat probe therapy or hemoclip placement.

      The goal of this study is to assess the outcomes of two different regimens of low vs. high
      dose of intravenous esomeprazole after endoscopic therapy in patients with peptic ulcer
      bleeding.
