      enabled model of care for improved hypertension and elevated blood pressure control using a
      home blood pressure monitor (HBPM), a blood pressure (BP) self-management web portal, and a
      trained patient navigator. During the first or the control period, all of the participants
      will have access to the only the HBPM. The control period will be compared to the final or
      the intervention period when the participants will gain access to a trained patient navigator
      and the web portal. This comparison will assist in estimating the effect sizes of the HBPM
      plus PN plus self-management web portal to HBPM alone for each of the outcomes: patient
      activation, self-management activities, medication adherence, reduced clinical inertia, and
      improved BP control. The second of the randomization periods will allocate a patient
      navigator to half of the participants, while the other half will gain access to only the web
      portal. We will compare the effectiveness of the PN plus webportal plus HBPM to webportal
      plus HBPM during this second period. An evaluation of the intervention process will delineate
      the barriers and facilitators by the providers, participants, and patient navigators.
