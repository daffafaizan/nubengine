      a hypotension in 40% to 90% despite preventing tools (fluid challenge and vasoactives drugs).
      Hypotension is responsible of foetale and maternal suffering. Fluid challenge is able to
      upgrade cardiac output for some patient, for some other it is unusefull or it can deteriorate
      it. Actually fluid challenge is not individualized. It would be interesting to have a tool
      that could detect patient who are at risk to have hypotension.

      Trans thoraciq echography is an easy non invading tool. Dynamic criteria which is recognized
      for predicting vascular filling , with spontaneus breathing, is the passive leg rising (PLR).
      PLR mime à vascular filling of 500 ml. Modification of this cardiac outpout is measured whith
      the echocardiograph. This consist in measuring variations of under aortic velocity peak
      (ΔITVAo) which estimate the modification of the cardiac output.
