      patient anatomy during surgery. This better adjusts for anatomical deformation and tissue
      excision compared to using preoperative images alone.

      Twenty patients scheduled for chest wall resection will be enrolled over the study duration
      of 2 years. Patients will undergo imaging and surgery in the GTx-OR at Toronto General
      Hospital, as part of the GTx Program of the TECHNA Institute. All patients will be asked to
      consent to receiving their care in a research environment. They will also be asked to consent
      to having the intraoperative image acquired and used to generate a navigation view in the
      GTx-OR. Instead of resecting the chest wall lesion according to the preoperative images alone
      with intraoperative findings as per standard-care procedures, the navigation view will be
      used as an additional reference for surgeons during the operation.
