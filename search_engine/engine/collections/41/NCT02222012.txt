      and unique properties. Currently standard TMS devices include a single channel, and can
      operate only a single coil. The "Multiway stimulator coil速" (Brainsway Ltd.) includes two
      channels which can operate two independent TMS coils, either simultaneously or sequentially.

      The "Multiway stimulator coil速" (Brainsway Ltd.) may be used to obtain a differential
      activation of various brain regions. For instance it can be used to induce high frequency
      stimulation of a certain brain region, thus inducing facilitation, while simultaneously
      stimulate at low frequency in another brain region, leading to inhibition.

      In the current study the investigators propose a multi-source pattern which integrates
      neuroimaging data associated with multiple, symptom-related neural processes relevant in
      depression to improve classification accuracy. The investigators conclude that combining
      brain activation related to the core-symptoms of depression using the multi-source monitoring
      data substantially increases classification accuracy while providing a sparse relational
      neuromarkers-model for future prediction.

      The purpose of the study is to to monitor and optimize the anti depressive effect of brain
      modulation technique using novel multi model monitoring approach.

      Subjects will be treated with one of two designs of the study device (the "Multiway Coil速"):

        1. Single Channel with a coil placed over the left PFC (10 Hz).

        2. Two channels: a. 10 Hz over the left PFC. b. 1 Hz over the right PFC.

      All subjects in the current study will undergo monitoring procedure inclusive of functional
      MRI and electroencephalogram.
