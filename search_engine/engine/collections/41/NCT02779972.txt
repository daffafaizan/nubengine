      with age. The cardiovascular system undergoes several age-related changes. For most healthy
      older individuals, the heart generally functions well under resting conditions. Structural
      and physiological changes tend to result in diminished exercise tolerance. However,
      increasingly it has been shown that even some of these changes are more a result of a
      sedentary lifestyle than an age-related phenomenon. Most elderly people tend to become less
      physically active. It is difficult to separate changes intrinsic to the aging process from
      those arising as a result of a sedentary lifestyle. Studies of aging and physical activity
      usually compare older athletes with sedentary ones, in which physical activity was not found
      to attenuate the impact on the aging heart. Thus, the investigators set of to find the
      difference between hearts of elderly who are physically fit as measured with METS to those
      who are not. And try and understand the basis of this difference.
