    
      The purpose of this Chinese bridging study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability
      and pharmacokinetics (PK) of asciminib versus best available therapy (BAT) in Chinese
      patients with Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia in chronic phase (CML-CP), previously treated with
      2 or more tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) to support related indication registration in
      China.

      This study will enroll the participants 1) who failed their most recent TKI therapy by
      meeting the definition of treatment failure as per the 2013 European Leukemia Net (ELN)
      guidelines, or 2) who were intolerant to the most recent TKI therapy and must have BCR-ABL1
      ratio > 0.1% IS at screening.

      Eligible participants will be randomized into asciminib arm or the BAT arm on a 2:1 ratio, to
      receive asciminib treatment (continuous 40 mg BID) or BAT from Day 1 until the end of study
      treatment period defined as 96 weeks after the last participant receives the first dose.
