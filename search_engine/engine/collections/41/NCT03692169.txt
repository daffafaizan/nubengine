      studies have reported choriocapillary damage and choroidal vascular remodeling after PDT.
      More recently, although OCTA related CSC research has been conducted, no quantitative report
      has thoroughly investigated the microstructural changes in the superficial, deep retinal and
      choroidal capillaries after hd-PDT. The purpose of the present study is to determine the
      changes in the retinal and choroidal capillaries quantitatively with OCTA after hd-PDT in
      eyes with CSC.

      This is a prospective observational study of patients undergoing hd-PDT for CSC with active
      leakage in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and followed for 3 months. Fundus fluorescein
      angiography (FFA) and indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) were performed at baseline; best
      corrected visual acuity (BCVA), fundus photography, optical coherence tomography angiography
      (OCTA) with the split-spectrum amplitude-decorrelation angiography algorithm (XR Optovue,
      Fremont, CA, USA) and spectral domain OCT (SD-OCT) were performed at baseline and each
      follow-up visit after hd-PDT.
