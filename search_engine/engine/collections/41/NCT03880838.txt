      but analysis of outcomes will include individual-level analysis. This analytic decision was
      made because the researchers assume that the intervention may potentially affect other
      members of the household. While one person in a household will be selected for matching the
      eligibility criteria, the mailed materials will be addressed to all adult members of the
      household (defined as adults 18+ who are the spouse or child of the selected member) who are
      members of the Geisinger Health Plan. Outcome data will be pulled from all adult members of
      the household who have data through the Geisinger Health Plan.

      The researchers will analyze the data using standard survey research analyses methods,
      including computing bivariate correlations, using general linear models, using non-parametric
      models for non-normally distributed insurance data, and entering variables as independent
      predictors in regression models to attempt to predict desired outcomes. The researchers will
      also use multilevel models to account for household- and individual-level data. The analysis
      of primary outcomes will focus on data one year after the intervention begins. Follow-up
      analysis on secondary outcomes will be conducted two years after the intervention begins. The
      researchers will conduct separate analyses of the selected participant (i.e., the individual
      who met the eligibility criteria) and other members of that participant's household. This
      will test whether there are any spillover effects of the intervention to other people in the
      household.

      For clarity in this record, any discussion of sample size and participants refers to
      households, as this is the primary level for participant selection and assignment.
