      functional reserve and limit the ability to respond to external factors.

      Likewise, aging is associated with a deterioration of the regulatory processes that maintain
      the functional integration of the different organs and systems. A direct consequence of this
      phenomenon is the atypical presentation of highly prevalent diseases in the elderly. This
      atypical presentation of diseases in the elderly is responsible for the so-called geriatric
      syndromes, considered as specific nosological entities with a high frequency of presentation
      in the elderly, being included within the prevention, diagnosis and treatment strategies of
      geriatric medicine.

      These syndromes can generate greater morbidity and consequences, sometimes more serious than
      the disease that produces them. Its systematic detection should be included in the anamnesis
      of the clinical history of the elderly. Geriatric syndromes are a group of conditions usually
      caused by the conjunction of diseases with a high prevalence in the elderly and which are the
      frequent origin of functional or social disability in the population. They are the
      manifestation of many diseases, but they are also the beginning of many other problems that
      we must take into account from their detection to establish a good prevention of them.

      The hypothesis of this work is that in frail and pre-frail older adults who participate in an
      integrated program of multicomponent physical exercise tutored by means of an app will
      improve their functional situation and reverse their diagnoses of pre and frailty.
