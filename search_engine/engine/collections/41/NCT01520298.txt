      either IV acetaminophen 1000 mg q6 hours (FDA recommended dose) or IV placebo. While
      receiving the study drug/placebo the subject's blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate,
      & pain intensity will be monitored. Additional pain meds will be given if needed. Study
      treatment will continue until subject is taken into the operating room; at that time the
      intervention will be discontinued and other pain medication will be provided. Participation
      in the study will end at time of discharge from the hospital. Researchers are expecting a 33%
      decrease in opioid use for subjects randomized to treatment group.
