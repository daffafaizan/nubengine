      anesthesia with nasotracheal intubation to widen the surgical field and to ease undergoing
      surgery. However, a nasotracheal tube blindly passing through the nasal cavity may easily
      result in nasal cavity and oropharynx damages. In addition, the advancement of the tube from
      oropharynx into trachea may assist by either using magic forceps or cuff inflation technique.

      The aim of the study is to investigate either use a bougie or nasogastric tube to assist the
      nasotracheal tube passing the nasal cavity, nasopharynx, oropharynx, and advanced into the
      trachea.

      Patients were randomized into three groups by using either bougie or nasogastric tube to
      facilitate nasotracheal tube sliding through into trachea from assigned nostril and compared
      with the control group with a conventional technique.

      Hemodynamic changes in each time interval, each time taken of tube going through the nasal
      cavity, tube advanced from oropharynx into trachea were recorded. The incidence of using
      Magill Forceps to accurately place tube tip into trachea, intubation related side effects and
      complications were recorded at postoperative time stages.
