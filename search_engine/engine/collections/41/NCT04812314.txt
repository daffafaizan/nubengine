      is shocking how little is known about how exercise works to improve health. Expanding the
      knowledge about novel exercise-induced adaptations in fat tissue of obese individuals and
      furthering the understanding about mechanisms underlying these adaptations could lead to
      innovative approaches for preventing and treating insulin resistance and obesity-related
      diseases.

      Overall, the researchers believe that exercise training modifies key processes in
      subcutaneous fat tissue that may contribute to an increase body fat storage capacity (without
      increasing fat mass). The research team anticipates that exercise will evoke an even more
      potent adaptive response when fat tissue is dynamically changing in response to alterations
      in nutritional status (i.e., weight loss and weight regain).

      Participants will be randomized into one of two different experimental groups: 1) Exercise
      group and 2) No exercise (control group). Subject participation in the study will involve a
      series of metabolic tests before and after participants undergo a 10% weight loss program
      (with or without exercise training depending on group randomization). After completing this
      weight loss portion of the study, participants will then be required to adhere to a high
      calorie diet program to regain half of the weight the participant lost - followed by the same
      series of metabolic tests. After the participant completes the study, the study team will
      help the participant to lose more weight. Total involvement in the study for each participant
      will likely be about 8-10 months.
