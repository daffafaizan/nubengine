      transplantation is becoming an important treatment for hematological diseases and the
      long-term survival of patients is gradually improved. However, thrombocytopenia after
      transplantation has always been an important complication. Studies have shown that about 20%
      patients had different degrees of thrombocytopenia. Eltrombopag could promote hematopoietic
      stem cell proliferation and differentiation in vitro studies. It has also been widely used in
      the treatment of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) and aplastic anemia(AA) and increased platelet
      levels in such diseases. Eltrombopag is also used to treat poor platelet engraftment after
      transplantation and the effective rate is about 60%-80%. Therefore, the application of
      Eltrombopag at early time after transplantation might promote platelet engraftment and reduce
      platelet transfusions.
