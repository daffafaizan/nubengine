    
      -  Patients will be clinically and radiographically examined and their eligibility will be
           assessed and preoperative pain will be measured using Heft-Parker VAS. Eligible patients
           will be treated in one visit.

        -  Patients will be randomly assigned to one of 2 groups: experimental group (taking a 100
           mg of Aceclofenac) and the control group (taking a placebo tablet). Each tablet will be
           taken one hour before the initiation of single-visit endodontic therapy. Each
           participant will receive a standard inferior alveolar nerve block injection of 1.8 ml of
           2% mepivacaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine. After endodontic treatment, patients will be
           given postoperative instructions and informed, in case of pain, to receive ibuprofen 200
           mg as rescue medication.

        -  Postendodontic pain intensity and incidence at the different pain categories (No, mild,
           moderate, severe) will be assessed 6, 24, and 48 hours postoperatively using Heft-Parker
           visual analogue scale (HP-VAS). Postoperative pain at injection area will be assessed at
           6,24 and 48 hours using HP-VAS. Analgesic intake throughout the 48 hours will be
           recorded.
