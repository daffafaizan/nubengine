      program with Upper Body Strength Training. After gaining ethical approval and baseline
      bowling speeds recorded, thirty under 19 club level fast bowlers will be assigned to two
      groups to complete either an upper-body plyometric or strength training program. Each group
      will participate in three (3) supervised exercise intervention sessions per week. Each
      65-minute session will consist of a warm-up and cool-down program in addition to specific and
      routinely progressed upper body exercises as per each group's protocol. At the end of the
      intervention period, their bowling speeds will again be measured using a Stalker Sport 2
      radar gun.
