        -  Determine the clinical effect of monoclonal antibody ABX-EGF, determined by the PSA
           response, in patients with hormone-resistant prostate cancer with rising PSA values
           without metastasis.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics and safety profile (including immunogenicity) of this
           drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the time to disease progression and time to PSA progression in patients
           treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive monoclonal antibody ABX-EGF IV over 1 hour once weekly. Treatment continues
      every 8 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 30-50 patients will be accrued for this study.
