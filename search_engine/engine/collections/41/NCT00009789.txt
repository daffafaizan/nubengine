        -  Determine the maximum tolerated course of accelerated 3-dimensional conformal
           radiotherapy in patients with stage I non-small cell lung cancer with pulmonary
           dysfunction.

        -  Determine the short-term and long-term toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine local tumor control, failure-free survival, and overall survival in patients
           treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the effect of radiotherapy dose volume relationships and pre-treatment
           pulmonary function studies on the incidence of pulmonary toxicity in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study.

      Patients receive accelerated 3-dimensional (3-D) conformal radiotherapy daily 5 days a week
      for 3.5-6 weeks.

      Cohorts of 8 patients receive escalating fractions of accelerated 3-D conformal radiotherapy
      until the maximum tolerated course is determined. The maximum tolerated course is defined as
      the course at which no more than 2 patients develop at least grade 3 dose-limiting toxicity
      and no more than 1 patient develops at least grade 4 dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 3 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, every 3 months for 2 years, and then
      every 6 months for 3 years.
