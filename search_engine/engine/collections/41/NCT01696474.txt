      lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, the disorder most frequently associated with CAD, and achieved
      40-80% responses. These striking clinical responses indicate that proteasome activity is
      critical for the survival of immunoglobulin-secreting cells. The resolution of transfusion
      requirement in two patients with refractory CAD associated with IgMk monoclonal gammopathy
      has been reported after treatment with a short course of Bortezomib. It may be interesting to
      test the efficacy of Bortezomib in a larger series of patients with refractory CAD,
      idiopathic or associated with an otherwise asymptomatic B cell clonal disorder, and to
      evaluate the duration of clinical benefit.
