    
      In Part 1 of the study (single ascending dose portion), approximately 40 subjects will be
      randomly assigned. Eight (8) subjects will be randomized in each of 5 dosage-level cohorts
      (AZD6423 or placebo). Within each cohort, 6 subjects will be randomized to receive AZD6423
      and 2 subjects will be randomized to receive placebo. Each subject will receive only one dose
      of either AZD6423 or placebo on Day 1. In Part 2 of the study (multiple ascending dose
      portion), approximately 24 subjects will be randomly assigned. Eight (8) subjects will be
      randomized in each of 3 dosage-level cohorts. Within each cohort, 6 subjects will be
      randomized to receive AZD6423 and 2 subjects will be randomized to receive placebo. Each
      subject will receive three doses of either AZD6423 or placebo.
