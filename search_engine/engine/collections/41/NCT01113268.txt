    
      The research program comprises 4 phases: a selection phase at D0-D1, a pre-inclusion and an
      inclusion phase at D4±2, a visit at M6, and a 5 year follow up phase.

      Visit at Day 0 - Day 1:

        -  The first 12-lead ECG, to be included in the observation book, is performed.

        -  The first blood sample is taken.

      Visit at Day 4±2:

        -  The first transthoracic echocardiography is performed in all patients selected.

        -  In the presence of at least 3 akinetic LV segments at the transthoracic
           echocardiography, the patient is included.

        -  Demographic data, medical and surgical anteriority, detailed circumstances of occurrence
           of the MI and any other relevant information is obtained during an interview.

        -  The second 12-lead ECG is performed.

        -  The second blood sample is taken.

        -  The first MRI is performed (optional)

      Visit at 6 months:

        -  The second transthoracic echocardiography is performed.

        -  The third 12-lead ECG is performed.

        -  The third blood sample is taken.

        -  A 24-hour Holter-ECG monitoring is performed (optional)

        -  The second MRI is performed (optional)

      Five year follow up (phone contact until 7 years after inclusion):

      Each patient included at day 4±2 will be contacted by phone 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 years post-MI to
      obtain information regarding cardiovascular events and hospitalizations. If the patient
      cannot be contacted directly, we will try to contact a member of his/her family or his/her
      family physician.
