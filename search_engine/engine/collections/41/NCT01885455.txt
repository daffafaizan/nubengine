      arm receive the current "gold standard" of treatment. The patients in the intervention arm
      are assigned to a PN, who helps to reduce the barriers to care that could negatively impact
      the patients' receipt of LDTCI. The telephone-administered survey is administered to all
      study participants at baseline and at 3-, 6-, and 12-months post-enrollment. It takes
      approximately 30-40 minutes to administer. The telephone mode of survey administration was
      chosen to reduce the number of visits that would be required by each patient. Interviews are
      scheduled at the convenience of the study participants. To further reduce burden to the study
      participants, the interviewers offer breaks during the interview process. Patients in both
      arms undergo standard therapy visits. Patients in the navigation arm receive standard therapy
      visits plus the navigation intervention. Outside of the standard therapy visits, no
      additional clinic visits are required of the study participants.

      Once informed consent has been obtained and the informed consent document is received, the
      SSC/PN will communicate to the MUSC HCC study staff the participant's contact information and
      that the participant is ready for baseline survey administration. All the study surveys will
      be administered by trained MUSC HCC study staff via telephone. A survey answer guide will be
      provided to the participant either in-person or via mail prior to administration of the
      baseline survey.
