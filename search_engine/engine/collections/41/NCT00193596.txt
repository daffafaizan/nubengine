      treatment arms:

        -  Paclitaxel + Carboplatin + Etoposide

        -  Irinotecan + Gemcitabine

      Patients will be stratified by tumor location (liver/bone versus all others) and number of
      metastatic sites (one versus two or more). Patients with an objective response or stable
      disease after completion of chemotherapy will receive ZD1839 until disease progression.
      Patients who do not respond to chemotherapy may crossover to the other chemotherapy regimen
      and will receive ZD1839 if they have an objective response or stable disease. The study is
      not blinded so both the patient and the doctor will know which treatment has been assigned.
