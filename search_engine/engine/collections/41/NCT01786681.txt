      preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative morbidly obese individuals undergoing
      Roux-en-Y gastric bypass with regard to: lung volumes and capacities, the prevalence of
      atelectasis, duration of surgery and diaphragmatic mobility.

      Individuals with BMI between 40 and 55 kg/m2, aged between 25 and 55 years, were submitted to
      Roux-en-Y type gastric bypass by laparotomy. Patients showing a normal preoperative pulmonary
      function test were included, but those with hemodynamic instability, a hospital stay longer
      than three days or the presence of postoperative complications were excluded.

      The volunteers were divided into four different groups:

      Gpre: subjects treated with positive pressure in the BiPAP mode (Bi-Level Positive Airway
      Pressure) for one hour before surgery; Gpos: individuals treated with positive airway
      pressure (BiPAP) for one hour after surgery; Gpeep: individuals treated with 10 cm H2O of
      PEEP (Positive End Expiratory Pressure) during the surgical procedure.

      Gcont: individuals treated with conventional physiotherapy (CP) according to the routine
      service of physiotherapy of the hospital, including the techniques of pulmonary re-expansion,
      breathing exercises (deep breaths or fractional), the use of incentive spirometry
      (Respiron®), bronchial hygiene resources if necessary (Flutter® and cough active or assisted)
      and assisted ambulation. It should be noted that the physiotherapist was blinded to the
      individual's participation in the groups, and all patients received conventional
      physiotherapy, independent of the group in which they were included.

      The respiratory evaluation (preoperative and second postoperative days) consisted of
      collecting the anthropometric data, a pulmonary function test and a chest radiography
      (inspired and expired).
