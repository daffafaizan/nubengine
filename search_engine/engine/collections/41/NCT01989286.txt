      becomes altered as the result of external forces applied to the malleable bones of the
      cranium and can occur pre- or postnatally. It is characterized by asymmetric occipital
      flattening (one side or the central part of the occiput is flattened)with ipsilateral frontal
      bossing.Viewed from above, this results in a parallelogram deformity of the head. We
      hypothesize that children who had plagiocephaly when they were infants, they have postural
      and spine implications at 3-5 years old.
