      diameter) in lesional and non lesional area

      . It is planned to include 45 patients (15 patients per severity group: SCORAD ]25-50] ,
      ]50-65]; 50-65; >65).The first 20 patients included will be group 2 and 3 patients (SCORAD >
      50).

      The patients will be adults with AD recruited from the cohort of patients followed up in the
      Dermatology department of Nantes University Hospital. A refusal rate of 4/5 is expected.
      Recruitment can therefore be envisaged in 18 months (2.5 patients/month). Patients will be
      recruited during follow-up consultations or at the first consultation in the department.
      Recruitment will be coordinated by the clinical research team (CRT). Blood samples will be
      taken by the CRT Nurse. The skin and blood samples will be sent to the CIMNA/ Immunology
      Laboratory Nantes University hospital
