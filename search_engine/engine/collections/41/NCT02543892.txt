      unencapsulated pneumococcal cells and adsorbed to aluminum hydroxide adjuvant (Alum). After
      adsorption of the Alum to SPWCV, the vaccine is referred to as PATH-wSP. PATH-wSP has been
      previously tested in Phase 1/2 studies in healthy US adults (VAC-002), and in healthy Kenyan
      adults and toddlers (VAC-010) and showed a favorable safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity
      profile. The SPWCV and Alum used in previous Phase 1/2 trials were supplied separately in a
      two-vial configuration; the SPWCV was manufactured at Walter Reed Army Institute of Research
      and the Alum at Instituto Butantan. A single-vial formulation of PATH wSP, an adsorbed
      suspension of SPWCV and Alum, has now been manufactured by PT Bio Farma, Indonesia. The
      purpose of this study was to assess the safety and tolerability of this new formulation.
