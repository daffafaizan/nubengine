      studies have been carried out, further defining this terminology as a method of avoiding
      misidentification injuries of the biliary system or portal vasculature when critical view of
      safety cannot be safely achieved. Recent data supports the safety of this decision, showing
      equivalent morbidity rates to total cholecystectomy in a large metanalysis of 1,231 patients.
      Importantly, only 4 of the 30 included studies were prospective in nature, allowing
      definition variability and inconsistent reporting of outcomes. Additional reports showed
      variable data regarding effect on hospital LOS, need for secondary intervention (including
      endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), percutaneous drainage bilioma, or
      completion cholecystectomy), infectious complications, biliary or major vascular injury, and
      mortality. Some studies suggest that while subtotal cholecystectomy is associated with a
      decreased rate of bile duct injury and a lower conversion to open operation, this comes at
      the cost of increasing bile leak and recurrent biliary complications. Furthermore, the
      relatively recent distinction between fenestrating and reconstituting subtypes of subtotal
      cholecystectomy remain ill-defined in many of these studies, and outcomes between the two
      modalities remain variable across the literature. There is an obvious need for a
      head-to-head, prospective comparison between these subtypes to determine the safety and
      efficacy of the chosen intervention. To determine the impact of these differing techniques
      for subtotal cholecystectomy (namely reconstituting and fenestrating subtypes) as indicated
      by Tokyo Criteria (Table 1), for the management of the difficult cholecystectomy on
      short-term and long-term patient outcomes.
