    
      Autosomal dominant hypocalcemia Type 1 is a rare familial genetic form of hypoparathyroidism.
      Autosomal Dominant Hypocalcemia (ADH) Type 1 is passed down from affected mothers or fathers
      to their children.

      This is a Phase llb open label, dose finding study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of
      CLTX-305 (encaleret) in Autosomal Dominant Hypocalcemia (ADH) Type 1 as well as the effects
      of CLTX-305 (encaleret) on blood calcium concentration.

      The estimated duration of this study is 12 months. This study plans to evaluate multiple
      doses of the investigational drug CLTX-305 (encaleret), in addition to safety and efficacy.
      CLTX-305 is administered orally.

      The study is divided into 3 Periods:

      Periods 1 and 2: Up to 8 study participants will be admitted to the NIH Clinical Center for 7
      days, where they will be administered different doses of CLTX-305 (encaleret) for up to 5
      days.

      Period 3: 24 weeks during which eligible study participants who completed Period 2 will take
      CLTX-305 (encaleret) at home

      Study participants may:

        -  Participate in Period 1

        -  Participate in Period 2

        -  Participate in both Period 1 and Period 2

        -  Participate in Period 3 after completing Period 2
