    
      This is a Phase 1 open-label dose-escalation study of rituximab + rIL-21 combination therapy,
      administered once weekly for 4 weeks following an initial treatment with one dose of
      rituximab alone to patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) who have failed prior
      therapy(ies). A standard dose of rituximab will be used. Increasing doses of rIL-21 will be
      studied sequentially in different groups of patients, starting with 30 Î¼g/kg.

      Before starting treatment with rituximab + rIL-21, patients will be treated with one dose of
      rituximab alone to look for rituximab infusion-related symptoms (such as fever, chills, and
      rigors). Patients who have severe infusion-related side effects after the first dose of
      rituximab will not go on to receive IL-21. Those who do not have unacceptable
      rituximab-related side effects will receive intravenous rIL-21 at least 60 minutes after
      completing the rituximab infusion at the rest of the weekly dosing visits. Patients will be
      evaluated for safety over the course of the study. Disease evaluation (tumor restaging) will
      be performed 2 weeks following completion of the first 4-week treatment cycle. Patients with
      stable disease or better at this evaluation may go on to receive a second 4-week treatment
      cycle of rituximab + rIL-21. Patients may be in the study for 2 to 4 months.
