      study will be performed in individuals who live in T.R.N.C and who develop mild, moderate or
      severe lymphedema after breast cancer in the 35-70 age range.

      A randomized controlled trial design with three groups were used; 1) A Hatha yoga
      intervention group, 2) Clinical Pilates intervention group, 3) Control group.

      Individuals in the intervention groups will be given 24 sessions of yoga or Clinical Pilates
      training 3 times a week for 8 weeks. Control group will not receive any treatment. During the
      training, and control group individuals will be asked to wear compression stockings during
      the 8 weeks and an educational booklet will be given to the each group.

      The yoga classes included a progression of low-impact, modified poses, stretching and
      isometric exercises focused on the shoulders, arms, and chest, and meditation. Breathing and
      poses to drain the lymphatic system were incorporated throughout the yoga practice to assist
      with lymphatic flow. Before starting the Clinical Pilates exercise program, the patients will
      be trained on Pilates exercises and postures. During training, the patients will be taught
      how to create lumbopelvic stability (core stabilization), which is the basis for Pilates
      exercises, and spinal stabilization and appropriate posture techniques.

      As a result of the research, the data will be analyzed to determine which treatment method is
      more effective in lymphedematous individuals.
