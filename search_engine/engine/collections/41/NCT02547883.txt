      cardiovascular events in large randomized studies. Anyway, in patients ≥ 75 years, the impact
      of statins on mortality have not been demonstrated and large observational studies have shown
      an increased risk of mortality in people with low cholesterol. Moreover, statins are
      associated with numerous side effects, particularly in the elderly including myalgia and
      myositis, diabetes, cognitive disorders, fatigue and loss of energy and of physical
      activities, treatment interactions. At last, the cost of statins for the French national
      health insurance is 800 million euros per year (including around 200 million euros for people
      ≥ 75 years).

      The benefit/risk ratio of statins is not established in primary prevention in people ≥ 75
      years, leading to numerous and discordant expert advices since no specific randomized trial
      have been conducted in this population.

      Thus, in patients ≥ 75 years treated with statins in primary prevention, the studied strategy
      will be to stop statin therapy. The comparison strategy will be represented by the group of
      patient who will continue their statin at the same dose.

      Patients will be followed up every three months, according to general recommendations, during
      36 months. Clinical events will be prospectively registered
