      improve outcome. Patients with impaired or lost renal function or continuous renal
      replacement therapy are hard to calculate using drug information sheets or "lists" with
      recommendations. It is nearly impossible to avoid drug levels that are much to low or much to
      high without measuring the concentration in blood samples. Since that possibility is still
      not available in every clinic we aim to show, how a computer based calculation can help to
      find the adequate dosing.
