      to the individual's skill level, need, and significance to their individual context. There is
      limited research on measurable changes in perceived meaningful daily activities after
      utilizing immersive VR, specifically with a head mounted display. Only in recent years have
      head-mounted displays become less expensive and more commercially available for research and
      patron purchase. At the low cost of $250, the device is within the reach of many older adult
      community centers for leisure and recreational use. The researchers will measure changes in
      occupational performance, occupational satisfaction, and quality of life for the older adult
      members of a community center, after eight immersive VR sessions. Sessions will consist of 30
      minutes of use of the virtual reality goggles. During the virtual reality sessions,
      participants will select from a list of Oculus Go apps related to their self-identified
      occupational performance issues. Participants are expected to complete the session while
      seated with the VR set secured on their head.
