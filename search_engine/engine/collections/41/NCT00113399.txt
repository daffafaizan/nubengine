      Primary

        -  Compare overall survival of patients with previously irradiated unresectable locally
           recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck treated with radiotherapy,
           cisplatin, and paclitaxel vs cisplatin-based chemotherapy alone.

      Secondary

        -  Compare progression-free survival of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the toxicity of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Compare quality of life, functional/performance status, and quality-adjusted survival of
           patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment
      arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo radiotherapy twice daily and receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour
           and cisplatin IV over 30 minutes once daily on days 1-5, 15-19, 29-33, and 43-47.
           Patients also receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously once daily on days 6-13, 20-27,
           34-41, and 48-55.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive 1 of the following cisplatin-based* regimens at the discretion
           of the treating physician:

             -  Regimen 1: Patients receive cisplatin* IV over 1-2 hours on day 1 and fluorouracil
                IV continuously over 96 hours on days 1-4.

             -  Regimen 2: Patients receive cisplatin* IV over 1-2 hours and paclitaxel IV over 3
                hours on day 1.

             -  Regimen 3: Patients receive cisplatin* IV over 1-2 hours and docetaxel IV over 1
                hour on day 1.

      NOTE: *Carboplatin may be substituted for cisplatin in patients with creatinine clearance <
      50 mL/min or in patients who experience grade 2 or 3 neurotoxicity.

      For all regimens, treatment repeats every 21 days for at least 6 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving complete response (CR)
      receive 2 additional courses beyond documentation of CR.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and then at 3, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every
      6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 240 patients (120 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 5Â½ years.
