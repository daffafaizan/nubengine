      fields to increase the strength of a muscle group. The conventional (CONV) parameters of NMES
      induces a direct activation of the muscle fibers located close to the stimulation electrodes.
      This means that the neuromuscular system is not fully solicited, which limits its adaptation.
      The recent use of wide-pulse (WP) stimulations allows, in addition to the direct activation
      of the muscle fibers, the use of sensory pathways. This more global solicitation of the
      neuromuscular system (i.e. information going back to the spinal cord and even to the brain)
      prejudges more nervous adaptations and therefore a greater functional benefit.

      The first aim of this study is to evaluate and compare the force gains induced by 2 NMES
      training programs (CONV, WP) applied on knee extensors in healthy subjects for 6 weeks. The
      second aim is to understand the neuromuscular adaptations involved in these gains, as well as
      the functional benefit resulting from these improvements. To consolidate the benefit of NMES
      programs, a control (CONT) modality is used as a reference and is representative of a
      sedentary behaviour regularly observed in our populations. The CONV modality allows us to
      compare with the current clinical application and the majority of the literature on the
      adaptations induced by NMES training. Finally, the WP modality aims to assess the possible
      benefits linked to the use of wide-pulses during the application of NMES. A clinical transfer
      will then be envisaged to confirm the interest and benefits of this type of program. We
      hypothesise that nervous adaptations will be increased by the use of WP NMES, leading to
      greater gains in strength and functional benefits than with CONV NMES.
