      prevention of complications associated with frequent co-morbidities. However, the levels of
      PA observed in patients who will benefit from bariatric surgery are generally low, and many
      patients do not comply with the recommendations of their course in terms of PA. It is
      envisaged that coaching interventions and adapted programs can improve the level of PA. The
      objective of this pilot study is to evaluate the effectiveness and adherence to digital tools
      on the level of PA in preparation for bariatric surgery.
