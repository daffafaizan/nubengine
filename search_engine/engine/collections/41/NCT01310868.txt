      Primary

        -  To establish that the combined use of 5-ALA and Gliadel wafers during
           fluorescence-guided radical brain tumor resection is safe and does not compromise
           patients with primary glioblastoma from receiving or completing adjuvant standard
           radiotherapy plus temozolomide.

      Secondary

        -  To gather preliminary evidence that the combined use of 5-ALA and Gliadel wafers at
           surgery has the potential to improve clinical outcome, via measurement of time to
           clinical progression.

        -  To gather preliminary evidence that this regimen at surgery has the potential to improve
           clinical outcome via measurement of survival at 24 months.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Gliadel wafers are applied to resection cavity immediately after 5-ALA fluorescence-guided
      radical brain tumor resection. After recovery from surgery (within 6 weeks of surgery when
      possible ), patients receive adjuvant chemoradiotherapy comprising standard radiotherapy and
      temozolomide.

      Tumor biopsy and blood sample may be collected at time of surgery for retrospective MGMT
      status analysis.

      After surgery, patients are followed up at post-surgical visits, during subsequent therapy at
      routine clinic visits, and at 12, 18, and 24 months.
