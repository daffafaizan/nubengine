      Complete neuropathic evaluations are obtained as part of SJLIFE, and the information will be
      shared for use in the SJLPSC study. A one-time blood draw will be obtained, and peripheral
      blood mononuclear cells (PBMC's) will be isolated for eventual creation of induced
      pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) that will be differentiated into human neurons. These human
      neurons will allow the investigators to functionally validate and further interrogate CEP72
      genetic variants or variants in other genes that are associated with persistent (or acute)
      vincristine neuropathy using a "state of the art" cellular model of human neurons.
      Furthermore, creating neurons from patients at the extremes (highly sensitive to
      vincristine-induced neuropathy and matched controls) allows the study of differences at
      baseline and after treatment with vincristine.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

        -  To establish induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from childhood cancer survivors who
           did or did not develop persistent treatment-induced peripheral neuropathy, from which to
           make human neurons to assess their sensitivity to vincristine and determine whether
           neurons from patients who developed neuropathy are more sensitive to vincristine or
           other neurotoxic chemotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

        -  To evaluate the iPSC neurons made from patients with persistent treatment-related
           neuropathy and iPSC neurons from patients who did not develop neuropathy from the same
           treatment, for phenotypic difference prior to and after exposure to vincristine or other
           potentially neurotoxic medications.
