      experimental studies to have anti-cancer effects as well as limited toxicity.
      Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) is the major active catechin in green tea; it has been
      shown to prevent and limit tumor growth in murine models1-3. Silymarin, which is extracted
      from the seeds of the milk thistle plant, is used clinically as a hepatoprotective agent in
      Europe4. Its major active component, Silibinin, is well-tolerated and largely free of adverse
      effects5-6. In recent studies, Silibinin has been shown to inhibit the growth of a number of
      cancers in mouse models, including lung7, bladder8, liver9, prostate10, and colon11-12.
      Silibinin and EGCG have similar anti-neoplastic mechanisms including: 1) cell cycle arrest
      via upregulation of P21 and P27 and downregulation of CDK, 2) induction of apoptosis via
      Caspase-3 activation and cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), and 3) suppression
      of angiogenesis and metastasis via inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
      and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP-9)
