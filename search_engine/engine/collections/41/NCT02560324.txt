      specifically sleep onset latency) by enhancing melatonin receptor function. The investigators
      propose a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled crossover study.

      Fifty chronic smokers will complete a validated procedure for screening new medications. All
      subjects will receive 8mg ramelteon and placebo. The order in which ramelteon and placebo is
      received will be randomized across participants. This is a 6-week study consisting of two
      2-week medication phases separated by a 2-week washout. Each phase includes 1 week of ad
      libitum smoking (baseline) and 1 week of medication (ramelteon vs. placebo) plus transdermal
      nicotine patches while trying to abstain from smoking (quit assessment). Subjects will
      complete the same procedures during each study phase. Following completion of the study,
      participants will be offered standard smoking cessation treatment.

      For the duration of the study, subjects will be asked to keep sleep diaries and to wear an
      armband while sleeping, which provides objective indices of sleep duration and quality
      (SensewearPro® armband).

      The primary outcome will be the total number of days abstinent (out of 5) during each quit
      assessment period. Intermediate outcomes include sleep onset latency (self-report) and sleep
      efficiency (SensewearPro®).

      This study will provide information about the role of the melatonin system during brief
      abstinence and whether enhancing melatonin reduces abstinence-induced sleep problems that
      promote smoking relapse. Information obtained in this study may further establish the role of
      sleep disturbance in promoting smoking relapse.
