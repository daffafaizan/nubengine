      each year. Orthopedic surgeons routinely prescribe narcotics instead of NSAIDs for post-op
      pain control because of risk of delayed healing and nonunion due to NSAID use. Orthopedic
      oncology, however, has a unique subset of patients that undergo prophylactic placement of
      intramedullary femoral nails, often due to bone metastases that increase risk for future
      fractures. Because no fracture is present, these patients do not rely on inflammatory healing
      factors, allowing for post-op NSAID use.

      Recent literature has demonstrated the efficacy of multi-modal pain management in treating
      post-op pain [1]. Currently, patients that undergo prophylactic intramedullary femur nail
      placement at SLU are often treated with both narcotics and toradol, as long as they can
      tolerate NSAIDs. However, the effect of toradol in addition to narcotics has not been
      determined. This study sets out to determine the effect of post-op toradol use in addition to
      opioids compared to solely opioids in patients undergoing prophylactic nailing of the femur.
