      investigators hypothesize that endothelial dysfunction is associated with an increased
      incidence of delirium after cardiac surgery. To test this hypothesis, the investigators will
      measure biomarkers from subjects undergoing cardiac surgery. Blood samples from three time
      points [baseline, upon arrival to the intensive care unit (ICU), and postoperative day 1
      (POD1)] will be analyzed and compared between patients that did and did not develop
      postoperative delirium.

      Aim 1b. Test the hypothesis that BBB disruption is associated with delirium. The
      investigators hypothesize that disruption in the BBB is associated with an increased
      incidence of delirium after cardiac surgery. To test this hypothesis, the investigators will
      measure levels of biomarkers at baseline, upon arrival to the ICU, and on POD1.

      Aim 1c. Test the hypothesis that neuronal injury is associated with delirium. The
      investigators hypothesize that neuronal injury is associated with an increased incidence of
      delirium after cardiac surgery. To test this hypothesis, the investigators will measure
      levels of biomarkers at baseline, upon arrival to the ICU, and on POD1.
