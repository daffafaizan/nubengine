      stimulates the sympathetic nervous system, generates oxidant stress, produces natriuretic
      peptides, and increases ventricular rate. These are interrelated responses and the extent to
      which these or other pathophysiologic responses determine QT interval during and after Atrial
      Fibrillation (AF) is unknown. In this study, the QT variability is related to those potential
      markers in patients with AF undergoing elective DC-cardioversion.
