      lumbar spine and knees to include: lumbar range of motion and mobility testing, knee range of
      motion, palpation, and knee mobility testing. The participant will complete a hip strength
      test utilizing the Biodex System 4 ProÂ®. The participant will then perform three activities
      (single leg step down, squat, and drop jump from a 2 foot platform) and provide a
      self-reported knee pain measure with each activity. A sealed envelope indicating the
      intervention to be received will be given to the participant. An investigator blinded to the
      pre and post-measures will open the envelope indicating the intervention to be performed. The
      participant will be blinded to which intervention group they are categorized to. Th e
      participant will be positioned on a high-low treatment table to receive the assigned
      intervention. The participant will be positioned to receive either intervention 1 (thrust
      mobilization) or 2 (sham mobilization). The participant will either receive the
      thrust-mobilization or sham mobilization up to 2 times on the left and right side. An
      immediate re-test of hip strength will be conducted followed by performing the same three
      functional activities (single leg step down, squat, and drop jump from a 2 foot platform)
      while providing a self-reported pain measure after each activity. Follow-up measures at 15
      minutes post-intervention and the final measure at 30 minutes post-intervention will be
      performed.
