      Ugandan children 1.00-4.99 years of age with SCA will receive zinc (10 mg oral dispersible
      tablet daily) or placebo (identical to zinc in appearance) for 12 months. The primary study
      outcome will be incidence of severe or invasive infections. Secondary outcomes will include
      incidence of all clinical infections, confirmed bacterial infections (by culture or PCR),
      incidence of vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC), change in height-for-age z-score, and incidence of
      zinc-related adverse events.
