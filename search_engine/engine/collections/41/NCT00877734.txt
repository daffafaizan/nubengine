      baclofen vs. placebo in conjunction with behavioral therapy for reducing heavy drinking in 80
      alcohol dependent individuals. Prior studies (Addolorato et al. 2000, 2002; Flannery et al.,
      2004) have found that baclofen reduces self-reported anxiety and craving; therefore, the
      proposed study also will assess baclofen's ability to reduce symptoms of these affective
      states. Furthermore, in our pilot study (Flannery et al, 2004), women appeared to respond
      more consistently than men, and therefore the study will also be balanced by gender.
