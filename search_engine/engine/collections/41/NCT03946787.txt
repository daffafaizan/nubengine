      Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) Therapy or Treatment as Usual (TAU) through block
      randomization. This process will be done using the program available at www.
      randomization.com.

      In this study, EMDR Therapy will be applied in adolescents with BD and compared to the Usual
      Treatment. The neuropsychological profile of the patients will be evaluated before and after
      the interventions. In addition, the collection of the biological markers related to BD will
      be done by measuring the levels of salivary cortisol and serum levels of C-reactive protein
      (CRP), Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), Interleukin (IL) - 1β, IL - 2, IL - 4, IL -
      6, IL - 10, Interferon gamma (IFN-γ) and Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha(TNF-α) in these
      patients, since a study proposing the use of serological biomarkers for BD diagnosis
      concluded that the use of a single biomarker would be of little use and a combination of
      several biomarkers would be necessary.
