      exercise interventions - a baseline exercise without treatment and a experimental exercise
      with intervention (Synera patch or Inactive patch). Participants rated their pain on a NRS-11
      1 minute, 5 minutes, and 60 minutes after both exercises, as well as 6 hours after the
      experimental exercise, before bedtime, and the following morning. Subjects were randomized to
      receive either Synera at the first visit and the inactive patch at the second visit or the
      inactive patch at the first visit and Synera patch at the second visit.
