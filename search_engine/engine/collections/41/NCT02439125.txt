      Parkinson's disease and levodopa-induced dyskinesia. The study will examine the effects of
      three different doses of eltoprazine HCl, compared to placebo, on severity of dyskinesia,
      parkinsonian symptoms, patient function, safety and tolerability, using Parkinson's disease
      rating scales, patient diaries and physiological measurement of abnormal movement by means of
      motion sensors.
