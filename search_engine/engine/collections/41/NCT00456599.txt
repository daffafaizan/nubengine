      radiation, surgery and post-operative chemotherapy for resectable pancreatic cancer. This
      research treatment will evaluate the combination of two chemotherapy agents, oxaliplatin and
      gemcitabine with radiation therapy. The researchers have already done studies using
      oxaliplatin, gemcitabine and radiation therapy together for pancreatic cancer. They want to
      build on the information they have from this previous research and do the research at
      multiple sites. They will use this study to determine how well people do who are treated with
      gemcitabine, oxaliplatin, and radiation therapy prior to having surgery for their pancreatic
      cancer. The researchers will also gather more information about what type of side effects
      occur with this treatment.
