      of loneliness, up to 40 eligible participants will be randomised into the experimental or
      control group. Participants in the intervention group will be offered a 12-week outdoor group
      walking and health education workshops intervention. Each session will be performed once
      weekly for up to 90 minutes per session. Participants in the control group will be asked to
      maintain their current level of physical activity. Baseline and immediate post-intervention
      assessments will include anthropometry (height, weight, BMI), assessment of the resting blood
      pressure, physical activity for a 7-day period using accelerometer, questionnaires to assess
      loneliness, social support, social networks, social contacts, anxiety and depression, and
      expected outcomes of, and barriers to, exercise. Focus groups with participants will be
      conducted at 4 weeks mid-point and post-intervention to assess how the intervention might be
      improved; focus group transcripts will be thematically analysed using a phenomenological
      approach.
