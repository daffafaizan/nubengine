    
      A prospective randomized comparison of 3D and 2D laparoscopic surgery for advanced gastric
      cancer with spleen-preserving splenic hilum lymph nodes dissection will be performed, to
      evaluate the safety and feasibility for the extensive application of the novel 3D
      laparoscopic technique. The evaluation parameters are number of group No.10 lymph nodes
      harvested, perioperative clinical efficacy, postoperative life quality and 3-year survival
      and recurrence rates.
