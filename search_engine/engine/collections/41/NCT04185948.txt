      intermittent fasting. One of the interventions will use the Mediterranean dietary guidelines
      proposed by the Mediterranean Diet Foundation, the other intervention will use the UK dietary
      guidelines (Eatwell Guide).

      In this study, the interventions will require participants to adopt these interventions for 4
      weeks. A basic website containing support information will be develop for each of these
      interventions.

      Baseline measurements will be taken at the start of the study. Blood samples will be obtained
      in a fasted state before and after 4-week study period.

      Anthropometric and body composition measurements including height and weight, waist
      circumference, bioelectrical impedance will be collected by researcher. Physical activity
      will be assessed using accelerometers.
