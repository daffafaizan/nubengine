      hen's eggs. There were several well-recognized disadvantages to the use of eggs as the
      substrate for influenza vaccine. Eggs required specialized manufacturing facilities and could
      be difficult to scale up rapidly in response to an emerging need such as a pandemic. It was
      usually necessary to adapt candidate vaccine viruses for high-yield growth in eggs, a process
      that could be time consuming, was not always successful, and could select receptor variants
      that might have suboptimal immunogenicity. In addition, agricultural diseases that affected
      chicken flocks, and that might be an important issue in a pandemic due to an avian influenza
      virus strain, could easily disrupt the supply of eggs for vaccine manufacturing. Therefore,
      development of alternative substrates for influenza vaccine production had been identified as
      a high-priority objective.

      One potential alternative method for production of influenza vaccine was expression of the
      influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) using recombinant deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) techniques.
      This alternative avoided dependence on eggs and was very efficient because of the high levels
      of protein expression under the control of the baculovirus polyhedrin promoter.
