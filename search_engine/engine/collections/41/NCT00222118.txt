    
      Randomized clinical trial to test the effects of a comprehensive prenatal, in-hospital, and
      postpartum education and support intervention on breastfeeding initiation and duration among
      teenage mothers. Experimental, attention control, and usual care groups are used to test the
      hypotheses. Drawing on the Theory of Planned Behavior and begun during the second trimester
      of pregnancy, the experimental condition uses a lactation consultant-peer counselor team to
      influence pregnant adolescents' beliefs and intentions about breastfeeding their newborns.
      The attention control (placebo) condition mimics the experimental condition, using an
      advanced practice nurse and peer counselor intervention team, and focuses on healthy
      pregnancy behaviors and labor/birth preparation. Teens in the two intervention groups attend
      two prenatal classes specific to their focus between the fourth and ninth month of pregnancy
      and receive telephone calls from a peer counselor. Teens in a usual care group receive no
      interventions beyond their standard prenatal care and education. After giving birth and still
      in the hospital, teens in the intervention groups receive a peer counselor phone call and
      visit. Breastfeeding teens in the experimental group also receive a breastfeeding counselor
      visit. After hospital discharge, breastfeeding teens from both intervention groups continue
      to receive peer counselor telephone support and, in the experimental condition, breastfeeding
      counselor phone calls for four weeks. Breastfeeding teens from all three groups complete
      short telephone interviews until six months after birth or until they stop breastfeeding.
