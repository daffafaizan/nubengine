      participating in the Safe at Home program in the North Kivu, DRC. The 420 individuals
      comprising the study population will be 210 couples, of which both the male and female
      partners will be asked to participate in the study. After baseline data collection is
      completed, within each of the four sites where the program will occur in North Kivu, DRC, two
      groups of couples will be formed (n=8 groups total). Each group will be formed based on
      geographical proximity and will mirror real-life implementation of the program and ensure
      high fidelity to program design and limit contamination or spillover of Safe at Home to the
      control groups. Groups will then be randomized to receive Safe at Home in Cycle 1 or be
      waitlisted to receive Safe at Home in Cycle 2. After randomization is completed the Cycle 1
      programming will commence. Following a waiting period of 3 months after the program ends, the
      endline survey will be administered. Subsequently Cycle 2 cohort will receive programming.
