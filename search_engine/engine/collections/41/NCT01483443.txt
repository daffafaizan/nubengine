      responsive to chemotherapy compared to extraovarian metastases. The survival impact of
      oophorectomy has not been defined yet in this clinical setting. The incidence of microscopic
      ovarian metastasis has been reported to be approximately 10%. Therefore, the investigators
      propose a prospective study of oophorectomy followed by standard chemotherapy versus standard
      chemotherapy alone to determine whether oophorectomy increases survival.
