    
      This study will be a prospective, multi-centred, non-randomized pilot study to investigate
      the safety and performance of the VIVASURE CLOSURE DEVICEâ„¢. All patients undergoing a
      procedure requiring an arteriotomy in the range of 18 to 24 F, via the common femoral artery
      will be screened against the inclusion/exclusion criteria. If the patient meets the
      requirements of the clinical investigation, they shall be invited to participate, provide
      informed consent and shall subsequently be assigned a subject number.

      Patient safety will be monitored closely by the Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC).
      Safety data will be reported to the DSMC for every patient with a reported complication. The
      DSMC will adjudicate on the safety data to determine whether it is safe to continue
      enrolment.

      Subjects shall have a 1, 3 and 12 month follow-up assessment. Safety data from the follow-ups
      will be assessed by the Data Safety Monitoring Committee.

      This protocol will adopt the VARC-2 definitions for major vascular complication associated
      with closure of the access site.

      This pilot study will enrol approximately 10 subjects. The study is designed to support a
      larger CE Mark study. As such, a study safety assessment will be complete when all patients
      have completed their 1 month follow-up assessment. The Data Safety Monitoring Committee
      (DSMC) will review all complications and recommend whether it is safe to proceed to the CE
      Mark study. All patients will continue to be followed at 1, 3 and 12 month follow-ups.
