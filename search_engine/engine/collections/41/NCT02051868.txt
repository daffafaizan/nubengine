    
      Study design: This is an international, multicentre, open label, randomised phase II trial.
      Patients will be randomised to receive either cisplatin plus 5-FU or carboplatin plus weekly
      paclitaxel. Region (Europe, North America, South America & Australia), (Eastern Cooperative
      Oncology Group- ECOG) ECOG performance status (PS) (0-1 vs. 2), HIV status (positive vs.
      negative) and extent of disease (locally recurrent vs. metastatic) will be used as
      stratification factors. Overall response rate is the primary endpoint.

      Indication: First line treatment of patients with inoperable locally recurrent or metastatic
      squamous cell carcinoma of the anus.

      Length of study: Recruitment should be completed within 3 years. The estimated recruitment
      rate is between 4-6 patients per month once it is established at multiple centres.

      Primary Objective: To evaluate best overall response rate by 24 weeks post treatment in the
      cisplatin plus 5-fluorouracil arm versus the carboplatin plus weekly paclitaxel arm

      Secondary Objectives: To evaluate: - Progression-free survival - Overall survival - Disease
      control rate (stable disease or better) at 12 and 24 weeks - Best overall response of
      metastatic lesions - Toxicity (graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE Version 4) - Quality of Life (using EORTC
      QLQ-C30 version 3 and EQ-5D-5L questionnaires).

      To assess: The feasibility of conducting a multicentre international study on squamous cell
      carcinoma of the anus and recruit within a reasonable time frame.

      Exploratory Objective: Explorative biomarker analysis including the collection of archived
      tumour tissue and blood sample at baseline and upon progression.
