      digestive tract and liver diseases in patients on productive age. One of the most frequent
      complications of chronic liver insufficiency is minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE), which
      affects the quality of life and predisposes to the development of clinical hepatic
      encephalopathy. There are few evidences on the therapeutic alternatives for minimal hepatic
      encephalopathy. The administration of non-absorbable disaccharides has been proven to
      ameliorate MHE. Lactose maldigestion may justify the use of lactose in patients with chronic
      liver disease as a non-absorbable disaccharide for the treatment of MHE.

      The aim of our study is to evaluate the efficacy of lactose administration in patients with
      minimal hepatic encephalopathy.
