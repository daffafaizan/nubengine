      Hypoxemia is a major fatal complication of pneumonia, and the risk of death increases with
      increasing severity of hypoxemia. Improving oxygen delivery and extending oxygen supplies to
      children with hypoxemia due to severe pneumonia could reduce mortality in resource-limited
      settings.

      Global Good has developed a low cost oxygen mask (nasal reservoir cannula) to more
      efficiently deliver oxygen to the pediatric patient by increasing dead space to recapture a
      portion of expelled oxygen using the spatial distribution of the nasal reservoir cannula
      volume and length of surface seal. This nasal reservoir cannula fits over a standard nasal
      cannula (also termed prong). The system is designed to reduce administered oxygen to deliver
      an equal or higher fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) per oxygen delivered (L/min) compared
      with a standard nasal cannula alone.
