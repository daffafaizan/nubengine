      regards to efficacy and safety in treatment na√Øve RRMS patients, diagnosed within the last 12
      months.

      To test this hypothesis, the investigators aim to perform a 30-months (24 + 6 months)
      prospective randomized double blinded multicenter non-inferiority study to compare rituximab
      to ocrelizumab in RRMS.

      MS disease activity as measured by brain MRI is more sensitive as compared to clinical
      disease activity as measured by number of relapses or disability progression. New or
      enlarging MRI T2 lesions is regarded an acceptable marker of disease activity, and is
      routinely used in clinical practice by annual examinations (Thompson, Baranzini et al. 2018)
      (Thompson, Banwell et al. 2018). The investigators will therefore use the proportion of
      patients with no new or enlarging T2-weighted brain MRI lesions from month 6 to month 24 as
      the primary endpoint of this study.

      Secondary objectives are included to further evaluate potential the difference or
      similarities in effectiveness between the treatments (disability progression, relapse rate,
      T25FW, 9-HPT, SDMT), to evaluate the difference in safety issues (most notably hematological
      complications, infections, malignancies, infusion reactions and other serious adverse events)
      and to evaluate the difference in patient reported outcomes by evaluation of working status,
      fatigue, anxiety and depressive symptoms, quality of life and treatment satisfaction (EQ-5D,
      MSIS-29, FSMC, and SDMT). The exploratory outcomes are included to evaluate specific blood
      samples and plasma biomarkers for treatment response (sNFL and CD19+ cell counts) and side
      effects (hypogammaglobulinemia and neutropenia) of the two treatments, differences in
      vaccination status (pneumococcus and/or influenza) and to determine the predictive value of
      BICAMS for the individual patient.
