      Differences in the proteome concerning cell death pathways of glaucoma patients correspond to
      the differences in the mRNA expression of these patients.

      Specific aims:

      Characterization of the cellular proteome from human leukocytes of glaucoma patients compared
      to healthy controls and patients with Alzheimer's disease.

      Background:

      Glaucoma is a worldwide leading cause of blindness. The key feature of this ocular neuropathy
      is characterized by an excavating optic nerve head. Loss of retinal ganglion cells is the
      final end point in blinding diseases of the optic nerve such as glaucoma. It is known that
      neuronal cell death in glaucoma occurs by an apoptotic mechanism. In earlier studies we could
      demonstrate that this cell death is reflected in circulating leukocytes by different
      parameters, like differential mRNA expression, and an increased fragmentation of the DNA. The
      differences in mRNA expression indicate a close relationship to cellular stress conditions
      and apoptotic events: increased mRNA expression was detected for p53, 20S proteasome alpha
      subunit, ABC1 transporter, p21(WAF1/CIP1), 14-3-3 sigma factor, MMP-9 and MMP-14, and TIMP-1.

      Based on the assumption that glaucoma patients may differ on the level of their expression
      for these mRNAs, we expect that similar differences should exist at the protein level.

      This study is, therefore, designed to characterize the proteome related to the proteins
      involved in cell death related pathways.
