      leads to oxidative stress and vascular damage including microcirculation inflammation.
      Physical activity prevents cellular damage and provide a protective effect to the health of
      the mother and fetus. Although physical activity has been recommended for obese pregnant
      women, studies assessing the effects on the microcirculation of these women are scarce. This
      study aims to determine the effect of a physical exercise program on microcirculation and
      maternal and perinatal outcomes in obese women. A randomized clinical trial will be performed
      at IMIP with obese pregnant women assisted at the IMIP prenatal service. The intervention
      group will be submitted to an exercise program consisting of daily post prandial, 10' after
      breakfast, lunch and dinner. The control group will follow the routine prenatal IMIP. All
      pregnant women will be evaluated by a questionnaire to assess physical activity.
      Microcirculation function will be evaluated by a Laser-doppler flowmetry at baseline and
      eight weeks after intervention. All pregnant women will be followed until the delivery and
      immediate postpartum period to check their perinatal outcomes. All pregnant women will be
      advised to use a pedometer to record their daily steps. The study meets the recommendations
      of the National Health Council. This project was submitted and approved from the Ethics
      Committee for Research involving human subjets of IMIP. All participants will be duly
      informed about the aims of the study and will be included after signing the Informed Consent
      Form.
