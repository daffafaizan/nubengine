    
      Phase I evaluation of the safety and effectiveness of an endovascular approach to the repair
      of mitral valve regurgitation using the Evalve Cardiovascular Valve Repair System.

      The study is a prospective, multi-center, Phase I study of the Evalve Cardiovascular Valve
      Repair System (CVRS) in the treatment of mitral valve regurgitation. A minimum of 20 patients
      will be enrolled (an additional maximum of 12 roll in-patients, a maximum of 2 per site, may
      be enrolled and analyzed separately). Patients will undergo 30-day, 6 month and 12 month
      clinical follow-up.

      Up to 12 clinical sites throughout the US may participate.

      The primary endpoint is acute safety at thirty days, with a secondary efficacy endpoint of
      reduction of MR.
