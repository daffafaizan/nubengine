        -  Determine the anticancer activity of irinotecan and cisplatin in patients with locally
           advanced or metastatic penile cancer.

        -  Determine the objective response rate and duration of response in patients treated with
           this regimen.

        -  Determine the acute side effects of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, nonrandomized, multicenter study.

      Patients receive irinotecan IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 and cisplatin IV over 1-3
      hours on day 1. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients not undergoing local treatment receive up to 8 courses.
      Patients planning to undergo surgery receive up to 4 courses.

      Patients are followed every 8 weeks until disease progression and then every 3 months
      thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 13-28 patients will be accrued for this study.
