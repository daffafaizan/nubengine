      binary rhythm has been successfully used in people with PD to improve their gait quality, but
      the beneficial effects disappear when the stimulus is removed. Recent evidences have shown
      that, in healthy subjects, the structure of walking relies on a number, called Golden Ratio
      (GR), based on a perfect proportion between different gait phases. While GR is known to be
      impaired in people with PD, there are few evidences that a GR-based auditory stimulus could
      support people with PD in counteracting gait alterations. As hypothesis, an auditory external
      cue based on a personalized GR-rhythm could assist people with PD to cope with the
      difficulties that they experience while walking, thus increasing their mobility and autonomy,
      and that the nature of this GR-rhythm allows to maintain the beneficial effects in time. Two
      personalized auditory rhythms (a binary rhythm and a GR-rhythm) will be alternatively
      administered to each participant (see diagram below). Patient-specific rhythms will
      administered by a user-friendly ad-hoc app for smartphone. Two assessments will be performed
      during these 24 weeks, to assess treatment efficacy. At the end of the 24th week, half of
      patients will continue with the GR-rhythm and, in a final assessment, we will see if the
      effect lasts over time.
