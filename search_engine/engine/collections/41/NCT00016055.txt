        -  Determine the safety of interleukin-12-primed activated T cells (12ATC) and temozolomide
           in patients with metastatic melanoma.

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of 12ATC in this patient population.

        -  Determine the clinical response of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of interleukin-12-primed activated T cells (12ATC).

      Patients undergo leukopheresis on days 1-3 until adequate peripheral blood mononuclear cells
      (PBMC) are obtained. The PBMC are treated in vitro over 2 weeks with monoclonal antibody
      anti-CD3, interleukin-2, and interleukin-12 to form 12ATC.

      Patients receive oral temozolomide on days 15-19 and 43-47 and 12ATC IV over 15-30 minutes on
      days 22, 25, 29, 32, 36, 39, 50, 53, 57, 60, 64, and 67 in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of 12ATC until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed weekly for 2 weeks, every 3 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months
      for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 9-18 patients will be accrued for this study.
