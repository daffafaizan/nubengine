      distalization of the maxillary canines were enrolled to the study. Piezocisions were
      performed on the distal and mesial sides of the right maxillary canines while the left
      maxillary canines served as controls. Canine distalization was performed via closed-coil
      springs applying 150 g of force per side by using miniscrews as anchorage. Gingival
      crevicular fluid samples were collected from both mesial and distal sides of right and left
      maxillary canines at 0, 1, 7, 14 and 28 days. The gingival crevicular fluid levels of
      osteocalcin and cross-linked C-terminal telopeptides of type I collagen were determined by
      using ELISA. The rate of tooth movement was measured on 14 and 28 days.
