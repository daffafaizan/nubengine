    
      Forty patients diagnosed with a new central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) of a maximum
      duration of 6 months will be recruited to the study. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to
      treatment with aflibercept ot ranibizumab.

      all patients will receive 3 initial monthly injections. There after injections will be given
      att every visit according to a treat and extend schedule. If no macular edema is seen on the
      Ocular coherent tomography (OCT) examination the next treatment will be after 6 weeks. If the
      macula is dry after 6 weeks a new injection is given and the next visit is scheduled for
      another 8 weeks. If edema is seen on the OCT after 8 weeks the time to next injection is
      reduced to 6 weeks. Patients cannot receive an injection more often than every 4 weeks. All
      patients will receive an injection at least every 12 weeks.

      Primary outcome: the number of needed injections over a 18 month period comparing ranibizumab
      and aflibercept.

      Secondary outcome: Change in visual acuity, change in macular thickness. A subgroup of
      patients will also be evaluated with OCT angiography. A possible relationship between the
      Visual acuity and the foveal avascular zone will be evaluated.
