    
      This study will be the first time that DSP107 is administered to human subjects. The aim of
      the study is to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and
      preliminary efficacy of DSP107 monotherapy and combination therapy in a two-part design.

      Part 1 will involve DSP107 monotherapy dose escalation in subjects with advanced solid tumors
      that are not amenable to surgical resection or other approved therapeutic options that have
      demonstrated clinical benefit. Additional dose finding cohorts will be enrolled to establish
      a safe dose of DSP107 when given in combination with atezolizumab.

      Part 2 will comprise a single expansion cohort consisting of two treatment arms in which
      subjects will be treated either with DSP107 monotherapy or DSP107 in combination with
      atezolizumab. This part of the study will enrol subjects with non small cell lung cancer who
      have progressed following first line treatment with PD-1 or PD-L1 targeting agents having
      previously achieved a best response of stable disease or better.
