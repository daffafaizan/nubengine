      supportive cares including transfusion or cytokine therapies. Lenalidomide is the treatment
      of choice in case of MDS with 5q deletion. A study of lenalidomide for non-5q deletion MDS
      patients showed that transfusion independency rate was 26% which was relatively acceptable
      and suggested that lenalidomide could be used for non-5q deletion MDS patients. There is no
      datum for second-line lenalidomide therapy after hypomethylating agents. MDS which has highly
      complex pathogenesis backgrounds will have distinctive subtype for each therapy and each
      treatment drug can have distinctive subgroup for the response. In fact the investigators
      don't know which patient will be responsive hypomethylating agents or lenalidomide except for
      5q deletion. This suggests that second line therapy after the first line failure in MDS will
      be different with other type of relapsed/refractory disease which will be tend to more
      resistant to subsequent therapies. In this regard, there is a possibility to have a
      relatively high response rate to second line lenalidomide in this selected subset who has
      failed to the hypomethylation therapy or some patients will be responsive regardless of
      treatment line. Recent data suggested that MDS with JAK2 mutation will be responsive to
      lenalidomide. The investigators will analyze the JAK2 mutation status in response evaluation.
