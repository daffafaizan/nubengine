      tissue displacement (linear oscillation) initiated by a computer-controlled needle stimulus
      tool (NST). The CTMM will be suitable as an outcome measure for mechanistic and clinical
      studies of CAM interventions. The CTMM also will potentially serve as a clinical diagnostic
      and treatment-monitoring tool for manual therapists, acupuncturists, and CAM clinicians
      interested in assessing the functional status of a patient's connective tissue.
