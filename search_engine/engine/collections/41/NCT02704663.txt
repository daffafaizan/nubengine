      divided into two groups as regards surgery: a transumbilical (TU) group (n=21) and a
      transabdominal (TA) group (n=21). General anesthesia and use of local anesthetics were
      standardized. Visual analog scale (VAS) scores for pain and side effects (nausea/vomiting)
      and the amount of postoperative analgesic used were recorded for 24 hours. Investigators also
      investigated the expenses related to endobags and trocars. Further, peri- and postoperative
      complications were recorded. Investigators inquired about patient satisfaction as well as the
      surgeons' opinions of the alternative methods available.
