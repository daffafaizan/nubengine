      activity to exercise intensity. Additionally, to the activation of the classical motor
      control regions (e.g.: motor, somatosensory, premotor and supplementary motor cortices and
      cerebellum), the activation of the regions associated with autonomic regulation (i.e.:
      insular cortex) during exercise, as well as reduced activation of cognitive-related areas
      (i.e.: prefrontal cortex), an effect that increased at higher perceived intensities of
      cycling has been observed.

      Furthermore, the precentral gyrus and cerebellar vermis, as well as brain areas (e.g.:
      posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and precuneus) have been associated with higher levels of
      perceived exertion as well. Although the results were assessed sing a specially designed
      compatible fMRI cycling ergometer (Fontes et al., 2020), due to which the brain imaging
      techniques were limited to static (and horizontal) measurement conditions during cycling, we
      believe that the present study clearly distinguishes between claims proposed by different
      theoretical frameworks on brain responses during exercise.

      Therefore, the aim of this study is to examine the brain activity with EEG during the same
      incremental protocol, which will allow us to investigate the functioning of surface
      electrocortical activation patterns during progressive cycling exercise. Furthermore, using
      the advanced brain image analysis (machine learning techniques and standardized
      low-resolution electromagnetic tomography - sLORETA) helped us determine the frequency
      spectrum of brain activity in the same brain areas.
