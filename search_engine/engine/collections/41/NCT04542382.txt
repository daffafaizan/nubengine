      and are important target sites for drug-drug interactions (DDIs). During drug development,
      clinical studies characterizing transporter-mediated DDIs are frequently required. There has
      been enormous interest in identifying and validating serum biomarkers or surrogate probes to
      be used in predicting in vivo (clinical) DDIs. These biomarkers could complement in vitro
      studies, reducing false positive and false negative predictions, as well as the cost and time
      required for clinical development.

      In this randomized, two-arm crossover study, subjects will undergo a placebo and rosuvastatin
      phase and eltrombopag and rosuvastatin phase to identify biomarkers for a membrane
      transporter known as Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP). The primary goal of this study
      is to validate and discover BCRP candidate biomarkers in a focused clinical DDI study with
      healthy volunteers to determine whether they can serve as clinical biomarkers for
      BCRP-mediated DDIs.
