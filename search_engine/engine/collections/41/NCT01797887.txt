      diagnostic procedures and complex treatments. Ayurveda-treatment is based on Ayurvedic
      diagnosis and has a special focus on lifestyle and nutritional counseling, based on the
      individual constitution of the patient. Ayurvedic counseling can easily be followed by the
      patients in their day-to-day life and is an inexpensive way of self-care. In Ayurveda it is
      often used for the treatment of burnout-syndrome. However, no systematic data is available on
      its effectiveness in comparison to conventional standard diet and lifestyle counseling. The
      aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of Ayurvedic diet and lifestyle counseling
      compared to conventional standard diet and lifestyle counseling in outpatient mothers with
      burnout-syndrome.
