      adversely affects quality of life, adherence to treatment and clinical outcome. Depression is
      expensive to the person, their family, employers and society. Recent developments in the UK
      General Practitioners' Contract mean that patients with two chronic diseases (Coronary Heart
      Disease- CHD and Diabetes - DM) are routinely screened for depression using a simple
      screening tool. We propose a study using an existing self help intervention in the specific
      context of patients with mild to moderately severe depression identified in this way.

      This RCT is the second phase of a 2 phase mixed methods study examining the feasibility of a
      Full RCT. The first involved focus group with patients and health practitioners.
