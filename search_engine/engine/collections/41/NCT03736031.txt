      people have access to comprehensive palliative care. Access is even lower in rural, low
      socio-economic and Hispanic communities. Palliative care has been shown to decrease
      healthcare costs. This study will use an innovative approach to provide quality palliative
      care to gynecology-oncology Hispanic patients by using community health workers also known as
      promotoras. The promotora model has been shown to be successful in several behavioral
      modification programs. The investigators aim to use promotoras to deliver a comprehensive and
      culturally sensitive educational intervention that covers self-care in the presence of
      cancer, advance directives, pain management, and care taker awareness. The goal of the
      intervention will be to decrease number of emergency department visits and hospital
      admissions of patients with advanced cancer, and increase the rate of completion of advanced
      directives, as well as improve overall quality of life (as measured by standardized scales)
      when comparing the intervention group vs. the control (usual care) group. The investigators
      will additionally assess the cost effectiveness of this intervention.
