      highly portable devices. The GE VScan is one such device and a number of studies have
      examined its diagnostic capabilities in different clinical settings however, no study has
      examined its capability for screening non-cardiac surgical patients in the preoperative
      setting. If VTTE could be shown to safely screen patients preoperatively then there is
      potential to save time and money. DTTE is more costly than VTTE and there are often delays in
      performing DTTE prior to surgery.

      Adult patients > 17 years old who are referred for a preoperative TTE prior to non-cardiac
      surgery (elective or emergency procedures) are eligible for recruitment. Once an eligible
      patient is identified verbal and written consent to participate will be obtained.

      VTTE will be performed by one of six accredited echocardiographers working in Hammersmith
      Hospital Echocardiography Department. Based on pilot data and previously published studies it
      is estimated the VTTE will take between 3 and 7 minutes. The VTTE is reported on a 'tick box'
      form with the findings separated into significant pathology (red zone) and insignificant
      pathology or normal findings (black zone).

      DTTE will then be performed by a different echocardiographer and a written report prepared as
      per normal practice. The written DTTE report will be converted to a 'tick box' report
      enabling direct comparison of VTTE and DTTE.

      The primary aim is to assess the ability of the VTTE to detect significant pathology
      identified on DTTE.

      A proportion of DTTE and VTTE will be re-rated to obtain a measure of inter- and intra-
      observer variability.
