        -  Determine the efficacy and safety of multi-herbal agent ACAPHA in former smokers with
           bronchial intraepithelial neoplasia.

        -  Evaluate whether ACAPHA can modulate other surrogate endpoint biomarkers of aberrant
           methylation, cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, as well as phase I and II enzyme
           regulation.

        -  Establish a library of in vivo confocal microendoscopy images with corresponding
           histopathology, nuclear morphometry, and other biomarker information to assess the
           potential of confocal microendoscopy as a nonbiopsy method in assessing the effect of
           chemoprevention agents.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to gender. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral multi-herbal agent ACAPHA twice daily for 6 months.
           Patients achieving a partial response receive an additional 6 months of ACAPHA.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo twice daily for 6 months. Patients achieving a
           partial response receive an additional 6 months of placebo. Patients with progressive
           disease receive ACAPHA twice daily for 6 months.

      Patients undergo sputum cytology, oral and bronchial brushings, bronchoalveolar lavage, and
      bronchial tissue biopsies at baseline and at 6 and 12 months. Samples are analyzed for
      histopathological and morphometric cell changes; MIB-1 bcl-2, and TUNEL immunostaining;
      methylation biomarkers; and gene expression analysis of RNA.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed at 1 and 6 months.
