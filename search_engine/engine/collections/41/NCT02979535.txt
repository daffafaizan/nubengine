      either concomitantly or sequentially. Due to a protocol amendment, only previously dengue
      exposed participants (seropositive for dengue before vaccination) were eligible to complete
      the vaccination schedule and be assessed for CYD immunogenicity and human papilloma virus
      (HPV) immunogenicity. Dengue unexposed participants (seronegative for dengue before
      vaccination) did not receive the third CYD dengue vaccine injection, but were followed for
      safety up to 6 months after the last injection.

      Safety assessments included solicited reactions within 7 or 14 days after each injection,
      unsolicited adverse events within 28 days after each injection, and serious adverse events
      during the study period. All participants were included in the assessment of safety up to 6
      months after the last injection.
