      plausibility are possible, a comprehensive analysis of genetic susceptibility can only be
      achieved by a whole genome approach. Therefore we will test for genetic linkage and
      association using a large number of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) spanning the whole
      genome.

      Principal Investigators have access to information on all surviving and deceased laboratory
      confirmed H5N1 cases. These cases will form the study base. The epidemiologist will attempt
      to make telephone contact with either the recovered patient or,if the patient died, the
      closest relative of the deceased patient. The proposed study will be explained and permission
      will be sought for the epidemiologist and a study nurse to visit the household to explain the
      study in greater detail, to offer an opportunity for questions and, if the subject agrees, to
      obtain informed consent for participation. If the epidemiologist has difficulty in making
      contact with the case or their family the local public authorities will be asked to assist in
      making contact. Eligible family members of H5N1 cases will be identified by face-to-face
      interviews with the surviving confirmed cases or close family members of deceased cases.
