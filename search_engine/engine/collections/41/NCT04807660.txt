      prospectively enrolled by 41 pediatricians who are part of a research and teaching network
      (ACTIV, Association Clinique et Thérapeutique Infantile du Val de Marne [Clinical and
      Therapeutic Association of Val de Marne]) throughout France. For some patients, otorrhea is
      the first manifestation of AOM; for others, otorrhea occurred after AOM treatment failure or
      recurrence. Failure (non-responsive AOM) is defined as otorrhea appearing despite at least 48
      hr of antibiotics or recurring less than 4 days after the end of antibiotic treatment.
      Recurrence is defined by the appearance of otorrhea 4 to 30 days after the end of antibiotic
      treatment for AOM.

      Middle ear fluid (MEF) is obtained by sampling spontaneous discharge according to clinical
      practice guidelines. MEF specimens are obtained with cotton-tipped wire swabs, immediately
      placed in transport medium (Copan Venturi Transystem®, Brescia, Italy), and transported
      within 48 hr to one of the two centralized microbiology laboratories (Robert Debré Hospital
      or National Centre for Pneumococci at European Georges Pompidou Hospital, Paris, France).
