      between 18 and 70, with breast cancer, at the start of TAXOL treatment, possessing a
      smartphone, will be recruited and randomized into two groups:

      107 in the control group (smartphone application "placebo" = number of steps) 107 will be
      equipped with the application "Bouge" = coached group

      For three months, the patients do their daily physical activity. The "coached" group, through
      the smartphone application "Bouge", receives computer coaching to increase their physical
      activity (no direct medical intervention, only notifications and computer pusch).

      The control group is not coached by the application (simple display of the number of step)
