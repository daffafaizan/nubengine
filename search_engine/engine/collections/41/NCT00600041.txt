      safety reviews by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. We provide additional data on acute
      cardiac effects of an intravenous application.

      Methods: Echocardiography was performed in 18 healthy volunteers after administration of a
      common high dose regimen of pantoprazole (80 mg IV bolus followed by 8 mg/h for 1h) or
      placebo. Design: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial.

      Results: EF [%, means+/-S.E.] in the treatment group (placebo group) was 60.7+/-1.1
      (61.2+/-1.7) at baseline, and 62.6+/-1.1 (62.1+/-1.9), 64.7+/-1.6 (63.5+/-1.3), 62.6+/-1.6
      (61.0+/-1.6) and 63.0+/-1.4 (61.8+/-1.5) at 7.5, 15, 30 and 60 min after bolus application,
      respectively (p = n.s.). Similarly, no significant changes were found for cardiac output,
      cardiac index, blood pressure, and heart rate. In contrast, gastric pH that was used as a
      treatment control was significantly increased 60 min after application of pantoprazole as
      compared to baseline and to placebo.

      Conclusions: Pantoprazole for injection is safe in healthy subjects with respect to cardiac
      contractile function. However, in view of recent reports of negative inotropy of the drug
      further studies in heart failure patients are required.
