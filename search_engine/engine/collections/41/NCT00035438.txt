      (SJW) in the treatment of symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). The approach is to
      conduct a 12-week, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, parallel group pilot trial
      with 30 subjects in each of two arms. The Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) will
      be the primary measure for evaluating OCD. An intention-to-treat analysis will be done to
      compare the two arms.
