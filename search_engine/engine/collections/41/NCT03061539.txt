      in patients with metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer that have progressed following
      at least 1 line of therapy and have an specified immunogenic signature. The immunogenic
      signature is defined by the presence of at least one of the following:

        -  Mismatch repair deficiency by IHC

        -  Defective DNA repair detected by a targeted sequencing panel

        -  High inflammatory infiltrate defined on multiplexed IHC criteria.

      Treatment consists of :

        -  Nivolumab 1 mg/kg + ipilimumab 3 mg/kg every three weeks for a maximum of 4 doses

        -  6 week gap after last combination dose

        -  480 mg flat dose of nivolumab every 4 weeks for up to one year, or until progression,
           unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of consent.

      Patients must have ongoing androgen deprivation to maintain serum testosterone < 1.73 nmol/L.
