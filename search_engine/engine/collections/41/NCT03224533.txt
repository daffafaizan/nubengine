      diabetes suggest a possible effect with walnuts. Objective. To examine the associations
      between walnut consumption and diabetes risk through data from the National Health and
      Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Methods. NHANES survey data for 1999 through 2014 was
      pooled for adults with 24 hour recall dietary data. Risk of diabetes was based on
      self-report, medication use, fasting plasma glucose levels, and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)
      levels. Individuals were characterized as reporting consumption of walnuts, mixed 'nuts', or
      no nuts.
