      controlling psoriasis, all the biologics should be continuously injected to suppress
      recurrence of the disease. In this regard, the observation in our phase I psoriasis clinical
      trial was groundbreaking that just a single dose of anti-IL-23p19 antibody administration
      produced disease clearance up to 66 weeks in 46% (6 of 13) of patients. Since FoxP3 mRNA
      levels remained high in posttreatment biopsy specimens of these patients, we hypothesized
      that IL-23p19 inhibition increased regulatory T-cell levels or function in resolved psoriatic
      skin. However, there is a lack of understanding about regulatory immune cell promotion by
      IL-23p19 inhibition in human skin.

      Our overall objectives of the study, are to (i) identify regulatory immune cell alterations
      induced by anti-IL-23p19 antibody administration in the skin of patients whose psoriasis is
      cleared without recurrence and (ii) develop pre-treatment predictive models for psoriasis
      patients that anticipate disease clearance and recurrence after short-term anti-IL-23p19
      antibody injection. The rationale for this project is that molecular evidence of immune
      tolerance induction by IL-23p19 inhibition in human skin is likely to offer a strong clinical
      framework whereby new strategies to prevent recurrence of chronic inflammatory diseases can
      be developed. In this study, subjects with moderate-to-severe psoriasis will receive
      FDA-approved anti-IL-23p19 antibody (Generic name: Risankizumab, Product name: SKYRIZIâ„¢ or
      risankizumab-rzaa) up to 4 months following the FDA-approved indications, usage, dosage, and
      administration in the FDA-approved dosage forms and strengths through week 16, after which,
      dosing stops.
