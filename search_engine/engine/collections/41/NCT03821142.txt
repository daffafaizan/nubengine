    
      Calistar S Single Incision Pelvic Organ Prolapse (POP) Repair System is intended for
      transvaginal reestablishment and reinforcement of the physiologic anatomy of the female
      pelvic floor in non-fertile women with anterior pelvic organ prolapse with or without apical
      vaginal wall involvement in both, recurrent pelvic organ prolapse and primary pelvic organ
      prolapse when other surgical procedures are expected to fail (i.e. complex primary prolapse).

      The treatment kit consists of the lightweight mesh, two single-use introducers and 3 tissue
      anchoring system (TAS) anchors for fixation to the sacrospinous ligament. The product is
      approved in accordance with the CE Directive 93/42/EEC.

      The utilization of synthetic implants in POP repair became increasingly popular in the last
      decade. The cumulative success rate of synthetic implants in anterior compartment repair is
      as high as up to 93%.However, meshes have been recently scrutinized due to high adverse event
      reporting after unreflected utilization of meshes which raised concerns of patients safety;
      furthermore taking into account the complexity of adverse event mesh management. This led to
      a vanishing of various meshes in transvaginal POP repair. Nevertheless, the further
      development of light weight meshes, the experience of the surgeon and the assessment and
      patients selection are well known factors reducing the rate of adverse events significantly.

      Therefore, in the current trial the efficacy and safety of calistar S in a highly selected
      patient population will be evaluated.
