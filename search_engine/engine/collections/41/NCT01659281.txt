      artesunate-mefloquine treatment in patients with uncomplicated falciparum malaria. Primary
      endpoints will be 63-day parasitological cure rates in the 2 treatment groups. Secondary
      endpoints will be parasitological failure rates at each of the weekly follow-up visits to Day
      56, occurence of treatment-emergent adverse events on days 0, 1 and 2, mefloquine blood
      concentrations on days 7, 14 and 28, and in vitro drug sensitivity profiles for parasite
      isolates as measured by inhibitory concentrations. Genotyping of parasites for known markers
      of drug resistence will be performed.
