      history and baseline information, and meet all the inclusion / exclusion criteria. Eligible
      patients who agreed to participate will be randomized to either long acting standard COS with
      corifollitropin alpha or standard COS with daily FSH in a fixed GnRH antagonist protocol. All
      patients will be allowed to participate in the study only once and a written informed consent
      will be obtained from all, following consultation and before the initiation of the treatment.

      The endocrine profile of all the patients will be evaluated by analysis of serum
      progesterone, 17b-estradiol (E2), FSH and LH at different time points: basal condition,
      during stimulation, at the hCG day and at pick-up.

      Transvaginal follicular aspiration will be performed by ultrasound guidance 36 hours after
      hCG administration. The day of pick up oocytes will be fertilized with partner's semen; after
      3-5 days, on the base of its evolution, embryo will be transferred. 14 days after
      embryo-transfer a preg-nancy test will be performed. Follow up in case of obtained pregnancy
      will be done until 20 weeks of gestation and considered as ongoing pregnancy.

      The entire duration of the study is 24 months, the follow up of the last patients enrolled
      will be 6 months.
