    
      -  The purpose of this study is to find out the effect of vibratory perineal stimulus
           compared to transvaginal electrical stimulation on the functionality of pelvic floor
           muscles in women with urinary incontinence who are unable to perform voluntary
           contraction of this musculature.

        -  Study Design: Randomized controlled trial

        -  Search location: The data will collected at the Ambulatory of Urogynecology and
           Obstetrics of Porto Alegre Clinical Hospital (HCPA), where the activities of Pelvic
           Physiotherapy are performed.and in the Clinical Research Center of the same hospital.

        -  Inclusion criteria: women with urinary incontinence with zero or one strength degree of
           pelvic floor muscle contraction by the Modified Oxford Scale.

        -  Main outcome: Improvement the functionality of pelvic floor muscles

        -  Secondary outcome: Improvement of urinary loss

        -  First protocol: patients will be referred by the medical team and will undergo
           physiotherapeutic evaluation to collect personal data, check the symptoms of urinary
           incontinence, apply a quality of life questionnaire and measure pelvic floor muscles
           strength. If patient has zero or one degree of pelvic floor muscle strength, will be
           referred to the second phase.

        -  Second protocol: Patients will be randomized into two groups - Vibratory stimulus group
           or electrical stimulation group. Both will follow a 6-week treatment protocol with
           intervention once a week. Both are intravaginal devices applied for 20 minutes, with on
           cycle of 8 seconds and off cycle of 16 seconds.

        -  Final protocol: patients will repeat the initial evaluation.
