      as Usual (TAU) Improves negative symptoms and/or positive symptoms.

      The secondary objectives are to determine:

        -  Effects on cognitive functioning.

        -  Effects on social functioning and quality of life.

        -  Safety and tolerability.

        -  Possible additive effects of Minocycline added to TAU

        -  The effect on inflammatory biomarkers associated with schizophrenia. Both pro and
           anti-inflammatory cytokines will be drawn at baseline and endpoint. We will test to see
           if minocycline is associated with improvements in abnormal cytokines as compared to
           placebo.

      The study will be a randomized double-blind placebo controlled trial of minocycline added to
      clozapine (Treatment as Usual) in TRS. There will be two treatment arms: one arm receiving
      TAU with minocycline and the other TAU with placebo for a period of twelve weeks.
