      single-center study to evaluate the oral bioavailability (ie, absorption and distribution
      within the body) and pharmacokinetics (blood levels) of a single dose of 1 fixed-dose
      combination (FDC) tablet of canagliflozin and metformin IR (abbreviated as 1 CANA/MET IR FDC
      tablet) when taken by healthy volunteers without food (in a fasting state) or with food (in a
      fed state). Healthy volunteers participating in the study will be randomly (by chance)
      assigned to receive Treatment A (1 CANA/MET IR FDC tablet taken by healthy volunteers in a
      fasting state) followed approximately 14 days later by Treatment B (1 CANA/MET IR FDC tablet
      taken by healthy volunteers in a fed state) or Treatment B followed approximately 14 days
      later by Treatment A.
