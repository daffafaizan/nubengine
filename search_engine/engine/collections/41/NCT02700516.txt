    
      Glomerulonephritis is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease in 30% to 50% of patients
      who receive a renal transplant. Even though recurrent or de novo posttransplant primary GN is
      the third most frequent cause of renal allograft loss after renal transplantation, different
      recurrence rates have been reported in different patient series worldwide. With the
      implementation of diverse and improved immunosuppressive treatment regimens and prolongation
      of graft survival, renal allograft loss caused by recurrent or de novo GN will be more
      important than ever. Data obtained from comparing patients who have recurrent primary GN
      against patients with non-recurrent GN and renal transplant recipients with non-GN etiology
      shall bring new approaches to the daily practice of managing patients with GN and renal
      failure, assessing them as transplant candidates and applying new therapies.
