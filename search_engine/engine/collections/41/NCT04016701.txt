      Attention Module is the intervention being evaluated. Floreo is a mobile application that
      offers a supervised virtual reality experience for individuals with ASD. The application
      provides a 3D immersive scene for Google Cardboard-compatible smartphones and a WiFi paired
      supervisory overview that can run on smartphones or tablets.

      The therapeutic content will consist of a Learning Module focused on Joint Attention. This
      Joint Attention Learning Module will include separate Learning Cards (LCs) that address
      specific subskills necessary to develop appropriate joint attention. Each Learning Card will
      consist of a virtual reality environment in a safari-themed setting, complete with animals
      designed to draw the learner's attention when necessary.

      The product will be implemented at The Children's SPOT by a therapist working with a client
      during the course of a therapy session.

      The intervention arm participant would engage in one or two VR episodes during a scheduled
      session. Each episode would last no more than 5 minutes. If two episodes are done in a day,
      there is a mandatory break of at least 3 minutes in between them. The sessions would occur
      two days per week, with at least two days in between sessions to allow the eyes time to rest.

      There are 15 total VR sessions in the protocol, and completion of all study sessions would
      take 8 weeks.

      The control condition is treatment as usual, that is, regularly scheduled therapy.
