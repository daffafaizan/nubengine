      presentation by conventional physical examination, hematologic and biochemical screening, or
      radiologic evaluation. More intensive radiologic evaluation with CT or radioisotope scanning
      has not proven to be useful. What may be useful is a more sensitive method of staging
      melanoma patients at presentation, specifically evaluating them for subclinical systemic
      disease.
