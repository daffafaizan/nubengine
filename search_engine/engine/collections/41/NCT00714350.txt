      is necessary to address usability, ergonomics, domain specific, and expertise specific issues
      and concerns. Our objective is to develop intuitive, meaningful and ergonomically efficient
      informative displays specific to the user's domain. Specifically we aim to enhance and refine
      the display prototype of ABG information to include gas-exchange, acid-base balance, lung
      mechanics, ventilation, oxygenation, and metabolism information.
