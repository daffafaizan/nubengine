      after elective spine surgeries. Common causes of postoperative urinary retention (POUR)
      include bladder stenosis, distension, trauma due to catheterizations, age, and prostate
      hyperplasia. The incidence of POUR increases with age, gender, types of surgery conducted,
      any comorbidities such as cerebral palsy or multiple sclerosis, use of drugs such as
      anticholinergic agents, beta blockers, or sympathomimetics, and use of IV fluids.

      This condition has been associated with the development of UTIs and sepsis, increased
      post-operative length of stay (LOS), and 90-day readmission after surgery. In the field of
      spine surgery, the reported incidence of POUR is highly variable, and there is no consensus
      on effective methods of prevention. We set out to assess POUR from patients catheterized
      compared to non-catheterized following a transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion.
