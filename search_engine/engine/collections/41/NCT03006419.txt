      year patient and graft survival and 91% and 83% at 5 years with rejection-free patients in
      93%. The cumulative dose of r ATG (thymoglobulin) was 5.29 mg / kg with 3% adverse effects
      and almost 50% steroid free at 12 months. Others have explored the benefit of low doses of r
      ATG (thymoglobulin) (3-5 mg / kg) against Basiliximab in low-risk population and demonstrated
      in living donor recipients with 8 year follow-up similar survival rates with a lower BPAR
      rate in rATG (thymoglobulin) (p <0.05) and better serum creatinine in 3 and 5 years. The aim
      of the study was to demonstrate that low dose (3 mg/kg total ) rATG (thymoglobulin) has
      similar efficacy (delayed graft function, slow graft function, biopsy proven acute rejection
      episodes, infections, hospitalizations, adverse events, graft loss and death) than
      Basiliximab induction.

      Material and methods: Prospective randomized study of patients undergoing renal
      transplantation who wish to participate. 100 patients who meet the inclusion and exclusion
      criteria at the time of transplantation will be randomized

      Experimental and reference therapy:

      Group A: Induction with Basiliximab 20 mg IV day 0 and day 4 Group B: rATG (Thymoglobulin) 1
      mg / kg body weight per day for days 0, 1 and 2 up to a total dose of 3 mg / kg day.
      According to protocol administration, if there are conditions to delay administration
      (WBC<2000 / mm3 and / or platelets <75,000 / mm3) (17), administration may be postponed until
      day 7 posttransplant Posttransplant immunosuppression: Tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil and
      steroids

      Outcome measures (12 months) delayed graft function slow graft function biopsy proven acute
      rejection episodes infections hospitalizations adverse events graft loss death
