      an effective treatment in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, stimulating the STN can lead to
      unwanted side effects that involve muscle movements (dyskinesias) and behavior and mood
      problems. DBS of a different brain structure, called the rostral zona incerta (rZI), has been
      demonstrated to be as effective as stimulating the STN, without any unwanted side effects in
      several studies. However, there is great variability in reported efficacy and adverse effects
      of rZI stimulation likely due to challenges in locating this area in the brain. The goals of
      this study are 1) to develop an improved method for targeting the rZI 2) determine efficacy
      of rZI with STN stimulation compared with STN stimulation alone, 3) evaluate any stimulation
      adverse effects of combined stimulation of the rZI and STN.
