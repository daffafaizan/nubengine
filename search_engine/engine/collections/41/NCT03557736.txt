      sedentary obese population has been disputed by public health experts. Existing HIT
      interventions have been successful only under optimal conditions with high levels of
      supervision and specialised equipment, creating further barriers to exercise in those most in
      need. We aimed to eliminate many of these barriers by modifying existing HIT protocols to
      create a new home-based HIT (Home-HIT) intervention tailored to individuals with low fitness
      and mobility. It was hypothesised that Home-HIT would 1) have high adherence to the
      prescribed exercise intensity (compliance) and 2) improve markers of cardiovascular disease
      (CVD) risk. 32 Obese adults with at least 3 additional CVD risk factors (age 36±2 y; BMI
      34.3±0.8 kg∙m-2; VO2peak 24.6±1.0 ml∙kg∙min-1), completed one of three 12-week training
      programmes 3x/week: Home-HIT (n=9); Laboratory-based supervised HIT (Lab-HIT; n=10) or
      home-based moderate intensity continuous training (Home-MICT; n=13). Adherence and compliance
      were monitored online in almost "real time" using a heart rate (HR) monitor and mobile app.
      The Home-HIT group completed 4 progressing to 8 1min intervals interspersed with 1min of rest
      in an unsupervised place of their choosing. The intervals were composed of simple bodyweight
      exercises that required no equipment. Changes in VO2peak, insulin sensitivity, body
      composition, flow-mediated dilation (FMD) and aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV) were assessed.
      Muscle biopsies were taken to assess changes in capillarisation, mitochondrial density,
      intramuscular triglyceride (IMTG) content and eNOS and GLUT4 protein expression using
      quantitative immunofluorescence microscopy.
