    
      1. This study will investigate the feasibility of assessing symptoms of developmental ADHD
           and "secondary ADHD" (S-ADHD) among adolescent survivors of childhood cancer using a
           structured diagnostic clinical interview procedure. (S-ADHD describes an acquired
           clinical presentation that is consistent with the diagnostic criteria of ADHD).

        2. This study will provide preliminary estimates of the rate of occurrence of ADHD/S-ADHD
           among adolescent survivors of childhood cancer as compared to the prevalence of
           developmental ADHD in the general population.

        3. The study will examine the relationship between ADHD/S-ADHD symptoms and laboratory
           measures traditionally used to assess specific components of attention (e.g., CPT) in
           survivors of childhood cancer.

        4. The study will examine the relationship between ADHD/S-ADHD symptoms and smoking
           (including intentions, behaviors, and motivators) among adolescent survivors of
           childhood cancer.
