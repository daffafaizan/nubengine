      patients and their families, because of strict daily treatment regimens, physical limitation
      or effects on social life for instance.

      The importance of considering quality of life (an overarching concept covering the effects of
      the disease on physical, metal, emotional, social and behavioural well-being) in the
      treatment of patients with chronic conditions is now well established.

      Quality of life studies often focus on a specific chronic condition. Studies of multiple
      chronic pathologies are rarer. However, factors such as the severity of the disease, its
      prognosis, the constraints of the daily regimen, and the visibility of the disease can have a
      greater impact than the type of disease itself. Studies of specific chronic diseases have
      identified several factors affecting quality of life such as age, sex, disease severity,
      medically unexplained symptoms, family cohesion, socio-economic status, perception of the
      disease, the adaptation strategies used by the child or their familyâ€¦ It would therefore be
      interesting to study the effects of these factors on chronic diseases in general,
      irrespective of disease type.

      In children, chronic diseases can lead to poor growth, which can of itself affect the child's
      quality of life.

      Our proposal is therefore to study the effects of short stature on the quality of life of
      children with chronic diseases treated in our multidisciplinary paediatrics department.

      The quality of life of the patients' relatives will also be considered.
