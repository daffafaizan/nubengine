      Tehran, Iran. After review of the inclusion and exclusion criteria and explanation of the
      design of the study, written consent form will be completed. The participants are 50 eligible
      coronary artery disease patients, aged 30-75 years. Intervention group will be received a
      heart-healthy diet with a specified number of food servings from different food groups
      (including vegetables, fruits, grains, dairy products, meats) + daily consumption of 30 grams
      of flaxseed + 25 mL/day of refined olive oil (equivalent to 4 tablespoons; 2 tablespoons for

      dairy sources with regular or high-fat ones; consumption of regular vegetable oils such as
      canola and sunflower; reduction in salt consumption; and reduction in the consumption of
      simple sugars, for 3 months. Flow mediated dilatation (FMD) in brachial artery via
      ultrasonography, plasma levels of lipids and lipoproteins via enzymatic method, and fatty
      acids composition of red blood cells via gas chromatography method were measured.
