      Wake Forest National Cancer Institute Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP) Research
      Base (WF NCORP RB). The recruitment goal will be to have 160 participants who complete the
      interviewer-administered Structured Questionnaire at all three time points. All participants
      will be administered the first Structured Questionnaire prior to a prostatectomy or
      initiation of radiation therapy to treat adenocarcinoma of the prostate. Participants will
      also be administered Structured Questionnaires at three and six months after the
      prostatectomy or completion of radiation therapy. For most patients, the time between study
      enrollment and completion of participation will be approximately 6 - 10 months.
      Interviewer-administered Structured Questionnaires will address work ability, job
      characteristics, presence of symptoms associated with adenocarcinoma of the prostate
      treatment, and general background information.
