      treatment period of a minimum 3-week and a maximum 12-week duration. Treatment with Progut
      will be at the discretion of the attending doctor and decision is independent of this study.
      This study will only recruit patients following the prescription of Progut and follow them up
      for upto a maximum of 12 weeks.

      At Visit 1 (Day 1), the eligible patients will receive a prescription for Progut from their
      physician. Depending on the discretion of the attending physician, they will be prescribed
      Progut for treatment duration lasting 3 to 12 weeks. Safety of Progut under normal clinical
      use will be assessed at the end of this period. Perception of effectiveness, and tolerability
      of treatment will be assessed on Day 8-15 using a phone interview. On Visit 2 (any time
      between Day 22 to 85, depending on duration of treatment given and schedule of their
      follow-up visit arranged by the attending physician), the patient will be evaluated for
      symptomatic improvement, perception of effectiveness, tolerability and satisfaction with
      treatment, following which he/she will formally exit the study.

      This study design was chosen with the aim of recruiting rapidly a large cohort of patients
      representative of the population being prescribed Progut. A total of 50 patients will be
      included to allow for an assessment of patient's tolerability of Progut, as well as
      satisfaction and perception of effectiveness and symptom response in the Singapore
      population.
