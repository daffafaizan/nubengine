      sequences by simple randomization: Superimposed NMES group (SG) or control group (CG).

      All volunteers will receive an COPD patient education program for once and conventional
      physiotherapy exercise program for COPD with the duration of 8 weeks. Additionally,
      superimposed NMES will be applied on quadriceps muscle of both limbs at the same time with
      voluntarily contraction of quadriceps muscle in SG.

      All patients will be assessed in terms of functional capacity, pulmonary functions,
      quadriceps muscle endurance and strength, dyspnea, respiratory muscle strength and quality of
      life at the baseline and at the end of study. Data will be collected from all the patients at
      baseline and at the end of study (8 weeks) by the same physiotherapist who also will
      supervise the exercise sessions.
