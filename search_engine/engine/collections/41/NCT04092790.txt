      ever-increasing life expectancy and aging of the population. As a result, it is imperative
      that health care professionals and policy makers develop strategies and new technologies that
      enable older people to enjoy their advancing years in good health.

      Sarcopenia, an age-related decrease in muscle mass, is a major factor in functional decline
      and frailty and leads to poor quality of life and increased health care costs in older age
      groups. Because sarcopenia is known to be exacerbated at the time of acute hospital
      admission, the development of new technologies for the prevention and diagnosis of sarcopenia
      will have important ramifications in promoting healthy aging in both the acute care and
      ambulatory settings.

      A pilot interventional self-controlled study will be performed in an internal medicine
      department (internal medicine ward Het) at the Rambam Health Care Campus in Haifa.

      Subjects will be evaluated for the risk of sarcopenia by acceptable screening instruments as
      well as B-mode portable ultrasound. They will then be treated using a stocking-like Virtual
      Gait Device (VGD) which will be applied to one randomly-assigned lower limb. The VGD is a
      technology that uses fussy-logic technology to stimulate calf muscles in synchrony with the
      patient's heartbeat, enabling a virtual gait in patients who have limited mobility.

      Confidentiality will be achieved by applying a unique identifier to each trial subject in
      accordance with Good Clinical Practice standards.
