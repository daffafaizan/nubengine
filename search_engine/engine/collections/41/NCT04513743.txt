    
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the agreement between automated sleep analysis by UNEEG
      medical's 24/7 EEG™ SubQ device using a deep learning algorithm and the consensus score of
      multiple sleep technologists' manual scoring of 120 gold-standard polysomnograms (PSG).

      The study will enroll 20 healthy subjects who will wear the UNEEG™ SubQ device for 365
      consecutive nights. All subjects are prescreened and invited to an interview to confirm
      eligibility. Subjects who provide informed consent are enrolled and will complete a detailed
      demographic, medical, health, sleep, and lifestyle survey. The enrolled subjects will have
      the UNEEG™ SubQ implanted and after approximately 10 days of healing the study subjects will
      start wearing the external part of the 24/7 EEG™ SubQ. Throughout the study the subjects will
      wear an ActiGraph, fill out a sleep diary and conduct cognitive tests. The duration of the
      study from screening to removal of sutures will be approximately 58 weeks.
