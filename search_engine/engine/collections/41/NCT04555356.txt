      minimum of twelve weeks between January 2018 and January 2020 were evaluated retrospectively.
      Twenty-four patients were excluded due to the presence of spondylolysis-listhesis, spinal
      alignment disorders including scoliosis and kyphosis, inflammatory diseases, or histories of
      spinal surgery and multilevel disc hernia. Two hundred five patients were finally enrolled.
      Age, gender, weight, and height were recorded, and BMI was calculated as weight/(height)Â².
      Participants were divided into two groups - with LDH (Group A) and without LDH (Group B).
      Right- and left-side PS, MF, and ES muscle volumes at intervertebral disc levels L4-L5 and
      L5-S1 were measured on Axial T2-weighted fast spin-echo sequences. All cross-sectional images
      at both levels (L4-5 and L5-S1) were generated by means of multiplanar reformat images. The
      muscles were identified by means of manual contouring at both disc levels. The fat components
      were then eliminated by application of the threshold technique, based on visual differences
      in pixel signal intensities. Volume measurement from cross-sectional images was based on the
      use of an automatic volume calculation tool.
