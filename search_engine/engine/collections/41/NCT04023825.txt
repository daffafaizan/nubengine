      complications it generates. The surgical site involving the upper airways and the use of
      morphine are providers of respiratory complications. The suprazygomatic maxillary nerve block
      could considerably reduce the use of morphine in the postoperative period and thus the
      respiratory complications in addition to an optimal comfort for the patient. The primary
      endpoint was to evaluate morphine consumption during the first postoperative 48 hours after
      cleft palate surgery.
