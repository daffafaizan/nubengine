    
      The purpose of this study is to validate the JADE wRAP™ in adult patients (≥18 years of age)
      according to American National Standard, ANSI/AAMI/ISO 81060-2:2013, Non-invasive
      sphygmomanometers - Part 2: Clinical investigation of automated measurement type.

      The study is intended to be a simple validation of blood pressure parameters only (Systolic
      and Diastolic). This study is not intended to yield any other special information.

      OBJECTIVES

      1) To validate the JADE wRAP™ for systolic and diastolic blood pressures compared to the
      reference standard mercury sphygmomanometer.

      The data collected from this study is for internal purposes only and should assist in further
      developing the device and supporting platform to a beta stage.
