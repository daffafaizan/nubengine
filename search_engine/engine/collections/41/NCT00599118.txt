      controls. The primary aim of future research using these samples is to identify mechanisms
      and pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation. Through this information, we hope to identify
      targets for new therapies and improve knowledge and understanding of atrial fibrillation.
      Identification of disease genes could improve strategies that prevent progression of atrial
      fibrillation to more persistent disease.
