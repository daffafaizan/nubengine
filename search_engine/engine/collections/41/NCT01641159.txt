      preventing relapse in cocaine-dependent adults in inpatient/residential treatment who are
      planning to enter outpatient treatment upon inpatient/residential discharge. Secondary
      objectives include evaluating the impact of buspirone, relative to placebo, on other
      drug-abuse outcomes and on factors that may mediate buspirone's efficacy as a
      relapse-prevention treatment.
