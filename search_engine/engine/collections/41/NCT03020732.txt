      generation platelet concentrate(PC).The rotational speed of the centrifuge machine used in
      CGF, varies between 2400-3000 rpm. The variability of the rotation speed during
      centrifugation allows a fibrin matrix that larger, more intensive and includes more growth
      factors than PRF. Some studies have been reported that CGF have an inducing effect on
      periodontal ligament stem cells for osteogenic differentiation and clinically provides new
      bone formation for the sinus augmentation. In literature, there is only one clinical research
      associated with multiple gingival recession defects treatment. It showed that CGF with CAF
      surgery increases keratinized gingiva weight and thickness and it maybe prevents
      post-operative relapse for CAF.

      PC has also been mentioned to be effective in to increase the width of keratinized tissue
      with providing root coverage and it may reduce early post-surgical complications, and
      accelerate wound healing in systematic review. In the treatment of isolated or multiple
      gingival recession, PRF and SCTG with CAF procedures have been reported to similar root
      coverage. PRF can be used as an alternative method for SCTG .CGF and PRF have similar
      composition. However higher resistance and viscosity of CGF may protect growth factors from
      proteolysis better than PRF. There is any comparative study for CGF and SCTG in literature in
      terms of clinically or patient related parameters.

      Therefore, the purpose of this clinical study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy of CGF in
      combination with CAF in the treatment of gingival recession's defects, and to compare SCTG in
      combination with CAF. It is also aimed to asses and compare postoperative pain and soft
      tissue healing.
