      metastases can be associated with reduced Quality of Life (QoL), pain and skeletal-related
      events (SREs) (defined as pathological fractures, surgery/radiotherapy to bone, spinal cord
      compression and hypercalcaemia). Maintaining QoL while avoiding or delaying SREs are the main
      goals of therapy. Patients therefore receive bone-targeted agents (e.g. pamidronate,
      zoledronate and denosumab) which are typically given every 4 weeks. However, this 4 week
      dosing is based on convenience so the treatment could be given concurrently with
      chemotherapy. The half-life of these drugs in the bone is many months or even years. Hence
      studies have been performed evaluating 12-weekly therapy. These have confirmed similar
      palliative outcomes in the 4 vs 12-weekly groups for both breast and prostate cancer
      patients. However, there remains clinical equipoise about which dosing interval physicians
      prescribe. The current trial will compare these two schedules of bone-targeting agents (12-
      vs. 4-weekly) to evaluate quality of life, pain and skeletal events within the Canadian
      Health Care System. This study will use an "integrated consent model" that involves "oral
      consent" rather than a written informed consent writing process as the study is comparing
      standard schedules and not a new administration schedule.
