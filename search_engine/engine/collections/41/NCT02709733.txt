      schizophrenia (SZ). Despite significant advances in our understanding and treatment of the
      illness, effective therapeutic strategies for motivational deficits have remained elusive.
      This has ultimately hindered our ability to promote recovery for individuals with SZ so that
      they can return to their premorbid level of functioning. An emerging therapeutic approach in
      SZ has utilized computerized remediation strategies, with recent efforts focused on cognitive
      deficits. To date, however, such a therapeutic strategy has not been developed for the
      critical motivational deficits in SZ. In light of the detrimental functional consequences of
      motivational deficits in SZ, there is a clear need for effective therapeutic strategies for
      the treatment of these motivational deficits experienced by affected individuals. To address
      this unmet therapeutic need, this pilot therapeutic trial will investigate the efficacy of a
      novel virtual reality-based motivation rehabilitation program in schizophrenia.
