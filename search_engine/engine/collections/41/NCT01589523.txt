      neonatal cholestasis and fat-soluble vitamin malabsorption. Although there is extensive
      experience with metabolic defects in the biosynthetic pathway, few patients have identified
      with defects in conjugation with taurine or glycine that allows bile acids to become
      effective detergents. This protocol is designed to study the effect of defects of conjugation
      of bile acids on growth and fat-soluble vitamin malabsorption. Study subjects will have liver
      function studies performed, serum and urinary bile acid measurements, vitamin levels, growth
      measurements, bile acid pool size measurements made by stable isotope dilution
      mass-spectrometry, and measurements of absorption of two fat-soluble vitamins, tocopherol and
      vitamin D. Subjects will be treated orally with conjugates of cholic acid with follow-up
      laboratories performed as an outpatient and then subjects will have all of the initial
      studies repeated during an inpatient stay 3-12 months after starting treatment. Subjects with
      previous liver biopsies indicating the presence of significant liver disease will have a
      repeat liver biopsy after 3-12 months treatment to assess the histologic response to
      treatment.
