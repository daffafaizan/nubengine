      Core biopsy to a suspicious axillary lymph node.

      Presently there is no possibility to identify the examined gland at the surgery. If the gland
      was infected it's most important to remove it.

      The only technique that exists today is marking with a metal clip and the use of this
      technique is not profit, partly because of technical difficulties.

      In this trial the investigator will use a special ink which will be injected to the axillary
      lymph node during the biopsy and latter on the surgery the investigator will try to assess
      the ability to identify the marked gland.
