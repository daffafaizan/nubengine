      population. Our most recent research with children who have univentricular heart indicates
      that gross motor skill and psychosocial factors are significant correlates of PAP. Important
      psychosocial factors include self-efficacy for activity, uncertainty about activity, and
      inaccurate perceptions of the child's PAP level, options, and abilities. This study seeks to
      determine whether gross motor skill and psychosocial factors influence PAP among children
      with a broad spectrum of cardiac defects. It will also determine the optimal changes to
      clinical care needed to encourage children with heart defects to develop health-related
      active lifestyles.

      We propose a prospective, randomized, cross-over preliminary clinical trial utilizing both
      quantitative and qualitative assessments. Through the cross-over design, each subject will
      complete both interventions (information, demonstration), with the order of intervention
      delivery randomly determined. Quantitative assessments will document moderate-to-vigorous
      physical activity (MVPA), gross motor skill, and health-related fitness. Qualitative
      assessments will evaluate parent/child anxiety about PAP and psychosocial factors influencing
      PAP. All factors will be assessed at each data collection point.
