    
      Objects: Phase II study

      Primary Objective :

      To evaluate the efficacy of combination of afatinib and weekly paclitaxel as assessed by
      pathologicalresponse in the residual tumor.

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. Efficacy of afatinib as assessed by the ultrasound of the breast.

        2. Adverse effect of afatinib monotherapy and the combination of afatinib and weekly
           paclitaxel.

        3. Correlation between baseline potential biomarkers and radiological response of afatinib
           monotherapy.

        4. Correlation between down- or up-regulation of potential biomarkers (in pre-treatment
           biopsy and surgical specimen) and radiological response to afatinib and paclitaxel.

        5. To identify the pharmacodynamic biomarkers, the following translational researches will
           be carried out on initial tumor biopsy and surgical specimen.

        6. To evaluate the dynamic changes of circulating tumor cells and cell-free DNA after
           afatinib monotherapy and after the combination of afatinib and weekly paclitaxel.
