      relaxation (PIR) technique, Isolytic Stretching Group (ISG) participants will perform a a
      PSSE with isolytic stretching technique and Static Stretching Group Group (SSG) participants
      will perform a PSSE with static stretching technique. All exercises will be performed in the
      modified crossbody position, for 5 times a week total of 6 weeks. Subacromial space,
      posterior capsule and muscle tendon thicknesses will be measured using a 7-12 MHz linear
      transducer with USG (LOGIQ e Ultrasound, GE Healthcare, USA). Athletes' GIRD results and
      rotational ROM measurements and Posterior shoulder tightness will be measured and recorded
      using a bubble inclinometer (Fabrication End Inc, New York, USA). Scapula kinematics
      (posterior tilt, upward rotation) will be evaluated with a digital inclinometer. Shoulder and
      scapular muscles will be evaluated with hend held dynamometer. Tightness of Levator scapulae
      and pectoralis minor will be assessed. The upper extremity functional performance of the
      athletes will be evaluated with the Functional Throwing Performance Index (FTPI). Evaluations
      will be performed before training program and repeated after 6 weeks of training, and at the
      1st, 3th and 6th months after training program is completed and the effects of different
      muscle energy techniques (MET) will be compared. Investigators hypothesized 6 weeks of PSSE
      with different MET would have different effects on Acromio-Humeral Distance, posterior
      capsule thickness, muscle tendon thickness, rotational ROM measurements, scapula kinematics,
      muscle strength, posterior shoulder tightness and performance on overhead athletes with GIRD
      and the effects of MET would be superior to static stretching.
