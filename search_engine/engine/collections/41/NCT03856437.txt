    
      The goal of this study is to determine the effects of message framing (gain vs. loss) on
      African American parents' acceptance of the HPV vaccine and how such effects are moderated by
      parents' salient beliefs prior to message exposure. Participants recruited from local
      communities and online panels will complete a computer-assisted survey. In the survey
      participants will first answer questions related to their beliefs about HPV and the HPV
      vaccine (e.g., perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived efficacy, perceived
      safety, etc.), as well as other background information. Then they will be presented with
      either a gain-framed or loss-framed human papillomavirus vaccination message. After the
      message exposure, they will answer questions related to their attitudes toward HPV
      vaccination, intentions to vaccinate their children, as well as other message response
      measures. Eligible participants are at least 21 years old, self-identify as African American,
      and are custodial parents or caretakers of at least one child ages 9-17 who has not initiated
      the HPV vaccine series.
