      investigate the effect of oxytocin treatment on attentional processing of emotional faces.
      Subjects complete questionnaires in Chinese versions before treatment administration,
      including the Beck Depression Inventory, Autism Spectrum Quotient , Trait Anxiety Inventory,
      Toronto Alexithymia Scale, Multidimentional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness. This
      experiment consists of two tasks including Emotional Face Cue-target Task and Visual Search
      Task. In the first task, subjects need to make a response to judge the position of target
      after a cue-target is presented. In the second task, subjects are asked to search the target
      "U" or inverted "U" placed on the nose of emotional/neutral faces and make an choices based
      on their oorientation. During these phases, subjects' response accuracy, response time and
      electrophysiological activity (ERP) are recorded.
