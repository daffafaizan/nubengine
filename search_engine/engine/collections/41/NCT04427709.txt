    
      This is a single site study at Wake Forest School of Medicine. Healthy volunteers and
      patients with advanced knee arthritis being seen in the Orthopedic Clinic in consultation for
      potential total knee arthroplasty will be recruited after their doctor visit if the decision
      is made not to perform surgery at this time.

      Study participants will come to the Pain Clinical Research Unit on 2 occasions. On these
      visits, they will receive an intramuscular (i.m.) injection of placebo or oxytocin, 25
      micrograms (μg) (Pitocin®), obtained from the research pharmacy. The order in this cross-over
      study will be randomized and double blind, and the studies separated by at least 48 hours.
      Every 2.5 minutes beginning 20 minutes before injection and until 180 minutes after injection
      oscillation in pupil diameter at low frequency (hippus) will be obtained using an infrared
      pupilometer, in which they focus on a central point of gaze for 20 seconds. Hippus, a measure
      of parasympathetic output to the pupil and affected by central actions of oxytocin as
      described in preliminary data, will be calculated as the magnitude of power in the 0-0.25
      Hertz (Hz) bin of the spectral analysis of pupil diameter, after removing blink and saccade
      artifacts. After 180 minutes the study participant will be discharged from the Pain Clinical
      Research Unit.
