    
      The aim of this study is to evaluate if automated adjustment of oxygen (with FreeO2 device)
      can reduce the hospital length of stay for acute exacerbation of COPD with comparison of
      manual oxygen titration.

      Patients with severe acute exacerbation of COPD requiring hospitalization will be included in
      this randomized controlled study and will be managed with either manual oxygen titration or
      automated oxygen titration (FreeO2 arm).

      The impact on the hospital length of stay will be evaluated.
