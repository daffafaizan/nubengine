      insular cortex. Few studies have examined the possibility of using repetitive Transcranial
      Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) for nicotine addiction and none so far have explored the use of a
      coil that specifically targets the insular region. The objective of this study is to test
      whether low and high-frequency rTMS of the insula modulates striatal dopamine (DA) release in
      healthy humans. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) with [11C]-(+)-PHNO, a radiotracer which
      is very sensitive to fluctuations in DA transmission in the human brain, will be used to
      assess the impact of rTMS on dopamine levels. This project will yield the first data in
      humans linking the insula to the DA system in vivo. These findings could lead to the
      identification of optimal parameters for Deep rTMS to use secondarily in a proof of principle
      clinical study in smokers.
