    
      Patients who undergo painless colonoscopy from May 1, 2019 to December 30, 2019.Inclusion
      Criteria: Age 18 years; ASA grade I - III level; Obtain informed consent. Exclusion
      Criteria:Age < 18 years; Allergic to the medicine used; Poor control of hypertension;
      Patients with hypovolemic or hypotension (systolic blood pressure < 80mmHg, or mean arterial
      pressure < 50mmHg); Severe sinus bradycardia (HR < 50 times/min) or atrioventricular block;
      Severe limited left ventricular function (EF<30%); Impaired renal function (GFR< 15ml/min) or
      requiring dialysis; Impaired liver function or drug abuse; Withdrawal criteria: patients
      required to withdraw. After inclusion, patients will be randomized to two groups: Propofol
      group: propofol is used as a sedative strategy: 2-5 mg/kg.h propofol during the whole
      colonoscopy; Dexmedetomidine group: Dexmedetomidine as a sedative strategy: 0.1mcg/kg
      continuous infusion for 15min, 0.7-1mcg/kg.h during the whole colonoscopy. The primary
      outcomes: 1. Patient's comfort score; 2. the incidence of adverse events. The secondary
      outcomes: 1. Patient's pain score; 2. Satisfaction score of endoscopists. This study aims to
      investigate whether dexmedetomidine is effectively and safely in Painless Colonoscopy, and
      improve the comfortable and safety of Painless Colonoscopy.
