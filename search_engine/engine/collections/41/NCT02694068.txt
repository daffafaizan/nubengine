      prospectively enrolled subjects. DNA will be analyzed from cohorts with data and DNA already
      collected and available, while prospective sites will collect plasma, DNA, and spent
      dialysate for further analysis. Clinical data related to the subjects' first ever Peritoneal
      Equilibrium Test (PET), demographic information, change in ultrafiltration capacity over
      time, will be correlated with various genetic markers of interest.

      Blood and dialysate will be collected at the first study visit, and there will be no
      additional sample collection. These samples will be collected as part of a PET during a
      standard of care study visit, or during a timed 4 hour dwell of 2.5% or 4.25% dextrose
      solution. Annually, subjects will either undergo a PET as standard of care or perform an
      additional 4 hour dwell as part of the study. These subsequent measures will be utilized to
      determine change in ultrafiltration capacity over time.

      This study has two specific aims:

      Aim 1: To identify and validate genetic loci that influence the peritoneal solute transfer
      rate (PSTR) at start of PD.

      Aim 2: To identify and validate genetic loci in pre-specified biologic pathways with change
      in peritoneal ultrafiltration capacity.

      If subjects grant permission, Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) results may be
      transferred to the NIH database of genotypes and phenotypes (dbGaP). Additionally, subjects
      may agree that remaining samples will be maintained at the University of Washington Kidney
      Research Institute in a repository for use in future research studies.
