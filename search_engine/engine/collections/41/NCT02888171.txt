      in reducing serum phosphorus and fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) concentrations and
      increasing iron stores and hemoglobin in individuals with non-dialysis-dependent CKD who have
      iron-deficiency anemia. This may prove to be advantageous in individuals with pre-dialysis
      CKD who require iron supplementation for iron-deficiency anemia. This is because ferric
      citrate may not only restore iron stores in individuals who are iron deficient, but by
      lowering FGF23 concentrations, ferric citrate may increase local and systemic concentrations
      of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, a powerful inhibitor of hepcidin synthesis, potentially
      attenuating the increase in hepcidin following oral iron supplementation. When compared to
      standard iron supplementation therapies (e.g., oral ferrous sulfate) that powerfully
      stimulate hepcidin secretion, this may then allow for greater iron bioavailability by
      increasing iron absorption in the gut while also reducing the degree of iron sequestration in
      reticuloendothelial system stores. However, little is known about the comparative
      effectiveness of treatment with oral ferric citrate vs. oral ferrous sulfate (currently the
      standard of care) in increasing iron stores and hemoglobin in iron-deficient CKD patients. If
      ferric citrate is shown to not only improve overall iron status, but also partially mitigate
      the long-term effects of iron supplementation on hepcidin secretion by increasing
      endogenously produced 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, this may indicate that ferric citrate can
      provide superior short- and long-term effects on iron-restricted erythropoiesis in CKD as
      compared to the current standard of care. The main objectives of the study are to compare the
      impact of ferric citrate compared to standard of care ferrous sulfate on serum iron, percent
      transferrin saturation (TSAT), ferritin, hemoglobin and hepcidin concentrations in
      individuals with moderate to severe CKD and absolute iron deficiency.
