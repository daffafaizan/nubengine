      subtalar strapping in knee osteoarthritis treatment. Fifty-eight patients with knee
      osteoarthritis were randomized to use either a lateral wedge or a neutral insole. VAS,
      Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) and Lequesne
      questionnaires were applied at baseline, and weeks two, eight, and 24.
