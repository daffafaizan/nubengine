      is investigator initiated study.This trial will be done at St Louis University ALS clinic.
      ALS patients will be screened for depression using Beck depression inventory (BDI-II) scale.
      A mental healthcare provider will evaluate the patients scoring 19 or above, before inclusion
      in the study. Quality of Life (QOL) assessment by questionnaire (McGill) and ALS functional
      rating scale (ALS-FRS) measurement will be done at the baseline. Then these patients will be
      allocated into two treatment groups to receive either TCA or SSRI medication for 12 weeks
      based on the clinical judgment (non-randomized). Patients will require clinical encounters
      every 4 weeks and telephone encounters in between the visits to assess the effectiveness of
      medication and tolerability of the side effects if any. If any patient endorses active
      suicidal ideation on any of these assessments, he/she will be immediately sent to the ER for
      appropriate management. At 4, 8 and 12-week clinic visits, repeat BDI, QOL and ALS-FRS
      measurement will be done on each patient from both groups and used in the data analysis.
