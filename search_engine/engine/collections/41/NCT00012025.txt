        -  Determine the complete and partial objective response rate and duration of response in
           women with metastatic breast cancer who have failed aromatase inhibitor therapy treated
           with fulvestrant.

        -  Determine the time to disease progression and overall survival of women treated with
           this drug.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this drug in these women.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive fulvestrant intramuscularly on day 1. Courses repeat approximately
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 5 years or until disease progression. After disease
      progression, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3
      years.
