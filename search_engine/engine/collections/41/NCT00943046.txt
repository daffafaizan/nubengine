      complications which are related to the leads. The assessment of efficacy of the SIELLO
      pacemaker leads is based on the collection of standard electrical lead data during the
      implant and follow-up procedures. Subsequent to the implantation of the SIELLO leads,five
      follow-up visits have been scheduled: at pre-discharge and after 1, 3, 6 and 12 months.
