      control during the interictal waking and sleep states, as well as during the ictal/peri-ictal
      periods, are associated with SUDEP-7 score risk profiles in refractory epilepsy patients, and
      to translate these measures into tools for risk-stratification and preventative strategies
      for SUDEP.
