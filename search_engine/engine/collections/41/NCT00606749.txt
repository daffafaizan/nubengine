      of KC706 is associated with prevention of the development of lesions in a mouse model of PV.
      Patients participating in this study will be those with active disease in spite of ongoing
      treatment with corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressive agents. The dose chosen for this
      clinical study is 300 mg once daily. The primary assessment of interest will be pemphigus
      lesion status during dosing with KC706.
