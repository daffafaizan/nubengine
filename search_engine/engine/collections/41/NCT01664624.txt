    
      This is a study to evaluate the antiglycemic efficacy and safety of roflumilast + alogliptin
      compared to alogliptin alone and roflumilast alone; it will also include an open-label
      exenatide treatment arm as a control. The antiglycemic efficacy of the combination will be
      evaluated through the measurement of postprandial active GLP-1 level, ÃŸ cell secretion
      activity (via the measurement of C-peptide and insulin levels), appetite sensations (as
      assessed by VAS) and glycemic control as assessed by a continuous glucose monitoring system
      (CGMS).
