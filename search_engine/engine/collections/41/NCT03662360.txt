      families, doctors and for patients the same.

      In absence of the universally recognized guidelines, the standard treatment involves the use
      of psychotropic drugs (typical / atypical neuroleptics, antidepressants, benzodiazepines)
      that are often not very effective and involve a series of side effects such as sedation,
      slowing down -motor with impaired cognitive performance, cardiac electrical changes and
      extrapyramidal syndrome. In view of this, it is important to find an alternative methods of
      treatment, which can reduce psychological and behavioral disorders and at the same time the
      use of psychotropic drugs.

      As for aromatherapy, ie the therapeutic use of natural essential oils, there is a
      decades-long clinical experience, especially in France, which is accompanied by increasing
      scientific evidence with considerable increase in publications in its use in psychological
      disorders and dementia behavior related. Based on the scientific publications available, it
      was therefore decided to use two essential oils (Citrus sinensis, Lavandula angustifolia) in
      environmental diffusion in the Geriatric Department of the Clinica Luganese Moncucco.
