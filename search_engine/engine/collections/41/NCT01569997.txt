    
      This is a multicentre, cluster randomized study comparing two parallel groups:

        -  Intervention group: nursing homes whose residents benefit from MDTM to identify the
           cases of dementia and to propose an adequate care project

        -  Control group: nursing homes whose residents continue to benefit from usual care In each
           group, 1000 elderly subjects aged over 60 years without documented diagnosis of dementia
           will be included and monitored for a period of 18 months.

      Information about the main and secondary aims will be collected monthly through online
      questionnaires.
