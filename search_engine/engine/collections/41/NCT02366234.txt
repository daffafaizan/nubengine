      is known in literature about this specific type of avulsion fracture and the treatment. Some
      surgeons recommend a cast for 4 to 6 weeks while others treat their patients with a removable
      brace. The only non-union reported in literature is Jonssen who published a case in 1990
      about a non-union of a tubercle fracture in a patient with repeated trauma. Kraus et al
      studied 81 cases of acute scaphoid fractures and found 4 cases of tubercle avulsion fractures
      in this group. We suspect some patients will not seek care for this condition as it hurts for
      a bit and then causes no problems.
