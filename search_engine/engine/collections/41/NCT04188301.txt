      onchocerciasis when it is administered after pre-treatment with IVM to clear or greatly
      reduce microfilariae from the skin and eyes. Widespread use of IDA following IVM pretreatment
      (I/IDA) has the potential to greatly accelerate elimination of lymphatic filariasis (LF) in
      African countries that are co-endemic for LF and onchocerciasis. study later.

      This study will also assess the efficacy of IDA for killing and sterilizing adult filarial
      worms. An improved macrofilaricidal treatment would be a major advance for the global program
      to eliminate onchocerciasis. Since the safety and efficacy objectives are both very
      important, we have included dual primary objectives for the study.

      Primary objectives:

        -  Safety: To compare rates and types of severe adverse events (grade 3 or higher) that
           occur within 7 days following 1 day or 3 days of treatment with triple drug treatment
           ("IDA" = diethylcarbamazine (DEC) with ivermectin (IVM) and albendazole (ALB)) with the
           comparator regimen of 1 day of treatment with ivermectin and albendazole (IA) in persons
           with active Onchocerca volvulus infections after pretreatment with ivermectin alone.

        -  Efficacy: To compare the effect of three treatment regimens (1 day of IDA, 3 days of
           IDA, or IA) for killing or sterilizing adult female O. volvulus worms based on the
           percentage of all adult female worms in nodules that are alive with embryos in the
           uterus 18 months after treatment.

      This is an open label, randomized clinical trial.
