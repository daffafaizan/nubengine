      screening who are average-risk for CRC. With every campaign, the investigators attempt to
      improve the return rates for patients receiving the FIT Kits. For the current campaign, all
      patients enrolled will receive usual care and the investigators are delivering an automated
      phone call to half the eligible patients reminding them to return their FIT kits and
      prompting them to request a new kit if needed. The investigators will investigate if this
      intervention increases the number of patients who complete the mailed Fit Kit or any type of
      CRC screening over a 6-month follow up period. This quality improvement project will help the
      investigators improve the processes of care for the patients, and community. If this phone
      call is successful the investigators will likely expand it to the entire population in future
      FIT Kit mailer campaigns. However, if it is not effective this will help the investigators
      minimize the number of calls/interventions the investigators send to patients and will
      hopefully allow for more useful outreach to patients in the future.
