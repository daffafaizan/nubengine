      quality of life (HR-QoL). Assessing HR-QoL with a disease- and site-specific HR-QoL is more
      advantageous than generic scales. In that concept, to our knowledge, there is not any
      osteoarthritis- and lower limb-specific HR-QoL instrument to use in Turkey. Mini-OAKHQoL was
      derived from the OAKHQoL questionnaire, which was developed to assess the quality of life
      (QoL) in subjects with lower limb osteoarthritis. Its good psychometric properties have
      recently been shown and validation studies have been done in several populations.
      Mini-OAKHQoL's validation study has not been done before in Turkey. The aim is to investigate
      the validity and reliability of the Turkish version of the Mini-OAKHQoL. Patients diagnosed
      with knee or hip osteoarthritis were recruited. For cross-cultural adaptation, items of
      Mini-OAKHQoL were selected from the interrelated Turkish version of the OAKHQoL study in
      which the adaptation process had already done. Missing data, floor effect, and ceiling effect
      were calculated. Reliability analysis with internal consistency and test-retest reliability
      were discovered. Face, content, convergent, and divergent validities were applied.
