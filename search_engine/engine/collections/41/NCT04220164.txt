      therefore it is beneficial to prevent the risk of ASCVD by controlling the prevalence of
      hyperlipidemia. According to CEPHEUS Pan-Asia survey, the rate of LDL goal attainment in
      hyperlipidemic patients of Taiwan was suboptimal, especially in high-risk patients. 2017
      Taiwan lipid guideline for high-risk patients has been published and clearly defined the
      treatment goal of blood LDL-C for high-risk patients. Besides, Taipei MacKay Memorial
      Hospital will establish a Lipid Clinic for hyperlipidemic patients. In this Lipid Clinic, the
      physician will discuss with each individual patient and set an individualized LDL goal
      according to current guideline and regulation of National Health Insurance Administration
      (NHIA). The aim of this study is to observe blood lipid outcomes in patients who receive
      treatment in Lipid Clinic of Taipei MacKay Memorial Hospital.
