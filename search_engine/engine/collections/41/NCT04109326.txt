      counseling whilst hospitalization and at home during the 26-week duration of adjuvant
      treatment

      The experimental program will include:

        -  8 PA sessions supervised at the hospital centers and 44 unsupervised home sessions, to
           be performed twice a week.

        -  6 consultations for nutrition education to teach the principles of well balanced diet,
           to foster weigh control during treatment, and to induce appropriate feeding behaviors
           after treatment.
