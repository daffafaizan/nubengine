      receive arsenic trioxide combined with induction chemotherapy while control group receive
      conventional induction chemotherapy alone. The 3 year overall survival rate (OS) and
      progression free survival (PFS), as well as incidence of adverse events, will be compared
      between two groups. Patients are followed every 3 months in the first year, every 6 months in
      the second year, and then annually thereafter.
