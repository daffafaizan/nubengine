      and early adjustment group (EA group). Voriconazole plasma levels will be measured on day 1
      (both peak and trough levels), day 3, day 5, day 10, and day 14 (all trough levels). For CA
      group patients, voriconazole dosage will be adjusted according to the trough levels of day 5
      (steady-state level). Predefined dose adjustment protocol will be used (< 1 µg/ml: 50%
      increase, 1~5.5 µg/ml: no change, > 5.5 µg/ml: 50% decrease). For EA group patients,
      voriconazole dosage will be adjusted according to the each measurements of voriconazole
      levels from day 1. Adjusted dosage will be calculated using the NONMEN software. The target
      range of trough level is between 1.0 µg/ml and 5.5 µg/ml. The appropriateness of voriconazole
      level (day 5, day 10, and day 14), mortality, ICU stay, and the frequency of
      voriconazole-related adverse events will be compared. CYP2C19 polymorphism will be analyzed
      for all patients.
