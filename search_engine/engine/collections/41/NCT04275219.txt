    
      This is a multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. A total
      of 218 patients will be recruited and randomly assigned to the experimental group (EG) or the
      control group (CG) in a 1:1 ratio. The treatment course will be 10-12 consecutive days, with
      a 90±7-day follow-up. The primary outcome is the all-cause mortality rate and the mortality
      of pneumonia at the 90±7-day follow-up. Secondary outcomes include changes in the gut
      microbiota; changes in the NIHSS score, BI index, mRS score, and Stroke-Specific Quality of
      Life scale (SS-QOL) score; and so on.
