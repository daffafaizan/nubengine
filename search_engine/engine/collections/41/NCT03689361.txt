      the diagnosis on these clinical criteria alone proves difficult in the acute phase. Added to
      this difficulty, the symptomatology of a migraine aura can sometimes be similar to that of a
      stroke, so a diagnosis can be poorly established, resulting in poor patient care. The
      possibility of making the positive diagnosis of migraine aura on a routine MRI sequence, T2
      *, would be an important advance for the management of these patients
