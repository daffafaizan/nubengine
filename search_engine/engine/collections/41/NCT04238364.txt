      pharmacokinetics of single and multiple doses of EI1071 when administered to healthy adult
      volunteers. This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, ascending dose,
      multi-cohort trial. Approximately 50 healthy volunteers will be enrolled in up to 7 cohorts.
      The study will be conducted in two phases: A single ascending dose (SAD) phase, followed by a
      multiple ascending dose (MAD) phase. In SAD, participants in Cohorts 1 - 5 will receive one
      dose of EI1071 or placebo. In MAD, participants in Cohorts 1 and 2 will receive multiple
      doses of EI1071 or placebo for 14 consecutive days. In both phases, sequential cohorts will
      be exposed to increasing doses of EI1071.
