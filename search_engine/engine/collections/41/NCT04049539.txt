      I. To demonstrate the safety and estimate the efficacy of liposome-encapsulated
      daunorubicin-cytarabine (Vyxeos) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients who have failed to
      achieve a hypocellular marrow after an initial course of 7+3.

      SECONDARY AND/OR EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determination of rate of morphologic leukemia-free state (MLFS). II. Determination of
      progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) at 2 years.

      III. Mass cytometric measurement relative clearance of quiescent leukemia stem/repopulating
      cells (LSCs) and blasts as compared to the same patient's preceding cycle of 7+3 and to a
      separate control population receiving re-induction with traditional 7+3.

      IIIa. Measurement of blast cell cycle fraction before and after Vyxeos treatment.

      IIIb. Relative clearance immunophenotypically abnormal blast and stem cells after Vyxeos.

      IIIc. Comparison of efficacy of blast cell and LSC elimination in patients receiving Vyxeos
      re-induction compared to similar blast cells and LSCs in patients receiving standard 7+3 or
      5+2 re-induction.

      OUTLINE:

      Within 14-26 days after the start of previous cycle of chemotherapy, patients receive
      liposome-encapsulated daunorubicin-cytarabine intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes on days 1,
      3, and 5 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up weekly for 60 days, then at
      least monthly for 2 years.
