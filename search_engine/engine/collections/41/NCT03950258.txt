    
      Intracranial arteriovenous shunts (ICAVS) in young children are characterized by frequent
      high-flow fistulas. In association with high-flow fistulas and the physiological condition of
      the developing brain and heart, each ICAVS type tends to present at a certain age with unique
      symptoms.

      Vein of Galen aneurysmal malformation (VGAM) and dural sinus malformation with arteriovenous
      (AV) shunt tend to present in the neonate with high output cardiac failure. In infancy, VGAM,
      pial arteriovenous fistula (AVF) and infantile dural AVF (DAVF) tend to present with
      hydrodynamic disorder such as macrocephaly, ventriculomegaly, prominent facial veins, and
      developmental delay.

      Pial AVF, AV malformation, and infantile DAVF can present with focal neurological signs such
      as seizure or hemorrhage at older ages they are in the subpial space, as opposed to VGAM or
      DAVF, which are extrapial in location and tend to present with systemic symptoms .

      Endovascular treatment is currently the first choice of treatment for most pediatric ICAVS.
      The treatment goal should be defined on a patient-by-patient basis, according to the unique
      physiological condition of the child.
