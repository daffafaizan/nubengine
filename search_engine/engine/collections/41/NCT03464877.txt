      sessions (pre- and post- exercise program). At the initial evaluation, subjects completed
      forms and questionnaires on sociodemographics, symptomatology, comorbidities, work
      restrictions, pain and functional limitations and fear-avoidance beliefs. A physiotherapist
      measured their lumbar and hip mobility, conducted diagnostic and pain provocation tests and
      assessed endurance of the trunk muscles. Following the initial evaluation, subjects took part
      in the 6-week multi-station full-body supervised exercise program (2 to 3 sessions per week).
      The Oswestry disability questionnaire (ODI) was completed at the initial and at the final
      evaluations. The change in ODI score following the program was considered the principal
      measure reflecting favorable or unfavorable outcome.

      An improvement of 50% in the initial ODI score was considered the reference standard to
      determine a favorable outcome. Univariate associations with favorable outcome were tested
      using chi-square or paired t-tests. Variables that showed between-group
      (favorable/unfavorable) differences were entered into a logistic regression after determining
      the sampling adequacy. Finally, continuous variables were dichotomized and the sensitivity,
      specificity and positive and negative likelihood ratios were determined for the model and for
      each variable.
