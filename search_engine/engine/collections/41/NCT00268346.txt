      Primary

        -  Explore the activity of single agent gefitinib, in terms of response rate, in a patient
           population with recurrent or metastatic esophageal or gastroesophageal junction cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Assess the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to prior treatment (yes vs no).

      Patients receive oral gefitinib once daily for at least 8 weeks in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 76 patients will be accrued for this study.
