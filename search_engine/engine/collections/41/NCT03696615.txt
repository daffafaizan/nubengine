      register large recruitment of the gluteal muscles, which are frequently weak in a patients
      suffering from low back pain. The Tabata protocol is a high-intensity training protocol in
      which subjects perform 20 seconds of all out effort (i.e. as many swings as possible),
      followed by 10 seconds of rest, repeated for a total of eight rounds. The rapid
      contraction-relaxation cycles utilized in the kettlebell swing are theorized to aid in the
      pumping out of muscle metabolites in the low back musculature, thus providing potential
      relief of chronic low back pain.
