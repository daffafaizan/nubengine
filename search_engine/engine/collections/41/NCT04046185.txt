      the initial treatment for early-stage disease is surgical staging with lymphadenectomy, it is
      apparently inappropriate for young patients who want to preserve fertility. Currently the
      standardize treatment for these patients are high-dose progesterone, which will be effective
      in approximately 40~70% patients. Mirena have been used recently as a new available treatment
      option, however, no concrete evidence shows it is more effective than the traditional
      progesterone treatment.

      PD-1 inhibitor has been utilized as a salvage treatment in many cancers including ovarian
      cancer, cervical cancer, lung cancer, gastric cancer and endometrial cancer. As endometrial
      cancer showed high microsatellite instability-high/deficient mismatch repair (MSI-H/dMMR)
      rates, it is assumed to be highly responsive to PD-1 inhibitor treatment. Published clinical
      trial results showed that PD-1 inhibitor treatment was effective in 6/24 late-stage
      endometrial cancer patients, with little or mild side effects. Here we want to investigate
      the efficacy of PD-1 inhibitor combined with progesterone in early stage endometrial cancer
      patients who want to preserve fertility.
