      despite increasing evidence demonstrating that there is no difference in effect between
      physiotherapy based- and surgical interventions. The target population for this study is
      patients suffering from rotator cuff tendinopathy waiting for subacromial decompression
      surgery at a university hospital in Norway. During this waiting period , study participants
      will be randomly assigned to standard follow up or a physiotherapy regimen in primary care.
      We want to compare the effect of a structured physiotherapy regimen consisting of heavy slow
      resistance exercises, stretching, manual mobilization and low level laser therapy to standard
      follow up.
