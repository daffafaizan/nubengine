      (tablets with no active ingredients) have been shown to improve symptoms of some medical
      conditions including fatigue. This study is being done to test the usefulness of taking
      placebos for improving cancer-related fatigue. In this study, the investigators are testing
      whether symptoms of fatigue will improve when people know they are taking a tablet with no
      active ingredients.

      This is a randomized study, which means the participant will be put into one of two groups.
      Because no one knows which of the study options is best, the participant will be 'randomized'
      into one of the two study groups. Randomization means that the participant will be put into a
      group by chance. It is like flipping a coin. Neither the participant nor the research doctor
      will choose what group he or she will be in. The participant will have an equal chance of
      being placed in each of the groups.
