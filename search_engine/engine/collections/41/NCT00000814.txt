      of viral resistance to the drug. Use of combination antiretroviral therapy can potentially
      reduce viral load and prevent emergence of multidrug resistance.

      In Stage 1 of the study, a minimum of 22 patients are randomized to each of three treatment
      arms: didanosine (ddI) plus AZT plus nevirapine (NVP); ddI plus AZT; and ddI plus NVP. After
      12 weeks of treatment, the study proceeds to Stage 2 provided at least 40 percent of patients
      in Stage 1 show a reduction of at least 40 percent from baseline ICD p24 antigen of greater
      than or equal to 70 pg/ml AND fewer than two patients experience grade 4 rash. Patients in
      Stage 1 continue treatment for an additional 36 weeks. In Stage 2, additional patients are
      randomized to each original treatment regimen until a maximum of 130 patients per arm have
      been entered. Stage 2 patients receive treatment for at least 48 weeks.

      AS PER AMENDMENT 02/12/97: As of 2/28/97, patients receiving study drugs will be offered
      blinded study drugs for an additional 16 weeks (until 6/30/97). Patients will be unblinded on
      or about 5/23/97.
