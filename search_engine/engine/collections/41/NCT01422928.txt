      adverse immune effects, as indicated by reduced biomarker levels and activity. RT has been
      observed to cause a striking reduction in total lymphocyte count, affecting mainly the
      T-cells. Furthermore, the reduction in the lymphocyte count after RT has been correlated with
      poorer outcome for bladder cancer, head and neck cancer, uterine cancer, and brain
      metastases.

      Research into the use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) has been conducted to
      determine the utility of these treatments in addressing the unmet needs of many patients with
      cancer. There is preliminary evidence that acupuncture, in particular, is successful at
      improving many cancer and treatment associated effects. Earlier studies have indicated that
      acupuncture can play a role in regulating immune system response to various morbidities,
      including chemotherapy induced immunosuppression. However, little research has examined is
      potential for radiation therapy patients

      This pilot study aims to assess a wide range of general immune biomarkers to identify
      biomarkers most affected by RT. Through use of a symptom assessment survey, changes in self
      reported symptoms will also be recorded. The feasibility of acupuncture as a strategy to
      ameliorate any adverse immune or symptom effects will also be examined. This information
      could be very useful in planning future studies on RT and the immune system, or the potential
      immune benefits of acupuncture.
