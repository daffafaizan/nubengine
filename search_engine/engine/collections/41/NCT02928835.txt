      of stretching exercises to improve flexibility and prevent soft tissue fibroses around the
      joint, thus, avoiding contractures and providing increases in the range of motion at the knee
      joint. Although knee manipulation and open arthrolysis may improve range of motion after
      total knee arthroplasty , the results have been variable and additional procedures are
      frequently necessary. Studies demonstrated the effectiveness of dynamic orthoses in reducing
      joint contractures after orthopedic surgeries in various joints that require a long
      rehabilitation period. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the
      effects of the knee flexion Dynasplint orthosis (KFD) on the length of rehabilitation and
      range of knee flexion angle after total knee arthroplasty.
