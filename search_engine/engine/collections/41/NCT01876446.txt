      I. To evaluate the 18-week progression free survival (PFS) rate of relapsed small cell lung
      cancer (SCLC) patients treated with NKTR-102 (pegylated irinotecan NKTR 102).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the objective response rate. II. To evaluate the duration of response. III. To
      evaluate the overall survival. IV. To evaluate the toxicity of NKTR-102 in this patient
      population.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore the correlation between UDP glucuronosyltransferase 1 family, polypeptide A
      cluster (UGTIA1) polymorphisms and NKTR-102 toxicities.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pegylated irinotecan NKTR 102 intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes on day 1.
      Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3
      months thereafter.
