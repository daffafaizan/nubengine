      Pennebaker. Individuals write on three days for about 20 minutes about particularly stressful
      experiences in their life. Several studies showed that expressive writing can have beneficial
      effects on the frequency of health care utilization and well-being. Particularly in patients
      with rheumatism, kidney cancer and posttraumatic stress disorder expressive writing showed an
      positive effect on subjective well-being. Furthermore, in several studies expressive writing
      showed a positive effect on immune parameters.

      As many studies suggest an important negative effect of stress on well-being and sperm
      parameters in male infertility, we want to investigate the effect of expressive writing in
      male infertility.The expressive writing condition is compared to a non emotional writing
      condition, in which individuals write about mainly non emotional topics such as time
      management. In this randomized-controlled trial subjects were allocated sequentially by block
      wise randomization (block size of 4). For randomization a computer generated random list was
      used. The allocation was concealed in a series of numbered sealed envelopes. The envelope was
      opened immediately before the first writing session.
