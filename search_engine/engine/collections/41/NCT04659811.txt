      I. To determine the efficacy of stereotactic radiation and pembrolizumab for treatment of
      recurrent meningioma compared to historical control based on progression free survival at 12
      months (PFS12).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To assess overall survival and further assess progression free survival of stereotactic
      radiation and pembrolizumab for treatment of recurrent meningioma.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess immune-related tumor effects pembrolizumab treatment in meningioma using
      magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in conjunction with assessment by Response Assessment in
      Neuro-Oncology Criteria (RANO) and Immunotherapy (i)RANO criteria.

      II. To assess neurocognitive function and quality of life with pembrolizumab and radiation
      using the Neurologic Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (NANO) Scale, and European Organisation for
      Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire brain tumour module
      (QLQ-BN20).

      III. To assess safety of the combined treatment modalities in meningioma, through evaluation
      of grade III adverse events (AEs) and dose-limiting toxicity (DLT).

      OUTLINE:

      Within -3 to 0 days from the start of stereotactic radiation therapy, patients receive
      pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1 and 22. Cycles repeat every 6
      weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo
      stereotactic radiosurgery on day 1 or days 1-5 of cycle 1 in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 12 weeks for
      2 years, and then every 6 months thereafter for up to 5 years.
