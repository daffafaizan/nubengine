      several studies. Spinal cord injury affects colorectal motility, transit times, and bowel
      emptying often leading to constipation, fecal incontinence or a combination of both. Although
      these symptoms are not life-threatening, they may have a severe impact on quality of life as
      well as increase levels of anxiety and depression.

      Various bowel management programs have been empirical, and individual solutions have been
      sought on a trial-and-error basis. Transanal irrigation has been used in selected patients
      with constipation or fecal incontinence. The majority of spinal cord injured patients in a
      recent study benefited from the treatment. However, there is limited evidence in the
      literature supporting any bowel management program in spinal cord injury in favor of another
      and well-designed controlled trials are still lacking. Therefore, the present study aims to
      compare transanal irrigation with conservative bowel management, defined as best supportive
      bowel care without irrigation, in a prospective, randomized, controlled, multicentre study
      among spinal cord injured patients with neurogenic bowel dysfunction.
