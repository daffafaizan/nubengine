      stroke/TIA attacks. Patients with carotid stenosis face an escalated risk of MI, PAD, and
      death. Treatments for patients with carotid plaque include lifestyle changes, medical
      management(such as control of hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and diabetes) and carotid
      revascularization(carotid endarterectomy or carotid artery stenting). Studies have suggested
      that plaque morphology and composition are important determinants of plaque stability, using
      serial MR imaging of the carotid artery allowed observation of changes in plaque composition.
      Contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) is a well accepted technique for detection of intraplaque
      neovascularization(IPN) in carotid atherosclerotic disease.

      The aim of this trial is to assess the safety and efficacy of SDT. The SDT can induce
      macrophage elimination and inhibiting matrix degradation, which will promote plaque lipid
      depletion, inflammation level decrease and changes in other plaque tissue components, leading
      to plaque stabilization and reduction.

      An estimated 80 eligible patients will be randomly divided into two groups: optimal medical
      care (OMC) combined with pseudo-SDT and OMC combined with SDT. Recruitment will be performed
      over 1 year and patients will be followed for 3 months; the anticipated total study duration
      will be 2 years.
