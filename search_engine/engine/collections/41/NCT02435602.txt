      squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Small, superficial, curable lesions are difficult to diagnose
      using only white light endoscopy. To improve detection chromoendoscopy is recommended. In
      this project patients are divided into two groups based on received chromoendoscopy (NBI
      versus Lugol). The results of two methods will be compare regarding positive predictive value
      to establish usage of chromoendoscopy in early detection of ESCC.
