      tubercle of the calcaneus, and 10% of the population will at some points in their life
      experience this condition. Accumulated loading of the plantar fascia seems to relate to
      development of PF, as it is commonly seen in runners and those who are overweight, and number
      of daily steps or simply time of standing has been shown to be a predisposing factor for PF
      development.

      Orthosis and glucocorticoid injections are 2 widely used treatments with proven effect.
      However treatment of overuse injury in other tendon/aponeurosis-like structures, has over the
      later years been dominated by an increasing documentation of a good curative effect of heavy
      controlled mechanical loading (eccentric strength exercises or heavy slow concentric strength
      training) upon tendinopathies in Achilles or patella tendon. However, no studies have looked
      at the influence of physical training (e.g. strength training) on the diseased plantar
      aponeurosis. Also no studies have looked at the effect of a combination of giving local
      glucocorticoid injection and training on this or other tendon overuse entities.

      We hypothesize that heavy strength training will have a positive effect upon PF, and that a
      combination of training and glucocorticoid injections will have an additive effect upon this
      disease and be even more effective than each of the treatments alone. Glucocorticoid
      injection acting as the standard control treatment.
