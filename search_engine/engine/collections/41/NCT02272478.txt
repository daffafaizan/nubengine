    
      AML18 is a trial primarily for older patients with AML and high risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome
      (MDS). It offers a randomised controlled Phase II/III trial which uses a factorial design for
      maximum efficiency to evaluate two induction options followed by treatment with small
      molecule beyond course 1, and dose intensification for patients without evidence of MRD
      negativity.

      There are five randomised comparisons within the trial:

        1. At diagnosis:

           For patients not known to have adverse risk cytogenetics DA chemotherapy plus a single
           dose of 3 mg/m2 of Mylotarg versus CPX-351. Patients with abnormal LFTs can enter the
           randomisation but receive DA alone or CPX-351.

        2. For patients who received DA chemotherapy but are not in CR or who are MRD +ve, or for
           whom MRD is not assessable.

           DA versus DAC versus FLAG-Ida

        3. All patients at second course who have received DA and have not received Vosaroxin and
           Decitabine induction AC220 versus no AC220 for a maximum of 3 cycles; then with or
           without maintenance for 1 year for patients allocated AC220

        4. For patients who are in CR or CRi and MRD -ve post course1 and have completed 2 courses
           of DA DA versus intermediate dose Cytarabine (IDAC)

        5. For patients who received CPX-351 chemotherapy but are not in CR or who are MRD +ve, or
           for whom MRD is not assessable CPX-351 100 units/m2 x 3 doses versus CPX-351 100
           units/m2 x 2 doses

      The trial will also assess:

        -  Non-intensive allogeneic stem cell transplant for patients with matched sibling or
           matched unrelated donors.

        -  The combination of Vosaroxin and Decitabine for those with known adverse risk
           cytogenetics at diagnosis
