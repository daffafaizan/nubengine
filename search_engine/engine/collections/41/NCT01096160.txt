      including systolic blood pressure (SBP) and aortic augmentation index (AIx), following
      multiple oral doses of MK-8266. Five serial panels, each consisting of eight participants (40
      participants in Panels A, B, C, D, and E), were randomized to receive either MK-8266 or
      matching placebo twice daily (BID) or three times daily (TID) for 10 consecutive days.
      Although the original plan was to evaluate MK-8266 treatment in Panels D and E using both BID
      and TID regimens, the study actually evaluated identical TID regimens in these panels.
