      underdeveloped countries which is generally accompanied by iron deficiency anemia and zinc
      deficiency. It has many consequences on the adult including limited capacity to work and
      higher risk of obesity and chronic disease. The present study will offer a fortified food,
      culturally accepted and locally produced. The effectiveness of this fortified food compared
      to lactose-free milk, in a controlled dose and with no risk to the health of the study
      participants, will be determined. Both will be distributed for free to be consumed as an
      atole or in liquid form, respectively, at a community level in an environment controlled as
      much as possible. This will allow to determine adherence, acceptability, consumption and
      distribution within the family.
