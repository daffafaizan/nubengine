      cardiovascular and metabolic systems, leading to a wide range of cardiovascular and metabolic
      disorders and side effects. Those are poorly described, due to the evolution of the
      anticancer pharmacopeia, and recent recognition of these adverse events. This study will
      investigate the potential benefits of a specialized cardio-oncology check-up and follow-up in
      this context.
