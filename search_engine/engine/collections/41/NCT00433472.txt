        -  Determine whether efaproxiral has a measurable effect on the brain as shown by T2 and/or
           T2* MRI in patients with recurrent or progressive malignant glioma enrolled on
           NABTT-9806.

        -  Determine predicted oxygenation changes based on observed T2 MRI changes in these
           patients.

        -  Determine the effects of this drug on T2 and T2* MRI relaxation times of normal areas of
           the brain in these patients.

        -  Determine baseline oxygen extraction ratios in tumors of patients treated with this
           drug.

        -  Determine whether administration of this drug reveals any new tumor- or
           non-tumor-related abnormalities on T2 and T2* MRI in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter, pilot study.

      Patients receive efaproxiral and carmustine on clinical trial NABTT-9806. During any one
      course of treatment on that study, patients undergo MRI before oxygen administration
      (baseline), before efaproxiral infusion, and then every 5 minutes until 1 hour after
      efaproxiral and carmustine treatment. Data is evaluated for extent and intensity of T2/T2*
      changes and oxygen concentration changes in both abnormal and normal brain.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-48 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-24
      months.
