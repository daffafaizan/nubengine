      and the seromuscular layer of the jejunum, and duct-to-mucosa suture. The clinical study
      about the various kinds of pancreatojejunostomy have been reported for the purpose of
      lowering the frequency of POPF; however, the frequency of more than grade B POPF is still
      around 10 to 20%. In soft pancreas cases with unexpanded pancreatic ducts, the risk is
      further elevated.

      The polyglycolic acid (PGA) felt is an absorbable suture reinforcing material. It is
      generally used to reinforce sutures of fragile tissues such as the lung, bronchi, liver, and
      gastrointestinal tract, and to reinforce a wide range of tissue defects. Regarding
      pancreatojejunostomy using a PGA felt, the incidence of POPF formation was decreased in some
      retrospective studies; on the other hand, no significant difference was found in other study.
      As described above, the pancreatojejunostomy aimed at reducing POPF is not established at
      present. We devised a new method using doubly PGA felt. This study is a multicenter,
      randomized phase III trial between Japan and Korea to verify the usefulness of this double
      coating of PGA felt.
