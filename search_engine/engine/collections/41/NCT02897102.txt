      known regarding the effects of these activities on cognition, motivation and quality of life
      in this population. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a structured
      program, which was based on abacus training associated with other activities, administered as
      weekly group classes over a 7 month period in older adults. Eighty-eight older adults were
      enrolled in an open-label controlled clinical trial to evaluate the effects of this training
      program on cognition, motivation and quality of life. Training had a significant effect over
      time; the training group maintained their level of performance on verbal learning and memory
      tasks, whereas the control group exhibited a significant decrease in performance from
      baseline to post-intervention. The subjects in the training group were more motivated to
      learn at study entry; however, the training had no significant effect on motivation or
      quality of life. Abacus training associated with other activities may benefit verbal learning
      and memory in older adults. Additional studies with longer follow-ups are necessary to
      determine whether the results of this training will have a positive effect on the lives of
      older adults.
