      signs and symptoms associated with central sensitization. Using a model of (innocuous,
      noxious and allodynia) PNE can be used in combination with exercise therapy, especially
      treating patients in which the nervous system has become increasingly hypervigilant. Teaching
      patients about the neuroscience of pain and lead to healthier and more positive attitudes and
      beliefs regarding chronic pain. Pain in diabetic neuropathy restrict the activity
      participation and compromise their quality of life. PNE will be helpful in such patients so
      decreasing pain can improve their quality of life.
