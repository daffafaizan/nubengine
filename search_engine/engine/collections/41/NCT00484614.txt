      has been called positron emission mammography, or "PEM," and the device used to perform the
      scan has been called a PEM Scanner. This protocol is designed as a prospective multi-center
      clinical trial to evaluate the role of high resolution PEM, used in combination with the
      radiotracer 2-[F-18]- fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), in pre-surgical planning in women with newly
      diagnosed breast cancer who are considered candidates for breast conserving surgery (i.e.
      lumpectomy) after full workup with mammography, clinical breast exam, and additional US as
      would normally be performed. Participants will undergo both contrast enhanced MRI and PEM
      imaging. In order to control for potential bias in interpretation of the second examination
      (i.e. PEM or MRI), the order of interpretation of these examinations will be randomly
      assigned at study entry.The primary objective of the study is to determine changes in
      surgical management resulting from PEM or MRI or both, separately and in conjunction with
      conventional imaging and to determine whether these changes were appropriate (i.e. to excise
      malignancy) or inappropriate (e.g. wider excision or mastectomy for what proved to be benign
      disease).
