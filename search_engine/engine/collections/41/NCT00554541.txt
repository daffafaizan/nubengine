      legs. Venous disease is more common in overweight patients, but little is known as to why
      this is the case. This research project is investigating the relationship between body weight
      and function of the leg veins using a special non-invasive technique known as venous
      plethysmography. We hope to investigate the reason for the relationship between body weight
      and higher risk of vein problems.

      Approximately 45 people will take part in this study. Patients will be recruited from among
      three groups: normal weight people, overweight people, and obese people.

      Resting ankle-brachial index will be measured in both lower extremities to exclude the
      presence of peripheral arterial disease. Venous physiologic study using air plethysmography
      with positional maneuvers will be performed. Parameters to be measured will be outflow time,
      passive draining and refill time, and exercise venous plethysmography. All studies will be
      performed with the Phlebotest system (Osborn Medical).

      All study procedures will be done during one visit, and no further follow-up is required.
