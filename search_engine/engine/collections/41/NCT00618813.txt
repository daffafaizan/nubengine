    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the feasibility and safety of adding interval-compressed vincristine, topotecan
      hydrochloride, and cyclophosphamide to a treatment protocol utilizing interval compression of
      vincristine, doxorubicin hydrochloride, cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, and etoposide in
      patients with localized Ewing sarcoma family of tumors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the event-free survival in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      INDUCTION THERAPY (WEEKS 1-12): Patients receive vincristine IV on day 1 in weeks 1, 2, 5, 6,
      9, 10, 11, and 12; topotecan hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1-5 in weeks 1 and 9;
      cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days 1-5 in weeks 1 and 9 and on day 1 in weeks 5 and 11;
      ifosfamide IV over 1 hour on days 1-5 in weeks 3 and 7; etoposide IV over 1 hour on days 1-5
      in weeks 3 and 7; and doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 15 minutes on days 1 and 2 in weeks 5
      and 11. Patients also receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) beginning 24-36 hours
      after the last dose of chemotherapy and continuing for at least 7 days or until blood counts
      recover, whichever comes last. Filgrastim is discontinued at least 24 hours prior to the next
      course of chemotherapy.

      LOCAL CONTROL: Patients who respond to induction therapy may undergo surgery alone if the
      lesion can be resected with negative margins and with a reasonable functional result
      beginning in week 13. Following surgery, patients with unresectable lesions or inadequate
      margins may receive radiotherapy during week 15. Patients with bulky lesions in surgically
      difficult sites such as the spine, skull, and periacetabular pelvis; poor response to
      induction chemotherapy; or those in whom surgery would result in unacceptable functional
      results may receive radiotherapy alone in weeks 13-19. Patients with bulky lesions in
      difficult sites and who do not have a good clinical and radiographic response to induction
      therapy may receive radiotherapy to the primary site during weeks 13-19 followed by surgery
      of the involved site during week 25 after recovery from course 11 of chemotherapy. Patients
      with microscopic residual disease after planned pre-operative radiotherapy will receive
      additional radiotherapy.

      CONTINUATION THERAPY (WEEKS 15-36): Patients receive vincristine IV on day 1 in weeks 15, 16,
      21-24, 27-30, 33, and 34; topotecan hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1-5 in weeks 15,
      21, and 29; cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days 1-5 in weeks 15, 21 and 29 and on day 1
      in weeks 23, 27, and 33; ifosfamide IV over 1 hour on days 1-5 in weeks 17, 19, 25, 31, and
      35; etoposide IV over 1 hour on days 1-5 in weeks 17, 19, 25, 31, and 35; and doxorubicin
      hydrochloride IV over 15 minutes on days 1 and 2 of weeks 23, 27, and 33. Patients also
      receive G-CSF SC as in induction therapy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 10 years.
