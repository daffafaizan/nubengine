      delivery. This technique brings about good maternal and neonatal outcomes as well as provides
      good postoperative pain control. Systematic review showed intrathecal morphine produced long
      period of pain control up to 27 hours. However, some patients still experienced moderate to
      severe pain which defined as postoperative pain score >,= 4. From our institute survey, there
      were more than 50 percents of patients undergoing cesarean delivery receiving spinal block
      with intrathecal morphine experienced moderate to severe pain in the first 24 hours. Failure
      in achieve adequate pain control results in poor maternal satisfaction, effect breast feeding
      and may lead to chronic wound pain.

      The aim of the study is to determine the actual incidence of patients whom experienced
      moderate to severe pain after spinal anesthesia with intrathecal morphine 200 mcg in cesarean
      delivery. Also, factors that may involved moderate to severe postoperative pain will be
      analyzed and reported.
