    
      5-year follow-up of two hospital-based patient cohorts (heart failure, metabolic
      comorbidities in CVD), recruited at baseline by the GANI_MED-project (Greifswald Approach to
      Individualized Medicine). Subjects will be comprehensively phenotypes using standardized
      protocols for the assessment of medical history, laboratory biomarkers, and the collection of
      various biosamples for bio-banking purposes. A multi-omics based biomarker assessment
      including genome-wide genotyping, transcriptome, metabolome, and proteome analyses
      complements the multi-level approach of GANI_MED. Comparisons with the general background
      population as characterized by the Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP) will be performed.
