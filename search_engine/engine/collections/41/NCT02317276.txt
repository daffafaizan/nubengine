      Weeks 0 (baseline), 2, 6 and 8 (Figure 1). At the first visit (baseline), patients who have
      met the screening eligibility criteria will be started on a stable TCS regimen for a total of
      two weeks. At the second visit (Week 2) following two weeks of therapy on stable TCS,
      patients will stop TCS and blood, serum, plasma and two 6mm punch biopsies (one lesional (L)
      and one non-lesional (NL) skin) will be obtained. At the third visit (Week 6), after four
      weeks receiving no TCS, the same sample collections will be repeated and the patients will
      then enter a two week safety follow up. At the end of the safety follow up (last visit, Week
      8) and after obtaining written informed consent by the patient, blood, serum and plasma
      samples mav be collected.
