      opiate dependent population on buprenorphine maintenance. Individuals who have already
      decided to undergo buprenorphine treatment in Project BEST will be invited to participate in
      the following data collection process. The investigators propose the following series of data
      collection to assess clients during their time in the cohort:

      GPRA, supplemental instrument, ASI, SCID, COWS, Urine toxicology.

      Patients who are enrolled will enter a standardized, manual based weekly counseling regimen.
      Urine toxicology will be performed a minimum of twice monthly, but will not occur at the same
      times monthly to decrease the probability of sampling error.

      This is a prospective cohort to follow a group of individuals on buprenorphine treatment. The
      goal of this prospective cohort is to generate thoughtful observations. Specific items of
      interest which will be compared with age, race matched historical controls on methadone will
      be:

        1. Changes in addiction severity over treatment time

        2. Changes in sexual risk behaviors and injection practices

        3. Improvements in urine toxicology

        4. Co-occurring mental illness
