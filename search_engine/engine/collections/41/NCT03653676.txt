      circulating systemic pro-inflammatory mediators and airway bronchoconstriction in SCA. The
      investigators hypothesize that regular exercise at moderate to vigorous intensity is safe for
      children with SCA and do not precipitate SCA-related symptoms. In this multicenter study, 70
      non-asthmatic children with SCA and 70 controls without SCA will first undergo a maximal
      cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET), then be randomized to an exercise challenge by
      controlled intensity interval training (CIIT) at either moderate or vigorous intensity (8
      exercise bouts at 50% or 70% peak workload, respectively). The Investigator's Aims are to: 1)
      Determine the influence of exercise intensity on the acute inflammatory response to exercise,
      defined by an increase in soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM) and other adhesion
      molecules, and 2) Define the effect of moderate to vigorous exercise on forced expiratory
      volume in 1 second (FEV1) and acute bronchoconstriction in children with SCA. The
      investigators will also explore exercise- induced changes in gene and microRNA expression in
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells, tissue oxygenation during exercise by near infrared
      spectroscopy as well as the role of hyperventilation in bronchoconstriction using eucapnic
      voluntary hyperventilation testing in a subset of participants.
