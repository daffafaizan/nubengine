      randomized, double-blind, and crossover protocol. After given written informed consent,
      baseline characteristics including physical examination, ECG, blood sample and a noninvasive
      assessment of endothelial function are obtained. The patients are randomly assigned to
      receive either ramipril 10mg (up-titration-scheme: starting with 2.5mg in Week1, then 5mg in
      Week2 followed by 2-5mg for the final 6 weeks) followed by placebo or vice versa.The
      individual disease-modifying antirheumatic drug therapy is continued throughout the study.
      The examinations are repeated after 8 weeks treatment of the first and 8 weeks after the
      second study drug. At week 1 and 2 in each treatment period a safety visit is scheduled.
