      to detect a difference of at least 25 percentage points in the closure rate between the oral
      ibuprofen and intravenous ibuprofen groups, assuming a closure rate of 65 percent with
      intravenous ibuprofen, with a p value of 0, 05 and a power of 80 percent.Patients
      (gestational age, 25 to 32 weeks) with echocardiographically confirmed patent ductus
      arteriosus and respiratory distress will randomly be assigned to receive one (10 mg / kg),
      two (10 mg / kg followed 24 hours after by 5 mg /kg) or three (10 mg / kg followed at 24-hour
      intervals by two doses of 5 mg /kg each) doses of either intravenous ibuprofen (group I, n =
      32) or oral ibuprofen (group O, n = 32), starting on the third day of life. The rate of
      ductal closure, side effects, complications, and the patients' clinical course will be
      recorded.
