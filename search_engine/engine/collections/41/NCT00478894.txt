    
      The purpose of this study is identify risk factors for signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis
      two and ten year post ACL reconstruction from information available at the time of surgery;
      including patient characteristics (age, gender, body mass index (BMI), activity level,
      clinical knee alignment), their injuries ("pop" heard at the time of injury, concurrent
      meniscus, articular cartilage, and collateral ligament injuries), and treatment decisions
      made during the initial surgery (e.g. meniscus and articular cartilage treatments.)

      Primary outcome measures will be the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis
      Index (WOMAC) pain and stiffness subscales and joint space width measured on weight-bearing
      radiographs.

      Secondary outcome measures will include the knee related quality of life subscale of the Knee
      Injury and Osteoarthritis Score (KOOS) and Kellgren-Lawrence grading from weight-bearing
      radiographs.
