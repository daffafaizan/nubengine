      port. The coolant ports of the ECD are connected to external heat exchanger while a third,
      central lumen simultaneously allows gastric decompression and drainage. The ECD can be
      inserted like a standard gastric tube.

      The aim of this prospective, interventional study is to quantify heat transfer during warming
      and cooling using the Esophageal Cooling Device in anesthetized patients having non-cardiac
      surgery.

      An esophageal heat exchange tube will be inserted in anesthetized surgical patients. Each
      will have 30 minutes of cooling (circulating fluid at 7 degrees C) and 30 minutes of warming
      (42 degrees C) with 15 -minute break in between; the order of the cooling and warming will be
      randomized. The primary outcome will be heat transfer, determined from inflow and outflow
      fluid temperatures and fluid flow rate assessed for both cooling and warming modes.
