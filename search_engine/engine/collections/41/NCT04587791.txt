    
      Twenty two male and female (ages 18-70) participants with comorbid opioid use disorder (OUD)
      and non-cancer chronic pain for at least 6 months, currently receiving methadone or
      buprenorphine, will be enrolled. Prior to their daily methadone or buprenorphine dose and
      thus at trough plasma levels of opioid, participants will receive oral CBD (400 mg, 800 mg,
      1200 mg) or placebo. Subsequently, all participants will undergo laboratory testing of
      opioid-related outcomes.

      Pain sensitivity will be measures including the well-validated Cold Pressor Test (CPT),
      Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST), the Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ) and a
      pain Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Attentional bias and cue-induced opioid craving will be
      measured using a visual probe task and the Heroin Craving Scale (HCQ-14). Negative affect
      will be measured using the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS). Cognitive
      performance will be measured by a comprehensive cognitive battery that includes the
      Continuous Performance Test (CPT) and the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (HVLT). The order of
      study medication administration will be counterbalanced order to minimize carryover effects.
      On the initial screening day and at the end of medication treatment, blood will be drawn to
      determine serum drug levels. Participants will be thoroughly evaluated by a physician prior
      to discharge on each experimental session. One week after the last study medication dose,
      participants will be conducted by phone for a follow-up session.
