      in the disease, have demonstrated to provide benefits to patients through multiple
      non-pharmacological interventions, among them fluid and salt restriction. Sodium restriction
      has a class I recommendation and evidence level C, that is, general agreement that the
      intervention is beneficial, useful and effective, evidenced by consensus, expert opinion,
      small studies, retrospective studies or registries. Sodium restriction becomes even more
      controversial when we consider evidence suggesting the benefit of non-salt restriction or
      treatments with salt administration, in the form of hypertonic solutions. In face of
      literature evidence not showing conclusive results about the benefit of sodium and fluid
      restriction, we designed this study in order to assess the effect of fluid and salt
      restriction on the management of patients hospitalized due to decompensated heart failure
