      receive 4 treatments of either intralesional IL-2 or intralesional IL-2 and BCG. We
      hypothesize that patients with MM (stage 3C or 4a with a minimum of 4 lesions) that receive
      combination therapy (IL-2/BCG) in the first stage of treatment will have a higher complete
      response (iCR) rate compared to IL-2 therapy alone.

      Response to stage-one treatment will be monitored and patient response to treatment will be
      determined and reported according to Immune Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours
      (iRECIST) guidelines. Based on response to stage-one treatment, patients will be placed into
      a response group before entering stage two. For stage two of the trial, patients will be
      randomized again, and placed into a treatment group; Il-2, IL-2 and BCG, BCG, or Discontinue
      Treatment. Response to treatment will be monitored and patient response to treatment will be
      determined and reported according to iRECIST guidelines.

      All patients will have lesions biopsied following standard surgical practice techniques and
      will provide urine and blood for analysis. Tissue samples will be assessed for immune system
      activity and transcriptome analysis, and urine and blood will be assessed for immune cell
      populations and markers. All patients will be followed for 5 years post treatment, and
      patient disease and survival status will be recorded according to iRECIST.
