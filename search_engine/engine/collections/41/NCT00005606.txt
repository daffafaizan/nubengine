        -  Compare the efficacy of Epstein Barr virus (EBV) reactive autologous and allogeneic
           lymphocyte clones ex vivo in targeting EBV immortalized lymphoblasts in patients
           undergoing a solid organ transplant or T cell depleted bone marrow transplant.

        -  Determine the efficacy of these regimens as treatment and prophylaxis in those patients
           who develop EBV viremia or EBV induced lymphoproliferative disease.

      OUTLINE: Autologous and allogeneic Epstein Barr virus (EBV) reactive lymphocytes are isolated
      from patients and siblings and tested in vitro for cytotoxic activity.

      Patients who develop EBV viremia or EBV related lymphoproliferative disease after transplant
      receive autologous Epstein Barr virus (EBV) reactive lymphocytes IV over 20 minutes. Patients
      receive allogeneic EBV reactive lymphocytes if autologous lymphocytes fail to control EBV
      proliferation or when sufficient autologous reactive lymphocytes cannot be isolated.
      Treatment repeats every 4 weeks in the presence of EBV viremia or lymphoproliferative
      disease. After 5 patients have received therapy without unacceptable toxicity, patients may
      receive lymphocytes as prophylactic therapy.

      Patients are followed at 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10-20 patients will be accrued for this study.
