      for chronic pain and perioperative period. it can provide both visceral and somatic abdominal
      analgesia if the injection were performed at a lower thoracic level. ESP block is effective,
      easy to perform, and can be performed in a short time. Therefore, bilateral ESP block may
      have comparable or improved analgesic effect in upper and lower abdominal surgical procedures
      when compared to other suitable plane blocks.

      Transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block technique is to reduce postoperative pain and is a
      part of current analgesic regimen for many abdominal surgeries . Moreover, it was found that
      posterior TAP block appears to produce more prolonged analgesia than the lateral TAP block.
      Ultrasound guided TAP block is a feasible, minimally invasive technique . It reduces the
      postoperative requirement of opioid analgesics, decreases the incidence and severity of
      postoperative nausea and vomiting, improves patient satisfaction, and allows early readiness
      for discharge postoperatively.

      Both blocks is effective in reducing postoperative complication and need of analgesia , To
      our knowledge there is no comparative study between the two blocks to this population .

      the investigators aim to compare the perioperative analgesic effect between TAP block and ES
      block in bariatric .
