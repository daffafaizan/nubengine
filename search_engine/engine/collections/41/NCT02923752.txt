      techniques in assessing the etiologies in patients with recent ischemic stroke. Patients who
      have had ischemic stroke (as confirmed by diffusion weighted MRI) and have had or will
      undergo 3D whole-brain vessel wall MRI within 8 weeks of symptom onset will be recruited into
      this study. It is anticipated that a total of 1000 subjects will be recruited from Feb 2017
      to Feb 2019. Approximately 12 centers in the US and China will participate in the registry.
      MRI whole-brain vessel wall images will be analyzed for detection and characteristics of
      various vessel wall pathologies and association between vessel wall imaging findings and
      patient's clinical information.
