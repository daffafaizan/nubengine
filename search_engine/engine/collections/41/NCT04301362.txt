    
      The main aims will be the following:

        -  Evaluate the utility of the combination of thrombosis biomarkers (D-dimers and thrombin
           generation potential) with the Khorana score in order to stratify VTE risk in ambulatory
           cancer patients;

        -  Determine the potential of this new score in the stratification of cancer patients into
           high- and low-risk VTE groups, in order to identify patients who would benefit from
           primary thromboprophylaxis;

        -  Determine the applicability of the thrombin generation test as an independent factor in
           the stratification of VTE risk in the cancer population under study;

        -  Determine the predictive value of D-dimers in the cancer population under study (high
           versus low risk discrimination).
