      department

        -  a period of usual management of sickle cell patients with VOS

        -  then a phase during which the device will be used. Each phase will last 3 months; the
           duration of the periods may be shorter if recruitment targets are met. Patients will be
           included consecutively.

      The main objective of the study is to measure the impact of virtual reality on the total dose
      of morphine administered to the emergency room in the treatment of vaso-occlusive seizures
      after initial morphine titration.

      The primary endpoint is the total dose of morphine (in milligrams), used in the emergency
      room after initial titration, meaning the dose administered by PCA (patient-controlled
      analgesia) and secondary titrations in the event of a recurrence of painful spikes with
      analog verbal scale (AVS) >7.
