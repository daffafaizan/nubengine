      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) added to anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF)
      therapy as compared to anti-TNF therapy alone on progression of structural damage in the
      spine over two years in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS). The trial consists of two
      phases. In the phase I (run-in phase), patients with active AS despite treatment with NSAIDs
      and elevated C-reactive protein will be included and treated with a TNF blocker (golimumab).
      Patients with good clinical response to golimumab at week 12 will be eligible for the phase
      II (core phase) of the study and will be randomized 1:1 to 1) golimumab + celecoxib
      (experimental intervention) for 2 years (weeks 12-108) or 2) golimumab alone (control
      intervention) also for 2 years. The primary outcome parameter will be the absolute
      progression of the modified Stoke Ankylosing Spondylitis Spine Score (mSASSS) - currently a
      standard of structural spinal damage progression evaluation in AS - over two years of therapy
      (weeks 12-108).
