      removing brain tumors during surgery. When ALA is provided at an increased concentration,
      protoporphorin concentration in the malignant cell increases and renders the cell fluorescent
      under long ultraviolet light. This study looks at using oral ALA to help identify the tumor
      cells intraoperatively and facilitate complete resection.

      Oral ALA will be given prior to image-guided microsurgical resection of the tumor. Following
      tumor resection under light microscopy, the tumor bed will be illuminated and any residual
      fluorescent tissue in cavity will be surgically removed leading to a more complete resection
      of tumor. Pathologic confirmation of tumor type will be made by neuropathology.
      Photosensitizer concentration in malignant and normal tissue will be estimated by
      fluorescence microscopy.
