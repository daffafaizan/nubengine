      approximately 300 healthy adults 18-49 years of age. Eligible subjects will be randomly
      assigned in a 4:1 fashion to receive a single dose of monovalent vaccine or placebo by
      intranasal spray. This study will be conducted at multiple sites in the United States.
      Randomization will be stratified by site.

      Each subject will receive one dose of investigational product on Study Day 1. The duration of
      study participation for each subject is the time from receipt of investigational product
      through 180 days after receipt of investigational product.

      To summarize the primary safety phase data (Study Days 1-8), the study will be unblinded to
      the analysis team at MedImmune after all data through at least Study Day 8 are locked.
