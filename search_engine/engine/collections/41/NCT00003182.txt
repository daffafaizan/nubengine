      used in combination with cisplatin in the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the head
      and neck. II. Determine the toxicity profile of this combination treatment in these patients.
      III. Assess the response rate of treatment in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of gemcitabine. Patients receive gemcitabine as an
      IV bolus on day 1 every 2 weeks. Cisplatin is administered on day 1 every 2 weeks. In the
      absence of dose limiting toxicity (DLT) in the first 3 patients treated, subsequent cohorts
      of 3 patients each receive escalating doses of gemcitabine on the same schedule. If 1 of 3
      patients in each cohort experiences DLT, an additional 3 patients are enrolled at that same
      dose level. If 2 of 3 patients experiences DLT in the cohort, then dose escalation ceases and
      the next lower dose is declared the maximum tolerated dose. Patients are assessed for
      response every 2 weeks. Patients may continue treatment for up to 9 months or until disease
      progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: At least 3 patients will be accrued for phase I and 20-40 patients will be
      accrued for phase II of this study.
