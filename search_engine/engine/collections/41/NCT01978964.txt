    
      Open label Phase 1b maintenance therapy study to evaluate the long-term safety,
      immunogenicity, and anti-tumor effects of repeat-dose vaccination with ONT-10 in patients
      with previously treated Stage 3 or 4 solid tumors with histologies that have been associated
      with expression of the MUC1 antigen as described in the medical literature. Patients must
      have previously been enrolled on the Phase 1 clinical trial ONT-10-001, completed all
      treatment and follow-up through at least 12 weeks, experienced no dose limiting toxicity, and
      experienced no progression of disease per the immune-related Response Criteria. Patients will
      receive maintenance ONT-10 every 6 weeks.
