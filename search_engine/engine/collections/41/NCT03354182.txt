      compare the effects of a bovine derived xenograft (with 10% collagen) + a bioabsorbable
      membrane (control group, CG) vs a bovine derived xenograft (with 10% collagen) alone (test
      group, TG) on the surgical treatment of mandibular type II furcation defects. The patients
      all underwent the same surgical intervention with the only difference between the two groups
      being the use or not of a collagen membrane.
