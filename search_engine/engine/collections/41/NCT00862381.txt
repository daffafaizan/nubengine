      induction, because of its short duration of action, its excellent cardiovascular tolerance
      and maintenance of cerebral perfusion pressure.

      For this reason etomidate remains the hypnotic of choice for induction of unstable patients.
      Other hypnotics currently in existence do not provide adequate safety with a sufficiently
      predictable and stable effect in this situation. However, it may induce acute adrenal
      insufficiency by inhibition of 11-b-hydroxylase necessary for the synthesis of cortisol from
      compound S. An observational study conducted at the Grenoble University hospital in 2006
      showed that the duration of this blockage can reach up to 48 hours. Acute adrenal
      insufficiency in intensive care patients is associated with a poor prognosis. The main
      objective of this study is to assess the value of substitution with 200mg/24h of
      hydrocortisone for 48 hours for patients in intensive care who have received a single
      injection of etomidate.

      This is an interventional, prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind,
      analytical study with a cohort of 100 patients between 18 and 80 years, of both sexes, who
      have had tracheal intubation in a pre-hospital or shock treatment setting with the
      administration of a single injection of etomidate.
