    
      Specific goals:

        1. Investigate if substituting saturated fats with polyunsaturated fats reduces steatosis
           and improves hepatic and/or peripheral insulin action in abdominally obese subjects with
           type 2 diabetes

        2. Investigate if changes of lipogenic enzymes in response to dietary fat intervention are
           associated with changes in hepatic/peripheral insulin sensitivity or liver fat content

        3. Investigate potential mechanism of the effects of dietary fatty acids; e.g. gene
           expression and lipogenic enzyme activity
