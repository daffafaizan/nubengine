      adults. To date the relation between nutrition and frailty is only poorly described.

      Thus, it is the purpose of this study to investigate the association between different
      nutrition characteristics and frailty in older community-living persons.

      206 volunteers aged 75 years or older were included in this cross-sectional study.
      Nutritional assessment included the Mini-Nutritional Assessment (MNA), a food-frequency
      questionnaire and a standardised three-day dietary record. Intake of energy and nutrients was
      calculated using the German nutrient database BLS II.2. Dietary patterns were described by
      different dietary scores. Frailty was defined according to Fried et al. based on the
      following criteria: weight loss, exhaustion, grip strength, walking speed and physical
      activity. In addition several standardised tests were performed to characterise physical
      performance (Timed Up & Go, repeated chair stands, balance tests).

      The association between nutritional aspects and physical performance is evaluated in an
      explorative manner.
