      There are over 600 people in Canada known to have Fabry Disease. For more details about Fabry
      Disease, please refer to the "Brief Summary."

      The goals of this nation-wide study are as follows:

        1. To maintain an established national registry which will collect information related to
           the identification and monitoring of all persons with Fabry disease in Canada;

        2. To determine clinical outcomes of patients with Fabry disease including those on
           treatment;

        3. To determine if urine and plasma Gb3 and globotriasylsphingosine (LysoGb3) and their
           analogues can be biomarkers for Fabry disease and can predict clinical outcomes.

      Data will be collected at baseline and every 12 months, as follows:

        -  Medical History

        -  Physical examination

        -  Neurological exam

        -  Electrocardiogram (ECG) - an electrical tracing of one's heart rhythm

        -  Echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart)

        -  Holter monitor

        -  Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) or CT Scan of the head

        -  Lab tests (including alpha-galactosidase levels)

        -  Review of current medications

        -  24-hour urine collection or a random spot urine test

        -  Biomarker samples

      To date though, evidence of the usefulness of ERT and its direct impact on the natural course
      of Fabry disease has been limited, while its cost continues to be very high (approximately
      $300,000 CDN per year per patient). As a result of these issues, there will need to be
      continued and long-term collection of information related to the effectiveness of ERT and
      other treatments to better document its true clinical outcomes in Canadian people with Fabry
      disease.
