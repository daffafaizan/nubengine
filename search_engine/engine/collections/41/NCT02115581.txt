      therapy of children with heart failure due to idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. In a
      prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial, patients younger than 18
      years with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy randomizes to receive either Coenzyme Q10 or
      placebo. Echocardiographic systolic and diastolic function parameters are determined for
      every patient at baseline, after three,six and nine months of supplementation.
