      The aim of the study is to observe the rate of postdural puncture headache observed after
      spinal anesthesia in cesarean section patients.

      Two kind of spinal anesthesia needles will be used:

        1. 26 Gauge Quincke (cutting-tip needle)

        2. 26 Gauge Atraucan (atraumatic needle)

      We will observe:

        1. Number of spinal punctures

        2. Time required for the spinal anesthesia procedure

      Patients will be evaluated after 7 days for:

        1. Headache

        2. Backache

      2 kind of spinal anesthesia needles will be used, but no comparison will be made. This is an
      observational study. Although literature gives different rates of postdural puncture headache
      for these two needles, we observe the same rate of headache in our clinical practice. We want
      to define the real rate of postdural puncture headache in patients undergoing cesarean
      section with spinal anesthesia.
