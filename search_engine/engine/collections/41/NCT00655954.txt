      of the tumour necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily. It was firstly discovered as a
      protein regulating bone metabolism, inhibiting osteoclastogenesis, consequently, inhibiting
      bone resorption OPG is detected in lung using Northern blot analysis. It is likely that OPG
      would contribute to the pathogenesis of COPD and could be an effective disease marker of the
      disease
