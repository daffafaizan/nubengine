      commonly used for pain and to put people to sleep for surgery. The researchers also want to
      know how the drug is broken down in the body. Participants will be given these drugs as they
      are prescribed by their regular doctor. As part of the participant's standard of care,
      doctors will perform tests, ask questions, review medical information and measure vital signs
      (heart rate, blood pressure, etc). The researchers will collect information that doctors have
      already written in the medical records. The research study team will collect blood from
      participants at certain time points depending on when the participant was first given the
      drug (up to 5 samples over the course of 10 to 48 hours). Parents will complete
      questionnaires about the study participant. Parents will continue to complete those same
      questionnaires for up to 12 months after the participant was first given the drug. Examples
      of current and upcoming anesthetics and analgesics include, but are not limited to:
      hydromorphone (Dilaudid), ketorolac (Toradol), methadone and ketamine.
