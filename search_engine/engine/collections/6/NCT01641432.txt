      cognitive function. This process consists of paper-pencil surveys and computerized tests.
      Following the assessment process, participants will engage in Internet browser-delivered
      training sessions conducted on any internet-accessible computer. These trainings can be done
      up to 7 times a week (once a day) or at participant's convenience (the investigators
      recommend 4-5 times a week). Following the completion of training, participant's cognitive
      function will be re-assessed. Participation is voluntary and participants may withdraw from
      the study at any time.
