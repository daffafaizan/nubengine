    
      The primary objective of the study is to assess the tumor response (by irRECIST) and
      pathological response of preoperative treatment with durvalumab combined with neoadjuvant
      therapy (carboplatin, paclitaxel with/without radiation).

      Secondary objectives are:

      To assess completion of treatment with durvalumab combined with chemotherapy with/without
      radiation treatment.

      To assess toxicities of durvalumab in combination with chemoradiation. [Time Frame: up to 1
      year] To assess completion of chemotherapy with/without radiation treatment. To assess
      withdrawal rate from surgery. To assess delay rate from surgery. To assess R0 resection rate.
      To assess post-operative complications. Progression Free Survival. [ Time Frame: up to 24
      months ] Overall Survival. [ Time Frame: up to 24 months ]
