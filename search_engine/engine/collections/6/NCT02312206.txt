    
      This is a multi-center, international, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-arm
      efficacy and safety study in subjects newly diagnosed with AL amyloidosis. Approximately 236
      subjects will be enrolled in ~60 centers, with approximately 118 subjects per arm.

      This is an event driven trial, therefore subjects will remain on-study until study
      completion, which will occur when all primary endpoint events (all-cause mortality or cardiac
      hospitalizations) have been reached. All subjects who discontinue will be followed until the
      last event is adjudicated. The estimated overall study duration is approximately 42 months,
      including the enrollment and treatment periods

      Study drug will be administered once every 28 days as a 60-120 minute IV infusion.

      First-line chemotherapy must be a bortezomib-containing regimen, with bortezomib administered
      weekly. The number of cycles of first-line chemotherapy that are administered are at the
      discretion of the Investigator, and subsequent chemotherapy regimens may be prescribed as per
      standard of care at the Investigator's discretion.

      An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will review data on a regular basis.
