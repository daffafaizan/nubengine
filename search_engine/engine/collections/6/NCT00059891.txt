        -  Determine the risk of complications and feasibility of total anorectal reconstruction
           using the Acticon Neosphincter prosthesis after abdominoperineal resection in patients
           with anal or rectal cancer.

        -  Determine continence, bowel function, and quality of life of patients treated with this
           surgery.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo abdominoperineal resection (APR) with perineal colostomy and
      diverting loop ileostomy. At least 3 months after APR, patients undergo placement of the
      Acticon Neosphincter prosthesis. At least 6 weeks after prosthesis placement, the prosthesis
      is activated. When the patient demonstrates the ability to operate the prosthesis, the
      ileostomy is reversed.

      Quality of life is assessed at 6 and 12 months and then annually thereafter.

      Patients are followed at 6 and 12 months and then annually thereafter.
