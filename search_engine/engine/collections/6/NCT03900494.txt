      obstruction in children. Eighty children (6 months to 4 years of age) will be recruited with
      moderate to severe dyspnea according to the Respiratory Distress Assessment Instrument (RDAI
      score ≥6). After receiving an informed consent from the parents/caregivers, the child is
      randomized to receive treatment with either Babyhaler® or Optichamber Diamond® VHC. Patients
      with underlying medical conditions listed in the study protocol, patients requiring immediate
      hospitalization or not willing to participate will be excluded from the study. Information on
      the medical history together with treatment response will be recorded using a manual case
      report form. According to calculations of the statistical power using the RDAI-score as an
      end-point, a total of 80 patients (40 patients in both study groups) are needed for the
      study.

      The study hypothesis is that the two VHCs are not equally efficient in treating acute
      shortage of breath in children aged 0.5-4 years.
