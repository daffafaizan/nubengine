      the supplementary motor area (SMA) improves motor symptoms in patients with Parkinson's
      disease (PD).

      The present study is a comparative study that examines the effectiveness of rTMS treatment
      technique Freezing of Gait (FOG) phenomenon in Parkinson's disease patients. We hypothesize
      that treatment using rTMS stimulation on frontal areas will decreasing frequency of FOGs in
      patients with Parkinson's disease and improve gait quality and quality of life.
