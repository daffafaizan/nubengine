      group multi-center trial, designed to evaluate the non-inferiority of CAM2038 compared to an
      existing standard of care (SL BPN/NX) in initiation and maintenance treatment with BPN. The
      trial will involve 4 phases: Screening, Phase 1 (weekly visits), Phase 2 (monthly visits),
      and Follow-up.
