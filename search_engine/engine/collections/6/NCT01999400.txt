      mesalamine known as N-acetyl-mesalamine in plasma. Mesalamine is available in different
      formulations that control the rate at which they are released in the gastrointestinal tract.
      Three formulations of mesalamine, Pentasa, Apriso, and Lialda, were studied in the crossover
      phase, while an oral solution formulation of mesalamine was studied in the single-arm phase.
      Each subject participated in a crossover phase study with one of the three formulations
      assigned at random using block randomization. Then the subject entered the single-arm phase
      study. After participation in one crossover phase study and one single-arm phase study, the
      subject could opt to participate in crossover phase studies using the other formulations also
      chosen at random until all three formulations were studied. The single-arm phase study was
      not repeated on returning subjects who participated in more than one crossover phase study.
