      However the treatment is associated with an on target side effect, i.e. neuropathic pain.
      This requires coadministration of intravenous morphine.

      In this clinical Trial we will evaluate a less toxic treatment regimen consisting of
      continuous longterm Infusion (LTI) of ch14.18/CHO administered at a dose of 10 mg/m2/day over
      10 days (total dose 100 mg/m2/cycle). Patients may receive up to five 35-day cycles in
      absence of signs of progression.
