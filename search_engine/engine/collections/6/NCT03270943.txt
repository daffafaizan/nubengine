      depressive episode before they graduate high school, and implications into adulthood. Since
      depression often first appears in adolescence and unsuccessful treatment of adolescent
      depression increases the risk of chronic or recurrent depression in adulthood, managing
      depression symptoms at this critical stage of development can benefit mental health and
      functioning throughout the lifespan. Preliminary studies have indicated that a mindful
      self-compassion program is a promising intervention to prevent depression and improve
      wellbeing in at-risk teens.

      The S.M.A.R.T Project (Stress Management and Resilience Training for Teens) is designed to
      learn about mood in teens, and whether emotional well-being can be improved with an 8 week
      class. In this study, 80 adolescents ages 14-17 ,with subsyndromal depression, will be
      randomized to either the 8-week mindful self-compassion intervention or the 8-week healthy
      lifestyles control program, followed by 6 monthly continuation sessions. Feasibility of the
      research protocol and of the program elements will be assessed. Focus group feedback will
      also inform program modifications and refinement. Additionally, baseline, mid-intervention,
      and 3- and 6-months post intervention measurements of depression, resilience, and other
      related psychosocial measures will allow preliminary exploration of the impact of each
      program on outcomes.
