      room. Laparoscopic surgery is one important risk factor for increased incidence of PONV.
      Gabapentin, an anticonvulsant with known postoperative analgesic properties, has shown some
      activity against PONV. Results from clinical trials evaluating the anti-emetic efficacy of
      gabapentin are conflicting.

      Aprepitant, a neurokinin-1 (NK1) receptor antagonist, blockades the central effects of
      substance P. Substance P is a neurotransmitter found in central areas associated with emesis
      such as the dorsal vagal complex and area postrema.
