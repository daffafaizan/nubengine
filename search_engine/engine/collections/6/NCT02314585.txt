      exercise program results in immediate and sustained reduction in falls risk and incidence ;
      2) to identify the factors that contribute to a reduction in fall risk and incidence; 3) to
      determine if a decrease in physiological fall risk and/or fall incidence results in increased
      quality of life and participation in older adults with MS; and 4) to determine the
      association between cognition, environment and comorbidities on future falls and intervention
      efficacy.
