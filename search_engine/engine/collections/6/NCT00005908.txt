      feasibility of using cDNA microarray as a measure of a tumor's biological response to
      chemotherapeutic agents by characterizing the cDNA expression patterns in breast cancer
      before and after primary chemotherapy. Thirty-six patients receive docetaxel/capecitabine
      induction chemotherapy followed by surgery and doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide adjuvant therapy
      (TX/AC). We will determine the response rate of TX induction therapy and the toxicities of
      the sequential combinations (TX/AC). We will also obtain tumor tissue for correlative
      biological determinations.
