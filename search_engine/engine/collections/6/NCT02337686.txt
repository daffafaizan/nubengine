      I. To evaluate immune effector function in resected glioblastoma tissue after treatment with
      intravenously administered pembrolizumab monotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting in patients
      with recurrent glioblastoma.

      II. To correlate the progression free survival at 6 months (PFS6) with objective increases in
      the immune effector T cell: regulatory T cell (Treg) ratio in tumor tissue as measured by ex
      vivo T-cell-specific cytokines profiling.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Comparison of time to progression of last prior therapy to time to progression on
      pembrolizumab, median duration of response, overall response rate (ORR), and overall survival
      (OS) and safety.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To identify imaging characteristics associated with immunological changes in tumor
      following treatment with pembrolizumab.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day -21 and day -1, and
      then undergo surgery on day 0. After 2-3 weeks or recovery from surgery, patients continue to
      receive pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes every 3 weeks. Courses repeat every 42 days for up
      to 24 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.
