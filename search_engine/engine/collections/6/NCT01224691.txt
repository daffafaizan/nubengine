      Growth Factor-beta (TGF-beta) mediates increased asthmatic epithelial susceptibility to
      respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection by examining responses to RSV infection in
      epithelial cells cultured from asthmatic and non-asthmatic participants. Non-smoking healthy
      adults and mild asthmatics, aged 18-60 years old, will be recruited to participate. Potential
      participants will be prescreened and scheduled for a final eligibility visit that will
      include medical history review, vital signs, physical examination, blood draw, and pulmonary
      function tests (PFTs). After eligibility is confirmed, the participant will be scheduled for
      bronchoscopy. During the bronchoscopy, bronchial epithelia and alveolar macrophages will be
      obtained from the participant for analysis. Alveolar macrophages will be evaluated ex-vivo
      for inflammatory activity at baseline and after stimulation.

      The primary objective of the laboratory analysis is to determine if TGF-beta mediates
      increased asthmatic epithelial susceptibility to RSV infection. The study has three aims
      which are interrelated: 1) To determine if asthmatic bronchial epithelia express more
      TGF-beta than normal epithelia; 2) to determine if RSV replication is greater in asthmatic
      epithelia than normal epithelia; and 3) to determine if TGF-beta mediates asthmatic bronchial
      epithelial susceptibility to RSV infections.
