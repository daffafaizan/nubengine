      procedures in our department. The earliest, 12 hours after an initial clopidogrel-loading
      dose (600mg)"on-treatment" platelet reactivity will be determined by Multiple Electrode
      Aggregometry (MEA, Multiplate® Analyzer), a point of care assay. In case of high residual
      platelet reactivity (i.e. ≥ 50U), patients are switched according to a therapeutic algorithm
      to either prasugrel (Efient®), or in case of contraindication (i.e. stroke) to ticagrelor
      (Brilique®), or in case of contraindication (intracranial hemorrhage) reloaded with
      clopidogrel.
