      (200 mg BID with does 8 hours apart) and a structured home based walking/progressive
      resistance program, EXCAP, alone or together, on cognitive function and levels of
      inflammatory molecules among cancer patients receiving chemotherapy (beginning at cycle 2).
      If these interventions prove to be useful and have potential benefit, they could have a
      substantial impact on treating cognitive difficulties experienced by cancer patients as well
      as improve quality of life. Moreover, if there is an effect of these interventions on
      cognitive functioning and inflammation, we will gain more knowledge of a possible mechanism
      of chemotherapy-related cognitive difficulties.
