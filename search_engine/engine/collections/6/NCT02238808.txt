      and luminal B) that differ in their response to treatment.

      Results from the Women's Health Initiative Trial showed that estrogen treated hysterectomized
      women with no prior history of breast cancer had a significant and persistent decrease in
      breast cancer incidence when compared to placebo treated participants. This implies that some
      ER+ breast cancers are in fact growth inhibited by estrogens and are not growth promoted.

      The hypothesis of this study is that some ER+ breast cancers (luminal A) are actually
      sensitive (growth inhibited) by estrogen.

      Objectives:

        1. To assess changes in breast cancer proliferation after a 7-14 day trial of estradiol in
           newly diagnosed estrogen receptor positive post-menopausal breast cancer patients prior
           to surgery.

        2. Exploratory analysis of biologic correlates with comparison to available genotyping
           tests.

      This is an open-label single group assignment pilot study for safety/efficacy and exploratory
      biologic correlates
