      weight, smoking history and the type of procedures performed during bronchoscopy shall be
      recorded. A written informed consent will be obtained from all participants. The patients who
      undergo flexible bronchoscopy would be randomised in a one is to one ratio either to
      transcricoid or spray as you go group. Prior to the bronchoscopy blood pressure, pulse rate,
      respiratory rate and pulse oximetry saturation will be recorded at the baseline Patients in
      both the groups shall be prepared in a similar fashion except for the initial route of
      lignocaine delivery.

      During the procedure, 1.5 ml aliquots of 2% lignocaine solution will be delivered through the
      bronchoscope when using spray-as-you go technique. Patients in the transcricoid group shall
      initially receive 5 ml of 2% lignocaine solution instilled transtracheally along with two
      baseline 1.5 cc bronchial spray aliquots of lignocaine, and additional aliquots of 2%
      lignocaine using the spray as you go method. The total lignocaine dose during the procedure
      will be recorded. The patients would be monitored for any adverse effects throughout the
      procedure. The bronchoscopist doing the procedure will be provided 2 VAS charts to mark the
      severity of cough and overall procedure satisfaction. Cough count shall be noted.
