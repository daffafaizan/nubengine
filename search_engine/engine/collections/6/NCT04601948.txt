    
      The purpose of this pilot study is to explore the feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of
      a 6-week mobile health (mHealth) physical activity intervention among adolescent and young
      adult (AYA) cancer survivors being treated at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics.
      Eligible participants will receive a Fitbit activity monitor and access to the mHealth
      physical activity intervention for 6 weeks. The intervention will include regular
      motivational messages to encourage activity, a social media thread to provide social support,
      and a series of fun virtual walking races. AYA cancer survivors between 13-39 years are
      invited to participate and the impact of this intervention will be tested over 6 weeks.
