      parenteral or oral corticosteroids, nedocromil, cromolyn, theophylline or anticonvulsants in
      the past 4 weeks.

           (DSS)

        -  Lung Function Test by spirometry (SpiroPro Jaeger Toennies, Hoechberg, Germany)

        -  Conventional Medication consumption, according to GINA/NIH guidelines.
