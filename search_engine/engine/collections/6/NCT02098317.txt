      enrolled. They will be randomized to treatment with DHA and Vitamin D (n=33) or an identical
      placebo (n=33) given orally for a period of 6 months. All patients will be included in a
      lifestyle intervention program consisting of a diet tailored on the individual requirements
      and physical exercise.

      Patients will undergo a medical evaluation at 3-6 and 12 months during the 12-months study
      period. Liver biopsy will be performed at baseline and at 12 months. Anthropometric
      measurements and laboratory tests, including liver enzymes, gluco-insulinemic profile and
      lipids will be performed at baseline and repeated at 6-12 months
