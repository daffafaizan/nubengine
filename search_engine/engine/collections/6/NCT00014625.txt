      duration of response, and progression-free survival of patients with metastatic melanoma. II.
      Determine the acute side effects of this drug in these patients. III. Determine the
      pharmacokinetic parameters of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive E7070 IV over 1 hour. Treatment
      repeats every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients are followed every 6 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 19-24 patients will be accrued for this study.
