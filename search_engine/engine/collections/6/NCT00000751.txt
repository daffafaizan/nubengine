      parturition (via breast-feeding). It is believed that therapy administered both during
      pregnancy and intrapartum may help prevent vertical transmission. Additionally, adjunctive
      short-term antiretroviral therapy for the newborn, following the intensive viral exposure
      presumed to occur at birth, may be necessary.

      Pregnant women who are currently receiving AZT are randomized at 20-30 weeks of gestation to
      begin receiving either HIVIG or IVIG every 28 days up to delivery. Within 12 hours after
      birth, the infant receives an infusion of matching study drug. During labor, all women
      receive an intravenous loading dose of AZT administered over 1 hour, followed by continuous
      infusion during the intrapartum period until the umbilical cord is clamped. All infants
      receive AZT syrup every 6 hours, beginning as soon as oral fluids are tolerated but within
      8-12 hours after birth and continuing for 6 weeks. Women are followed until 26 weeks
      postpartum. Infants are followed at weeks 1, 2, 4, and then every 4 weeks through week 24,
      every 12 weeks through week 60, at week 78 (18 months), and at week 104 (24 months).
