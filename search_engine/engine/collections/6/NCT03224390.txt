      than two-thirds of unintended pregnancies and more than two-thirds of maternal deaths.
      Voluntary family planning has also been shown to improve newborn health outcomes, advance
      women's empowerment, and bring socioeconomic benefits through reductions in fertility and
      population growth. Yet among the populations that would benefit the most from family
      planning, uptake remains too low.

      The specific aim of this pilot study is to estimate the impact of a new digital health
      service on the uptake of family planning among Kenyan women with an unmet need for
      contraception. This service promotes uptake by offering free screening and referral. Women
      text the service for free, complete a short automated screening over the phone, and receive a
      list of recommended methods and a referral to local family planning providers offering those
      methods. The main hypothesis is that the service will increase the uptake of family planning
      among these users.
