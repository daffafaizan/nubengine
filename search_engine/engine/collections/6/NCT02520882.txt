      development, patient stratification and therapeutic response monitoring. Various GRPR
      targeting imaging probes have been develop to meet the purpose. Bombesin (BBN) is an
      amphibian homolog of mammalian gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP). BBN(7-14), with the amino
      acid sequence of Gln-Trp-Ala-Val-Gly-His-Leu-Met-NH2, has been extensively used for the
      development of molecular probes for the imaging of gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR),
      after being labeled with various radionuclides. Multiple preclinical studies have
      demonstrated receptor-specific accumulation of the tracers in GRPR positive tumors. For
      interests in clinical translation of 68Ga-NOTA-Aca-BBN(7-14), an open-label dynamic
      whole-body PET/ CT study was designed to investigate the safety and diagnostic performance of
      68Ga-NOTA-Aca-BBN(7-14) in patients with glioma.
