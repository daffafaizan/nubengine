      therapy include radiation dermatitis (skin pain, itching, erythema, desquamation). Late
      toxicities include skin fibrosis, ulceration, telangiectasia, altered skin pigmentation,
      delayed wound healing for potential future wounds in the irradiated field, and radiation
      induced malignancy in the irradiated field (lifetime risk estimated to be 1% or less)
      Additionally, efficacy of the treatment is not known and there is a risk that the keloid will
      continue to grow immediately or in the future resulting in treatment providing patients with
      no benefit but with the included aforementioned acute and late toxicities of the RT.

      The potential benefits of this study include prevention of keloid progression, keloid
      improvement or resolution with symptomatic relief and cosmetic. This therapeutic option
      uniquely provides these benefits for patients who are otherwise lacking efficacious treatment
      options for their keloids. Previous published studies of similar regimens suggest that rates
      of symptom control and/or stable to reduced keloid size of 75% or higher may be achieved with
      our regimen.
