      (NO) donor and main precursor of NO, L-arginine, to further improve the symptoms of
      schizophrenia with minimum or no additional side-effects. L-Arginine is classified as a
      semi-essential or conditionally essential amino acid depending on the developmental stage and
      health status of the individual. Glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors have
      functional connections to the NO system in the brain. Dysfunction of connectivity of the
      neuroregulators glutamate and NO have been implicated in mechanisms of psychosis. Therefore,
      any downstream effects of NMDA dysfunction in schizophrenia may be ultimately mediated by the
      NO system at a cellular level. As an augmenting treatment to antipsychotic therapy, we
      examined the ability of L-arginine to further improve residual symptoms in the illness.
