    
      After a screening period of about 2 weeks, 36 eligible healthy men and women were randomly
      allocated to receive 3 sequential treatments in the following order:

        -  a single dose of diclofenac followed by a single dose of the fixed-dose combination of
           diclofenac/tramadol followed by a single dose of tramadol

        -  a single dose of tramadol followed by a single dose of the fixed-dose combination of
           diclofenac/tramadol followed by a single dose of diclofenac.

      There were washout periods of 7 days between treatments.

      Sixteen blood samples were collected per participant: at pre-dose and 0.16, 0.33, 0.5, 0.75,
      1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24 and 36 hours after administration of each of the study
      drugs.

      The pharmacokinetic parameters and relative bioavailabilities of diclofenac and tramadol (and
      of the tramadol metabolite M1) were determined for the new fixed-dose combination product and
      were compared to the single compound reference products.

      Furthermore, the safety (frequency of adverse events) and tolerability of the new fixed-dose
      combination of diclofenac 25 mg and 25 mg tramadol in healthy men and women was assessed.
