      requirements. These require confirmation of brain death by one of the statutory methods
      before organ harvesting. The use of these methods in clinical practice has not yet been
      described.The aim of this retrospective observational study is to describe the use of these
      methods in the real clinical practice of the transplant program in the Czech Republic, taking
      into account the legislation of other European countries.
