      controlled study in patients with De Novo coronary artery lesions in small vessels treated
      with the CYPHER™ (sirolimus-eluting) stent as compared to the small vessel tercile uncoated
      Bx VELOCITYTM Stent patients from the SIRIUS Trial. A total of up to 100 patients will be
      enrolled in this study.

      Patients with de novo native coronary artery lesions >=15mm and <=30mm in length and >=2.25
      mm to <=2.75 mm in diameter by visual estimation will be treated with the CYPHER™
      (sirolimus-eluting) stent. Patients will be followed at 30 days, 6, 8, 9 months and at 1, 2
      and 3 years post-procedure, with a repeat angiography at 8 months. In all patients
      Intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS) will be performed before (only in case of crossing success)
      and after the initial procedure. An IVUS control will also be done at 8 months follow up to
      assess neo-intimal growth and remodeling.

      This is a single lesion treatment study. Patients may have other lesions treated before the
      treatment of the intended lesion in the small vessel (a non-target lesion may not be located
      in the target vessel!). Post-procedural treatment of another lesion is only allowed after the
      30-day follow-up contact has been completed or in case this is clinically needed.

      It is anticipated that the total length of the study will be 39 months: 3 months to complete
      patient enrollment and 3 years for follow-up.
