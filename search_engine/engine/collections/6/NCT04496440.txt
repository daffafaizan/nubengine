      (Primary Osteoarthritis Knee = OA Knee). At present the cause and treatment are not known.
      The study was based on a hypothesis, designing a treatment and testing it through a clinical
      trial. This established that the deficient full flexion or deficient full extension of knee
      joints, producing contracture in their capsules was the cause and the correction (Contracture
      Correction Therapy = CCT) was the cure of the disease. The correction was carried out by
      passive flexion or passive extension of affected knee through eight body postures designed
      specifically during the study.

      To test the efficacy a multi-centre, multi surgeon six months study on 125 patients was
      carried out, patients were divided into Trial and Control groups. The effects were measured
      by primary outcome measure - The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index
      (WOMAC) score and other measure EuroQol-Visual Analogue Scales (EQ-VAS) score, DFF*, DFE^ at
      0, 6 ,12 and 24 weeks.

      The "Intervention" for 1st group was CCT and for the 2nd group was "No intervention".
