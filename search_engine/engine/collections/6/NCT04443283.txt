      an effective method to treat infertility. Chest X-ray is a routine examination before IVF-ET,
      which can exclude active tuberculosis. However, for patients with chest X-ray showing old
      healed tuberculosis, the relationship between latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) and
      pregnancy outcomes is unknown. In this study, a prospective cohort study was carried out in
      infertile women who were planning to receive IVF-ET. IGRA were tested in patients with old
      tuberculosis in chest X-ray. A cohort of IGRA positive and IGRA negative was constructed. The
      pregnancy outcomes were followed up prospectively and the relationship between latent
      infection of tuberculosis and pregnancy outcomes was analyzed. The primary outcome was
      clinical pregnancy rate, miscarriage rate and live birth rate. Secondary outcomes were
      tuberculosis reactivation during pregnancy period and in 3 months after delivery.
