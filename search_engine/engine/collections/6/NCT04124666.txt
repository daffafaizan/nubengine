      high cancer-killing activity are collected and infused into a specific cancer patient by
      matching, to achieve the therapeutic anticancer effect. In this proposed trial, up to 100
      Subjects with advanced cancer can be entered. Potentially hundreds of healthy
      Donor-participants will be recruited. First, granulocyte donors will be identified via
      in-vitro assay of Cancer Killing Activity (CKA), which screens healthy Donor-participants for
      those with anticancer activity of more than 80%. Secondly, after donor-recipient blood
      matching, (2.0-5.0)x10^10 granulocytes will be collected from each donor, accounting for
      about 1/10 of the human body. Each patient will be given a dose of (2.0-5.0)x10^10
      granulocytes from a different donor per week over a course of 5 doses (with an ideal total
      infusion of 2X10^11 granulocytes). After each infusion, the patients will be monitored
      carefully for possible adverse events. If adverse events occur, the infusion can be slowed
      down or stopped until the adverse events can be managed. The trial will observe the subject's
      cancer 7, 30, 90 and 180 days after the last infusion. Target lesions, non-target lesions,
      and new lesions will be evaluated via medical imaging and tumor markers. The responses will
      be compared against the measurements at baseline.
