      cholecystectomy will have less postoperative pain than patients undergoing laparoscopic
      cholecystectomy with standard CO2 insufflation. The study design is a double-blind,
      prospective, randomized study comparing patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy with
      standard CO2 insufflation vs those receiving warmed, humidified CO2. Main variables included
      postoperative pain (rated with a visual analog scales) and analgesic requirements.
