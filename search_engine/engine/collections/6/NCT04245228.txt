      on the adult heart or adult lung transplant waiting list at the Mayo Clinic will undergo
      informed consent. Consenting participants will be randomized to weekly, 30-minute telephone
      calls for twelve weeks or usual care. Questionnaires and demographic information will be
      collected at baseline and after 12 weeks.
