    
      Acne is a chronic inflammatory disease that affects almost 100% of the teenagers worldwide.
      The peak incidence is between 12 and 18 years old, although it can be present in adults.
      There are many different beliefs about what factors can cause or exacerbate acne, as well
      concerning treatments.

      In Mexico, 26.4% of the population is between 15 and 29 years old, which represents that more
      than 25% of the population is at risk for presenting acne. In our country, there are diverse
      beliefs about the causes and treatment of acne among general adolescent population which have
      not been explored before. The objective of the present study is to determine possible causes
      that are involved in the low use of health system with the intention to receive treatment for
      acne. The investigators' main hypothesis is that the lack of knowledge of the disease is
      responsible for this behavior.

      The investigators are going to explore health, educational, family and economic issues in the
      search of association by multivariate analysis.
