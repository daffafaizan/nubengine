      been shown that bariatric surgery combined with diet and exercise changes have positive
      effects on weight loss, knee pain and function.

      Neuropathic pain is a disease that affects the somatosensory system or pain that results in a
      lesion. It has been reported that neuropathic pain is more frequently seen in patients with
      high body mass index.

      The hyperreactivity of the central nervous system (CNS) plays an important role in the
      chronic pain of OA patients. It has been shown that CNS becomes hypersensitive in people with
      chronic OA pain and central sensitization phenomenon plays an important role in pain
      complaints reported by these patients.

      The aim of this study is to determine the effects of bariatric surgery on knee pain, loss of
      function, quality of life and central sensitization.
