      ergocalciferol lowers plasma mucin-1 levels. The study population will include 40 healthy
      individuals and 40 individuals with ADTKD-MUC1.

      The study consists of an initial screening, signing of consent of interested individuals,
      performance of pregnancy test in women of child-bearing age and screening labs, and
      administration of 200,000 units of ergocalciferol on Day 0 (On Study). Laboratory studies
