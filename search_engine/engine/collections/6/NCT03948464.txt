    
      Slow-release oral morphine (SROM) has emerged as a promising yet understudied form of oral
      treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD), with preliminary studies suggesting similar efficacy
      rates as methadone with respect to promoting abstinence, and with better improvements in a
      number of patient-reported outcomes, including tolerability, treatment satisfaction, mental
      symptoms, and craving. The proposed study is an open-label, non-inferiority, randomized
      controlled trial evaluating the relative effectiveness, safety and acceptability of SROM vs.
      methadone for the treatment of OUD in outpatient clinical settings. Participants will be
      randomized 1:1 to SROM or methadone for 24 weeks. Data linkages performed three years after
      randomization will evaluate long term health outcomes. This study aims to provide evidence to
      optimize care for individuals with OUD, and potentially increase access to additional form of
      evidence-based oral treatment.
