      pregnancy) without contractions if they meet the inclusion criteria. If the cervix is still
      non-inducible after 4-6 hours and there are no contractions, the medication to be
      administered to them will be determined by means of computer randomization. The success rate
      of induction with Propess vs. Prostin tablets will be compared. Soon after PROM, there can be
      the onset of contractions and cervix dilation that lead to childbirth.

      In case of some pregnant women, there are no contractions and cervix dilation even after the
      event despite PROM and water breaking. If the status remains unchanged, the risk of
      intrauterine infection, fetus infection, and later on an infection of the newborn increases.
      The expecting mother can also eventually lose hope for a successful vaginal birth and starts
      thinking about having a caesarean delivery. To avoid that, the investigators use medications
      that accelerate the onset of vaginal birth in clinical practice.

      The investigators know several ways to induce labour after PROM. References give no clear and
      reliable data on the best approach. The investigators can use medications such as oxytocin,
      dinoprostone, or misoprostol.

      Our ward has been using Prostin 3 mg (dinoprostone) vaginal tablets to induce labour in case
      of PROM for several years. They have proven to be an efficient and safe procedure in our
      clinical practice.

      Propess is used for the induction of labor with intact membranes. Based on the information
      from references and according to our experience, the medication is highly effective and safe,
      as well as easy to use.

      Our study aims at establishing whether it can also be used with pregnant women with PROM.
