      for histamine 10 - 100 fold that of natural histamine receptors, might attenuate Nasal
      Allergen Challenge (NAC) induced allergic rhinitis.

      Methods: Patients with known ragweed allergy will be screened to determine the minimal
      threshold concentration (PD30) of pollen extract that consistently induces the four key
      symptoms of allergic rhinitis: itch, sneezing, congestion and mucus production. A
      standardised system of TNSS scoring will be used. A total of 112 eligible patients will be
      randomised in double blind fashion to receive one of four concentrations of rEV131 (0.63,
      1.25, 2.5 and 5.0 mg/ml) by nasal spray 30 minutes prior to NAC or placebo. Symptoms will be
      scored at 15, 30 and 45 minutes post NAC. Mean sum of symptom scores of all active medication
      treated patients will be compared with those of placebo treated patients. The primary
      analysis will be the sum of scores at 15 minutes post challenge for the optimum concentration
      of rEV131. Secondary outcome variables will include comparison of individual symptom and
      percentage of patients having a clinically significant response.
