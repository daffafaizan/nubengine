      affecting health and life expectancy and increasing health care costs. There is an urgent
      need to lower the incidence or delay the onset of both conditions by lifestyle-related
      interventions. Dietary whey protein acts in the gut to release GLP-1 and insulin release,
      thereby lowering post-meal glucose levels and satiety. Whey protein is a mixture of proteins
      which the investigators have modified to be potentially more effective at lowering blood
      glucose. Using laboratory tests, a protein present in whey that does not increase levels of
      GLP-1 was identified and removed. Its removal raises the levels of other proteins which are
      more effective. The study will test the effectiveness of the "modified" whey protein. If the
      modified whey protein is found to be more effective it may be used to minimise the post-meal
      rise in glucose levels.
