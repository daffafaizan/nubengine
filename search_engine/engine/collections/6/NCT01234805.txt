      I. To estimate the participation rate, accrual, adherence, and retention to a yoga trial in
      patients with malignant brain tumors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To obtain estimates of the variability of self-reported fatigue, distress (i.e.,
      depression, anxiety), sleep disturbance, cognitive function, and health-related quality of
      life from baseline to the end of the intervention at 6 (post-onsite intervention) and 12
      weeks (post-full intervention).

      II. To obtain preliminary estimates of the efficacy of a yoga intervention in patients with
      malignant brain tumors on the outcomes of fatigue, distress, and cognitive function.

      III. To standardize the cancer-specific yoga protocol for use with brain tumor patients.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients participate in yoga classes comprising postures, deep relaxation, breathing
      practices, and meditation twice weekly for 75 minutes during weeks 1-6. Patients then
      practice yoga at home twice weekly for 45 minutes during weeks 7-12.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for 4-5 months.
