      development of metabolic syndrome in a drug na√Øve population suffering from first episode
      schizophrenia and compared it with a matched healthy control group. We also aimed to examine
      the prevalence of metabolic syndrome as defined by the two most widely accepted definitions,
      the ATP IIIA and the IDF.
