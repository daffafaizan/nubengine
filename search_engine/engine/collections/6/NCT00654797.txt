      validated, and safe eProtocol-insulin into a second group of naïve ICUs, none of which
      participated in eProtocol-insulin development, refinement or validation. Our primary goal in
      this second phase is to determine the feasibility of exporting this tool to naïve ICU
      environments. In this second phase we will also compare the effects of the eProtocol-insulin
      and ordinary care approaches to glucose control on the bedside nurse's experience.

      This second phase will be a prospective cohort study. We will determine the feasibility of
      distributing eProtocol-insulin and will further validate eProtocol-insulin in >4 adult and >4
      pediatric ICUs. If necessary we will modify eProtocol-insulin with an iterative refinement
      process, with Institutional Review Board (IRB) and independent Data and Safety Monitoring
      Board (DSMB) oversight. eProtocol-insulin will be considered refined if >90% of the
      instructions are accepted and if the percent of glucose values between 70 and 110 mg/dl
      (3.9-6.1 mMol/L) are equivalent to our Phase-1 refinement and validation experience of 46%%,
      and if the rate of glucose values < 40 mg/dl (2.2 mMol/l) is less than 0.5% of glucose
      measurements.
