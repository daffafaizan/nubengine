      cardiovascular events. Its primary mechanism of action is the irreversible acetylation of
      platelet cyclooxygenase-1, thereby inhibiting platelet production of thromboxane A2, a potent
      vasoconstrictor and activator of platelets. Thromboxane A2, the major product of
      cyclooxygenase cytochrome oxidase (COX-1) in platelets, induces platelet aggregation.
      Thromboxane B2 is an inactive metabolite/product of thromboxane A2. This primary outcome
      measures the extent of inhibition of platelet COX-1 by measuring the amount of the metabolite
      thromboxane B2 in serum.

      Previous studies have demonstrated that many patients have recurrent events despite treatment
      with aspirin, which has been termed "aspirin resistance" or "aspirin nonresponse." This study
      addresses some of the possible mechanisms for aspirin nonresponse; specifically, we will test
      the hypothesis that aspirin nonresponse results from states that produce high peroxide
      concentrations ("oxidative stress") in platelets. In addition, we will evaluate the effect of
      enteric coating on the pharmacologic efficacy of aspirin in patients with coronary artery
      disease.
