      consist of eating a subjectively or objectively large amount of food over a period of time
      accompanied by a sense of loss control over eating, in the absence of recurrent compensatory
      behaviors (e.g., purging). Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the current gold-standard
      treatment for reducing binge eating episodes in BED patients. The first-line of recommended
      CBT treatment is a self-guided intervention called CBT-Guided Self-Help (CBT-GSH). However,
      for a substantial minority of patients, CBT-GSH fails to reduce binge episodes after
      treatment. Preliminary findings of the literature suggests that individuals with BED possess
      deficits in inhibitory control as it relates to food-stimuli. We are studying how inhibitory
      neurobiological and neurocognitive processes relate to binge eating treatment outcome.

      This study involves a brief phone screen and research assessment (approximately 5 hours) to
      determine eligibility. Eligible participants will receive CBT-GSH, which will include a
      one-hour clinical intake followed by 6 therapy sessions (approximately 30 minutes each).
      Participants will also complete research assessments at mid-treatment, post-treatment, and 3
      month follow-up intervals. Research assessments include a battery of questionnaires,
      computerized tasks, interviews, and a task using functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIR)
      imaging.
