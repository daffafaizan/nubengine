      neurohormonal antagonism are limited. Studies have demonstrated impaired oxidative capacity
      of skeletal muscle among HF patients, which may contribute to symptoms of breathlessness and
      persistent fatigue.

      In addition to its role in erythropoiesis, iron (Fe) plays a critical role in skeletal
      muscle's oxygen (O2)-storage capacity (myoglobin) and systemic aerobic energy production. As
      Fe deficiency is common in patients with symptomatic HF, repletion of iron stores may improve
      submaximal exercise capacity among these patients beyond the effects on erythropoiesis.

      While intravenous Fe repletion in HF patients with mild Fe-deficiency (i.e. Ferritin <100 or
      Ferritin 100-299 with transferrin saturation <20%) with or without anemia global well-being
      and functional status, oral Fe repletion has not been studied. Furthermore, the efficacy of
      oral Fe to replete iron stores in a similar population and its impact on functional capacity,
      measured objectively by peak VO2, remains unknown.
