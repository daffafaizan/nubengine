      (an immunosuppressant) given after transplant to help prevent certain complications, can be
      given safely for a shorter period of time than it has been in the past.

      At the present time there are few or no cures for your type of disease outside of a bone
      marrow transplant. The bone marrow for this transplant comes from a relative who is a
      half-match or "haplo" match to you. Possible donors include parents, siblings, and children.
      In order to help the bone marrow grow, or "take", inside your body, you will receive
      chemotherapy and radiation before the transplant. After the transplant you will receive high
      doses of cyclophosphamide (CytoxanÂ®) along with other medications to lower the immune system,
      tacrolimus. These medications may lower the risk of graft versus host disease (GVHD) and of
      your body rejecting the bone marrow graft.
