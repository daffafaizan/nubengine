    
      The primary objectives of this study are: (1) test the long-term effectiveness of a peer
      mentor model on improving glucose control, blood pressure, LDL levels, diabetes mellitus
      quality of life, and depression scores in a mixed race population of poorly controlled
      diabetic Veterans; (2) test the effectiveness of using former peer mentees as peer mentors as
      a means of creating a self-sustaining program; and (3) and test the effects of becoming a
      mentor on those who were originally mentees given a growing literature that being a mentor is
      good for your health. Secondary objectives include: (1) in those randomized to being a
      mentee, explore mentor characteristics associated with improved HbA1c.

      This study will be a prospective randomized controlled trial. Outcomes to be measured include
      glycosylated hemoglobin, blood pressure, direct LDL, diabetes quality of life and depression.

      The trial has two phases. In phase one, patients with poorly controlled diabetes are
      randomized to usual care or receiving peer mentoring. In phase two, poorly controlled
      diabetics are randomized to usual care or receiving peer mentoring from former mentees.
      Former mentees from phase 1 are also randomized such that they will have a 50% chance of
      becoming a mentor.
