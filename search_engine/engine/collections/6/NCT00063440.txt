      Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death in the United States and one of the
      leading causes of morbidity. New technology recently has allowed the non-invasive
      investigation of the extent of atherosclerosis in different vascular beds. Unfortunately, the
      clinical implications and significance of this new technology have not yet been fully
      examined nor has the interrelationship between these various measurements of clinical and
      sub-clinical atherosclerosis. The study is ancillary to the Multi-Ethnic Study of
      Atherosclerosis (MESA), an NHLBI-supported epidemiological study of atherosclerosis in
      several ethnic groups.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      A longitudinal assessment of the carotid intima media thickness (IMT) will be added to the
      scheduled follow-up visits in MESA subjects in order to study the relationship between
      carotid IMT and a measure of calcium burden in the coronary vessels. In addition, studies
      will be conducted on how these two non-invasive markers of atherosclerosis relate to
      cardiovascular disease risk factors and clinical events.The study will utilize the MESA
      cohort involving 6500 subjects who will have baseline and four follow-up examinations.
      coronary artery calcification (CAC) and IMT are being obtained at baseline, with CAC
      determinations also scheduled at follow-up. IMT determinations will be added in conjunction
      with the CAC studies in the second and third exams and detailed analyses will be carried out
      on these two measures of atherosclerotic burden that may reflect different biologic
      processes.
