      lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and
      for the treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED). This study will look at the change in lower
      urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and in
      erectile dysfunction (ED) in people who take Udenafil.

      The study will enroll approximately 950 patients. Participants taking BPH or ED medication
      will enter a 4-week wash out period. Patients not previously treated and those who
      accomplished the wash out period will enter a placebo (dummy inactive pill) lead-in period of
      another 4 weeks. Participants will then be randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a
      coin) to one of the four treatment groups-which will remain undisclosed to the patient and
      study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need):

        -  Udenafil 25 mg

        -  Udenafil 50 mg

        -  Udenafil 75 mg

        -  Placebo (dummy inactive pill) - this is a tablet that looks like the study drug but has
           no active ingredient

      All participants will be asked to take one tablet at the same time each day throughout the
      study, and will be asked to keep a Sexual Encounter Profile (SEP) diary.

      This multi-centre trial will be conducted in Mexico. The overall time to participate in this
      study is up to 20 weeks. Participants will make 6 visits to the clinic.
