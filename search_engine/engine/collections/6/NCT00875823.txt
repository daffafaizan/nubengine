    
      This study involves the collection of medical information to create a computer database
      (registry) for patients with PH. The information will be entered into the registry by your
      physician, healthcare provider or a staff member of the Mayo Clinic Hyperoxaluria Center. The
      computer web site for the registry is secure and protected by a required password. Some
      information which will be entered may include your age at first symptoms of PH,kidney stone
      history, lab values, kidney function, and your health over time. Information for a patient
      can only be viewed by the appropriate physician and staff. Once the information is entered
      into the registry, you will only be identified by a code number.
