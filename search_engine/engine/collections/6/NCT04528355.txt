      broad spectrum of non-malignant disorders (NMD). Although reduced-intensity conditioning
      (RIC) regimens promise decreased treatment-related morbidity and mortality, graft failure and
      infections are limiting the use of RIC in chemotherapy-naive patients. Dr. Szabolcs have
      completed several trials to evaluate a novel RIC regimen of alemtuzumab, hydroxyurea,
      fludarabine, melphalan, and thiotepa. The last trial at UPMC Children's Hospital of
      Pittsburgh of a highly effective and biologically rational chemotherapy-based RIC regimen
      paired with simple alemtuzumab dosing strata was tested and resulted in outstanding survival
      and remarkably low rates of graft failure. The favorable outcome described may serve as a
      toxicity and efficacy reference for emerging gene therapy strategies as well.

      This prospective collection of clinical data will allow the investigators to further assess
      engraftment, GVHD, immunosuppressant use and overall survival in this patient population.
