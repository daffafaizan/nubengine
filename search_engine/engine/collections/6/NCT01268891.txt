      the most effective medications for relief of the symptoms of PD. However, within few months
      to few years the majority of levodopa-treated patients notice a decline in the duration of
      benefit of each dose and develop motor-complications. A major problem is the appearance of
      fluctuations in mobility, cycles of ON and OFF periods. The administration of Azilect®, a
      monoamine oxidase type B (MAO-B) inhibitor, can slow the elimination of the endogenous
      dopamine supplies or the dopamine produced from the exogenous levodopa therapy and may
      therefore improve ON-OFF fluctuations. Azilect® is approved for treatment of PD in Europe and
      the US.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of Azilect®
      compared to placebo in Korean PD patients with motor fluctuations on levodopa therapy.
