    
      This is a pivotal Phase 3, open-label, single-arm, multicenter study to assess the
      tolerability, safety, efficacy, and Pharmacokinetics of the Investigational Medicinal Product
      in adults and children with Primary Immunodeficiency Diseases (PIDD). A total of
      approximately 75 subjects aged 2-80 years will be enrolled in the study. Subjects who switch
      from an investigational immune globulin or subcutaneous immune globulin (IGSC) are required
      to receive a stable dose of commercial product (CP), which is a licensed commercially
      available immune globulin intravenous (IGIV) product for at least 3 cycles before they can be
      given the Investigational Medicinal Product . This study schema will result in the Commercial
      Product Treatment Period and Investigational Medicinal Product Treatment Period. All subjects
      will be treated on an outpatient basis with the Investigational Medicinal Product for
      approximately 1 year, with the dose and schedule based on their previous IGIV treatment
      regimen (21-day or 28-day dosing interval). A subset of subjects will participate in a
      Pharmacokinetics sub-study.

      The primary objective of the study is to examine the rate of clinically documented serious
      bacterial infections (SBIs) in subjects treated with the Investigational Medicinal Product to
      achieve a rate of less than one SBI per year.
