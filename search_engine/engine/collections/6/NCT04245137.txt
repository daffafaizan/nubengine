      supporting structure. Pelvic floor muscles play an important role in the maintenance of
      pelvic floor function. Surface electromyography (sEMG) has been widely used to evaluate the
      function of pelvic floor muscles. The sEMG tests, which include pretest and posttest resting
      amplitude (µV), as well as phasic, tonic and endurance contractile amplitude (µV), are
      performed using Vishee neuro-muscle stimulator (MyoTrac Infiniti, model SA9800, Thought
      Technology Ltd., Montreal, Canada), following the Glazer protocols. A pear-shaped vaginal
      probe (serial number DYS180610, type VET-A, produced by Nanjing Vishee Medical Technology,
      Ltd.) is placed into the vagina when sEMG tests are performed. This is a cross-sectional
      survey. The reference intervals of pelvic floor sEMG in healthy female are evaluated.
