      screening has been used as a tool to identify individuals who are at increased risk of
      developing future coronary events, but almost one-half of patients who develop myocardial
      infarction have either normal or only moderately increased serum cholesterol concentrations.
      In the last years, experimental and clinical evidence has demonstrated that atherosclerosis
      is not simply a disease of lipid deposits. Rather, there is growing recognition that CHD has
      an inflammatory component which plays a critical role in the arterial plaque rupture that
      triggers most episodes of coronary thrombosis. In the last years, C-reactive protein (CRP),
      an exquisitely sensitive marker of systemic inflammation, has emerged as a powerful predictor
      of cardiovascular diseases, in particular of CHD, beyond what can be estimated by traditional
      risk factors. The availability of high-sensitivity (hs) CRP assays has enabled the detection
      of even low-grade inflammatory responses that have previously been regarded as clinically not
      meaningful. However, for hs-CRP to make the transition from epidemiological and clinical
      research to the routine clinical setting, several important issues must be satisfactorily
      addressed.

      Therefore, the overall objective of this proposal is to study the applicability of the hs-CRP
      assay in the assessment of CV risk in daily clinical conditions where hyperlipidemic
      population with or without CHD are currently evaluated and to evaluate hs-CRP response to
      statins.
