      COVID-19 patients according to international guidelines. The Phase I and II of this
      development process have been finalized. Based on a systematic literature review , interviews
      with 44 health-care professionals and 52 patients in 6-7 countries a final list of 80
      questions, the preliminary Oslo COVID-19 QLQ - PW80 Â©, is ready to be tested in the current
      Phase III of the development process.

      The objectives of the phase III are:

        -  In a limited patient group, to check that the items make sense to the target population,
           that the phrasing and sequence of questions is acceptable, that there are no missing
           issues and that none of the questions are confusing and/or offensive (Phase IIIA).

        -  In addition, in a larger patient group, to test hypothesized subscales for psychometric
           properties including reliability, prevalence and variance (e.g. Cronbach's alpha
           coefficient and correlation-based methods) (Phase IIIB).

      The end-product, the international COVID-19- specific questionnaire, will be a
      psychometrically robust patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) to assess HRQoL in patients
      with or after COVID-19 disease
