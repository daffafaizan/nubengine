    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Non-inferiority of percent change in time of serum unconjugated estradiol levels, adjusted
      for baseline levels, following four up to six weeks of exemestane 25 mg given three times per
      week or one time per week compared with exemestane 25 mg daily dosing.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess safety and toxicity. II. To support the preventive activity of exemestane we
      will investigate the change in Ki-67 and progesterone receptor (PgR) levels in tumor cells
      and the adjacent intraepithelial neoplasia or benign histologic structures.

      III. To assess possible association of estradiol level with tissue and circulating
      biomarkers.

      IV. To investigate possible pharmacogenetic markers. V. To assess drug levels on tissue
      samples. VI. To investigate tissue proteomics profiling.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive exemestane orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-7.

      ARM II: Patients receive exemestane PO QD on days 1, 3, and 5. Patients also receive placebo
      PO QD on days 2, 4, 6, and 7.

      ARM III: Patients receive exemestane PO QD on day 1 and placebo PO QD on days 2-7.

      In all arms, cycles repeat every 7 days for 4-6 weeks in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then undergo surgery on days 29, 36, or 43.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 20-30 days.
