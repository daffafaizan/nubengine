      The co-primary endpoints were the duration of asparagine depletion < 2Âµmol/L and the
      incidence of asparaginase hypersensitivity during induction. Key secondary endpoints are
      complete remission (CR), minimal residual disease (MRD), event free survival (EFS) and
      overall survival (OS).The study was powered to detect 3-fold difference in the incidence of
      allergic reactions between treatments. patients will be randomized to GRASPA or to Reference
      L-asparaginase. Patients with history of hypersensitivity to previous L-asparaginase
      treatment will be treated with GRASPA (exploratory arm)
