      a prospective, multi-centered, randomized controlled, parallel-group study to compare the
      time to detect AF with portable handheld single lead ECG recorder versus conventional care in
      patients with history of ischemic stroke without documented AF. Patients will be randomly
      assigned in a 1:1 ratio to Home-based AF screening group and Control group.

      The home-based AF screening system comprises (1) a handheld single lead electrocardiogram
      (ECG) recorder (Comfit Healthcare Devices Limited, Hong Kong SAR, China), and (2) a
      patient-facing smartphone application specially designed for the study. Patients randomized
      to the home-based AF group will be instructed to record a 30-second single lead ECG using the
      handheld ECG device every morning or when symptomatic. In addition, all study participants
      will be instructed to measure and report their blood pressures in the morning and evening
      through the patient-facing smartphone application. In addition, all study participants will
      be encouraged to input their routine blood tests from the public hospitals through the
      smartphone application.

      All remotely obtained data will be automatically transmitted in real-time through the study
      smartphone application to a secured cloud hosting and displayed to display on a web-based
      dashboard at the clinicians' offices for review. All ECG recordings will be analyzed using an
      artificial intelligence based diagnosed system. When a diagnosis of AF is made with the
      system, the patients will be called back for a formal cardiology consultation and standard
      12-lead ECG to confirm the diagnosis within 1 week. This will be followed by echocardiogram
      and blood tests to determine the possible options of long-term anticoagulation therapy.
