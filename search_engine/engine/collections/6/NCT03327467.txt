    
      The primary purpose of this protocol is to enable access to sibling or autologous umbilical
      cord blood for children with various brain disorders. Children with autism, apraxia, cerebral
      palsy, hydrocephalus, hypoxic brain injury, stroke, and other brain injuries will be eligible
      if they do not qualify for or are unable to participate in another active clinical trial at
      Duke. Children with qualifying partially or fully matched sibling or autologous cord blood
      units will be eligible. The family will be enrolled on the screening protocol, "A Research
      Database and Screening Protocol for Children with Brain Injuries Potentially Undergoing
      Cellular Therapy or Other Clinical Trials," Pro00063563. Information may be obtained under
      this protocol including but not limited to: diagnostic information, genetic testing, videos
      and pictures of the child, cord blood report, etc. The PI or her designee will review this
      information to determine if the child might be eligible for a cord blood infusion(s) on this
      expanded access protocol.

      If eligible, the child must come to Duke with a parent or legal guardian for clinical
      evaluations and infusion of the umbilical cord blood unit. Parents will be required to
      participate in remote follow-up phone calls and be willing to complete questionnaires for
      safety follow-up.
