      carcinoma involving the lower urinary tract at 3 months, many patients suffer from multiple
      recurrences and progression in up to 1/3 of patients. While radical cystectomy is an
      effective local therapy for patients with high risk non-invasive disease, roughly 15% of
      patients will still develop progression. More importantly, the morbidity of radical
      cystectomy as described above represents a barrier to treatment in some individuals. Thus,
      there is a real need to identify newer therapies that reduce morbidity and improve outcomes
      in patients with non-invasive urothelial cancer. While multiple drug regimens have been the
      standard for many forms of cancer including invasive bladder cancer, few reports exist on
      multidrug regimens for non-invasive bladder cancer.

      The fundamentally agreed upon mechanism of action of BCG intravesical therapy for superficial
      bladder cancer is the generation of a non-specific immune response with the expression of
      cytokines by inflammatory cells resulting in tumor death. Cytokines produced by BCG therapy
      such as IFNÎ± may block vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) which is expressed in
      superficial and invasive bladder cancer and may provide a mechanism for disease progression.

      Sunitinib is an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor that blocks VEGF. Recent reports demonstrate
      clinical response in patients with metastatic bladder cancer treated with sunitinib after
      recurrence following standard chemotherapeutic regimens. The addition of sunitinib following
      BCG in order to consolidate VEGF inhibition may result in superior 3 month complete response
      rates. We know that patients who have a complete response to BCG at 3 months have improved
      disease.
