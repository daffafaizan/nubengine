      potential additive effects with a therapy intervention have not been explored in
      marijuana-dependent individuals. In the proposed study, the impact of intranasal oxytocin on
      therapy effectiveness and marijuana use outcomes following a brief therapy intervention will
      be investigated. It is hypothesized that oxytocin administration (vs. placebo) will improve
      treatment satisfaction and decrease marijuana use.
