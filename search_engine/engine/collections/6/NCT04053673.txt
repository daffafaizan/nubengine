    
      This is a first-in-human, Phase 1, multi-center, open-label, dose-escalation study to:

        -  Evaluate the safety profile and MTD of RBN-2397 administered orally and establish the
           RBN-2397 dose(s) and schedule(s) recommended for further investigation in Phase 2

        -  Characterize the PK profile of RBN-2397

        -  Identify preliminary antitumor activity.

        -  Biomarkers and their correlation with response to RBN-2397 and other outcomes will be
           examined.

      Cohorts will follow a traditional 3 + 3 design. After enrollment of the first participant
      within a cohort, there must be a wait period of at least 1 week before enrollment of
      additional participants in that cohort.

      After the MTD is determined, Expansion Cohort(s) of approximately 20 participants each will
      be enrolled to further examine the safety, PK, pharmacodynamics, and antitumor activity of
      RBN-2397 at the MTD or other dose recommended for further investigation. Based on nonclinical
      data as well as clinical data obtained from the dose-escalation portion of this study,
      enrollment in the Expansion Cohort(s) may be limited to specific tumor type(s), as warranted
      by the data.
