      hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative
      advanced breast cancer has shown to result in substantial improvements in progression-free
      survival. There is however no evidence that this combination strategy leads to an improved
      overall survival. Furthermore, no specific subgroups that will or will not benefit from the
      combination of drugs have been identified yet. This means the optimal strategy for deploying
      CDK 4/6 inhibitors in clinical practice is not yet known. Since CDK 4/6 inhibitors are costly
      and can have toxic effects, it is important to determine the optimal treatment strategy to
      avoid both over- and undertreatment.

      The SONIA-trial is an investigator-initiated, multicenter, randomized phase III study. The
      primary objective of this study is to evaluate if treatment with a non-steroidal aromatase
      inhibitor combined with CDK 4/6 inhibition in first line followed at progression by
      fulvestrant in second line (strategy A) improves progression-free survival compared to
      treatment with a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor in first line followed at progression by
      fulvestrant combined with CDK4/6 inhibition in second line (strategy B). The primary end
      point is progression-free survival after two lines (PFS2), secondary end points include
      overall survival, quality of life, safety and biomarker analyses.
