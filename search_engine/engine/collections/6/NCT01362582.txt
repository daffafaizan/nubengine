      early metastasis, and marked cachexia. Subjects are afflicted with a variety of disconcerting
      symptoms, including profound cachexia and deterioration in performance status, even when
      their tumour burden is low. Therefore, one of the most important therapeutic targets is the
      improvement of quality of life. Supplementation with parenteral nutrition improves Quality of
      Life in subjects with advanced cancer cachexia. The European Society of Parenteral and
      Enteral Nutrition recommend PN only for malnourished subjects but does not reflect situation
      in cancer cachexia patients At present, no 2nd-line therapy (or higher) is recommended for
      pancreatic adenocarcinoma, but often asked for.

      Within this clinical trial, we evaluate if parenteral nutrition in combination with
      chemotherapy in subjects with advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma have an impact on quality of
      life?
