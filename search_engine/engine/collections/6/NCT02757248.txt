    
      This is a non-randomized, unblinded single arm Phase I multi-center trial to determine the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination of volasertib and romidepsin in patients with
      relapsed/refractory peripheral T cell (PTCL) and cutaneous T cell (CTCL) lymphoma.

      Primary Objectives:

      1. Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination of romidepsin and volasertib
      in patients with relapsed/refractory peripheral T cell and cutaneous T cell lymphoma.

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. Evaluate the overall response rate (ORR) to the combination of romidepsin and volasertib
           in patients with relapsed/refractory peripheral T cell and cutaneous t cell lymphoma.

        2. Define gene expression signatures and patterns of acquired tumor mutations that
           dynamically correlate to clinical response to romidepsin/volasertib combination therapy
           in cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL) through longitudinal RNA sequencing of tumor
           samples.
