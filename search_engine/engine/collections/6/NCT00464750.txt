      been a mainstay of monitoring critically ill patients for more than thirty years. Recent
      studies have questioned wether the traditional practice of averaging measurements from tree
      room temperature thermal indicator injections give sufficient precision.

      This study tests the number of indicator injections necessary to be within 5 % of the "true"
      cardiac output (taken as the average of 16 injections) when the injection is synchronized
      with the respiration. The reliability of the thermodilution measurements are tested A) in
      sedated, artificially ventilated cardiac surgical patients and B) in the same patients when
      postoperatively awake and spontaneously breathing. We further compare the use of room
      temperature and iced thermal indicator injections.

      The study hypothesis is that when injections are synchronized with the respiration, only
      three injections at room temperature are needed to achieve the desired precision in
      mechanically ventilated patients.

      Only patients receiving a pulmonary artery catheter according our institution standard
      procedure of care will be included.
