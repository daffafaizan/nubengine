      between 40 and 75 years old, regardless of sex, recruited from the reference centers in
      neurology and physiotherapy in João Pessoa-PB. Participants will be randomized into three
      groups: Group 1 - ETCC over M1 + CPFDL; Group 2 - ETCC on M1 + APF; Group 3 - ETCC on M1. In
      each condition an initial baseline assessment (T0) will be performed after 16 treatment
      sessions (T1) and 30 days after the end of the protocol (Follow-up Assessment - T2). The
      evaluated outcomes will be: analysis of microstates and spectral analysis of frequencies by
      EEG; dual task capability with Timed Up and Go (TUG); executive function (Stroop test and
      verbal fluency test); motor aspects of daily life (MDS UPDRS II). For all analyzes, the
      statistical software SPSS (SPSS Inc, Chicago IL, USA) for Windows, Version 20.0, will be used
      and statistical significance considered at 5% (p ≤ 0.05).
