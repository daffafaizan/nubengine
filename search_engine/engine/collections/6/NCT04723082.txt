    
      To achieve this study recruited volunteers (n=128), aged 18 years and older will visit the
      Rowett Institute at the University of Aberdeen for one occasion, their body composition will
      be measured by 4 methods: DXA, BOD POD, Tanita scales and deuterium dilution and their
      consumption of SSBs will be assessed using 24h dietary recall (once in the lab and once at
      home over the phone). In addition, a urine sample will be collected and assessed for
      potential markers of sugar. Individuals will have a blood sample (5 ml) taken to determine
      genetic variation in their taste receptors and they will also undergo a taste test using
      randomised tasting of a panel of 9 different sugar solutions measured in triplicate (in total
      they will taste 27 little cups).

      The researcher will advise all the study subjects to come to a designated room in the Rowett
      Research Institute to complete the measurement regime at a pre-determined time between 6:30
      am - 3:00 pm on their appointment day with about 2 participants per day. Each subject will
      take 4 hours to complete. Volunteers will complete informed consent before starting
      participate in the study:

      Phase I:

        -  Pregnancy test

        -  Demographic questionnaire

        -  24-h recall of SSB intake (face to face and phone interview)

        -  Deuterium dilution

        -  Early morning urine sample

        -  Measuring weight and height (BMI)
