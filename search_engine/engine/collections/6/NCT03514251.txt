      parathyroid marker method was used to mark the parathyroid gland at the first time when it
      shows, and this marker was further used to identify and locating the inferior parathyroid
      marker in subsequent central region dissection. In the control group, the central area was
      routinely cleaned without suture parathyroid marker .
