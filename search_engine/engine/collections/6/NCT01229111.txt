      I. To determine the response rate to AZD2171 (cediranib maleate) and modified folinic
      acid-fluorouracil-oxaliplatin-6 regimen (FOLFOX 6) in subjects with advanced biliary cancers.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine overall assessment of toxicity of AZD2171 and modified FOLFOX6. II. To
      determine the progression-free survival of subjects with advanced biliary cancers treated
      with AZD2171 and modified FOLFOX6.

      III. To determine overall survival of subjects with advanced biliary cancers treated with
      AZD2171 and modified FOLFOX6.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive cediranib maleate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-14 and modified
      FOLFOX6 comprising oxaliplatin intravenously (IV) over 2 hours, leucovorin calcium IV over 2
      hours, and fluorouracil IV over 46 hours on day 1. Courses repeat every 14 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year,
      every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.
