      increasing dose levels. Participant safety and efficacy during part I will determine the
      doses used for Part II. In part II participants will be enrolled into one of two sequential
      treatment arms using two of the doses defined in part 1 of the study. Part II was 5 cohorts,
      3 with 8 milligram per kilogram (mg/kg) and 2 with 16 mg/kg. Part I and all but the last
      cohort in Part II were dosed with Phase 1/ 2 drug product. The last cohort in Part II was
      dosed with Phase 3 drug product. Both Part I and Part II are open-label/unmasked.
