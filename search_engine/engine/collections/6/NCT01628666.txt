    
      This is a randomized prospective cluster crossover trial to track outcomes of high infection
      risk patients undergoing arrhythmia device procedures. Centres will be randomized to either
      conventional antibiotic therapy or incremental antibiotic therapy. Patients will not be
      randomized. Centres will be randomized to one therapy and then cross over to the next after 6
      months. At one year they will randomize again and then cross over for the final time at 18
      months. During each treatment period the randomized antibiotic therapy will be used on all
      centre patients undergoing a device implant procedure.

      Ethics approval has been obtained in all sites for waiver of consent with notification of the
      study (i.e. data collection is taking place to track infection rates). A third of sites
      obtain consent after the procedure for collection of data (but not for care, since either arm
      is the standard of care).
