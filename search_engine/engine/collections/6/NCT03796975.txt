      hydrochloride and metformin hydrochloride tablets on hepatic fat ultrasound and liver enzyme
      levels, and observed whether the drug can improve fatty liver in patients with newly
      diagnosed type 2 diabetes combined with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. This is an
      multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-controlled study.
