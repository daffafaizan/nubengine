      face, neck, and upper trunk. These sebaceous follicles have follicular channels and adjacent
      multiacinar sebaceous glands. In the lubrication process of normal skin, sebum travels
      through the follicular canal to the skin surface, carrying along with it desquamated cells
      from follicular epithelium. Acne develops when these specialized follicles undergo pathologic
      alterations that result in the formation of non-inflammatory lesions (comedones) and
      inflammatory lesions (papules, pustules, and nodules).

      The basic cause of acne remains unknown, but its manifestations are thought to be the product
      of four pathogenic events: 1) increased sebum production fueled by androgenic stimulation in
      the pubertal period; 2) obstruction of the pilosebaceous unit due to an abnormal
      keratinization process; 3) proliferation of Propionibacterium acnes, an anaerobic diptheroid
      normally residing in pilosebaceous follicles; and 4) inflammation that is mediated both by
      the action of chemotactic factors and various enzymes, and initiated in part by the
      interaction of P. acnes with toll-like receptors. Impaction of the pilosebaceous follicle
      gives rise to the microcomedo that is thought to be the precursor lesion of acne.

      Topical benzoyl peroxide is a common and well-established agent with known antibacterial and
      antimicrobial properties used in the treatment of acne vulgaris. The safety profile for
      topical benzoyl peroxide has been well delineated. The most common side effects attributed to
      benzoyl peroxide products include irritation, dryness, scaling, burning and stinging.

      Benzoyl peroxide 10.0% creams (Formulation #1 and Formulation #2) will be evaluated to detect
      any differences in their response for safety and efficacy.
