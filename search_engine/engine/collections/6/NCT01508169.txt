      be a feasible strategy for improving postural control.The objective of this study was to
      determine if foot orthoses (with metatarsal pad and medial arch support) are effective as an
      adjuvant treatment to improve balance, foot pain and disability in elderly women with
      osteoporosis. Another purpose was to verify if social demographic and clinical factors such
      as age, race, education, marital status, age of menopause, use of drugs related to balance
      dysfunction, visual or hearing complaints, body mass index, previous fractures and number of
      falls may influence the results.
