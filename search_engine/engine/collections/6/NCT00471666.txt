      concurrently with malarial parasites. In Mali, lymphatic filariasis due to Wuchereria
      bancrofti co-exists in several regions highly endemic for malaria, and co-infection is common
      in the residents of these areas. Because of the chronicity of filarial infections and an
      associated bias towards the development of an adaptive immune response dominated by Th2
      cytokines, a pre-existing filarial infection has the potential to alter the immune response
      towards incoming malarial parasites, clearance of which are considered to be dependent on a
      robust Th1 response. This could, in turn, affect the clinical manifestations and outcomes of
      malaria infection. Conversely, immune responses to filarial parasites may be modulated in the
      presence of malarial parasites. In addition to sharing a human host, Plasmodium falciparum
      and Wuchereria bancrofti are transmitted by the same mosquito vector, Anopheles gambiae, and
      interaction between the two species in the vector may have important implications for
      transmission of these two infections. The primary goals of this study are to determine the
      effect of concurrent infections with P. falciparum and W. bancrofti parasites on the
      prevalence and severity of malaria infection in children living in a Malian village
      co-endemic for two parasites and to assess the effects of co-infection on the immune
      responses to these two parasites over the course of the malaria transmission season. The
      epidemiology of co-infection at the human and vector level will also be examined.
