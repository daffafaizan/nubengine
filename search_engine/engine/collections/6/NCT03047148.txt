      and anesthesia is dependent on the basic anesthesia technique (General vs. regional
      anesthesia). The patients' post-anesthesia presentation encompasses vital respiratory and
      hemodynamic parameters as well as subjective signs of well-being such as absence of nausea,
      vomiting and a low pain level. By pair matching of patient records after regional anesthesia
      with otherwise similar patients after general anesthesia (control group), the rate of
      postoperative complications in the 2 groups will be compared. The results of this
      investigation will help to answer what is the difference in complication rates and wellbeing
      of patients depending on their previous anesthesia. The results of this study will Show which
      basic anesthesia technique has more or less early complications.
