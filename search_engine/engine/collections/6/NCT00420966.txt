      children. Infection due to RSV represents a large public health burden; in Canada, it
      accounts for 5,800 hospitalizations annually. The peak incidence of RSV disease occurs
      between 2-6 months of age with half of all infants infected in the first year of life.
      Palivizumab has been approved for the prevention of serious lower respiratory tract disease
      caused by RSV in pediatric patients at high-risk of RSV disease. These children include those
      born premature, those with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), and those with hemodynamically
      significant congenital heart disease (CHD).

      With the recent approval of palivizumab in Canada, access to this medication has increased.
      However, there are limited data on utilization, compliance, and health outcomes, particularly
      the frequency and severity of RSV infections. The primary objective of this study is to
      provide insight into the current management (utilization, compliance) of children at
      high-risk of RSV infection with palivizumab prophylaxis in the tertiary care centers and
      community settings through the development of a Canadian Registry Database.
