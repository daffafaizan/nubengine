    
      The objective of the study is to determine, through a randomized cluster trial, the
      effectiveness of problem-solving therapy offered through a web platform on self-perceived
      stress levels.

      Overall objective Evaluate the effect of Problem Solving Therapy offered through a web
      platform, on the self-perceived stress level of administrative workers.

      Specific objectives

        -  Develop and validate a web platform with problem-solving therapy.

        -  Determine the cut-off point of self-perceived stress measurement scales.

        -  Evaluate the factors associated with stress in office workers.

        -  Compare the levels of Perceived stress scale (PSS) before and after the use of a web
           platform with educational material in Problem Solving Therapy (PST).

        -  Compare the effect of a conventional platform versus the Problem Solving Therapy offered
           through a web platform on self-perceived stress levels.

        -  Compare the levels of occupational stress (OSS) before and after the use of a web
           platform with educational material in Problem Solving Therapy (PST).

        -  Compare the effect of Problem Solving Therapy offered through a web platform versus a
           conventional web platform on work stress levels (WSS).

        -  Evaluate the correlation between the perceived stress scale and the occupational stress
           scale (OSS).
