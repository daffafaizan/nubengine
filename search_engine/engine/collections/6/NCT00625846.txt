      I. To establish the safety and efficacy of GW786034 (pazopanib hydrochloride) as a
      therapeutic in patients afflicted with differentiated, medullary and anaplastic thyroid
      cancers.

      CORRELATIVE OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assessment of the impact of therapy with GW786034 on serum/plasma vascular endothelial
      growth factor (VEGF) levels.

      II. To explore the potential relationship between changes in thyroglobulin levels and tumor
      response in patients with advanced differentiated thyroid cancer known to be thyroglobulin
      antibody negative.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pazopanib hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Cycles
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for up to 3
      years after registration.
