      different reasons in our institution were recruited from August 2013 to August 2016. 80
      patients meet the criteria of PJI from the muscle and skeletal muscle Association (MSIS) are
      divided to the infection group, another 80 patients are divided into the non-infection group.

      Medical and demographic data were recorded. Collected lab examinations included blood routine
      test, C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), synovial leukocyte
      counts, Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve-Area Under Curve (ROC-AUC) analysis will be
      used to evaluate the specific and sensitivity of diagnosis index. Moreover,microorganisms
      isolated from periprosthetic tissues and articular fluid. Postoperatively, the prosthesis was
      sent for ultrasound sonication. The sonicate extraction, implant surrounding tissue and
      synovium were sent for microbiologic culture, and the implant-surrounding-tissue were also
      sent for pathological examination. The isolated strains and drug-resistance rate for each
      bacterium for different antibiotics were presented.
