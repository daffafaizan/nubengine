      standard approaches in clinical routine (e.g. in patients with low back pain). Numerous CT
      needle navigation systems have been developed with the aim to improve accuracy (and thus
      safety) of punctures while decreasing radiation exposure and procedure time. Their usability
      in clinical routine is limited either because of high sensitivity to interference, high
      expenses, bulkiness, or incompatibly with daily clinical practice and thus increasing
      procedure time and workflow complexity. The Puncture Cube® takes into account all these
      requirements. Furthermore, in an in vitro-phantom study (study submitted for publication),
      punctures with the Cube were found to be faster and more accurate compared to the free-hand
      conventional method.

      In a prospective, randomized, controlled, parallel group study the accuracy, intervention
      time and radiation dose of CT-guided punctures using the Puncture Cube® will be compared to
      the conventional free-hand method in patients requiring a percutaneous diagnostic or
      therapeutic CT-guided intervention for lumbar pain (facet joint-, nerve root-, epidural
      infiltrations at the lumbar/lumbosacral level).
