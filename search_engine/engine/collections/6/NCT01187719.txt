      half-life of NVP as it has also shown a significant difference in the elimination half-life
      of NVP in the ENVI study and side effects were also transient and mild. The guidelines for
      ARV prophylaxis for PMTCT has been changed to a more complex regimen. Therefore addition of
      phenytoin OD for 7 days after delivery will not complicate the regimen for the mother.

      Tanzania and Zambia are among the countries in sub-Saharan Africa most affected by the HIV
      pandemic. In 2008, an estimated 85,000 children were living with HIV in Zambia and out of the
      89,000 children born to HIV infected women, 28,000 are infected annually. In Tanzania,
      140,000 children were living with HIV in 2007. Both countries use NVP alone or in combination
      with other drugs as ARV prophylaxis for PMTCT. Little data are available on the extent of NVP
      resistance in the Tanzanian, Zambian PMTCT setting. Moreover, there is no data available on
      the follow-up of mother-infant pair with particular focus on resistance to NVP and the
      infants HIV status. No studies have explored possibilities of reducing NVP resistance by use
      of an enzyme inducer.

      This study seeks to the effect of phenytoin on the pharmacokinetics of NVP and the
      development of NVP resistance on SD NVP as part of the ARV prophylaxis for PMTCT. This
      intervention will be part of the VITA2 trial to test the hypothesis that phenytoin reduces
      the elimination half life of SD NVP and thereby decreases development of resistance to NVP in
      HIV positive pregnant Tanzanian and Zambian women.
