      were collected. Data of Triglycerides, cholesterol, Low-density lipoprotein and High-density
      lipoprotein were collected perioperatively. The postoperative major cardiovascular and
      cerebral events were also identified and collected. Other data including perioperative
      information and surgeries and anesthesia data were gathered.

      Logistic regression models were built and selected. Independent risk factors relative to
      postoperative major cardiovascular and cerebral events were screened and identified.
      different levels of Triglycerides, cholesterol, Low-density lipoprotein and High-density
      lipoprotein were analysed.
