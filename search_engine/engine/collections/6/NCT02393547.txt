      varenicline. The investigators will obtain preliminary data on the efficacy of lorcaserin (10
      mg twice daily) for 12 weeks in 20 adult weight-concerned cigarette smokers with a BMI of 27
      to 40 simultaneously receiving 12 weeks of open-label varenicline and a behavioral
      intervention to assist with stopping smoking. Secondary aims will be weight, waist
      circumference, and smoking cessation.
