      and Type 2 diabetes mellitus. One factor strongly associated with the development of obesity
      and Type 2 diabetes mellitus disparities in children is low physical activity levels. Low
      physical activity is more prevalent in African-American girls, pointing to the critical need
      for effective physical activity interventions. For a physical activity intervention message
      to be effective among African-American girls, the program must be enjoyable and tailored to
      African-American girls and women. One possibility for an appropriate physical activity
      intervention is afro-centric dance, which has strong cultural and historical significance in
      the African-American community. This form of physical activity may provide girls with
      sustained bouts of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. There appears to be a strong
      positive correlation between parental and children physical activity levels. In the
      African-American culture, maternal health behaviors in particular have a strong influence on
      children's health behaviors. Currently, there are no studies that examine the effects of a
      daughter-mother Afro-centric dance program on the physical activity levels of
      African-American girls. Therefore, the purpose of this study will be to examine the
      feasibility and efficacy of a 12-week physical activity intervention consisting of
      afro-centric dance and its ability to affect the physical activity levels of African-American
      girls. If investigators identify afro-centric dance as a sustainable form of physical
      activity for African-American daughters and mothers, investigators can use this intervention
      to significantly reduce obesity and Type 2 diabetes mellitus in these groups.
