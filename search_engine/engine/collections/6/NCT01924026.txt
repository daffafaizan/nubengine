    
      The following personal/medical information will be collected and reviewed:

        -  Evaluation of current and past medical history, including psychological treatment such
           as medication and counseling/therapy.

        -  Mutational analysis for each MHP subject

        -  Detailed history of educational, employment, relationship, and socioeconomic
           status/achievements as a measure of successful transition to adulthood

        -  Diet history, including past treatment with medical food or Sapropterin (Kuvan) for
           pre-conceptual and pregnancy Phe management

        -  All available untreated Phe levels, including newborn screening results (where possible)
           will be collated to calculate lifetime mean Phe level. Age at collections will be
           recorded separately for each MHP subjects to ensure inclusion of Phe levels beyond
           infancy

      The following clinical investigations will be administered:

        -  Measurement of Phe and Tyrosine after an overnight fast, via blood spot using tandem
           mass spectrometry analysis. Blood spot collection will be done at the same time of day
           for all subjects.

        -  Physical exam, height and weight measurements

        -  Food Frequency Questionnaire assessment to estimate typical daily intake of natural
           protein.

        -  Self-Report Questionnaires:

             -  Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF)-A

             -  Beck Anxiety Inventory

             -  Beck Depression Inventory

             -  Quality of Life questionnaire

        -  Neuropsychological Tests assessed by a trained psychologist

      An informant BRIEF-A report will be completed for each subject. To ensure consistency in
      rating, the same informant will be used where possible for the MHP subject and their sibling
      control (i.e. parents). These questionnaires will be mailed to the informants and returned to
      the study site via FedEx.
