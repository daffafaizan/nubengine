      membranes with resulting cell death. This process has been shown to ablate tumors in animal
      and human studies. A pulsating direct current of 20 to 50 A and 500 to 3000 V is delivered
      into metastatic or primary tumors in the liver, kidney, or lung via needle electrodes
      inserted under computed tomography (CT) or ultrasound guidance. Patients usually require
      general anesthesia with muscle relaxant. Currently, circa 30 procedures have been done at our
      institution with good or excellent results. However, several patients have had severe pain
      postoperatively.

      Dexmedetomidine is an α2-adrenoreceptor agonist with sedative, analgesic and anxiolytic
      effects, and it has more selective α2-adrenergic effect than clonidine. We will evaluate
      perioperative dexmedetomidine 0.4 µg/kg/hr infusion effects on hemodynamics, anesthetic
      consumption, and recovery profiles during anesthesia for IRE of solid organs tumours.
