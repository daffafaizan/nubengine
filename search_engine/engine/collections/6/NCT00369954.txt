      Primary

        -  Determine the progression-free survival of patients with persistent or recurrent
           platinum-sensitive ovarian epithelial, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer
           treated with gemcitabine hydrochloride and intraperitoneal carboplatin.

        -  Evaluate the systemic and regional toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes followed by intraperitoneal
      carboplatin on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients will be accrued for this study.
