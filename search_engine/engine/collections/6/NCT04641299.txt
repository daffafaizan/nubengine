    
      This is a randomized parallel, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging Phase 2b study
      in approximately 108 participants with dyslipidemia. The primary objective of the study is to
      investigate the effect of AZD8233 on LDL-C across different dose levels. The study will be
      conducted at up to 25 sites in up to 4 countries.

      The screening period starts up to 42 days before the randomization visit and ends on Day -1.
      Eligible participants will attend 7 visits during the treatment period and 7 additional
      visits during the safety follow up period. Eligible participants are randomized across four
      different treatment arms in a 1:1:1:1 ratio for a 12-week treatment period. The planned
      treatment arms are AZD8233 low dose, AZD8233 medium dose, AZD8233 high dose, and Placebo.
      Participants will be dosed SC on Days 1, 8, 29, and 57.
