      alternative to traditional immunosuppressive therapies for the treatment of systemic lupus
      erythematosus (SLE, lupus). Too frequently, aggressive therapies are inadequate in the
      control of the disease and have potent side effects and complications. The collection and
      expansion of one's own T cells harnesses a naturally occurring regulatory mechanism to
      restore self-tolerance in people with lupus. Tregs are a specialized subset of T cells that
      function to control the immune response. Studies have shown that in active lupus, the numbers
      and function of Treg cells are significantly decreased, which contributes to an overactive
      immune system and an increase in disease activity. The hope is that these naturally occurring
      Treg cells can be used for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, including lupus.
