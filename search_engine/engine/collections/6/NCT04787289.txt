      7.5mg/kg per dose vs. 15mg/kg per dose, given in combination with chemotherapy in patients
      with ovarian cancer that progressed on platinum chemotherapy. Higher doses in cases of
      antibody-based drugs like bevacizumab are not always better than lower doses, and in fact can
      cause more side effects without improving survival or shrinkage of cancer. Both 7.5 and
      15mg/kg doses of bevacizumab every 3 weeks are used as standard protocol in BC Cancer for
      ovarian cancer patients, but only 15mg/kg doses are allowed for patients with ovarian cancer
      that progressed on platinum chemotherapy. This study is a pragmatic two-arm blinded study in
      which 70 patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer and eligible for bevacizumab +
      chemotherapy will be randomly assigned either to lower or higher standard dose of bevacizumab
      , combined with chemotherapy. Treating clinicians will decide how long the treatment will
      continue per standard of care. Duration of cancer control on CT scans, side effect profiles,
      and quality of life related to the two arms will be compared. If demonstrated, this finding
      will be practice-changing, with comparable efficacy and quality of life, potentially improved
      safety profile, as well as reduced provincial drug costs.
