      less than 18 years old presenting with ASD. A 6-month double-blind treatment period will be
      performed in which efficacy and safety of bumetanide 0.5mg BID will be assessed versus
      placebo. This double-blind period will be followed by a 6-month open label treatment period
      of bumetanide 0.5mg BID in which long term safety will be evaluated.
