      nodules(GGNs) and makes complete surgical resection impossible. At the same time, there is no
      good solution for the remaining GGNs after resection of the main lesion. Theoretically,
      pre-operative anti-PD-1 therapy is optimal for promoting anti-tumor immune response on the
      basis of maximum tumor mutational burden (TMB). In addition, neoadjuvant immunotherapy should
      have long-term anti-tumor effect even after surgery, because tumor recurrence may cause
      memory cells activation and differentiation. This is a pilot study to analysis the
      pathological remission rate of neoadjuvant immunotherapy and adverse events related to the
      treatment
