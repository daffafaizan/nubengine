      a different primary mode of action. It acts primarily as an inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase
      II, exerting its cytotoxic effects by stabilizing a topoisomerase II mediated cleavable
      complex. This inhibition is significantly more than that seen in doxorubicin, which, in
      contrast, tends to demonstrate more DNA intercalation than amrubicin.

      It has not yet been evaluated for use in thymic malignancies, but given its efficacy in NSCLC
      and small cell lung cancer (SCLC), as well as the known efficacy of other anthracyclines and
      topoisomerase II inhibitors in first-line thymoma treatment, it warrants study for use in the
      second line and beyond in refractory or relapsed patients. Unlike doxorubicin, amrubicin has
      had minimal cardiotoxicity even with ongoing use, which also makes it a promising agent for
      use in the second line even for patients who have previously been exposed to, and potentially
      helped by, doxorubicin.
