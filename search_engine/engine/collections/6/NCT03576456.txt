      premedication before coronary angiography could be used to reduce anxiety and pain, but
      evidence is lacking. Previous trials were predominantly conducted in men and in coronary
      interventions with femoral access. Recently, radial access has become the preferred route for
      performing coronary angiograms (RIVAL trial) In this setting, sedative premedication could be
      of interest to reduce radial spasms, patient anxiety and pain.
