      centre, randomized to be treated exclusively with a single FVIII product either
      plasma-derived or recombinant, and followed up until inhibitor development or until 50
      exposure days (EDs) or 3 years from enrolment have elapsed, whichever comes first. Study
      products, belonging to the class of rFVIII concentrates and to the class of plasma-derived
      VWF/FVIII concentrates, will be provided for free to the patients for all the duration of the
      study
