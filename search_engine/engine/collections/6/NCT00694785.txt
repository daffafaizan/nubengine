    
      ARC1779 will be investigated in an open-label, uncontrolled study in up to 3 vWD-2B patients.
      Patients with vWD-2B will be screened for eligibility based primarily upon a single major
      criterion, i.e., presence of any degree of chronic thrombocytopenia. Eligible patients will
      be treated by intravenous infusion of ARC1779 for 72 hours.
