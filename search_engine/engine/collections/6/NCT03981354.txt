      patients undergoing hip surgery, thus preventing an effective application a nutritional
      support program. It is therefore necessary to start identifying the clinical steps
      (pre-operative and post-operative) that may be defined as critical control points for
      malnutrition. Patients undergoing hip surgery would be enrolled before the surgical operation
      and would be evaluated three times: preoperative, postoperative, and after discharge. The
      observation should foresee the identification of nutritional status indicators, such as
      weight, hemoglobin, albumin, food intake, and others that might affect a proper recovery.
      This study aims to investigate the prognostic nutritional factors that might influence
      clinical outcomes, and their variation in relation to hospitalization and rehabilitation
      periods.
