      independent prognostic models for short-term serious adverse events in pulmonary embolism
      (PE) patients. The target population is emergency department (ED) patients with confirmed
      acute PE within 12 hours of ED presentation. The primary outcome is a composite of death,
      delayed circulatory or respiratory dysfunction, hypoxia, and reperfusion intervention within
      five days of PE diagnosis. Secondary outcomes will be nonfatal bleeding, recurrence of venous
      thromboembolism, and hypoxia requiring oxygen supplementation.

      The specific aims are: 1) determine the incidence of death, circulatory and respiratory
      deterioration, and administration of reperfusion therapy within five days of PE; 2) determine
      functional outcomes 30 days after PE using the Pulmonary Embolism Quality of Life
      Questionnaire; 3) evaluate the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative likelihood
      ratios of each RVD assessment tool for clinical deterioration within five days of PE; and 4)
      derive a prediction model for clinical deterioration within five days of PE diagnosis.

      Patients with confirmed PE will be assessed for hemodynamic stability at presentation, and
      then will be assessed for RVD. Normotensive PE patients without RVD will be assessed by a
      clinically derived model (sPESI or HESTIA) to determine if they are low risk or
      intermediate-low risk. The investigators will then determine incidence of the clinical
      endpoints during the subsequent 5 days, as well as 30 days later. The 30-day follow-up will
      also include administration of the validated Pulmonary Embolism Quality of Life questionnaire
      (PEmbQoL).
