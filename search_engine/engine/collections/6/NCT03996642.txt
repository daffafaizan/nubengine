      meaningful whole, providing a balanced view of the past, present and future. Life review is
      also an evaluative process, enabling participants to examine how memories contribute to the
      meaning of their life.

      VoicingHan, the software program that will be used in this study, provides an illusion that
      the Avatar is speaking, allowing users to observe their stories in real time, potentially
      encouraging deeper reflection and memory retrieval. The technology uses motion capture
      (MoCap) to translate human movement into a digital platform. MoCap offers several advantages:
      lightweight, sensitive to minute movement, and user-friendly.

      Patients will select avatars from different age groups during their sessions, allowing them
      to retrieve specific, positive memories of different lifetime periods and facilitating a more
      candid autobiographical memory. Creative expression may serve as a vehicle for patients with
      a life limiting illness in finding purpose and creating a sense of meaning. The integration
      of art and technology into a storytelling, life-review platform through means of engaging the
      physical, psychological, and spiritual domains will support patients to contemplate their own
      mortality.
