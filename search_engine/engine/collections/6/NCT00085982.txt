      Patients with mutations of the insulin receptor have diabetes that is challenging to control
      withconventional therapies, leading to early morbidity and mortality. We hypothesize that
      recombinant leptin (metrel eptin) in these patients will improve glycemia control.

      Objectives:

      Primary Objective: To determine if 1 year of metreleptin will improve glycemia control in
      patients with genetic defects of the insulin receptor. Secondary Objectives: To determine
      mechanisms by which metreleptin improves glycemia.

      Endpoints:

      Primary Endpoint: Hemoglobin A1c

      Secondary Endpoints: fasting plasma glucose, fasting insulin, glucose/insulin area under the
      curve during oral glucose tolerance test.

      Study Population:

      20 male or female patients with mutations of the insulin receptor, age (Bullet)5 years, at
      the NIH Clinical Center.

      Description of Sites/Facilities Enrolling Participants: Description of Study Intervention:

      NIH Clinical Center

      Open label study of metreleptin, 0.2 mg/kg/day (max dose 0.24 mg/kg/day).
