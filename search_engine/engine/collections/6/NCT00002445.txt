      are randomized equally to receive either IM862 or placebo given intranasally every other day.
      Patients are seen every 4 weeks for 6 months or until disease progression to evaluate
      toxicity and efficacy. Quality of life is assessed before treatment, then every month for 6
      months. At the end of the 6-month study evaluation period, patients with PR/CR (responders)
      remain on study and continue blinded treatment for an additional 6 months. For patients with
      stable disease (non-responders), the treatment assignment is unblinded and off-study IM862
      compassionate use is offered for 6 months, regardless of treatment group. For patients with
      documented progressive disease (treatment failure), the treatment assignment is unblinded and
      off-study IM862 is offered for 6 months to any patient in the placebo group. For treatment
      failures in the IM862 group, IM862 is stopped and the patient is allowed other therapy
      options.
