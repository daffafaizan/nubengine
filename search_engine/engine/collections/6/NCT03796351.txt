    
      This is a randomised, double-blind, intra-individual controlled, dose escalation study to
      assess the safety, tolerability and preliminary effectiveness of a single dose of MT10107 in
      comparison to Botox®50U (BOTOX® is a registered trademark owned by Allergan). This is the
      first-in-human study for MT10107, and will be performed in healthy volunteers.

      Subjects will be administered a single equivalent dose of MT10107 and Botox®50U by
      intramuscular injection to the EDB muscles of contralateral feet. Five cohorts of eligible
      subjects will be studied; Group A (2 U dose), Group B (5 U dose), Group C (10 U dose), Group
      D (20 U dose) and Group E (30 U dose).

      The foot in which each drug is to be administered (i.e. left or right) will be assigned in a
      randomized manner.
