      care physiotherapy, compared to usual care physiotherapy, on functional recovery in
      critically ill children. We will conduct a qualitative substudy to evaluate caregiver
      impressions of the intervention, and to understand barriers and facilitators to implementing
      early mobilization in critically ill children.
