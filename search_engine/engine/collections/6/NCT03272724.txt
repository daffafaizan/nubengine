    
      All the clinical, biological, microbiological and laboratory describing the history of
      patients and their evolution during hospitalization for infective endocarditis will be
      obtained from physicians supporting patients and recorded in an electronic case report form.
      Will include collected clinical characteristics (site, pre-existing heart disease underlying
      symptoms, complications), biological characteristics (dosage on admission and diagnosis),
      microbiological characteristics (identifying the genus and species of the microorganism
      responsible, sensitivity to antibiotics susceptibility testing and evaluated by determination
      of minimal inhibiting concentration (MIC), exhaustive search of the rare forms of
      endocarditis uncultivated microorganisms), an analysis of the gateways based on the causative
      organism; echocardiographic characteristics (number and size of vegetations, valvular damage,
      scalable: surgery, lethality) and therapeutic characteristics (antibiotic treatment,
      surgical).
