      with advanced cancer and Part B (Expansion) in subjects with untreated advanced pancreatic
      cancer.

      Up to 60 evaluable subjects (i.e., subjects who complete at least 1 cycle (28 days) of
      therapy) will be enrolled, assuming that:

        1. Part A: The maximum sample size will be 6 subjects up to 4 dose levels (exclusive of
           replacement subjects). However, additional subjects may be added if exploration of
           intermediate dose level(s) of VS 4718 is warranted. The starting dose of VS-4718 will be
           200mg BID.

        2. Part B: Up to 36 additional subjects may be enrolled at the RP2D. These subjects will be
           randomized at a 1:1 ratio to 1 of 2 treatment cohorts:

             -  Cohort 1: IV treatment in 28-day cycles (nab-paclitaxel 125 mg/m2 over 30 minutes
                on Days 1, 8, and 15 and gemcitabine at 1000 mg/m2 over 30 minutes on Days 1, 8,
                and 15) and oral VS 4718 BID continuously starting on Day 1 of Cycle 1

             -  Cohort 2: IV treatment for the first 2 cycles, followed by IV treatment and oral
                VS-4718 BID continuously starting on Day 1 of Cycle 3
