      structures characterized by vegetations on valves and other endocardial surfaces, with tissue
      destruction and risk of embolization.

      The clinical variability, including the heterogeneous response to infection and the different
      antibiotic treatments make the identification of the underlying pathogens of infective
      endocarditis (IE) is critical for precision therapy. Virulence factors mediate tissue
      adherence, host infiltration, immune resistance/evasion, and dynamic stress responses and
      confer enhanced pathogen survival, proliferation, and host invasion in animal models of
      infective endocarditis.

      To identify the microorganism and simultaneously considered the response of the host to the
      infection could improve the management of the infective endocarditis.
