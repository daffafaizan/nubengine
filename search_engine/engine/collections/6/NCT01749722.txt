      real-time removal of pre-cancerous polyps during the examination. It is well known that
      lesions are missed during routine colonoscopy.5 major reasons can be detailed for missing
      polyps during colonoscopy: polyps that are hidden behind folds, polyps that are masked by the
      colon's topography and natural folds, shallow polyps, unscreened portions of the colon (due
      to incomplete colonoscopy) and endoscope slippage. The NaviAid™ G-Eye system presents a
      unique concept that overcomes all 5 items listed above, providing an overall solution to the
      two endoscopy key challenges of limited detection/treatment yield and limited operation
      range.

      The G-Eye endoscope comprises a standard endoscope onto which a unique balloon is permanently
      integrated, at its bending section. The NaviAid™ G-Eye may be used for performing controlled
      withdrawal and endoscope stabilization.

      A major attribute of the NaviAid™ G-Eye system controlled withdrawal technique of the
      endoscope, with the balloon moderately inflated is to expand and stretch the intestinal lumen
      during endoscope withdrawal.

      This is a single-center, non randomized open-label study intended to evaluate the serious
      adverse events prevalence when using the NaviAid™ G-Eye system during colonoscopy.
