        1. Basic assessment of medicines that were actually taken (brown bag review) by a general
           practice based health care assistant (HCA) and

        2. Checklist-based (MediMoL - Medication-Monitoring-List) pre-consultation interview on
           problems relating to medicines (technical handling, potential adverse drug reactions)
           and patient's therapeutic aims by HCA provides structured information in the
           Medication-Monitoring-List (MediMoL) for the general practitioner (GP) and enables
           patients to discuss their problems with the GP.

        3. GP uses a computerized decision support system (pharmaceutical information system, AiD+)
           to optimize medication (reducing number of inappropriate prescriptions, e.g.
           pharmaceutical interactions, renal dose adjustments, duplicate prescriptions) and

        4. prioritizes medication in the physician-patient consultation taking into consideration
           patient's preferences.
