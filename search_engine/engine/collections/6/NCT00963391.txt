      with intermittent tap water availability. A total of 1727 children between 1 and 5 years of
      age distributed in 42 childcare centers participated in the study. The intervention consisted
      on installation of ABHS gel dispensers and training on their use by participating children in
      child care centers. Centers assigned to the control group were recommended to continue with
      current hand hygiene practices. Child care centers matched by location, size and sanitary
      conditions were randomly assigned to intervention or control. Cases of Acute Diarrheal
      Disease (ADD) and Acute Respiratory Infections ARI were identified through teacher reported
      signs and symptoms of disease and validated by a trained physician. We also monitored adverse
      events potentially related to ABHS. To compare incidence rates between study arms we modeled
      the number of episodes of ADD and ARI per child using a Cox proportional hazards multiple
      regression with random effects.
