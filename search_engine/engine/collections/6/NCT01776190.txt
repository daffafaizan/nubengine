      week for 10 weeks. Each treatment will take less than 30 minutes. This period will be
      followed by an eight-week observation phase to assess longer term effects of the treatment.
      Patients will be assessed for disease activity, and blood studies and photos will be
      completed prior to, during, and after phototherapy treatment. Optional skin biopsies of
      affected and unaffected skin will be performed at the beginning and end of the active
      treatment phase.
