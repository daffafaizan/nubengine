      stimulation test) before and after 8 weeks of treatment with either fluoxetine or placebo
      between women with a history of childhood abuse (early life stress, ELS) and current major
      depression (ELS/MDD), women with a history of childhood abuse without major depression
      (ELS/non-MDD), and women without a history of childhood abuse and major depression
      (non-ELS/MDD). Changes in neuroendocrine responses to CRF are correlated with psychological
      outcome measures. We hypothesize that treatment with fluoxetine will normalize altered
      neuroendocrine responsiveness in cases with ELS and that this normalization will be
      correlated with improvement of symptoms of depression and anxiety.
