      provide additional evidence indicating the presence of functional mineralocorticoid receptors
      (MR) on zona glomerulosa (ZG) cells, the investigators propose the following protocol in
      healthy volunteers. The investigators will evaluate aldosterone and cortisol production in
      response to an angiotensin II infusion after three separate test conditions: 1) placebo, 2)
