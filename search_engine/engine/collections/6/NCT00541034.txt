        -  To determine the frequency of response in patients with previously untreated,
           intermediate- or high-risk B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) treated with
           pentostatin, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab.

        -  To characterize the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV followed by pentostatin IV on day 1 in course
      1. Beginning in course 2 and in all subsequent courses, patients receive cyclophosphamide IV
      on day 1, pentostatin IV on day 1, and rituximab IV on day 1 or on days 1 and 2. Treatment
      repeats every 3 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at least every 3 months for 1
      year.
