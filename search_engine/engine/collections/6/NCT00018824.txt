      syndrome. After appropriate detoxification, patients are started on either naltrexone 50 mg
      or placebo. After one week, sertraline is added in an open label fashion. It is hypothesized
      that those patients receiving combination therapy will last 3 months with follow-up tracking
      lasting 1 year.
