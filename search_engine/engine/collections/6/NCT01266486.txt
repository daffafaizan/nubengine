      diabetes for over 50 years. There is now growing evidence from in vitro laboratory and animal
      work that metformin has anticancer properties. In addition a retrospective clinical study in
      a diabetic population has demonstrated evidence of markedly increased pathological response
      rates (a typically robust surrogate clinical endpoint of efficacy) to pre-surgical
      chemotherapy in early breast cancer for patients that were also taking metformin as part of
      their diabetes treatment.

      There are several studies of metformin in cancer patients ongoing or being developed
      worldwide These are predominantly in relatively unselected cancer populations and with
      clinical outcomes as endpoints. However this study is the only study currently planned which
      will carry out a substantial assessment of pharmacodynamic endpoints. It is important that
      this study is carried out at an early stage in the development of metformin as a potential
      cancer therapy in order to ensure that future large scale studies are properly informed.
