      vaginal and cesarean delivery with a reported prevalence of 4-6% of deliveries [1].
      Prophylactic treatment with oxytocin after fetus extraction is a common practice. [1,2] The
      increase in plasma volume during pregnancy, and uterine perfusion that reaches 750ml/min near
      term [3] are causes for excessive blood loss during vaginal or cesarean delivery. Blood loss
      is approximately 500ml and 1000ml during vaginal and cesarean delivery respectively. Studies
      have shown that blood transfusion treatment reaches to up to 6 % after cesarean section
      [5-6].

      During placental delivery fibrinogen and fibrin degradation and plasminogen activation
      occurs. This causes fibrinolytic cascade that continues 6-10 hours post-partum [7]. Tissue
      injury during cesarean section may convert the hemostatic equilibrium towards fibrinolysis
      that results in excessive bleeding [8]/ Transexamic acid - Hexakapron is a potent
      antifibrinolytic, it prevents lysine adhesion to plasminogen molecules by blocking its
      binding site. It can lower fibrinolysis rate and by that reduce bleeding [9]. Systematic
      treatment of anti-fibrinolytic drugs is in surgical practice after procedures such as
      coronary artery bypass graft, orthopedic surgeries and liver transplantation [10-13].
      Hexakapron is an FDA approved drug, it is defined as a class B drug for pregnancy and
      lactation [12], it is already being used in a non-routine fashion in the delivery room during
      PPH.

      In obstetrics Hexakapron given before vaginal or cesarean delivery has been presumed to
      decrease blood loss and PPH. 2 studies that included 453 woman reported decrease in PPH (RR
      0.51, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.72) [13-15]. However specific protocols for prophylactic treatment
      with Hexakapron as available with oxytocin are lacking, and further research is necessary to
      determine such guidelines [16].

      PPH jeopardize young reproductive women's health, it is specifically related to major
      morbidity in the context of prior anemia which features this population in high rates [17].
      PPH is the major maternal cause of death, with 100000 cases per year [6].

      Thus the investigators sought to investigate the efficacy of Hexakapron, as a prophylactic
      treatment after vaginal delivery and cesarean section, in reducing PPH.
