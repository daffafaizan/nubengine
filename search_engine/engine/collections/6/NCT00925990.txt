    
      There are approximately 1 million Hepatitis C (HCV) patients in the US who have failed to
      respond to, or cannot tolerate, interferon or interferon plus ribavirin therapy. Significant
      adverse effects of interferon therapy include bone marrow depression (with reduced white
      blood cell and platelet counts) and major psychiatric disorders (especially depression).
      Ribavirin is associated with hemolytic anemia in a minority of patients who are treated with
      it. Patients with chronic HCV infection have a very low incidence of spontaneous viral
      clearance, have progressive disease, and have a continuing medical need for more efficacious
      and safer therapy. There is a significant unmet medical need for therapy in HCV patients who
      cannot (or will not) tolerate interferon-based treatment.

      This trial will evaluate the effects of CTS-1027 with or without ribavirin in patients who
      are previously untreated with interferon including patients with major psychiatric disorders,
      uncontrolled autoimmune disease, and patients who simply decline treatment.
