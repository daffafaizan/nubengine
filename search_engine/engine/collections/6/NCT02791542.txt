      central to the development of asthma. Precise regulation of gene transcription is essential
      for airway epithelial cell differentiation and transcription changes lead to many
      abnormalities seen in asthma. Despite the dominant role of enhancers in regulating
      transcription, little is known about how these DNA regulatory elements control airway
      epithelial cell transcription or about how enhancer activity differs in asthma compared to
      health. Closing this knowledge gap will have a major impact on our understanding of normal
      epithelial development and asthma. In addition, enhancer-based approaches for reprogramming
      the airway epithelium promise to be powerful tools for dissecting mechanism that will set the
      stage for developing a new class of precisely targeted treatments for asthma. Our overall
      goals are to identify enhancers that are important in regulation of key airway epithelial
      cell genes, to determine how enhancer activity changes in asthma, and to develop approaches
      for targeting the activity of these enhancers.
