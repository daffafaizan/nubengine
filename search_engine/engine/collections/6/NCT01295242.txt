      risk factors for HPV infections in 30-50 year old women. Participants will be followed for 6
      months and will be asked to complete online questionnaires on their health, sexual behavior,
      HPV vaccinations, and cervical cancer screening. The investigators will ask participants to
      self-collect monthly vaginal swab samples and self-collect 2 oral swab samples. Women will
      also be asked to provide 2 blood samples. All swab samples will be tested for type-specific
      HPV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assay, blood
      samples will be tested for HPV antibodies.
