      posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) plus treatment as usual (PE+TAU) relative to treatment
      as usual (TAU) alone using a randomized, between groups, repeated measures design. One
      hundred fifty six (156) ethnically/racially diverse male and female Veterans with
      posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and severe mental illness (SMI) will be recruited from
      the Charleston VA and affiliated Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs) during the study
      time frame. For the investigators' study purposes, severe mental illness (SMI) is defined as
      (1) the presence of a past year Diagnostic Statistical Manual (DSM-IV) Axis I diagnosis of
      schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder, or severe depression (2) resulting
      in persistent impairment in self-care, work, or social functioning. Veterans will be
      randomized 1:1 to one of two conditions: PE+TAU or TAU. The active intervention phase is 12
      weeks. Veterans randomized to treatment as usual (TAU) will receive support services through
      the VA potentially inclusive of case management, psychotropic medication management, and/or
      supportive counseling and Veterans randomized to prolonged exposure (PE) plus treatment as
      usual (TAU) will receive 12 weekly sessions of prolonged exposure (PE) in addition to
      treatment as usual (TAU). All participants will be assessed at baseline, 6 weeks,
      post-treatment, and at 3 and 6 months. Additionally, they will complete two self report forms
      during sessions 3, 6, and 9.
