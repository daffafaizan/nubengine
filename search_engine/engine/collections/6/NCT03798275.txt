      agreed to drink coffee. In healthy pregnant women with isolated borderline oligohydramnios,
      AFI and fetal renal artery blood flow indices were evaluated before and after coffee
      consumption. Sixty three patients for the borderline oligohydramnios group (the study group)
      were included in this study. These patients were compared with 63 healthy pregnant women who
      had normal amniotic fluid volume (the control group)
