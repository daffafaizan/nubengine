      receive either norepinephrine in the dose needed to maintain pre-anesthesia blood pressure or
      to a control group and receive norepinephrine only if mean arterial pressure decreases below
      60 mmHg. Arterial blood gas will be analysed every ten minutes. Equal anesthesia in both
      groups will be monitored. No fluids will be infused. Noninvasive continuous hemoglobin
      measurement (SpHb) will be measured.
