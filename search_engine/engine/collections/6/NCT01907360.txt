      Screen, subjects will be screened over the course of 14 days, and washed off their existing
      ADHD medication during the final 5 days of outpatient screening. During the active period,
      subjects will receive a single treatment of B-HLD200 and plasma samples for PK will be
      collected during the night and through the next 48 hours. In addition, pediatric subjects
      will undergo math testing using the pen-and-paper PERMP both prior to and post dosing. This
      study procedure will be carried out across three sequential groups of 6 subjects until the
      full B-HLD200 formulation cohort of 18 subjects have completed all study procedures.
      Following the first cohort of 18 subjects, the entire sequence may be repeated in second
      subject cohort tested with C-HLD200.
