      October 31-to end of November 2013. Endoscopic ultrasound-elastography was performed using
      linear Pentax-EUS and "Hitachi-Avius". The quantitative-strain ratio and qualitative
      endoscopic ultrasound-elastography was measured in the body of the pancreas taking in
      consideration the curve of the compression rate of the probe high: +0.4, middle: 0, low: -0.4
      in the largest and smaller region of interest diameters. Analysis for qualitative
      elastography was obtained by the predominant color of the pancreatic area studied. Pictures
      where recorded and quantitative strain ratio data were calculated comparing endoscopic
      ultrasound-elastography of pancreatic tissue with soft tissue (normal mucosal layer: red).
      Finally, a comparative analysis was performed between the results with the mean normal value
      for quantitative strain ratio previously published for normal pancreatic tissue, and between
      the different compression rates of the probe.
