    
      This study is designed as a prospective, open-label, multicenter, single-arm clinical
      investigation. This study is a follow-up study to the ARGOS-SC01 study (NCT03756662).
      Patients who have graduated the ARGOS-SC01 study after 12 month follow-up will be asked to
      enroll in this study for an additional 24 month follow-up (month 12-36 post implantation).
      This study will be solely observational, as only patients who had implanted the device within
      the earlier study will be invited to join this ARGOS-SC01-FU study.

      The sensor was always implanted in one eye only which will be the study eye.
