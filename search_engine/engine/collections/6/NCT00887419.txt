      implant can improve short- and long-term outcomes in self-efficacy for coping with chronic
      pain, physical disability, psychological distress, and pain intensity.

      Participants are patients who have been approved by their doctors and insurance companies to
      receive the spinal cord stimulator trial. After patients have been approved, they can be
      enrolled in this study. After completing a baseline evaluation, patients are randomized into
      (1)six individual pain coping skills training sessions(relaxations techniques, communication
      skills, goal setting), (2) six individual chronic pain education sessions (discussion
      approach to etiology and treatment of chronic pain and information on spinal cord stimulator
      implants, or (3) treatment as usual (no study intervention).

      Participants are evaluated prior to or shortly after their surgery, at post treatment, at 6
      month follow-up and at 12 month follow-up. All participants continue their routine medical
      care throughout the study.
