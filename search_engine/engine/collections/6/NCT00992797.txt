      of type 2 diabetes and disturbances in glucose and insulin metabolism. There is lack of data
      from randomized, controlled studies of sufficient duration and with the use of sufficient
      doses of vitamin D to assess the importance of vitamin D supplementation in glucose
      metabolism in type 2 diabetes.
