      exists, a problem that is projected to worsen. Patient access to dermatologic care is
      threatened. The dermatology workforce shortage has resulted in long wait times for patients,
      especially new patient visits and acute care cases.

      Teledermatology has received much attention as a solution to the preceding problems.
      Teledermatology can reduce the burden of repeat office visits in chronic conditions by
      facilitating care from home. In this trial, a model incorporating store-and-forward
      technology is tested in general clinics while its impact on clinical outcomes, satisfaction,
      and wait times are studied.

      Comparison: After consent, study subjects are assigned a unique study number and randomly
      assigned to one of two groups:

      Group 1- The first group of subjects will have four (4) in-office visits spaced six weeks
      apart.

      Group 2- The second group will have four (4) "e-visits" spaced six weeks apart.

      At the end of study (after completion of 5th visit overall) all participants will complete a
      satisfaction survey.
