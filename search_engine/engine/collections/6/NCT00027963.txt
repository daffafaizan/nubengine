        -  Determine whether gabapentin improves the pain and other symptoms in cancer patients
           with chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy.

        -  Determine the effect of this drug on symptom distress, mood states, functional
           abilities, and overall quality of life in these patients.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients
      are stratified according to neurotoxic chemotherapy (active vs nonactive and discontinued vs
      completed) and neurotoxic chemotherapeutic agents (vinca alkaloids vs taxanes vs
      platinum-based compounds vs combination of two or more of the above agents). Patients are
      randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive titrating doses of oral gabapentin twice daily and then three
           times daily for 3 weeks. Patients then receive a fixed dose of oral gabapentin three
           times daily for 3 weeks. Patients cross-over to therapy as in arm II at week 8.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive titrating doses of oral placebo and then a fixed dose of oral
           placebo as in arm I. Patients cross-over to therapy as in arm I at week 8.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and then at the end of weeks 6, 8, and 14.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients (50 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
