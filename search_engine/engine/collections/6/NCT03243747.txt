      included 50 patients and 81 patients in 2016. Questionnaires were identical in both testing
      stages for comparability. Practicability of a computer-based questionnaire on patient medical
      history, diagnosis as well as behavior guidelines was tested at anesthesia ambulance.
      Moreover, the investigators evaluated the user satisfaction with the help of a separate
      anonym paper-based questionnaire in 2013 as well as in 2016.
