      brain morphology and function, in 700 cognitively healthy individuals, 45 to 75 years old,
      recruited from an ongoing longitudinal cognition study exploring memory and executive
      functions (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT01835717).

      All subjects have been APOE genotyped and underwent a clinical and cognitive assessment.
      Within this study, the subjects will be submitted to an MRI scanning protocol including
      morphological and resting state acquisitions. An identical follow-up MRI session will be
      performed in 2 years' time. The analyses will be focused on detecting the effect of the APOE
      allelic variants on the change rate of the neuroimaging variables as well as its interaction
      with aging.
