    
      Adrenocortical carcinoma(ACC)is a rare malignancy with an incidence of 1.5 to 2 per million
      per year in the United states. Surgery is the only therapeutic option that can prolong
      survival. Currently there are no therapies that have been proven to prolong survival for
      patients with nonsurgically resectable disease. ACC has been shown to be highly resistant to
      standard chemotherapy, therefore, it is important that we test agents with mechanisms of
      action. This is a single arm phase II study of Bevacizumab, an angiogenesis inhibitor, given
      as a single agent at 10 mg/kg IV every 2 weeks in patients with unresectable ACC. Bevicizumab
      will be used as first line therapy. The study will test if Bevacizumab will be able to
      prolong the time to progression. If a delay in time to progression of 4 months or greater is
      seen, this will be considered clinically meaningful and further studies will be considered.
      This study will be conducted at multiple institutions (see below).
