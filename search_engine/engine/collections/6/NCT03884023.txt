      silencer factor (NRSF) is a zinc finger protein of 121 kD and belongs to the Gli-Kruppel
      family with transcriptional regulation.This will be a Case-Crossover research. Consecutive
      participants will be divided into Alzheimer's disease dementia group, mild cognitive
      impairment due to Alzheimer's disease group and normal control group according to inclusion
      criteria of this research. Peripheral blood samples will be retained to detect REST gene
      polymorphisms and protein concentrations. Participants perform neuropsychological tests to
      assess cognitive function. Medial temporal atrophy scale is used to describe hippocampus.
      Differences in the mean or proportions between these 3 groups will be checked by t test or
      test. The relationship between REST protein concentration and cognitive function will be
      estimated, as well as the relationship between REST protein concentration and hippocampus.
