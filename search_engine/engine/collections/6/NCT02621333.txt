      great progress was made in treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. It's necessary to explore
      the treatment mode of this kind of patients. As the progress was made in tumor immunity and
      immunotherapy, more and more cancer therapists accept the treatment model of chemotherapy
      combined immunotherapy. And now chemotherapy combined autologous CIK cells is one kind of
      common treatment model in some countries. Investigators try to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of this kind of treatment model in patients with stage â…£ naive EGFR wild-type lung
      adenocarcinoma.
