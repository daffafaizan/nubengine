    
      The next generation TECNIS IOL designed to provide improved intermediate and near visual
      acuity and decreased spectacle wear was evaluated for safety and effectiveness in a six-month
      interventional study and compared to a marketed monofocal IOL. Assessments included
      distance-corrected intermediate and near visual acuity, depth of focus at 0.2 logMAR and
      spectacle wear frequency.
