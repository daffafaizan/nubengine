      of pain sensitivity using electronic algometer and other known risk factors for postoperative
      pain in 100 patients scheduled for open colorectal cancer surgery.

      The following items are investigated before surgery; Age, sex, level of education, type of
      surgery, past surgical history, presence of chronic pain, the expected maximal pain score
      (VAS) after surgery, Pain catastrophizing scale, anxiety scale (HADS-A), Pain sensitivity
      questionnaire, and pain threshold measured by electronic algometer.

      The total opioid consumption is investigated for 24 and 48 hours after surgery. In addition,
      the severity of postoperative pain is measured by the 11-point VAS at 24 and 48 hours after
      surgery. Patient satisfaction with postoperative pain control is also investigated at 48
      hours after surgery using the 7-point patient's satisfaction scale.
