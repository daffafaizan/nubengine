      with ACS（Acute Coronary Syndromes） and ST-segment depression on ECG have a worse prognosis
      than patients with a normal ECG. ST-segment depression is not only a qualitative marker, but
      also a quantitative marker of risk, because the number of leads with ST-segment depression
      and the magnitude of ST-segment depression (either within a single lead or as sum over all
      leads) are indicative of the extent of ischaemia and correlate with prognosis.The presence of
      ST-segment depression >1 mm in >_6 leads in conjunction with ST-segment elevation in aVR
      and/or V1, particularly if the patient presents with haemodynamic compromise, suggests
      multivessel ischaemia or severe left main coronary artery stenosis. However,in patients
      presenting without persistent ST-segment elevation,the clinical features, treatments, and
      outcomes in patients with normal ECG is still unclear.
