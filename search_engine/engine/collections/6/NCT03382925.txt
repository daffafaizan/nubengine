      (ESI), when conservative treatments like oral analgesics, physical therapy, and activity
      modification have failed. There are no universal clinical practice guidelines for the use of
      diluents when CESI are performed.

      Interlaminar CESI may be performed with or without the use of local anesthetics, due to
      training bias or theoretical concerns of weakness. CESI without the benefit of local
      anesthetic as a steroid diluent increases the latency of pain relief and may decrease
      diagnostic information immediately after a CESI with regard to pain generators responsible
      for symptoms, and may potentially decrease patient satisfaction.

      By evaluating the effects of local anesthetic as a diluent during interlaminar cervical ESI,
      we will enhance the safety of this treatment with regard to expectations of objective motor
      weakness as well as post procedure pain control in the recovery phase after the injection
      procedure.

      Additionally, investigation of short-term pain, function, medication use, and global
      impression of change following use of local anesthetic versus saline as a diluent during
      interlaminar cervical ESI will provide evidence to inform the optimization of clinical
      outcomes related to steroid diluent choice.
