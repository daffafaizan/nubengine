      randomize equally to either the control arm or one of the three intervention arms. This
      should assure that at least 10 participants would complete each intervention. The four groups
      are placebo (no bean powder or rice bran included), 1/4 cup cooked navy bean powder
      (17.5grams powder)/day, 15 grams rice bran/day, and combination of 9 grams of bean powder/day
      and 8 grams rice bran/day. Participants will follow this dietary intervention by being
      provided a study snack, such as a banana nut muffin and strawberry-pineapple smoothie.
      Participants will consume one snack on a daily basis for a total of four weeks (28 days). The
      snack options were developed by a professional chef and research dietitian to fit a set of
      requirements for calorie and macronutrient content based on USDA food guide recommendations.
      The placebo group will be provided the same snacks without the inclusion of rice bran or bean
      powder.

      Randomization of subjects to the dietary intervention groups will be done during the study
      enrollment period. Randomization will be based on sex of the subject to include equal numbers
      of both genders across all 4 groups.

      All participants will consume the allocated foods daily for a total of four weeks (28 days)
      and will not be required to alter the rest of their diets in any other way. They will also
      complete a 3-day food and activity log each week, starting the week prior to the study
      intervention (Week 0) and ending the week of their final visit (Week 4).
