      included in the study. Patients with previous spinal surgeries or with gross spinal
      deformities were excluded. In all patients ultrasound scanning of the lumbar interspinous
      spaces was performed with curvilinear 2-5 MHz Sonosite probe. At each lumbar interspinous
      level (L1-2 to L5-S1) the best possible transverse and paramedian oblique sagittal view was
      obtained. The obtained ultrasound images were the graded based on the visibility of LF and
      PLL. The lumbar spine MRI images were analyzed by radiologists who were blinded to the
      ultrasound images. On MRI various parameters such as depth of epidural space, absence of LF,
      thickness of LF, characteristics of muscular and intervening fatty tissue, epidural/subdural
      fat thickness etc was noted. The correlation between neuraxial ultrasound images and various
      parameters observed in MRI was identified.
