    
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, multicenter study of HMPL-689 administered orally to patients
      with relapsed or refractory lymphoma.

      This study will consist of a dose escalation stage (Stage 1) and a dose expansion stage
      (Stage 2).

      Dose Escalation Stage (Stage 1):

      This stage will end when any of the following criteria is met:

        -  The dose level 1 demonstrates an excessive toxicity, ie, 3 dose limiting toxicities
           (DLTs) are observed out of the first 3 patients at dose level 1.

        -  The maximum sample size is reached.

        -  The MTD and/or RP2D is confirmed.

      Dose Expansion Stage (Stage 2):

      To further characterize the safety and explore the preliminary anti-tumor activity of
      HMPL-689 at RP2D, patients with B cell lymphoma will be enrolled in the dose expansion stage.
