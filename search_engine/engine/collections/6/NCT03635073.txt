      will assess the safety and tolerability of TAK-935 for 2 years in patients who participated
      in previous short-term efficacy/safety studies of TAK-935. All patients will receive TAK-935
      treatment.

      Patients who rollover from previous blinded study will undergo up to 0 to 2 weeks of Dose
      Optimization Period (depending on the previous study) followed by 103-weeks of Maintenance
      Period. Patients who rollover from an open-label study will continue on their current dose
      for 103-weeks. There will be a 4-week safety follow-up after the last dose, including a
      2-week dose tapering period.
