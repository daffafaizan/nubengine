      Baker's cyst, giant cell tumor, lymphangioma, hernia, abscess, epidermoid cyst, hematoma,
      muscle rupture, glomus tumor, fibromatosis, lymphadenitis hemangioma, exostosis, fibroma,
      neurofibroma and schwannoma. Malignant lesions also could be seen as lymphoma, metastasis,
      osteogenic sarcoma, liposarcoma , leiomyosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma and synovial sarcoma.

      Nowadays, High resolution ultrasound has a high sensitivity in detecting superficial soft
      tissue masses through the grey-scale grading that compose an image range from pure black at
      the weakest intensity to pure white at the strongest that can be used to evaluate its
      structure, some aspects of its function and to determine the nature of a mass lesion (cystic
      or solid) and with Doppler ultrasound which is an excellent imaging modality to determine the
      vascularity of superficial soft tissue masses that can be characterized in terms of their
      echogenicity, margin, shape, composition, acoustic transmission, size, the grading of color
      Doppler ultrasound , and resistive index in spectral Doppler as spectral Doppler will be
      applied in lesions with positive color flow signals.
