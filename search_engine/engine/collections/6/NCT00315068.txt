    
      Catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation is a recent therapeutic tool to treat atrial
      fibrillation. The success rate of eliminating atrial fibrillation by radiofrequency catheter
      ablation is 80 %, after one or sometimes two procedures, against 20-50 % with drug treatment.

      This intervention may be complicated by : hematoma at the puncture site - 1 % incidence;
      thromboembolic events < 1 % incidence; cardiac perforation with tamponade < 1 %, pulmonary
      vein stenosis 2 % incidence.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate blood tests of biological products (NT-proBNP and CRP)
      as markers of prognosis and success after radiofrequency catheter ablation for atrial
      fibrillation.

      Previous studies demonstrated the prognostic value of NT-proBNP and CRP in the recurrence of
      atrial fibrillation after electrical cardioversion. However the prognostic value of these
      biomarkers was never demonstrated in the setting of radiofrequency catheter ablation of
      atrial fibrillation.

      This is an observation study including 180 patients with the indication of catheter ablation
      for atrial fibrillation. Confounding factors of increased NT-proBNP will be assessed with
      echocardiographic imaging.
