      receiving cisplatin for the treatment of their cancer. NAC also has potential to protect the
      kidneys from cisplatin toxicity.

      The study uses a 3+3 dose-escalation scheme to determine the dose of NAC necessary to achieve
      serum levels consistent with hearing protection in pre-clinical animal models. Three dose
      levels are predefined. Once the maximum tolerated dose is determined, an expansion cohort
      will then be enrolled to further evaluate tolerability as well as intra-patient and
      inter-patient variability in achieved serum levels. An option to enroll in a separate arm for
      study assessments only is available for those who do not wish to receive NAC. Hearing loss in
      the cohort will be assessed in the entire cohort in comparison to historical and non-treated
      children to evaluate for trends toward efficacy.
