      non-nutritive sweetener (NNS), affects the glycemic response to an oral glucose tolerance
      test (OGTT) and potentiates glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in obese people who are not
      regular consumers of NNS. However, studies conducted in healthy lean adults, none of which
      control for previous use of NNS, show that sucralose does not affect glycemic or hormonal
      responses to the ingestion of glucose or other carbohydrates. Therefore, we do not know a)
      whether sucralose effects are limited to obese subjects, or are generalizable to lean people
      when controlling for prior history of NNS consumption, and b) mechanism(s) responsible for
      the acute effect of sucralose on glucose metabolism as we measured in obese subjects. The aim
      of this study is to determine the effects of an acute intake of sucralose on the metabolic
      response to an oral glucose tolerance test in lean and obese people.
