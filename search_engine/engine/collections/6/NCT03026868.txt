      acetabular fractures. Then, Stoppa approach was widely used clinically. For the fragments
      involving quadrilateral surface, the Kocher-Langenbeck approach was added because the
      fixation of posterior fragments could not be obtained with reconstruction plate through
      single Stoppa approach. Novel quadrilateral surface plate was used in this study to examine
      its fixed role for posterior fragments. Functional outcome and complication were recorded to
      compare with the results treated with reconstruction plate. If good results were obtained for
      the patients fixed with quadrilateral surface plate, it was meaningful to popularize the
      fixed method.
