      resection. There is growing, but still limited, evidence that extended mesenteric excision
      during ileocolic resection is beneficial in decreasing disease recurrence. We propose a
      prospective multicenter cohort study to better understand the role of extended mesenteric
      excision in ileocolic CD and how it affects disease recurrence. The primary outcome of this
      study will be the rate of endoscopic recurrence at 6 months in patients undergoing first-time
      resection for ileocolic CD. Secondary outcomes will include endoscopic recurrence at 18
      months and rates of recurrence requiring surgery by 2 years. These outcomes will be compared
      to historical controls (limited mesenteric resection). Our hypothesis is that patients
      receiving extended mesenteric ileocolic resection will have reduced endoscopic recurrence at
      6 months after resection. As seen in previous studies, advanced mesenteric and mucosal
      disease predicts increased surgical recurrence.
