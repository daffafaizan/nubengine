        1. What is the reproducibility of ventricular systolic function measurements (including
           ventricular strain) in Fontan patients using echocardiography (Echo) and cardiac
           magnetic resonance imaging (CMR)?

        2. What is the reproducibility of ventricular diastolic function measurements (including
           tissue Doppler and strain rate) in Fontan patients using Echo and CMR?

        3. Is there a correlation between ventricular function measurements and circulating
           biomarkers (including galectin-3 levels, NT-proBNP, ST2, and MELD-XI score)?
