      older patients whose elective noncardiac surgery has been deferred because of the COVID-19
      emergency, and explore the intra-individual changes in these trajectories from before to
      after surgery, through periodic remote self-administered cognitive testing. Secondarily, in
      the same patients, the investigators will also describe the perioperative trajectories in
      depressive symptoms and pain, and study their correlation with the trajectories in cognitive
      performance.

      The study will be conducted remotely and virtually. The investigators will have an initial
      videoconference with the participant (and a support person if necessary) to explain the
      computerized cognitive test battery (i.e. the Cogstate Brief battery, CBB), and train on
      self-administration through a user-specific link. At each due assessment, the research team
      will call the participant to remind to complete the CBBÍ¾ and to assess depressive symptoms,
      pain, and collect data on intercurrent clinical events (i.e. medication changes,
      hospitalization, ED or urgent care visits).
