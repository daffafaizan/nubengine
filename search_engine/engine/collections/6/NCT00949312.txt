        -  Determine whether the immunohistochemical and molecular presence of micrometastases in â‰¥
           12 lymph nodes removed during en-bloc resection in patients with stage II colon cancer
           correlates with 3-year disease-free survival.

        -  Evaluate the prognostic significance of molecular markers detected in the primary tumor
           and develop a microarray-based gene signature for stage II colon cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Tumor tissue and regional lymph node samples are collected during surgery for analysis of
      micrometastases and molecular markers by immunohistochemistry, qRT-PCR, MM qRT-PCR,
      qRDNA-PCR, and microarray profiling.

      Patients are followed up periodically for 4 years after surgery.
