      pramipexole to ropinirole CR reduces the non-motor side effects frequently experienced by
      these patients. Side effects that we will monitor in particular include somnolence,
      peripheral edema, cognitive decline with and without hallucinations. PD patients followed in
      the MUO Neurology Clinic who are being treated with pramipexole and have evidence of at least
      one of the following symptoms: somnolence, cognitive impairment with or without
      hallucinations, or peripheral edema will be offered the opportunity to participate in this
      study.

      Fifteen subjects who are currently receiving pramipexole therapy (monotherapy or adjunctive
      therapy) who are experiencing one or more of the following symptoms: somnolence, cognitive
      decline with/without hallucinations, and peripheral edema will be asked if they are willing
      to participate at the time of their clinic visit at the PDMDP.

      The crossover from pramipexole to ropinirole CR will be performed over a 2 week interval.
      During the first week, the initial drug dose will substitute ½ of the pramipexole with ½ of
      the target dose of ropinirole CR. If subjects are tolerating the drug change, then 100% of
      the target dose of ropinirole CR (and no pramipexole) will be started in the second week.
