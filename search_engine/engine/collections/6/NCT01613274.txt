      pain, nausea/ vomiting, impaired nutritional intake, and abdominal distention. Return of
      bowel function is a strong determinant in length of hospital stay. There are small studies
      that have shown that chewing gum post-operatively may enhance bowel motility thus minimizing
      complications and decreasing length of hospital stay. The purpose of this research study is
      to determine the effect of gum chewing on bowel motility as measured by time to first flatus,
      bowel movement and length of stay in patients following a colon resection.
