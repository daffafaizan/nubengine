      Eligible patients will receive intravenous (IV) infusions of Elelyso every two weeks. The
      infusions will be administered at the selected medical center or in the home care setup. The
      dose of Elelyso will be the same dose of the other ERTs . Bone parameters QCSI and BMD will
      be assessed at baseline, 12 months and 24 months.

      The intention is to open 3 more sites in Israel thereby making this IIR a multi center
