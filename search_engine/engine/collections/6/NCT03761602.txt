      iodine concentrations, serum selenium concentrations, etc). The nutritional status of iodine
      and selenium will be monitored and followed up for all the included subjects throughout the
      pregnancy. The information of thyroid function and level of anti-TPO and anti-TG will be
      collected. And all the complications (especially thyroid disease) in pregnancy will also be
