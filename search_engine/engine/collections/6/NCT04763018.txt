      labeling. The sham group will receive an iTEAR device which looks identical to and makes
      noise similar to a fully functional iTEAR device but has a tip that does not vibrate. All
      subjects in the sham group will crossover to the treatment group after 2 two weeks and all
      patients will continue to 30 days.

      The study will be conducted at up to 5 sites in the United States. It will enroll 30 subjects
      for 30 days.

      This is a double-masked study with 10 subjects receiving sham and 20 subjects receiving
      treatment. The subjects and the examining investigators are masked to treatment until the
      crossover.
