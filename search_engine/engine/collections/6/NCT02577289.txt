      platelet rich fibrin (PRF) versus Nano-crystalline Hydroxyapatite as sole grafting material
      in patients with atrophied posterior maxillary ridge which provides a new modality for
      treatment of patients with atrophied posterior maxillary ridge with least cost and a much
      easier way using platelet rich fibrin (PRF) as substitution to bone graft
