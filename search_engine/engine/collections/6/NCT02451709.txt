      steroids, and feeding this information back to patients and families can improve adherence
      and outcomes in childhood asthma. The devices will also sound twice daily reminder alarms to
      act as direct medication prompts. This intervention will be compared to a control group in
      which adherence is monitored, but with no feedback or alarms.
