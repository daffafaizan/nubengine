      design will be carried out. A total of 10 subjects (5 males, 5 females) will be recruited and
      divided into 2 groups. Each group will be assigned to one of the test fat and fed with test
      meal prepared with 50g of test fats. 10 mL of blood samples will be collected at time points
      0 (baseline, before meal) and 3, 4 and 5h after finish the meal. There shall be a 2-weeks
      washout period between each test fat.

      Test fats used for this study are palm olein, with predominantly oleic acid at sn-2 position
      of the triglyceride backbone (about 68%, Gunstone et al, 2007) and lard, with predominantly
      palmitic acid at sn-2 position (about 72%, Gunstone et al., 2007). A high fat muffin with 50g
      of test fat will be formulated using the above two test fats mentioned. On each study day, a
      high fat muffin will be served and a glass of skim milk will be provided for subjects to help
      the digestion of fats from the muffins.

      Chylomicron will be harvested using the ultracentrifugation technique. Samples collected will
      be stored in -80Â°C prior to NMR analysis.
