      patients with hormone-sensitive breast cancer or immunotherapy in those with Human Epidermal
      growth factor Receptor 2 (HER2)-overexpressing cancer.

      These adjuvant treatments reduce the risk of recurrence and metastasis. The side effects of
      hormone therapy are known and depend on the therapeutic strategy and the drugs used. The side
      effects of Tamoxifen are similar to menopausal symptoms: hot flashes (half of the female
      population), vaginal dryness or leukorrhea, nausea, irregular menstruation, benign ovarian
      cyst and, less frequently, weight gain. Aromatase inhibitors have the same side effects,
      though with lesser frequency and intensity. The incidence rate of hot flashes after adjuvant
      treatment in menopausal women with localized breast cancer is 60 to 65 %, and these reactions
      are very severe in one third of these women. Despite this fact, the management of hot flashes
      is not systematic and there is currently no therapeutic strategy with proven efficiency.
      BRN01 (Boiron laboratory) is a homeopathic remedy whose active ingredient is already present
      in other homeopathic drugs indicated for the management of menopausal hot flashes. BRN01
      could reduce the intensity of the reaction in women with breast cancer receiving adjuvant
      hormonal treatment.
