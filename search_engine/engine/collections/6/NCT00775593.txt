      Primary

        -  To determine the complete response rate in older patients with relapsed or refractory
           acute myeloid leukemia when treated with low-dose clofarabine and temsirolimus.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the tolerability and safety of this regimen.

        -  To determine the duration of response.

        -  To determine the duration of survival.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

        -  Induction therapy: Patients receive clofarabine IV over 1 hour on days 1-5 and
           temsirolimus IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment continues for 1-2
           courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Maintenance therapy: Patients achieving morphologic complete remission (CR) or CR with
           incomplete blood count recovery receive temsirolimus IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8
           of each month. Treatment continues for 12 months in the absence of disease progression
           or unacceptable toxicity.
