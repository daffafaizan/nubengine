      Hence the need to discover new antileukemic agents. Tezacitabine is a nucleoside analogue
      with equivalent or even superior activity when compared with ara-C in leukemic cell lines. It
      has shown significant antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo tumor models. Several phase I
      studies with various dosing schedules have been conducted in solid tumors where the
      dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is mainly myelosuppression, usually a favorable feature for
      development of leukemia. In a phase I study in hematological malignancies, we used
      Tezacitabine as a bolus infusion daily x 5. The DLT consisted of grade 3 CNS toxicities and
      mucositis in 3/6 patients. The study is ongoing and we are currently evaluating a dose level
      of 7.5 mg/m2 as possible Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD). However, in view of the fact that
      tezacitabine is a cell cycle specific agent with a short terminal plasma half-life of 2 to 6
      hours, a continuous infusion dosing schedule may enhance the activity and reduce the
      incidence of adverse effects of tezacitabine.
