      for decades.Recently the investigators have witnessed great progresses in cancer therapy with
      chimeric antigen receptors modified T cells(CAR-T), especially for B-cell malignance.
      preclinical data about anti-CD123 CART have shown raised serious safety concerns of human
      anti-CD123 CAR-T for severe impairment of normal hematopoiesis in NSG mice.Patients with AML
      recurred after allo-HSCT have a dismal prognosis.The investigators developed donor-derived
      CART to target CD123 for the treatment of AML. The investigators start the Phase I study
      aimed to recurred post-transplantation AML patients using donor-derived CAR-T. The purpose of
      this study is to assess the safety and effectiveness of anti-CD123 CAR-T cells in patients.
