      day to day care. These friends and family members often lack the skills and confidence to
      carry out these tasks and studies have shown that many would want more support. Studies have
      also shown that many patients feel they are a burden.

      This study involves carers receiving training to learn the skills they need to care for their
      loved one. Adult patients with terminal illnesses, currently receiving care from a specified
      hospice in the South East of England, who have a friend or family member caring for them at
      home are eligible to be referred for this study.

      The training of the carer will be carried out over three sessions by an Occupational
      Therapist in the patient's own home.The training will focus on goals that the patient and
      carer have chosen together.

      The carer will be asked to complete before and after questionnaires and some will be asked to
      take part in interviews to see how they felt about the study.

      The potential benefits of this study are to increase carer confidence in caring for their
      loved one.

      The overall aim of this study is to test out the research method to see if patients and
      carers find this training and the outcome measures acceptable. If they do then the
      investigators plan to learn from this study to design a larger randomised control trial which
      would be the best way of knowing for sure whether and in what ways this training is helpful.
