      decision-making for advanced breast cancer. The investigators want to better understand what
      topics the participant wants their doctors and nurses to address with the participant in
      clinic, and the investigators want to evaluate whether asking patients to fill out a brief
      survey about their goals and preferences for care and giving this survey to their clinician
      before the next visit is a good idea that helps to improve communication and decision-making
      in breast cancer care.
