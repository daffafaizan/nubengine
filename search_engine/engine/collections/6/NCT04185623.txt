      randomly divided into 2 groups; Group A: Oocytes were denudated immediately after oocyte
      retrieval , Group B: Oocytes were denudated 2 hours after retrieval and both groups were
      microinjected at 4 hours from ovum pickup. Microinjection was performed on all matured
      oocytes only and they were cultured to blastocyst stage.The rates of maturation,
      fertilization, good quality blastulation, chemical pregnancy and clinical pregnancy were
      analysed and compared between the two groups.
