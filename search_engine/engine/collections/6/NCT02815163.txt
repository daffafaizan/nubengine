      self-efficacy and competence) and secondary outcomes (Activities of Daily Life, mobility,
      depressive mood, and quality of life) for older adults with total hip replacement surgery.

      Background. Degenerative arthritis is a common and serious chronic illness that impacts the
      quality of life of older adults. As joints degenerate continuously and the hip has been
      damaged by arthritis, Activities of Daily Life will be difficult to perform due to severe hip
      pain and joint stiffness. Therefore, hip replacement surgery should be considered, and
      effective nursing care should be provided to improve the recovery of older adults.

      Design. A prospective randomized control trial. Methods. A trial was conducted from September
      of 2013 to May of 2014 in two hospitals in northern Taiwan. 108 participants were randomly
      assigned to either the empowerment education group or the comparison group. The outcomes were
      collected at the day of discharge (T2), one month after (T3), and 3 months (T4) after the
      discharge.
