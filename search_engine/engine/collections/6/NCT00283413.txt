    
      Symbiot III was a prospective, multi-center, randomized, controlled trial to evaluate the
      safety and efficacy of the Symbiot stent compared to bare metal stents in the treatment of
      symptomatic ischemic saphenous vein graft disease. Randomization was stratified by the
      intended use of intravenous glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors and by the intended use of
      approved distal protection to ensure approximate balance between study treatments within each
      of the strata. The primary outcome variable for the study was target lesion percent diameter
      stenosis at 8 months post-implant.
