    
      Patients will be treated with subcutaneous injections of GAA/TT-vaccines starting on Week 0
      and every 3 weeks thereafter for up to 8 cycles or until Off-treatment criteria are met
      (Section 4.6). I.m. poly-ICLC will be administered (30ug/kg i.m.) immediately following the
      vaccine. Poly-ICLC should be administered i.m. within 3 cm of the peptide-injection site.

      To allow for flexibility with scheduling, the peptide vaccine and Poly-ICLC dose may be given
      within one week of the date that the vaccine and poly-ICLC administration are due.

      Patients will be evaluated for any possible adverse event, regimen limiting toxicity (RLT) as
      well as clinical/radiological responses by clinical visits and MRI scanning. Follow-up MRIs
      will be performed (Weeks 6, 15 and 24).
