      I. Determine the feasibility of providing postoperative acupuncture for patients undergoing
      open colorectal or pancreatic surgery.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Compare postoperative opioid use for pain management, pain levels, and satisfaction of
      pain control between acupuncture and standard care groups.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Compare dietary recovery and postoperative length of stay between acupuncture and standard
      care groups.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I (ACUPUNCTURE): Beginning the day after surgery, patients undergo acupuncture sessions
      over 25 minutes once daily (QD) for up to 7 days. Patients also undergo usual care including
      preoperative visits to the primary surgical team, anesthesia preoperative evaluation,
      referrals to other specialties for perioperative evaluation and optimization of comorbid
      conditions if necessary, surgical operations, postoperative hospitalization, and
      post-discharge clinic visits.

      ARM II (USUAL CARE): Patients undergo usual care including preoperative visits to the primary
      surgical team, anesthesia preoperative evaluation, referrals to other specialties for
      perioperative evaluation and optimization of comorbid conditions if necessary, surgical
      operations, postoperative hospitalization, and post-discharge clinic visits.
