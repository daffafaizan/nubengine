      experience bladder recurrence after nephroureterectomy. Although many agents have been
      administered for the prevention of bladder recurrence, the standard prophylactic treatment
      has yet to be established. A meta-analysis found that a single instillation of chemotherapy
      immediately after transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) significantly decreased
      the risk of recurrence in patients with bladder cancer. Indeed, a single early instillation
      of Docetaxel was found to reduce the post-TURBT bladder recurrence rate among patients with
      bladder cancer.

      In this prospective, randomized study, the investigators evaluated the efficacy of a single,
      early, intravesical instillation of Docetaxel in the prevention of bladder recurrence after
      nephroureterectomy for UUT-UC.
