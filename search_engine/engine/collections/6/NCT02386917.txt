    
      This study aims to

        1. to investigate the relationship between body composition and the liver/intestine
           activity and expression of proteins (drug metabolizing enzymes, transporters and
           regulatory factors) important for drug bioavailability and disposition in the range from
           normal to morbid obesity (the combined gastric bypass and cholecystectomy groups) at
           baseline.

        2. to compare the short-term (6-week) and long-term (2 years) effect of gastric bypass
           (GBP) and a very low calorie diet (VLCD) (matched weight loss) on bioavailability and
           pharmacokinetics of probe drugs (caffeine, omeprazole, digoxin, midazolam, rosuvastatin,
           losartan) and biomarkers (and adjoining protein expressions) for cytochrome P450
           (CYP)1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A, P-glycoprotein (gp) and organic anion-transporting
           polypeptide (OATP)1B1.

        3. to compare the 3 study groups (GBP, VLCD and cholecystectomy) at baseline with respect
           to body composition, cardiovascular risk factors and metabolic biomarkers.

        4. to compare the short-term (6-week) changes in glucose metabolism, blood pressure, blood
           lipids and body composition of matched weight loss and long-term effects (2 year) on
           body composition, cardiovascular risk factors and metabolic biomarkers, between the GBP
           and VLCD groups.
