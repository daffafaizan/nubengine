    
      Eligible subjects will be Veterans with alcohol dependence during their first year of
      recovery, 21-65 years old, with ISI total score of 15 or more, medically and psychiatrically
      stable, and without dependence on other drugs (with the exception of nicotine and marijuana).

      The proposed study will consist of a single-blind trial comparing CBT-I against a behavioral
      placebo intervention (Quasi-Desensitization Therapy, QDT).

      Baseline assessments conducted over a month will comprehensively evaluate for the addiction,
      psychiatric, sleep and medical disorders, as well as for a family history of alcohol
      dependence.

      Once the subject is seen to be eligible for the study he will be randomized to either the
      CBT-I or the QDT arm, and treated for the next weeks. The primary outcome measure for
      insomnia will be the Insomnia Severity Index. The primary outcome measure for alcohol
      dependence will be the percent days abstinent (on the Time Line Follow Back measure, TLFB),
      and the daytime symptoms will be assessed using the Short Form-12 item scale (SF-12, for self
      reported well-being), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI, for depressive symptoms), and the
      State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI, for anxiety symptoms).

      After completion of the treatment phase, subjects will be followed up 3 months and 6 months
      later, to assess for changes over time in their insomnia, alcohol use, and daytime
      functioning.
