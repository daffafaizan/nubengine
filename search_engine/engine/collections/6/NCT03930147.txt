    
      The objective of the study is to assess the feasibility of ASV in children and compare
      physiologic values on ASV mode to Pressure-Control and Pressure-Support mode of ventilation
      regarding the participant is on active or passive ventilation phase.

      Physiologic values will be monitored on different modes of ventilation in a randomized order.
      Each participant will be his own control regarding the different modes of ventilation.
      Monitoring will be done during 90 minutes for each mode of ventilation.

      Participant will have two different phases of ventilation. The first one is the passive phase
      (participant does not trigger the ventilator cycle sustainly) in which ASV and
      Pressure-Control Ventilation will be performed in a randomized order. The second phase will
      be the active ventilation phase (participant does trigger the ventilator cycle sustainly) in
      which ASV and Pressure-Support Ventilation will be performed in a randomized order.
