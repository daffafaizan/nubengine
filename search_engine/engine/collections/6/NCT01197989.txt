      and quality of life. The manifestation of the disease is often exacerbated by factors such as
      significant physical and mechanical stress resulting from repeated and prolonged pressure
      over the affected areas and by everyday clothing. These problems have led the textile
      industry Lenzi Egisto S.p.A. to conduct some preliminary analyses to find a fabric that meets
      the specific needs of psoriatic patients in relation to everyday clothing. This preliminary
      study led to the creation of a particular fabric, TEPSO®, with features specific to the
      identified needs. This material consists essentially of PTFE (commercially known as Teflon®)
      and thus presents interesting characteristics that make it suitable for creating garments for
      patients with psoriasis:

        -  Excellent flow properties and low surface friction

        -  non-stick

        -  Complete biocompatibility and chemical inertness

      We can therefore speculate that in palmoplantar pustulosis high smoothness of the fabric and
      low coefficient of friction may translate into less discomfort felt by patients during normal
      physical activities, and into improved clinical course of the disease. In the end, it is
      expected that reduced mechanical compression and friction, would result into partial or
      complete clinical remission within a few weeks of use.

      Therefore we propose to conduct a randomized controlled, double-blind, left-right clinical
      trial to assess the hypothesis that in palmoplantar pustulosis the use of TEPSO® could induce
      an improvement of disease and overall quality of life. To better assess the effects of
      treatment, the use of clothing in the study will be limited to symmetrical pustular lesions
      of feet in order to include areas that are comparable and relevant from a functional point of
      view.
