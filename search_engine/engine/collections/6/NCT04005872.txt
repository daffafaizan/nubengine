      fluoride versus calcium hydroxide in an indirect pulp treatment of deep carious second
      primary molars. This clinical study is important because World Health Organization (WHO) has
      reported that school children experience to dental caries was 60-90% of worldwide (P. D.
      Garkoti et al., 2015).

      This clinical trial has potential benefits to patients where indirect pulp treatment
      preserves pulp vitality by partial caries removal without exposing pulp. Several materials
      have been used for indirect pulp technique including calcium hydroxide (Metalita M et al.,
      2016).
