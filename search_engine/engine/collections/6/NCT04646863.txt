      multiwave locked system laser, group B consists of 20 patients received Pilates exercises and
      group C consists of 20 patients received a multiwave locked system laser and Pilates
      exercises. Patients with a history of tumors, ovariectomy, heart disease, renal failure, disc
      prolapse, or any trauma to the back area were excluded from the study. All patients who
      participated in the current study did not intake any medications to accelerate bone density
      like vitamin D or calcium. The randomization method was applied by asking each patient to
      choose a piece of paper that the (A), (B), or (C) letter was written. (A) considered the LLLT
      group, (B) considered the Pilates exercise group, while (C) considered the LLLT and Pilates
      exercises group. Both patients, the examiner, and therapist were blinded from the selection
      process.
