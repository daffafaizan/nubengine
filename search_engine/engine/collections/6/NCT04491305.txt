      Croatia. First aim is to validate Endometriosis Health Profile-5 (EHP-5) before implementing
      this questionnaire in clinical practice. After validation, we will prospectively follow women
      with endometriosis through whole process - pre- and postoperatively, including comparison
      with rASRM and Enzian score which are already established in our Clinic.

      We will try to identify correlation between EHP-5 score and surgical findings and to provide
      better insight in quality of life consideration of women with endometriosis particularly in
      Croatia. Since we are tertiary referral centre with almost 250 operative procedures which
      include ovarian, pelvic and/or extra pelvic endometriosis, we believe that this study will
      bring new tool not only for preoperative assessment but postoperative surveillance.
