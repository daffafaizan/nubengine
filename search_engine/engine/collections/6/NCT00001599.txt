      is characterized by lymphocytic infiltration of lacrimal and salivary glands leading to
      secretory function loss, and the symptoms of dry eyes and dry mouth. After bone marrow
      transplantation, most patients with chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD) develop symptoms
      of oral dryness and salivary gland lymphocytic infiltrates indistinguishable from SS.
      Thalidomide has not been studied as a treatment for Sjogren's syndrome, but pilot studies
      suggest that it may be beneficial in the treatment of a number of autoimmune diseases
      including rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and various skin disorders, as
      well as in the treatment of chronic graft versus host disease. Major adverse effects of
      thalidomide include teratogenicity, neuropathy and sedation. The study is a 12 week
      randomized, double-blinded, pilot clinical trial designed to screen for potential efficacy
      and to evaluate the safety and potential adverse effects of 300 mg thalidomide daily compared
      with placebo in 28 patients with primary SS (PSS).
