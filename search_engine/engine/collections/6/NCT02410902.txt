      children with Autism exhibit impaired protein digestion which may or may not manifest in
      self-restricted diets. The inability to digest protein affects the availability of essential
      amino acids in the body. CM-AT is designed to enhance protein digestion thereby potentially
      restoring the pool of essential amino acids. Essential amino acids play a critical role in
      the expression of several genes important to neurological function and serve as precursors to
      key neurotransmitters such as serotonin and dopamine. CM-AT is a proprietary enzyme that is
      designed as a granulated powder taken three times daily.
