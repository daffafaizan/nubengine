        -  The Screening Phase will extend up to 28 days prior to Cycle 1, Day 1.

        -  The Treatment Phase will be conducted in 2 parts and will extend from Cycle 1 Day 1
           until treatment discontinuation.

      Treatment Phase, Part 1: Induction/Transplantation/Consolidation Phase. The consolidation
      phase of treatment will begin approximately 30-60 days after Autologous Stem Cell
      Transplantation (ASCT), when the patient has recovered sufficiently and engraftment is
      complete.

      Treatment Phase, Part 2: Maintenance Phase treatment until a maximum duration of 2 years,
      documented disease progression, death, loss to follow-up, or withdrawal of consent, whichever
