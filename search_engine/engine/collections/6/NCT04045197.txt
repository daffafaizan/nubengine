      million infants are delivered each year. Preterm birth is an extremely important problem in
      terms of its effects on newborn's health, mother's health, community and economy. Preterm
      birth causes the newborn chronic pulmonary disease; gastrointestinal, immunologic, central
      nervous system, auditory and visual problems; long-term motor and cardiovascular system
      diseases; and cognitive, visual, behavioral disorders. While preterm birth causes the women
      postpartum anxiety, stress and depression; it also leads to newborn intensive care costs,
      long-term complex health care needs for families and community and has serious consequences
      for public service sector such as health insurance, education, other social support systems
      and economy. Some factors initiate preterm birth, whereas 70-80% of them start spontaneously,
      remaining 20-30% has iatrogenic origin. It is reported that there is no known and effective
      treatment for preterm birth. It is reported in literature that stress which is one of the
      risk factors of preterm birth, causes preterm birth. If stress causes threat of preterm
      delivery, reducing stress may delay preterm birth and the complications of preterm birth on
      newborn and mother's health and also its economic and social burden can be reduced. National
      and international studies related to the effect of coping with stress on threat of preterm
      birth are lacking. It is thought that preterm birth can be prevented in women with threat of
      preterm birth through developing mechanisms to cope with stress and reducing stressors. Since
      nurse provides 24-hour care for woman diagnosed with the threat of preterm birth, the nursing
      care may be effective in this aspect.
