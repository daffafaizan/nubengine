      will be used to identify empirically-based and theoretically-grounded features across
      multiple time scales that are most predictive of lapse. Operationalizing vulnerability in
      terms of the predicted level of risk for lapse, the investigators hypothesize that (H1)
      current vulnerability is represented by current and/or recent high negative emotions, low
      positive emotions, high craving, low self-efficacy, low self-regulatory capacity (SRC), and
      risky context (e.g., specific locations, such as a bar; cigarettes available; others
      smoking).

      Aim 2: Identify states of receptivity for engaging in self-regulatory activities:
      Self-reported and sensor-based measures will be used to identify empirically-based and
      theoretically-grounded features across multiple time scales that are most predictive of
      engagement (i.e., usage of self-regulatory activities). Operationalizing receptivity in terms
      of the predicted likelihood of engagement, the investigators hypothesize that (H2) current
      receptivity is represented by high positive activating emotions (e.g., happy, grateful), low
      negative deactivating emotions (e.g., sad, boredom), low craving, high self-efficacy, high
      SRC, and low risk contexts (e.g., specific locations, such as home).

      Aim 3: Investigate approaches to capitalize on states of vulnerability and receptivity to
      deliver real-time self-regulation prompts. Investigate whether, what type, and under what
      conditions (e.g., current state of vulnerability and/or receptivity) a prompt to engage the
      individual in self-regulatory activities increases engagement, hence reduces vulnerability.

      The proposed research will help build a comprehensive conceptual, technical, and empirical
      foundation necessary to develop effective Just-in-Time-Adaptive-Interventions (JITAIs) based
      on dynamic models of vulnerability and receptivity. In the micro-randomized trial (MRT),
      Ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) are administered before and after JITAIs with items
      that are designed to measure different indices that may be related to participants'
      engagement of the JITAIs.
