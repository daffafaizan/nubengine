    
      This is a mono-center, observational, controlled study with 2 parallel groups (obese versus
      non-obese pregnant women). The study will be conducted at the University Hospital of Basel,
      Department of Obstetrics and Antenatal Care. A total of N=188 healthy pregnant women
      (expected 40% with BMI â‰¥ 30 kg/m2) will be recruited in the first trimester in our
      outpatients' department in order to have a total of 169 evaluable women, considering a
      drop-out rate of 10%. Serum hepcidin, iron and hematological parameters will be measured at
      11-14, 24-28, 32-36 weeks of gestation and at labor. The blood pressure, weight, weight gain,
      BMI and smoking status will be examined at all visits. Blood samples will be measured in the
      University Hospital of Basel, Department of Laboratory Medicine. Recruitment will begin in
      January 2019.
