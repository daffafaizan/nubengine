      cutaneous nerves around the hip joint. There have been numerous study assessing it's ability
      to control pain in the pre and post operative period in patients with hip fractures. However,
      there is a limited amount of literature on its efficacy after total hip arthroplasty, and no
      data when a posterior surgical approach to the hip was utilized. Because regional blocks have
      been shown to decrease pain post operatively after total knee arthroplasty, we hypothesize
      that the FICB will decrease pain and narcotic use in patients after total hip arthroplasty.
      This study will aim to recruit 120 patients that will be randomized to receive a FICB or
      placebo in the recovery room within 30 minutes of leaving the OR. Once the intervention is
      complete we will collect data on the patients' pain levels, morphine equivalents of narcotic
      that they used, and how well they worked with physical therapy during their inpatient stay.
