      dissonance-based thin-ideal internalization reduction program, healthy weight control
      program, expressive-writing control condition, or assessment-only control condition.
      Dissonance participants showed significantly greater decreases in thin-ideal internalization,
      body dissatisfaction, negative affect, eating disorder symptoms, and psychosocial impairment,
      and lower risk for eating pathology onset through 2-3 year follow-up than assessment-only
      controls. Dissonance participants showed greater decreases in thin-ideal internalization,
      body dissatisfaction, and psychosocial impairment than expressive-writing controls. Healthy
      weight participants showed greater decreases in thin-ideal internalization, body
      dissatisfaction, negative affect, eating disorder symptoms, and psychosocial impairment, less
      increases in weight, and lower risk for eating pathology and obesity onset through 2-3 year
      follow-up than assessment-only controls. Healthy weight participants showed greater decreases
      in thin-ideal internalization and weight than expressive writing controls. Dissonance
      participants showed a 60% reduction in risk for eating pathology onset and healthy weight
      participants showed a 61% reduction in risk for eating pathology onset and a 55% reduction in
      risk for obesity onset relative to assessment-only controls through 3-year follow-up,
      implying that the effects are clinically important and enduring.
