      with the loss of ability to walk being the largest and most devastating of them for these
      patients. Therefore, our goal is to analyze the effects of the treatment with electrical
      transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS) associated with gait training with partial
      body weight support aided by robotic device (Lokomat, Hocoma) in the gait of patients with
      incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI) classified as AIS C and D. In this stratified randomized
      double-blind study, the participants will be randomly allocated into one of both groups,
      outpatients (GA) or inpatients (GI), and will receive active or placebo tDCS followed by gait
      training with Lokomat (GA: 3 sessions/week x 10 weeks = 30 sessions; GI: 5 sessions/week x 6
      weeks = 30 sessions). The functional assessments (through clinical and functional scales,
      assess gait, muscle strength, spasticity, balance and pain) and neurophysiological (cortical
      excitability measured by transcranial magnetic stimulation, electroencephalography and
      functional near-infrared spectroscopy) will be held before and after the training period. The
      functional assessments will be also held after 15 sessions (intermediate) and after 3 months
      follow up. The expected result is that patients that received the active (tDCS) presents an
      improvement over the ground gait after the Lokomat training period, significantly greater
      than the placebo group, with positive correlation between neurophysiologic, kinematics and
      functional measurements.
