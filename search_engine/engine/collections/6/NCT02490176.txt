      peptide-1 (GLP-1) is an incretin hormone that regulates plasma glucose, and has direct
      effects on the cardiovascular system. In our previous study, the GLP-1 analogue liraglutide
      could improve left ventricular function in patients with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial
      infarction. However, the effects of GLP-1 on HF patients remain unclear. Pulse indicator
      continuous cardiac output (PiCCO) technology is a combination of transpulmonary
      thermodilution and pulse contour analysis, which measures hemodynamic variables (left
      ventricular ejection fraction, volumes, and mass) in a fast and feasible way. Therefore, the
      aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of liraglutide on hemodynamic variables in HF
      patients using the PiCCO system.
