      tissue solvent effect. Until now, there is no other alternative that provides its activity
      characteristics. Although it represents many advantages, and it is usually considered safe,
      some cases of mishap and systematic reviews about case reports of NaOCl accident especially
      during endodontic procedures, have been reported in the literature. NaOCl may lead
      potentially very damaging injuring results with acute pain, swelling, hemolysis, ulceration,
      inhibition of neutrophil migration, endothelial and fibroblast cell damage, nerve weakness or
      damage, trismus and tissue necrosis if it overflows the periapical area.

      The aim of this prospective observational investigation is to determinate the frequency of
      the extrusion in endodontically treated teeth.

      The patients who applied to the clinic for dental treatment will be identified as having root
      canal treatment indication for at least one tooth. After the detailed medical and dental
      history will be obtained, the written consent form was taken from the patients who wanted to
      participate in the study. Age, gender, medical history, preoperative pain and pulpal status,
      having any periapical radiolusency of the related tooth will be recorded and root canal
      treatment will be performed according to routine procedures. After treatment, the code of
      tooth according to FDI classification, number of root, apical diameter, volume and
      concentration of irrigation solution will be recorded.

      Routine treatment follow-up will be performed in patients who has no NaOCl overflow from the
      root during procedure. The patients with NaOCl overflow during the treatment process,
      appropriate treatment will be planned and followed up until symptoms regress.
