      versus that of nitrazine test in vaginal wash of pre-labour rupture of membranes
      patients.Each patient with rupture of membranes will be assessed clinically and then if not
      in labour , patients will be divided into 2 groups, 5ml saline will be injected in the vagina
      of each patient in every group then the vaginal wash will be collected in a test tube. Urea
      and creatinine group, biochemical tests for urea and creatinine in mIU/ml to detect their
      presence in the wash will be done. In Nitrazine group wash will be assessed by nitrazine
      paper showing bluish discoloration in rupture membranes. Sensitivity of each test in
      diagnosed rupture of membranes will be assessed.Which means how many patients in each test
      show positive results in case of diagnosed case.
