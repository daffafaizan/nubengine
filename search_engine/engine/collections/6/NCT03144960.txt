      occurrence of symptoms and signs corresponding to the involvement of focal areas in the
      brain.The two main types of stroke are ischemic and hemorrhagic.Thrombosis can form in the
      extracranial and intracranial arteries when the intima is roughened and plaque forms along
      the injured vessel.The endothelial injury permits platelets to adhere and aggregate, then
      coagulation is activated and thrombus develops at site of plaque.Blood flow through the
      extracranial and intracranial systems decreases, and the collateral circulation maintains
      function. When the compensatory mechanism of collateral circulation fails, perfusion is
      compromised, leading to decreased perfusion and cell death. Stroke is the third leading cause
      of death in the United States. Many people die each year from stroke in the United
      States.Stroke is the leading cause of serious, long-term disability in the United States.
      Nearly one fourth of strokes occur in people under the age of 65.High blood pressure is the
      most important risk factor for stroke. Intravenous recombinant tissue-type plasminogen
      activator is the only Food and Drug Administration approved treatment for acute ischemic
      stroke. Mechanical thrombectomy improves clinical outcomes in patients with acute ischemic
      stroke caused by a large vessel occlusion.There is no apparent benefit of intravenous
      thrombolysis to patients with ischemic stroke undergoing mechanical thrombectomy. The study
      will be performed involving ischemic stroke patients with proximal occlusion within 4.5 hours
      from stroke onset.
