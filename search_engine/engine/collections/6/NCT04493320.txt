      function declines with aging, that dopaminergic dysfunction contributes to deficits in
      behavior, and that L-DOPA administration improves cognitive and motor performance. The
      long-term goal of this line of research is to determine how dopaminergic dysfunction
      contributes to clinical presentations of LLD, how responsive behavioral symptoms are to
      modulation of dopamine function, and to identify novel targets for future interventions.
      Investigator's approach is to enroll 30 psychiatrically healthy elders and 60 depressed
      elders at Columbia/NYSPI exhibiting either slowed processing speed or slowed gait speed.
      Participants will undergo thorough clinical evaluations and complete PET imaging measuring
      different aspects of the brain's dopamine system, neuromelanin-sensitive MRI measurement of
      longterm dopamine transmission, functional MRI focused on effort-based decision making and
      reward processing, a comprehensive neurocognitive evaluation, a physical performance
      evaluation, and measurement of inflammatory markers. To assess responsivity of the dopamine
      system to modulation, depressed subjects then will be randomized to L-DOPA or placebo for 3
      weeks, followed by repeat multimodal MRI and cognitive/behavioral assessments. In a second
      phase, participants will receive the opposite intervention for an additional 3 weeks followed
      by clinical and cognitive assessments only. This proposal is significant and innovative, as
      no prior published study has comprehensively examined dopamine-dependent behaviors in LLD.
      This will inform treatment approaches focusing on facilitating cognition and movement,
      reducing the effort cost of voluntary behavior, and promoting behavioral activation.
