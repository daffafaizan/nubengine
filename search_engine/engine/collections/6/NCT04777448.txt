      leading to dyspnea, effort limitation and sometimes right heart failure and death. Balloon
      pulmonary angioplasty (BPA) is a new method of treatment for inoperable CTEPH or persistent
      CTEPH after surgery. BPA restores blood flow in the treated areas and improves or even
      normalises hemodynamic parameters measured during a right heart catheterization.
      Nevertheless, the vast majority of patients retain dyspnea and impaired exercise capacity
      after angioplasty procedures.

      Exercise training has been demonstrated to alleviate exercise dyspnea and to improve exercise
      capacity in many chronic cardiopulmonary conditions. Pulmonary rehabilitation (RHB) can
      improve symptoms, quality of life and exercise capacity in patients with pulmonary vascular
      disease of different etiologies including CTEPH. Furthermore, RHB does not present any
      particular risk for CTEPH patients with normalized or near-normalized pulmonary hemodynamics.
      Unfortunately, access to RHB remains a concern in many countries. Tele-rehabilitation (tRHB)
      has been shown feasible and effective some cardiac or pulmonary diseases. Our hypothesis is
      that tRHB may also be effective in CTEPH patients with normalized or near-normalized
      pulmonary hemodynamics after BPA treatment.

      This randomized controlled study aims at comparing the effects of tRHB with the effects of
      simple advices regarding exercising in CTEPH patients with normalized or near-normalized
      pulmonary hemodynamics after BPA treatment.
