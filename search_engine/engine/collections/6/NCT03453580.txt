      closely related with portal vein system diseases, such as collateral circulation of portal
      hypertension and portal vein thrombosis.

      The prevention of Esophageal variceal bleeding and hepatic encephalopathy in hepatic
      cirrhosis has become a hot spot in clinical practice.

      Three-dimensional reconstruction of images obtained by multi-slice spiral computed tomography
      portography (MSCTP) is clear, realistic, and accurate.

      It can directly and quickly display all anatomical information of collateral portal vein
      system, and is recognized as a good method to display blood vessels
