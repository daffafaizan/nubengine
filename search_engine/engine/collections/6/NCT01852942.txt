      on stable ART randomized in a 1:1 ratio to losartan (50 mg orally daily titrated to 100 mg
      daily) vs placebo for 30 months. We plan to enroll a total of 63 HIV infected subjects to
      ensure that 50 complete the protocol. All HIV infected subjects will undergo biopsies of
      inguinal lymph node (LN) and gut associated lymphatic tissue (GALT) for primary endpoint
      analysis at baseline, 12 and 30 months after study enrollment. Blood will be collected at
      least quarterly throughout the study and an intensive blood pharmacokinetic (PK) study will
      be conducted at month 1. All HIV infected subjects will be vaccinated with the quadrivalent
      human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine at months 23, 25 and 29.5 to measure immune function. 5
      HIV uninfected control subjects will also be enrolled.

      The primary endpoint is to determine the impact of losartan on lymphoid tissue fibrosis in
      HIV infected, ART treated adults. This will be determined by measuring the amount of collagen
      deposition in lymphoid tissues and the integrity of the FRCn using immunohistochemistry (IHC)
      and quantitative image analysis (QIA).
