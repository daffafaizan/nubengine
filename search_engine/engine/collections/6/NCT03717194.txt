    
      This study is a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, active-competitor, parallel-group study
      that is anticipated to enroll 120 patients. Patients taking metformin and/or DPP4 inhibitors
      as per local label for â‰¥12 weeks without a dose adjustment before enrollment will be eligible
      for screening. All patients will have a screening period comprised of an up to 2-week
      screening phase prior to randomization. In order to qualify for randomization, patients must
      demonstrate compliance based upon pill count (80%) and discretion of the investigators during
      the Run-in phase.

      Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) will be masked to patients after
      randomization. To prevent partial unblinding, urinary glucose excretion (UGE) results will be
      masked to patients. Urine glucose, albumin, calcium, and creatinine will be measured
      separately on-site visits.
