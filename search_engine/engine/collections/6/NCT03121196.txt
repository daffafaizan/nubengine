      reported that deprivation is the main cause of inequalities in health. Several studies have
      already shown an association between socioeconomic deprivation and adverse birth outcomes.
      EPICES score is the only one that measure individual deprivation. The EPICES score should be
      therefore included systematically in standard follow-up of pregnant women.

      Descriptive analysis will assess women's characteristics and prevalence of social
      deprivation. Two groups of women will be compared deprived women and non-deprived women.

      Association between EPICES score and the adverse perinatal outcomes will be assessed by
      quantile regression.
