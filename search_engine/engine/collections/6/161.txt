a sensitive and specific fluorescence assay for tissue serotonin .a sensitive and specific method for the estimation of serotonin inbiological materials is described . in this method, serotonin is reactedwith ninhydrin to form a product whose fluorescence is eight times moreintense than the native fluorescence of serotonin in strong acidsolution . with this method it is possible to measure serotonin inorgans in which endogenous serotonin had not been previously detectedand to study the subcellular distribution of this amine in the ratpineal and adrenal glands .
