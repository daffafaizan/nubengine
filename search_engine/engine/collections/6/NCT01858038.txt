      be pursued at the Clinical Research Unit at Wellman Center for Photomedicine (MGH). A
      side-by-side comparison of untreated vs. one topical treatment of ablative fractional
      photothermolysis in qualifying subjects will be made. Ten subjects will receive treatment on
      randomly-assigned portions of their scars, in addition to non-treated control sites. The
      primary measures of efficacy are (a) blinded evaluation of scar improvement from standard
      digital photographs taken before and after the treatments, (b) changes in scar volume
      (measured by 3D Image system) and/or scar width, and (c) a quantitative characterization of
      gene expression measured by mRNA expression levels from treated and untreated scars and
      control sites. The primary measures of side effects are inflammatory and pigmentary outcomes
      assessed by blind evaluation of digital photographs taken before and after the treatments.
      Another study endpoint includes histopathological examination and comparison of treated and
      untreated scars.

      An FDA-approved 10600 nm Fractional laser source will be used for laser exposures performed 2
      months prior to 2 skin biopsies (each 24 mm x 4 mm) of treated and untreated scar sites. A
      control site, with no treatment will also be left for clinical, histological and molecular
      examination.
