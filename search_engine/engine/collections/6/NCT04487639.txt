      for COVID-19 symptomatology (fever, cough, headache, myalgia, diarrhea, anosmia,
      pharyngodynia). In addition, a nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 research by RT- qPCR will
      be performed on the day of semen collection. On the same day, serological tests will be
      carried out, and 30 to 50 days after, according to HAS specifications with methods validated
      by the National Reference Center. Seminal fluid and spermatozoa will be separated by density
      gradient centrifugation for a posteriori molecular analysis of SARS-CoV-2 presence.

      Will thus be measured, within the same ejaculate, the concordance between the presence of
      SARS-CoV-2 in the seminal fluid and in the sperm cells fraction.

      The investigators will also determine if the virus presence in the sperm is related with :

        -  (i) the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the nasal swab;

        -  (ii) patient symptomatology;

        -  (iii) a specific serological profile;

        -  (iv) a particular oncological pathology and / or treatment. The investigators may also
           find out if the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 in semen affects sperm quality.

      This study will be the first one examining the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in semen from cancer
      patients. This will guarantee the safety of fertility preservation procedures during the
      COVID-19 pandemic.
