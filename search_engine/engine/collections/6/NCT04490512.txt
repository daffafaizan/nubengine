    
      BS-01 is a randomised, placebo-controlled, double- blind phase 1 dose-escalation study in
      women with normal cytology or low-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.

      The primary objective is to assess the safety and tolerability of subcutaneous
      administrations of FluBHPVE6E7. Secondary objectives are the assessment of the systemic
      immune responses to immunisations with FluBHPVE6E7 , changes in HPV infection status and
      cervical cytology, and biodistribution.

      Study medication is administered subcutaneously three times (Day 0, Week 4, Week 12). Study
      participants are randomised at a ratio of 3:1 for FluBHPVE6E7 or placebo. The first cohort is
      treated at dose level 107.5 fTCID50/dose. The second cohort is treated at 109 fTCID50/dose.

      Interim safety reviews are performed by a Data Monitoring Committee. After completion of the
      dose-escalation and in order to collect additional safety data on the highest safe and
      tolerated dose level, four additional study participants are enrolled into an expansion
      cohort.
