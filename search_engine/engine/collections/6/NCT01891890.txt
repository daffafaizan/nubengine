    
      This is a prospective multicenter, randomized, open-label, central assessor, parallel-group
      study of children ages 5 years, 6 months to 16 years, 0 months with newly diagnosed
      Localization Related Epilepsy (LRE) to establish whether three common antiepileptic drugs
      (AEDs) used as first line LRE treatment (lamotrigine (LTG), levetiracetam (LEV), or
      oxcarbazepine (OXC)) are associated with differential cognitive side effects on attention. It
      is predicted that one AED will be identified with greater negative cognitive effects on
      attention. The study will also examine whether there are differential risks for drug-related
      behavior change. The study will address whether 6 month attentional outcomes can be reliably
      predicted based upon shorter term cognitive change assessed soon after beginning AED therapy,
      and establish practice effects associated with repeated test exposure when on constant doses
      of AED.

      Children will undergo cognitive testing after study enrollment and no more than a week after
      AED initiation. Selected measures will be repeated at the first follow up clinic visit after
      beginning AED treatment, and the primary endpoint will be the attention performance obtained
      at the subjects' 6 month follow-up clinic visit.
