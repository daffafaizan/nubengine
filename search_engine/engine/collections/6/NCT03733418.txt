    
      VIOLET-BUD is an ancillary study to a parent double-blinded, placebo-controlled randomized
      control trial (RCT) evaluating how a single, high-dose (540,000 IU) oral Vitamin D3 treatment
      affects 90-day mortality in patients who are at high risk for ARDS and have Vitamin D
      deficiency (plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D < 20 ng/ml) at enrollment. The parent RCT (Vitamin D
      to Improve Outcomes by Leveraging Early Treatment [VIOLET], NCT03096314) is part of the
      Clinical Trials Network for the Prevention and Early Treatment of Acute Lung Injury (PETAL)
      sponsored by the NHLBI. The VIOLET trial completed enrollment in July 2018 with 1,360
      randomized to either high dose, enteral Vitamin D3 or placebo.

      This ancillary study will provide additional funding to perform comprehensive
      neuropsychological (cognitive) evaluations, which were not part of the parent trial. These
      neuropsychological evaluations will be conducted 12 (+/- 4) months after randomization among
      a subset of 140 survivors enrolled in VIOLET. This ancillary study will conducted in 7 (out
      of 42) sites.
