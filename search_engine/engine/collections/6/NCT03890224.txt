      of death in the world, especially in countries of middle to high income, like EU. Despite the
      improvements in survival by using acute non- invasive ventilation (NIV) to treat patients
      with exacerbations of COPD complicated by acute hypercapnic respiratory failure (AHRF), these
      patients are at high risk of re-admission and further life-threatening events. Furthermore,
      in a recent study of 110 patients who had AHRF (RESCUE study, Struik, Thorax 2014), at one
      year after discharge 65% had another life-threatening event, and 49% had died. New recent
      data suggests that NIV at home can reduce re-admissions (HMV-LTOT, Murphy, JAMA 2017), but in
      a small proportion of patients, and with a high level of expertise. There is an urgent need
      to develop strategies to reduce the number and severity of exacerbations of COPD. With
      healthcare objectives and budget constraints, telemonitoring of COPD patients is an important
      challenge in most European countries. RESCUE2-Monitor is the next step. This European trial
      (currently, France, Spain and Portugal) will test the hypothesis that home NIV, with a highly
      adapted ventilatory strategy (hereafter referred to as 'TARGETED VENTILATION'), compared to
      no home NIV (only hospital NIV), to non-targeted home NIV or to rescue home NIV will reduce
      re-admission to hospital or death in COPD patients, is possible using e-medicine, and will
      reduce costs of health.
