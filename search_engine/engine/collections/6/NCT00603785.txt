      nasal polyps. Since Xolair has been shown to be effective in asthmatic subjects with evidence
      of atopy and elevated IgE, we will limit our study to patients with chronic sinusitis and
      these parameters. The primary objective is to determine if Xolair decreases mucosal thickness
      on CT scan after 6 months of treatment.
