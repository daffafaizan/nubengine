      years at Tactile Communication and Neurorehabilitation Laboratory (TCNL) at the University of
      Wisconsin - Madison. All human subjects testing was performed under IRB approval. The PoNS™
      is an experimental device that has been evolved over this same period at TCNL, and is not FDA
      approved. An Investigator's Brochure and attendant Safety Chart have been developed to
      satisfy requirements for an Investigational Device Exemption, and provide additional context
      with respect to the research proposed here.

      The goal of this work is to test the effectiveness of this device with standard
      rehabilitation therapy on individuals who have operationally induced balance disorders from
      blunt or blast head trauma.

      SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES:

        1. To compare the effectiveness of active PoNS-2 (PoNS™) device combined with standard
           vestibular rehabilitation to a placebo PoNS™ device with vestibular rehabilitation in
           patients with blast and blunt head trauma induced dizziness over the time period of a
           standard course of therapy.

        2. To compare the effectiveness of active PoNS™ device combined with standard vestibular
           rehabilitation to a placebo PoNS™ device with vestibular rehabilitation in patients with
           blast and blunt head trauma induced dizziness three months after a standard course of
           rehabilitation.
