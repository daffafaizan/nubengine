      Traditionally, the presence of urinary bladder fibrosis has been confirmed directly with
      bladder biopsy or using urodynamic testing.

      We will use ultrasound ARFI (acoustic radiation force impulse)-derived shear wave velocities
      to potentially identify the presence of urinary bladder wall fibrosis. We hypothesize that
      shear wave velocities found within the bladder wall will increase with increasing evidence of
      fibrosis.
