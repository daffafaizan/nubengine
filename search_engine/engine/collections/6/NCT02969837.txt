    
      Primary Objective

      • The primary efficacy endpoint will be the rate of sCR and/or the rate of negative MRD by
      next generation gene sequencing (NGS) by clonoSIGHT (Adaptive Biotechnologies) at the end of
      8 cycles among non-transplant candidates and transplant candidates who agreed to defer
      transplant

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of elotuzumab in combination with KRd, when
           administered to subjects with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.

        -  To determine the rate of MRD by next generation gene sequencing (NGS) by clonoSIGHT
           (Adaptive Biotechnologies) and by multi-color flow cytometry (MFC) at the end of Cycle
           4, 8,and 12 for all subjects, and end of C18 (for subjects who are MRD+ at the end of C8
           but MRD- at the end of C12 only), 24 months after C1D1, and yearly after that.

        -  To estimate time to event, including duration of response (DOR), progression-free
           survival (PFS), time to progression (TTP), and overall survival (OS).

      Exploratory Objectives

        -  GEP, proteomics, and gene sequencing to evaluate the correlation between treatment
           outcome and pre-treatment subject profile.

        -  Immunologic correlative studies including FcγRIIIa V genotype.
