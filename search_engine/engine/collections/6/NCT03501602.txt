      operation requiring intubation. Patients will be divided into protector LMA and I-gel LMA
      groups by closed envelope method. Forty patients are planned for both groups. The age,
      weight, height, body mass index (BMI) of the patients, operation to be performed, ASA,
      mallampati, thyromental distance values will be recorded. A standard induction of anesthesia
      will be applied to the patient. After 2 minutes the LMA will be inserted. It will be recorded
      how many numbered LMAs are used, success rate, number of trials, optimization maneuver
      required. With LMA, whether sufficient amount of tidal volume can be given to the patient and
      whether sufficient amount of chest departure is observed during ventilation will be recorded
      together with tidal volume values. In patients with adequate ventilation, an Aintree catheter
      placed on a fiberoptic bronchoscope in LMA will be delivered. Fiberoptic laryngeal appearance
      staging will be performed:

      Stage 4: only the cords look Stage 3: cords + posterior epiglot seen Stage 2: cords +
      anterior epiglot seen Stage 1: no cords seen Cord vocals will be seen on the monitor and the
      aintree catheter will be sent into the trachea. After insertion of the trachea, the
      fiberoptic bronchoscope and LMA are removed and the patient's intubation tube is advanced
      through the Aintree catheter in the appropriate size and the tube is placed in the trachea.
      Once participants have made sure that the tube is trachea, it will be removed. The time from
      insertion of the LMA to placement of the endotracheal tube will be coded. During the
      procedure, the patient's blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, any complications
      that may develop will be recorded.
