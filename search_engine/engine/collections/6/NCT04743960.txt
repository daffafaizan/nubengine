      health, partly through limiting sleep disruption and circadian misalignment. Acute sleep and
      circadian rhythms disturbances are associated with cardiometabolic derangements, including
      persistent hyperglycemia, a significant contributor to life-threatening complications.
      However, it is currently considered standard practice for patients on parenteral nutrition to
      be fed for 12-hour periods overnight. Current guidelines lack explicit guidance regarding the
      time-of-day when nutrition support should be administered. Thus, the overall objective of the
      clinical trial is to comprehensively examine a novel dimension of clinical nutrition by
      determining whether advancing the timing of home parenteral nutrition from overnight to
      daytime regimens leads to improved glucose profiles and sleep quality, and other changes in
      plasma metabolic signatures. The study is a 2-week controlled cross-over feeding trial where
      20 short bowel syndrome patients will follow their usual overnight parenteral nutrition
      regimen for one week, and then advance their feeds to daytime for a second week. Patients
      will be assessed objectively using non-invasive, novel technologies and 'omics techniques.
      The investigators hypothesize that advancing the timing of home parenteral nutrition feeds to
      a daytime regimen is a cost-efficient, effective, and feasible nutrition timing
      countermeasure against metabolic derangements, fragmented sleep, and decreased quality of
      life. Results of this study may provide evidence-based, cost-efficient, and effective
      nutrition support countermeasures against hyperglycemia and sleep disruption, and could
      potentially modify current widespread clinical nutrition support practice.
