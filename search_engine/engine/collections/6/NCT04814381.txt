      attacks that occur for more than one year with no remission period or with remission periods
      lasting < 3 months (ICHD-3 criteria). In certain cases, CCH patients become drug-resistant
      and continue to suffer almost daily attacks.

      Ketamine appears to be effective in a variety of chronic pain conditions, such as refractory
      headache, and can show an enhanced analgesic effect when combined with magnesium. A single
      infusion of ketamine-magnesium combination has been described to reduce attacks in 17
      patients with rCCH. The main outcome was a comparison of the number of daily attacks two
      weeks prior to the infusion and one week after (days 7-8). The number of daily attacks
      decreased from 4.3±2.4 before treatment to 1.3±1.0 after treatment (p<0.001). 13/17 had at
      least 50% response. Thus, the goal of this placebo-controlled study is to try to confirm
      these findings.
