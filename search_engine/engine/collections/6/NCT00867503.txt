      treatment of ovarian cancer in women who are refractory to standard drug regimens. Non-cross
      resistance to platinum is critical for the development of effective salvage regimens in this
      platinum resistant population. In addition bendamustine's cytotoxic effects are thought to
      occur via several mechanistic pathways, apoptosis, DNA repair, DNA replication, DNA
      transcription. The study seeks to determine the efficacy and safety of bendamustine in women
      with advanced ovarian cancer.
