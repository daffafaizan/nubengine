    
      The purpose of this study is to identify and characterize blood diseases presenting at
      Shanghai hospitals and to compare them with respect to clinical presentation, phenotype,
      molecular characteristics, benzene or other exposures and genetic susceptibility. The format
      for these studies is a set of clinical series superimposed on a case-control design that
      enables integration of detailed clinical and molecular characterizations of disease
      pathogenesis together with an evaluation of potential confounding and interacting factors
      within a structured statistical analysis of benzene exposure.
