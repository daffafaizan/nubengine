      established technology. Research utilizing rTMS in patients with alcohol use disorder has
      shown some promising results. The limitations of this approach include the duration of the
      treatment (approximately 40 minutes per treatment session). Recently, researchers have
      aggressively pursued modifying the treatment parameters, such as using accelerated
      intermittent theta-burst stimulation (aiTBS), to reduce treatment times with possible
      enhanced efficacy with some preliminary success. This study intends to further modify the
      parameters to create a more rapid form of the treatment and look at the change in
      neuroimaging biomarkers.
