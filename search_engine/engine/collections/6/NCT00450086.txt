      in patients with collagenous colitis. Efficacy of mesalazine was never tested in collagenous
      colitis by placebo-controlled trials. This trial will check the superiority of mesalazine
      over placebo using the common clinical symptom of collagenous colitis, which is chronic or
      recurrent non-bloody, watery diarrhea.
