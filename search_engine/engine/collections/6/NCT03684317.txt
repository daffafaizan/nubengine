      prevention, and primary prevention remains poorly explored. By reconstructing the entire
      trajectories of patients having developed primary drug dependence, from the genesis of first
      drug exposures, investigators will identify patients' profiles and early changes in drug use
      that could accurately predict future complications. Pharmacoepidemiological methods are
      particularly relevant in the field of abuse and drug dependence. By definition, specialized
      care seeking can only be achieved after emergence and identification of the problem.
      Outpatients data obtained through medico-administrative database are then the only source of
      evidence that could enable to ascertain accurately history of past drug consumption
