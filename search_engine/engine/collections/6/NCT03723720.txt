      with ADR other indicators are needed. MAP (mean adenoma per colonoscopy) reflects the quality
      of examination of entire colon and is considered to be the most objective quality indicator.
      The aim of our study is to compare MAP with ADR and PDR (polyp detection rate) of all
      colonoscopists in our department.

      We want to retrospectively assess the quality indicators of all colonoscopies from January
      2013 to December 2017. We want to calculate ADR, PDR and MAP of all our endoscopists for all
      colonoscopies in patients over 50 years of age excluding therapeutic, IBD, management of
      complications and sigmoidoscopies (screening, surveillance, diagnostic) and separately only
      for screening colonoscopies. Correlations between MAP/ADR and MAP/PDR will be performed using
      PearsonÂ´s correlation coefficient.
