      histologic cancer subtype - such as adenocarcinoma of the lung or breast - there is
      significant heterogeneity in cancer behaviour and response to therapy. Recognizing genetic
      mutations that promote disease facilitates targeted treatment; this has been demonstrated in
      several small subgroups of cancers in which specific genetic mutations or translocations have
      been successfully treated with targeted chemotherapy agents.

      Analyses of individual patients demonstrate unique molecular signatures for every cancer
      examined. Frequently, multiple different pathways are involved in disease growth and
      progression and the dominant process varies from person to person and perhaps even within
      different sites of disease within one person. As well these variations evolve in response to
      treatment. With many recognized mutations personalized evaluation of the genetic signature
      encoded in DNA and RNA may enable directed therapy to the appropriate oncologic pathway
      thereby providing information to help guide chemotherapy choices.
