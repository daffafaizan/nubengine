           1.1 To provide a definitive proof that vision therapy (VT) can improve the accommodative
           function of myopic children by comparing the results from treatment group to placebo
           group.

           1.2 To minimize the influences of confounding variables by randomly assigning the
           intervention.

           1.3 To observe the longitudinal effects of VT on accommodation system and its effect on
           axial length.

        2. Hypothesis:

      VT can improve the accommodative functions of 8-12 years old Chinese myopic children with
      poor accommodative response.
