      CSF, are useful for identifying cognitively normal (CN) elderly who are likely have early AD
      pathology ("preclinical AD"). However, they are invasive and/or expensive. The goal of the
      current study is to develop and validate cognitive proxies of AD biomarkers by using
      cognitive tasks that are dependent on brain regions impaired by very early AD pathology. If
      successful, these tasks will provide a non-invasive and cost-effective way to identify and
      track change in CN individuals at high risk for progressing to mild cognitive impairment
      (MCI) and dementia stages of AD and thus will facilitate future prevention trials in pAD.

      Subjects will attend three study visits. During the first study visit, subjects will have
      eligibility criteria confirmed, have a blood sample drawn, and complete about half of the
      cognitive tasks. The second visit, which will occur within one week of visit one, will
      involve completion of the remaining cognitive tasks. Subjects will also be asked to have a
      PET-CT scan during visit three (to occur within 3 months of visits 1 and 2).
