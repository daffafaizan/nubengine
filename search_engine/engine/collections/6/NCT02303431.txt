    
      Phase 1, open-label, multiple-center study in pediatric patients from 0 to < 18 years of age.
      Patients will receive a single dose of edoxaban to match either the 30 mg (low dose) or the
      60 mg (high dose) exposure in adults. Exact doses will be selected during the study on the
      basis of PK modeling of emerging data. If unanticipated exposures are observed, the target
      doses may be modified to best match expected exposure response relationships observed in
      adults.

      Enrollment in the study will start with the low dose, highest age group (adolescents) and
      will continue from low to high dose in each age group and from higher to lower age groups.
      Enrollment in the next dose/age cohort will begin after 50% of the subjects have completed
      the previous dose/age cohort.

      Age cohorts and dose groups: (6 participants each in low and high dose groups, for a total of
      12 participants per age cohort)

        -  12 to < 18 years of age

        -  6 to <12 years of age

        -  2 to <6 years of age

        -  6 months to <2 years of age

        -  0 to <6 months of age
