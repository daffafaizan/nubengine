      outcome measures was discontinued and all primary and secondary outcome measures were
      reported in 2012.

      An amendment protocol allowed subjects who were on study treatment to enroll in a Long Term
      Follow Up (LTFU) phase if they had evidence of clinical benefit but no local access to
      standard of care treatments. Subjects received study treatment until disease progression,
      unacceptable toxicity, or subject withdrawal. In LTFU only Adverse Events data were
      collected. For the LTFU the Outcome Measure "Number of participants with the indicated Grade
      3 or Grade 4 Adverse Events (AEs) occurring in >=2% of participants in either treatment arm"
      and "Adverse Events" were updated.
