      play a role in slowing myopia. The experimental BHVI2 eye drops were proven to be safe for
      in-eye use in the trial that was conducted in Sydney, Australia. The investigators wish to
      evaluate the effects of experimental BHVI2 and 0.02% atropine eye drops either alone or in
      combination mainly on the pupillary and accommodative responses in children aged between 6 to
      13 years old over a one-month period.
