      conditions and inflammatory disease of the eye with a relatively favorable safety profile.
      However, systemic administration carries the risk of systemic side effects, which in the case
      of infliximab can be severe, such as increased risk of infection, reactivation of
      tuberculosis or Hepatosplenic T-cell Lymphoma.

      Direct intravitreal administration of medication is the preferred method of treatment for
      retinal vascular disorders. The eye is a self contained organ relatively isolated from the
      systemic circulation by the tight blood retinal barrier. Effective intraocular drug levels
      can be achieved with a much smaller amount of medication if injected intravitreally and this
      also results in minimal systemic exposure to the patient. Preliminary studies have shown that
      Infliximab may have a positive role in the management of retinal vascular disorders in humans
      when administered intravenously, and can be an effective treatment intravitreally in animal
      models. No data has been published yet on intravitreal use of infliximab in human subjects.

      We plan to study the safety and tolerability of intravitreal injections of infliximab in
      human subjects with refractory diabetic macular edema or choroidal neovascularization. Our
      infliximab dose will be 0.5mg/0.5ml, as it follows the reconstitution instructions in the
      Product Insert. This dosing will fall within the therapeutic dosing found within the animal
      study as it leads to the same vitreous concentration as the7.5 Âµg dose in group B rat eye
      study. (4)
