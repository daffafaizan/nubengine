      Laval University) will be recruited to undergo this randomized, triple cross-over study.
      Three nebulizers will be tested, the Wright, the Bennett-Twin and the new Aeroneb Solo.

      Breakdown of study procedure: Participants will undergo three (potentially four) methacholine
      challenges, one with each nebulizer in randomized order. An additional methacholine challenge
      may be performed for screening purposes if the participant has not undergone methacholine
      challenge testing in one of the participating labs in the previous 6 months. The screening
      challenge will be performed with the standard nebulizer used at the given testing site (i.e.
      the Wright or the Bennett-Twin).

      The methacholine challenges performed with the Wright and Bennett-Twin nebulizers will follow
      the two-minute tidal breathing protocol as outlined in the 1999 American Thoracic Society
      Guidelines for Methacholine Challenge Testing. The testing protocol used with the Aeroneb
      solo will be identical save for a 1 min inhalation period instead of 2 min. Each challenge
      will be stopped when a participant's forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) drops at
      least 20%. This will allow for the determination of the participant's PC20 (provocative
      concentration of methacholine causing a 20% fall in FEV1), which will subsequently be
      converted to a PD20 (provocative dose) value. A minimum 24-hour washout period between
      challenges will be enforced.
