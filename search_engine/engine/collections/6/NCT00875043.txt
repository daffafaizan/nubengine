      understood and potentially preventable complication. Ischemic optic neuropathy, affecting
      both the anterior or posterioir portions of the optic nerve, is the most common cause of
      postoperative vision loss(POVL). Other, less common causes include retinal artery occlusion,
      retinal vein occlusion, retinal embolism, and cortical blindness. The estimated incidence of
      POVL in patients undergoing general anesthesia is 1/60,000. The incidence dramatically
      increases in cardiopulmonary bypass and prone spine surgery with estimates at 1/1600 and
      1/1100, respectively. The etiology is unknown but it is thought to be multifactorial, and
      several potential risk factors have been identified, including degree of hypotension,
      preoperative hematocrit, external compression of the eye, blood loss and prone position. The
      investigators are proposing eight volunteers in two different sessions of 5.5 hours each. The
      first session the volunteer will lie prone of the flat Jackson table and the second session
      the volunteer will spend 5 hours prone on the Jackson table with a table elevation of 6
      inches. The following measurements will be done: Intraocular Pressure (IOP) with a device
      called the Tonopen-XL, the Nidex NM 200 to visualize the retinal optic nerve imaging,
      refractometry, ultrasound, corneal thickness pachymetry, measurement of proptosis,
      measurement of pupillary reflex, The volunteers do not receive anesthetic medications or
      intravenous fluids and will provide a baseline for comparision with patients enrolled in the
      prospective study.
