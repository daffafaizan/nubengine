      hospitalized patients with severe infections, as well as in outpatients with
      community-acquired infections such as UTI. Variation in prevalence exists across countries
      and regions. Travels outside own country of residence, like France, whatever the duration
      (short or long)or the reason (professional or leisure), are known risk factors for acquiring
      and disseminating MDRGN bacteria. Digestive carriage of multidrug-resistant
      Enterobacteriaceae could be a source of infection for the host as well as a source of
      dissemination. Qualitative and quantitative gut colonization by MDRGNB is poorly studied in
      non-hospitalized people who stayed for a few months out of France. The total amount of
      multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae influences the spread of the dissemination. In our
      knowledge, no clinical study has been carried out to qualify and quantify gut colonization by
      MDRGNB in volunteers after staying 4-6 months outside country of residence such as France. A
      specific microbiological method will be evaluated in this study.
