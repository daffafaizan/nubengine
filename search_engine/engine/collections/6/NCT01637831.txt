      patients with IPF. Underlying, and usually under-diagnosed OSA in these patients may be a
      reason for impaired sleep quality and may consequently have a negative influence on their
      daily activities and overall quality of life. In addition, underlying OSA may have a negative
      influence on the already impaired IPF-related morbidity and mortality. The absence of any
      effective treatment for IPF so far indicates that the recognition and treatment of generally
      under-diagnosed OSA in IPF patients should be a primary goal. Therefore, our primary aim in
      this study was to assess the results of effective CPAP therapy in terms of sleep quality and
      overall quality of life in IPF patients with moderate to severe OSA. The investigators used
      generally accepted instruments to assess quality of sleep and overall life. In addition, the
      investigators tried to determine and overcome the reasons for poor CPAP compliance in these
      patients
