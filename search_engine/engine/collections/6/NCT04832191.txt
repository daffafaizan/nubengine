      worldwide (1).

      Early detection and accurate diagnosis of breast cancer aims to reduce morbidity and
      mortality and have essential role in management and improved prognosis of breast cancer (2).

      Mammography has been established as the imaging modality for screening and early detection of
      breast cancer; however, it is accused of having low sensitivity and specificity in women with
      dense breasts (3).

      Contrast-enhanced MRI considered the gold standard method for diagnosis of breast cancer;
      but, it has many limitations as high cost, long examination time and limited availability
      (4,5).

      Contrast-enhanced spectral mammogram (CESM) is considered now a relatively new imaging
      modality which can provide both anatomic and functional information of the breast lesion
      similar to MRI (6).

      CESM like contrast-enhanced MRI (CE-MRI) is used to detect angiogenesis of the lesion in the
      mammography suite. It includes high- and low-energy images during a single compression after
      contrast injection (7).

      The advantage of CESM over MRI is that it is less expensive and easier to perform with
      shorter examination time. Also, the higher sensitivity of MRI is plagued by numerous
      false-positive foci of enhancement (8).

      Also, CESM can replace MRI in case of patient contraindicating for MRI as patients with
      pacemakers, aneurysm clips or metal implants, or severe claustrophobia (7).

      So, our study aims to determine the value of CESM and answer the question of does CESM could
      replace CE-MRI in diagnosing breast cancer? so,our study aimed to assess the accuracy of CESM
      in comparison to contrast-enhanced breast MRI in the evaluation of solid breast lesions.
