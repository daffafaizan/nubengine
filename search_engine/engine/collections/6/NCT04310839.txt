      and 2/3 in a context of neoplasia. This surgery is associated with numerous postoperative
      complications. Since the start of Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) in 1997,
      complications have been steadily reduced by optimizing surgical and anaesthetic techniques.
      At the same time, the average length of post-operative stay has decreased. In 2014, ERAS was
      the subject of recommendations by the French Society of Anaesthesia and Resuscitation, taken
      up by the French Health Authority (HAS) in 2016, and which are now an integral part of
      surgical management in colorectal surgery. More recently, two teams have set up an outpatient
      colectomy program. The three studies published on this subject show encouraging results, in a
      private structure, with no increase in postoperative complications.

      In accordance with the recommendations on ERAS published by the HAS, a program involving
      pre-, per- and post-interventional investment, has been put in place. Patients are discharged
      on D0, followed by close monitoring by a home care nurse twice daily. This nurse is in charge
      of collecting clinical data in order to detect possible early signs of post-operative
      complications that would justify re-hospitalisation after a medical-surgical decision.
