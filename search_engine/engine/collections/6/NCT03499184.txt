    
      In this clinical trial total 60 participants of clinically diagnosed chronic periodontitis
      will be recruited after taking a written consent for their approval. Participants will be
      divided into 3 groups A, B and C through the process of randomization using a method of
      opaque sealed envelopes. A research assistant will be hired for the purpose of randomization
      and allocation concealment. All participants will be asked to pick an opaque envelope
      containing the details of treatment products. After randomization plaque sample will be
      obtained from the depth of periodontal pockets and all the clinical periodontal parameters
      will be recorded in every participant. Then all the participants will undergo SRP. After SRP
      group A will be given antibiotics Amoxicillin 500 milligrams (mg) for 3 times a day (TDS) and
      Metronidazole 400 milligrams (mg) for twice a day (BD) for 5 days. Group B will be given
      probiotics lactobacillus reuteri 1.2 billion colony forming unit (CFU) sachets twice daily
      for swallowing with water for 12 weeks. Group C will be given lactobacillus sachets of same
      amount and participant will be asked to mix it with little amount of water and apply it on
      teeth with the toothbrush twice daily after brushing with standard tooth paste for 12 weeks.
      Patients will be recalled at the interval of 3, 6, 9 and 12 weeks for the recording of
      clinical periodontal parameters. After completion of trial plaque sample will be taken again
      from every participant and will be processed through qPCR to check bacterial count of
      porphyromonas gingivalis before and after treatment. Whereas comparison between clinical
      periodontal parameters will be made at the interval of 0, 3, 6, 9, 12 weeks.
