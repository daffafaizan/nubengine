      effectiveness of a multi-component intervention on improving fruit and vegetable consumption
      in teenagers and their mothers. Participants will be allocated in three groups with a) an
      intervention group in which mothers and children receive the intervention and questionnaires,
      b) only the children receive the intervention and mothers and children receive the
      questionnaires, and c) mothers and children are in active control group and only receive the
      questionnaires. The intervention package contains behavior change techniques targeting
      outcome expectancy, self-efficacy, action planning, coping planning, and self-monitoring. The
      active control group receives an information sheet regarding recommendations on fruit and
      vegetable intake. There will be 3 assessment points in time, with 1 months in between. All
      the intervention materials and information sheets will be handed to participants after the
      baseline assessment. The self-monitoring calendar will be collected at time 2 assessment.

      The primary outcome of this study is to estimate the dyadic mechanisms between mothers and
      their children regarding improving fruit and vegetable intake. Secondary outcome is to
      investigate whether fruit and vegetable consumption did improve in the intervention groups in
      general and also to find the psychological mechanism behind the changes during the time of
      the study.
