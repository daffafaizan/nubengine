    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the impact of neoadjuvant niraparib tosylate monohydrate (niraparib) therapy
      prior to radical prostatectomy (RP) on pathologic tumor stage, frequency of lymph node
      metastases and positive margin rates for patients undergoing radical prostatectomy for
      high-risk, clinically localized prostate cancer with alterations in DNA repair pathways.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To assess 5-year biochemical recurrence in subjects with high-risk prostate cancer and
      DNA-damage response defects after prostatectomy.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive niraparib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every
      28 days for up to 3 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Following completion of treatment, patients then undergo standard of care surgery.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 3 months for
      2 years, and then every 6 months for up to 3 years.
