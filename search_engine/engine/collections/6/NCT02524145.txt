      apparently normal systolic function, so called "heart failure with a preserved ejection
      fraction" or HFpEF. To date, no effective therapy for HFpEF has been found, in part because
      of failure to discern key pathophysiologic pathways.

      Although HFpEF is a complex disease with multiple pathophysiologic pathways leading to the
      phenotype of heart failure, virtually all proposed mechanisms involve some impairment of
      diastolic function - the inability of the heart to fill adequately at a low enough pressure
      to avoid congestion which during physical activity or exercise, prevent an increase in heart
      rate. A number of studies have purported the inability to increase heart rate (chronotropic
      incompetence) is responsible for the diminished exercise capacity.

      Alternatively, the investigators hypothesize that the stiff, slowly relaxing heart of
      patients with HFpEF causes a marked elevation in pulmonary capillary pressure during exercise
      which leads to premature fatigue prior to achieving maximal heart rate, thus causing apparent
      "chronotropic incompetence".
