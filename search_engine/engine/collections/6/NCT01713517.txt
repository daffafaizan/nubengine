      malaria vector control tools LLIN and IRS. This is done by a cluster randomised trials of
      universal coverage LLINs versus universal coverage LLINs in combination with IRS, with levels
      of baseline insecticide resistance in the main vector balanced between the two study arms. In
      each cluster resistance to the insecticide used on LLINs is monitored, and malaria incidence
      is estimated from cluster specific cohorts of children followed up over the duration of the
      study. Resistance impact will be assessed from the ratio of incidence rates in clusters with
      high compared to those with low resistance and from a continuous measure of resistance
      expressed as percentage loss of mosquito mortality when exposed to insecticide in
      standardised WHO tests. Resistance mechanisms will be studied in subsets of study clusters.
