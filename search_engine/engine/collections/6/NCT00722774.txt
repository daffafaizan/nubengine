      influenza virus. The first cases occurred in China in 1956, and disease became widespread in
      1956-1957, resulting in the "Asian Influenza" pandemic that was responsible for between 1 and
      4 million deaths worldwide. H2N2 viruses have not circulated since 1968, when they were
      replaced by H3N2 influenza viruses and the resurgence of H1N1 viruses. For this reason, a
      large proportion of the population is now susceptible to infection with H2N2 influenza. If
      this subtype re-emerges, it could potentially cause the next pandemic. This vaccine,
      therefore, is an important priority in the development of vaccines against potential pandemic
      influenza strains.

      This vaccine trial will be conducted in the Center for Immunization Research isolation unit
      in the Mason F. Lord Building at the Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center (Baltimore, MD).
      The study will be initiated between April 1st and December 20th, 2008, when wild-type
      influenza is unlikely to be circulating in the Baltimore area.

      An individual's participation in the study will last approximately 90 days. All participants
      will receive two vaccinations approximately 4 - 8 weeks apart. After each vaccination,
      participants will remain in isolation at the study site for at least nine days or until
      rRT-PCR assays for influenza are negative for 2 consecutive days. A physical examination and
      nasal wash will occur each day during the isolation period. Blood collection will occur in
      isolation beginning on Day 7 until release. Follow-up outpatient visits are scheduled on Days
      28 and 56 after the first vaccination and on Day 28 after the second vaccination. Follow-up
      visits will include serum collection, nasal wash, and interim medical history.
