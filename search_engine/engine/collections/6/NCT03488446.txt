      in China (Nanfang Hospital of Southern Medical University; Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer
      Center; First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University; The Third Affiliated Hospital, Sun
      Yat-Sen University) designed to determine the predicted performance of radiomics-based
      prediction model for identifying metastasis of each station lymph nodes by enhanced CT for
      preoperative noninvasive assessment of the lymph node status in patients with gastric cancer.
      The study includes the construction of CT radiomics-based prediction model and the validation
      of the prediction model.
