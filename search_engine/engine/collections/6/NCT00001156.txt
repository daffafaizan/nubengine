      diseases of the nervous system such as multiple sclerosis (MS). The studies in the NIB range
      for studies of the natural history of MS to trials of new experimental therapies. In order to
      recruit patients into the various NIB research studies, patients with a tentative diagnosis
      are initially seen by the NIB to assess the accuracy of the diagnosis and to assess the level
      of disease activity occurring in the patient. Patients seen under the NIB screening protocol
      are evaluated in clinic with a complete neurological examination. Blood studies necessary to
      eliminate the possibility of many other causes of disease that may resemble MS are performed.
      Spinal fluid examination may be preformed if uncertainty exists with respect to the
      diagnosis. Finally, patients will have at least one MRI preformed to assess the consistency
      with MRI findings expected in MS. Most patients will have a series of three MRIs done
      approximately one month apart in order to assess the frequency of new contrast enhancing
      lesions occurring in the patient. The level of disease on MRI is important both from the
      standpoint of diagnosis as well as determining if the patient may be eligible for any other
      NIB protocols. To assess the patient's eligibility for other NIB studies, the NIB may
      periodically follow patients in whom the diagnosis is uncertain or in whom the level of
      disease activity is not clear for the initial evaluation.
