    
      Primary Objective: This study objective is to document the incidence of complete responses
      compared to oral vorinostat, in a randomized 2-arm trial after a maximum of 12 months of
      treatment for subjects with stage IB/IIB mycosis fungoides with mSWAT < 50 who have never had
      lymphoid disease or a prior bone marrow / HSCT transplant.

      Secondary Objective: To further explore the toxicity profile of A-dmDT390-bisFv(UCHT1) fusion
      protein for subjects with mycosis fungoides who have been selected to be free from
      preexisting cardiac disease and never treated with Campath.

      Number of Subjects: Lead-in Dosing: 12 / Randomized: 162

      Patients will receive full supportive care during the course of the study. Participation in
      the study will require IV infusions of the research agent 2 times a day for four days
      (protocol FDA outpatient approved), as well as frequent outpatient blood draws for the first
      30 days. Patients with partial or complete remissions at their 1 month follow up visit will
      have another follow-up visit on day 60, then every three months for 1 year, followed by
      annual visits to assess duration of the response.
