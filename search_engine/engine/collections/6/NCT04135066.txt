      various mechanisms, and diet/nutrition has been linked to both gut and brain health. However,
      majority of related evidence derived from animal models or human study of small scale.

      In the WEBRAIN, we aim to investigate the relationship between diet, gut microbiome and brain
      structure and function in a large human cohort study via deep phenotyping the participants:
      1) objective measurement of physical activity using accelerometers over 2 weeks; 2)
      continuous blood glucose monitoring over 2 weeks, with two standard test meal during the 2
      weeks, and traditional diet assessment with FFQ and 24h recalls; 3) measurement of cognitive
      function and brain images with the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination-Revised (ACE-R) and
      brain MRI; and 4) measurement of gut microbiome using metagenome and 16S rRNA sequencing
      techniques.
