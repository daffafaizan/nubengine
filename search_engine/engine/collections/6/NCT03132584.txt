      intervention and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational
      intervention to use for further studies. "Investigational" means that the intervention is
      being studied.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved alemtuzumab for aggressive
      lymphoma but it has been approved for other uses.

      In this research study, the investigators are studying the combination of cyclophosphamide
      and alemtuzumab in participants with several types of aggressive lymphoma which are positive
      for a protein called CD52, the target of alemtuzumab. Studies in laboratory models of CD52
      positive lymphoma showed the combination of cyclophosphamide and alemtuzumab was very
      effective. Cyclophosphamide causes a specific type of immune cell, called a macrophage, to
      attack lymphoma cells treated with alemtuzumab. Both drugs have been used in participants
      with lymphoma but have not been previously combined in this way. The investigators hope to
      identify the highest dose of the drugs that can be safely given together and to see if the
      combination if effective in treating these lymphomas.
