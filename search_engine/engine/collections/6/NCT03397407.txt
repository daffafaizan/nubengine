      cardiovascular (CV) fitness are key links between lifestyle factors like diet and exercise on
      one hand, and CV disease on the other. However, very little is known about these links during
      the juvenile years, when the processes leading to CV disease are at an early stage of
      development. The specific aims are as follow: (1) to determine the relations of free-living
      diet and exercise to total body percent fat ( percent BF), visceral adipose tissue and CV
      fitness in black and white boys and girls of varying socioeconomic status. (2) to determine
      the relations of fatness and fitness to different CV risk factors. Design and methods: (1)
      Recruit 800 14 to 18 year olds, 200 in each ethnicity and gender subgroup. (2) Assess diet
      with seven 24-hour recalls, and exercise with two seven-day recalls and Actigraph monitors.
      (3) Measure percent body fat with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, visceral adipose tissue
      with magnetic resonance imaging and CV fitness with a multi-stage treadmill test. (4) Measure
      major fatness- and fitness-related CV disease risk factors (e.g., total cholesterol:HDL
      cholesterol ratio, insulin, systolic blood pressure, left ventricular mass indexed to height,
      fibrinogen). (5) Conduct multivariate and univariate analyses to determine relationships.
      Health relatedness: The provided by this project will assist in the formulation of effective
      lifestyle interventions targeted to specific demographic groups for primary prevention of CV
      disease, starting early in life when the foundations for adult disease are being laid.
