      mitochondrial damage and organ dysfunction in sepsis. Melatonin accumulates in mitochondria
      and both it and its metabolites have potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity,
      preventing organ dysfunction in a rat model of sepsis. In a recent Phase I dose escalation
      study (DAMSEL 1) the investigators showed that oral doses of melatonin in healthy subjects
      were well tolerated with no adverse events and resulted in levels of circulating melatonin
      and its major metabolite which had beneficial anti-inflammatory and antioxidant actions in ex
      vivo studiesStage 1 will assess the pharmacokinetics of melatonin and its major metabolite
      after a single dose of 50 or 100mg exogenous melatonin in two small groups of patients with
      sepsis in order to make dosing and dosing interval decisions for Stage 2.

      Stage 2 is a double blind randomised controlled trial of melatonin in patients with sepsis at
      the dose and dosing interval decided after Stage 1. Measurements of melatonin and its major
      metabolite, and an array of biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative stress will be made,
      plus transcriptome (mRNA) analysis. This study will inform a planned larger phase II trial.
