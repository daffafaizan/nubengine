    
      A total of 20 subjects with at least one relapse of Clostridium difficile infection
      undergoing Intestinal Microbiota Transplantation via colonoscopy will be recruited in this
      study. The patients will produce a stool specimen at the time of colonoscopy and a biopsy
      will be obtained during the colonoscopy. At 2 weeks and 10 weeks, stool specimens and
      anoscopy will be collected to be tested for C. difficile polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and
      the fecal microbiota. Subjects will be referred from all locations of Emory Healthcare.
