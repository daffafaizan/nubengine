      posterior tooth in the left maxilla will be considered for enrollment. Subjects who meet the
      inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomized to receive alveolar ridge preservation on
      one side of the maxilla and only an extraction on the other side of the maxilla.

      Extraction of the failing teeth will be performed atraumatically; a mucoperiosteal flap will
      not be employed. After removal of the tooth, the alveolus will be meticulously debrided and
      cleaned. In the test site, the socket will be filled with xenograft and a collagen membrane.
      In the control site, no graft material or collagen membrane will be used. Clinical
      measurements, standardized peri-apical radiographs and Cone Beam Computed Tomography scans
      will be performed immediately following tooth extractions (visit 2) and 6 months (visit 4)
      after extractions.

      Subjects will be examined over the course of 6 months. Investigators will be trained prior to
      participating in the study. Training will be undertaken during a site initiation visit and
      will include a detailed description of all study procedures including treatment methods, and
      measurement methods to obtain study endpoints.
