      potentiating factor is the microbiome. The microbiome has become increasingly studied with
      the advent of new techniques, but these have not been applied to uveitis. We wish to evaluate
      microbiome composition in patients with the ocular inflammatory diseases uveitis who may be
      on standard therapy or receiving orally-administered tolerizing antigen therapy.

      Study Population: A total of 200 participants may be enrolled in this study. Of those
      participants, the goal is to enroll 50 healthy controls and 150 with various types of
      uveitis.

      Design: This is an observational, prospective, single-center study. Participants will receive
      a complete ocular examination with clinical testing as determined clinically and will provide
      stool and blood samples using a standardized method. Participants may have multiple visits
      and may provide multiple samples in order to evaluate changes in microbiota composition with
      disease status or treatment.

      Outcome Measures: Alterations in bacterial diversity, microbiota composition and changes in
      relative abundance of various taxa or species will be analyzed between healthy volunteers and
      participants and between various types of uveitis. In addition, comparisons will be made
      between these findings and the immunome and metabolome.
