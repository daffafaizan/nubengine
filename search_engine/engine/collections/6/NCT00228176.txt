      placebo-controlled, 2-arm parallel group trial (rimonabant 20-mg od vs placebo). There will
      be a three-stage screening process including successively a Screening visit, a Screening CIMT
      and a validation of the Screening CIMT by the Imaging Core Laboratory. Patients complying
      with all inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomized in one of the 2 treatment groups
      less than two weeks after Screening visit. Study drug (rimonabant 20 mg od or matching
      placebo) will be administered during 30 to 32 months. At inclusion, patients will be
      counseled to follow a mild hypocaloric diet, to increase their exercise level, and to stop
      smoking (if smokers). Glucose/lipid parameters will be assessed at Baseline and every 6
      months until the Month 30 visit. CIMT will be performed at Baseline and every 6 months until
      final assessment at Month 30 (primary endpoint).A post-treatment follow-up visit at Month 35
      will allow the collection of all adverse events and cardiovascular outcomes occurring after
      last study drug administration
