      rehabilitation after hip fracture. We have an assumption that it is of utmost importance to
      continue and progress the functional training that started in the acute phase at the
      hospital, also during the sub-acute phase while the patients are at short-term stays in
      nursing homes. However, there are indications of lack of resources in the nursing homes and
      that the nurses may be less concerned with their role and participation in the patients'
      rehabilitation process. Possibly, this creates a discontinuity in the rehabilitation efforts
      during short-term stays that may have a negative impact on the patients' recovery of physical
      functioning.

      In this study the aim is to continue and progress the functional training started during
      hospital stay, such as training in walking and further on repetitive sit-to-stands, as part
      of the daily habitual routine during short-term stays in the nursing homes. This type of
      functional training may be motivational and easily recognizable to the patients, and it can
      also be carried out by the nursing staff with only initial guiding from a physiotherapist.
      There is lack of knowledge on the effect of additional functional training, incorporated as
      part of the habitual daily routine during short-term stays, on the patients' immediate and
      long term recovery of physical functioning and activity level after hip fracture, compared to
      usual care alone.

      The study is designed as a single-blind randomized controlled trial (RCT), comparing the
      effects of additional functional training (functional training group)to usual care alone
      (control group) during short-term stays in nursing homes.
