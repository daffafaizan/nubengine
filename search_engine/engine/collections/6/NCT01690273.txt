      program (M) or mobility plus elastic resistance exercise program (M+R) or no exercise (C).
      The exercises group sessions were conducted twice per week for 16 weeks. This supervised
      program comprised 30 minutes of outdoor stretching and mobility exercises for the spine and
      limbs (M). After the flexibility program, M+R group carry out more 30 minutes of elastic
      resistance exercises. The mobility, disease activity and functional parameters were evaluated
      at baseline and after 16 weeks, with the evaluator blinded to the treatment group.
