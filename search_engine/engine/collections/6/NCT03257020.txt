      Germany) is a widely used commercial device in ophthalmology field. For a long time, retinal
      nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness was measured with OCT to detect and follow up glaucoma
      patients. Bruch's membrane opening - minimum rim width (BMO-MRW) is relatively new parameter
      which measures the minimum distance between Bruch's membrane opening to internal limiting
      membrane (ILM). BMO-MRW,a new parameter, is known to have better diagnostic performance than
      RNFL thickness and recently, many researches has been performed on this new parameter. SD-OCT
      can measure RNFL thickness and BMO-MRW at the same time. The test procedure is not different
      from RNFL thickness measurement but only software implemented in OCT device calculates
      BMO-MRW as well as RNFL thickness. The investigators are going to compare these two
      parameters and find out the relationship between two parameters.
