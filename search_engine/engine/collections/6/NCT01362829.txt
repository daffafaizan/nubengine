      provide survival benefit.It was thought that early optimization of ScvO2 within 6 hours in
      emergency department brought survival benefit to patients of septic shock or severe sepsis.On
      the other hand, early lactate clearance is associated with improved outcome in patients with
      severe sepsis or septic shock. In patients with severe sepsis and septic shock, those with
      low lactate clearance had poor prognosis, despite optimization of ScvO2. It is unknown if
      ScvO2 could still guide hemodynamic resuscitation after admission into ICU. The investigators
      perform a prospective observation study to see the correlation between ScvO2 and clinical
      outcome (including organ failure, disease severity, and survival) and the correlation between
      lactate and clinical outcome. Furthermore, if ScvO2 >= 70% is still of prognostic
      significance in ICU, we will investigate the outcome in patients with high ScvO2 and high
      serum lactate levels, and to evaluate the clinical features of this patient population.
