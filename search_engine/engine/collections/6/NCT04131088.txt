      upper third of the arm and whose distal end does not extend beyond the axillary vein. It
      requires the identification of the vein by ultrasound which reserves its installation for
      professionals trained and authorized to use the ultrasound scanner.

      Midline is currently indicated for intravenous treatments > 7 days and in patients with
      precarious venous capital. According to the manufacturer's instructions, it can be kept in
      place for up to 30 days, while the recommendations of the Centers disease of control specify
      that this period could be extended to 49 days.

      Its use is expanding rapidly in France, thus meeting the needs of patients who do not require
      a central line and whose use of a standard peripheral venous catheter is not possible (low
      venous capital or treatment duration > 7 days). Its installation, essentially carried out by
      qualified anaesthetists, does not increase medical planning and is therefore an attractive
      alternative to the installation of a central catheter whose complications (thrombosis and
      infections) are known.

      The only data on the complication rate, estimated at 1-2%, are from low-potency observational
      studies. In the absence of high-level evidence, most of the good practice recommendations
      published in 2019 are based on expert consensus.

      This leads us to conduct a large-scale observational study to assess the complication rate
      and identify the associated factors. This study will provide professionals with reliable
      scientific data for the next review of good practice recommendations.
