    
      -  The study will enroll a total of 428 cases of primary in situ coronary artery disease
           patients (all patients enrolled with a maximum of two target lesions in different blood
           vessels and maximum of 2 stents per lesion. If more stents are needed for implantation,
           stents with the same brand are required, and mixing brands is not allowed for each
           patient except for salvage with implantation of other brand of stents.)

        -  Lesions with reference diameter of 2.5mm-3.5mm (by visual measurement) and with length
           â‰¤40mm (by visual measurement) will be selected, subjects meeting the inclusion and
           exclusion criteria and who agree to participate will be enrolled.

        -  Prospective, single-blinded, multi-center, randomized, controlled clinical trial;

        -  Patients with in situ primary CHD;

        -  Clinical sites: up to 18; patients will be enrolled in a 1:1 ratio (i.e., 214 cases
           enrolled into each group, the MiStent stent group and TIVOLI stent group);

        -  Clinical follow-up time points: 1 month, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months and yearly at 2-5
           years post index procedure;

        -  Angiographic follow-up at 9 months post index procedure; in-stent late lumen loss
           measured by quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) will be used as the primary efficacy
           endpoint for product evaluation;

        -  In this trial, the collection, collation, statistical analysis and adjudication of all
           relevant clinical and angiographic data will be conducted by an independent coronary
           angiography core laboratory (CCRF Medical Technology Co., Ltd.), data management and
           statistical center, clinical events committee and clinical audit agency. All patients
           will be followed up for 5 years (by telephone or outpatient form), and the incidence of
           adverse events will be recorded to allow a more accurate and reliable evaluation of the
           long-term safety of the MiStentTM drug (sirolimus) eluting coronary stent system.
