      enrolled in this study. Subjects were administered two 20mg doses of Campath-1H antibody
      therapy (Day 0 and Day 1) in combination with a short course of corticosteroids, and
      maintenance sirolimus.

      Subjects were followed for 3 years to compare the incidence and severity of rejection
      episodes, complications related to the immunosuppression, including infections, malignancies
      and adverse events. All subjects underwent protocol renal transplant biopsies at 6 and 12
      months (unless medically contraindicated).
