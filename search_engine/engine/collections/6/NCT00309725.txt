      arrhythmias and conduction disturbances, such as heart block. Holter monitors and
      Electrocardiograms were used to measure cardiac parameters at baseline, at the end of Week 2
      (first dose of 12 mg twice daily), at the end of Week 4 (first dose of 16 mg twice daily) and
      at Week 6 (after 2 weeks of maximum tolerated dose allowed in the trial, i.e., 24 or 32
      mg/day). Other safety data collected were adverse event reports, urine and blood analysis,
      vital signs and physical examination. Drug levels in the blood were also tested. Patients
      were randomized to receive either placebo or galantamine up to 32 mg daily (i.e., 4 mg twice
      daily in Week 1, 8 mg twice daily in Week 2, 12 mg twice daily in Weeks 3 and 4, and 16 mg
      twice daily in Weeks 5 and 6). Dosage could be reduced from 16 mg twice daily to 12 mg twice
      daily during the first 3 days of the 32 mg/day dosing period, if a patient could not tolerate
      the higher dose. This titration is more rapid and the dose is higher than currently
      recommended for treatment.
