      groups, outcome measures relating to concussion symptoms, cervical range of motion and pain
      pressure thresholds will be taken prior to and after the intervention.

      In the DN group, four muscles (upper fibres trapezius, cervical multifidus, levator scapulae
      and suboccipitals) will be palpated by a physiotherapist trained in dry needling. If a
      palpable trigger point is found, the physiotherapist will perform dry needling until a local
      twitch response is elicited. If a trigger point is not found, no dry needling will take
      place. In this way, up to 8 total muscles will be needled during the session. The participant
      will be in prone for the above procedure.

      In the MT group, soft tissue release will be performed on the above four muscles bilaterally.
      Cervical traction (unilateral grade 3 oscillatory distraction technique, any cervical segment
      between C0/C1 and C7/C7, 3-5 sets of 30 seconds) and mobilization (unilateral
      inferior-medial-posterior or superior-anterior-lateral, grade 3 oscillatory, any cervical
      segment between C0/C1 and C7/C7, 3-5 sets of 30 seconds ) will also be performed if the
      physiotherapist deems it necessary, specific to the spinal level noted to be involved. In the
      DN+MT group, MT interventions will be performed first, followed by DN, of the four above
      muscles. Immediately following intervention, the outcome measures will all be re-tested. The
      participants will also be instructed to fill out the SCAT-5 Step 2 upon waking the next
      morning. Additionally, if one or more of the cervical motions caused pain during initial
      testing, they will be asked to repeat the motion and report the current level of pain on the
      VAS scale.
