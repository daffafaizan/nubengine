      thyroid cancer. The majority of patients with MTC do not present with early stage disease.
      Differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) accounts for >90% of all thyroid cancers. In a sub-set of
      patients, thyroid cells become resistant to I-131 radioiodine therapy and subsequently
      develop distant metastases. In both MTC and DTC, systemic chemotherapy for metastatic disease
      is largely ineffective.

      LBH589 is a histone deacetylase (HDAC) with recently demonstrated activity to inhibit the
      Notch1 signaling pathway in MTC cancer cells and suppress tumor cell proliferation in DTC
      cancer cells. This clinical trial will evaluate the tumor response rate of LBH589 in patients
      with metastatic MTC or radioactive iodine resistant DTC.
