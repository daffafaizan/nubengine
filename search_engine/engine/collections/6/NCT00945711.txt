      have been seen collaboratively by International Diabetes Center (IDC) and Park Nicollet
      Eating Disorder Institute (EDI) staff from 2005 - 2008 and their matched eating disordered
      controls.

      Research Questions

        1. What are the general characteristics of the ED DM T1 population?

        2. How are ED DM T1 patients different from the matched eating disordered patients with
           respect to race, marital status, age of onset, eating behaviors, self-reported highest
           and lowest weight, exercise frequency and duration, number of hospital admissions,
           number of emergency room visits, medication needs, and other medical and
           psychological/psychiatric comorbidities?

        3. How are ED DM T1 patients different from the matched eating disordered patients with
           respect to the affective and cognitive aspects of eating disorders such as self-reported
           depression symptoms, body image distortion, thoughts and feelings about eating,
           psychological concerns, readiness to change, self-esteem and anxiety?

        4. For ED DM T1 patients, what is the time relationship of the diagnosis of diabetes and an
           eating disorder?

        5. For ED DM T1 patients, what is the relationship of BMI and A1c?
