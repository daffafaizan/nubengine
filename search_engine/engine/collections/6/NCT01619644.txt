      enable us identifying specific cognitive and motor deficits and their association thanks to
      imaging markers. Assessing the various aspects of motor skills, i.e. primary (movements,
      standing at ease position, immobility) and complex motor skills (actions and behaviours,
      motor aspects of feelings and language expressions) is an integral part of the clinical
      examination in psychiatrics.

      The main interest of a functional capacity analysis is to be used as an index allowing the
      assessment of the nervous system's global capacities and the study of the connections between
      cognitive functions and motor skills Main objective: Evaluate long term memory with subtest
      "point location" - CMS and "image recognition" RBMT A patient is said to be responder if
      after one year his or her test result increase for one point at least one of the two tests :
      a increase of one point to "point location" or "image recognition".

      Double-blind phase 2 clinical trial, designed as a one-step Fleming design but with a control
      group. Rubival is a two-parallel group randomized trial:

        -  a placebo group of 20 patients

        -  a group of 40 patients taking sodium valproate (HDAC inhibitor) with an oral dosage of
           30 mg/kg/jour
