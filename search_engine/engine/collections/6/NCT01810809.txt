      is a relatively new approach comprising the injection of hyaluronic acid into diarthrodial
      joints. Any osteoarthritic joint is eligible to this treatment modality, but the great
      majority of studies are for knee viscosupplementation. The dosis regimen is well established
      for the knee joint, but there is still no consensus regarding the optimal dosage for hip
      viscosupplementation. We will prospectively enroll 80 patients with hip osteoarthritis and
      will randomize them into four groups: Group zero will receive joint lavage with saline
      injection. Group 1 will receive joint lavage with saline injection and 2 ml of Hylan GF-20 (1
      ampoule of Synvisc Classic速). Group 2 will receive joint lavage with saline injection and 4
      ml of Hylan GF-20 (2 ampoules of Synvisc Classic速). Group 3 will receive joint lavage with
      saline injection and 6 ml of Hylan GF-20 (3 ampoules of Synvisc Classic速). The Visual
      Analogic Scale of Pain (VAS), the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Index (WOMAC速),
      and Lequesne questionnaires were completed at baseline and at Weeks 1, 4, 12, and 24. Our
      objective is to determine the optimal dosis for hip viscosupplementation
