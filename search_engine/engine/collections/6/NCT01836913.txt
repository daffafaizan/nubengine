    
      This is a prospective cohort study testing the hypothesis that in a proportion of patients,
      locoregional recurrence, observed at 6, 12 or 18 months after treatment, can be prevented if
      PET/CT-based treatment planning was used instead of CT-based treatment planning alone.

      Patients eligible for the study will undergo definitive radiotherapy with or without
      concomitant chemotherapy with planning-CT based target volumes, either or not followed by
      surgery.

      A planning-PET/CT will be made for research purposes only, and will be blinded for the
      treating physicians. This planning-PET/CT will not be used for actual treatment planning.

      In case of neoadjuvant chemoradiation the response on this therapy will be analysed at
      pathologic evaluation of the esophageal specimen.

      Routine follow up will be carried out every 6 months, using CT. In case of no locoregional
      recurrence and/or metastases, patients will be followed up to 18 months for study evaluation.

      In case of distant metastases, patients will be censored if locoregional recurrence is
      excluded. When indicated, palliative treatment will be given.

      In case of (suspicion of) locoregional recurrence, PET/CT-based recurrence analysis should be
      carried out with comparison and co-registration of CT-based and PET/CT-based target volumes.
