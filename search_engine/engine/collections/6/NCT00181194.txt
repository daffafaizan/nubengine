      first step in efforts designed to reduce asthma-related health disparities in urban areas.
      Improving communication will help providers tailor asthma therapies to their patients' needs,
      and help providers and patients to overcome barriers (e.g., concerns about adverse effects)
      to adherence with those asthma treatment plans.
