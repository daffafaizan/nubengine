      Alogliptin in combination with metformin hydrochloride was being tested to treat people who
      have Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with inadequate glycemic control despite treatment with
      alogliptin in addition to diet and exercise. This study looked at the efficacy and safety of
      alogliptin 25 mg once daily (QD) + metformin hydrochloride 500 mg QD compared to alogliptin
      25 mg QD + metformin hydrochloride 250 mg twice daily (BID) and alogliptin 25 mg QD
      administered alone.

      The study enrolled 374 patients. Participants were randomly assigned (by chance, like
      flipping a coin) to one of the three treatment groups-which remained undisclosed to the
      patient and study doctor during the study (unless there was an urgent medical need):

        -  Alogliptin 25 mg QD + metformin hydrochloride 500 mg QD

        -  Alogliptin 25 mg QD + metformin hydrochloride 250 mg BID

        -  Alogliptin 25 mg QD

      This multi-center trial was conducted in Japan. The overall time to participate in this study
      was 36 weeks (12-week screening period and 24-week treatment period). Participants made
      multiple visits to the clinic including a final visit 24 weeks after the start of study
      medication.
