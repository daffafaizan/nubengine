      medical care, can be difficult even for experienced medical practitioners. The pain of
      intravenous cannulation is considered the major limitation in pediatric clinical care.
      Reducing the pain of intravenous cannulation has been the motive for many investigations.
      Intervention methods used to reduce the distress related to painful procedures are widely
      recommended. The management of pain and anxiety is more essential because it may modify
      children's memory for procedural pain and the subsequent acceptance of later health care
      painful interventions. Distraction is the most studied psychological technique to relieve
      venipuncture-related pain and distress, with strong evidence supporting its efficacy in
      children.

      Art therapy commonly used to reduce pain and anxiety of children's disease but was not used
      in reducing distress outcomes of painful procedures.

      We used a collection of the image need for coloring and tracing called Trace Image and
      Coloring for Kids-Book (TICK-B).

      The purpose of this study is to exam the effectiveness of TICK-B in decreasing pain and
      anxiety during cannulation.
