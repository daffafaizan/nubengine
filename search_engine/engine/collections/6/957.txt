neurohypophysial principles in rats with familial hypothalamicdiabetes insipidus (brattleboro strain).antidiuretic and oxytocic assays wereperformed on tissues from 3 female rats withfamilial hypothalamic diabetes insipidus (di)and on 3 normal females.  oxytocicactivity was only slightly lower in the pituitariesfrom the di rats.  antidiuretic activityin the pituitaries from 2 di rats wasno more than that expected from theircontent of oxytocin.  thus, these pituitariesappeared to contain oxytocin but notarginine vasopressin.  the hypothalami fromthese 2 rats showed minimal antidiureticactivity, which might have been due tooxytocin or vasopressin.  the pituitaryfrom the third di rat contained more antidiureticactivity than could be due to oxytocin.antidiuretic responses to extracts ofpituitary and hypothalamus from thisrat resembled those produced by argininevasopressin.  this pituitary appeared tocontain about 1/100 the normal amount ofvasopressin.  since vasopressin can inhibitdiuresis in these di rats, it would appearthat they have a specific deficiency ofendogenous arginine vasopressin.
