      I. Evaluate the feasibility of a Smoking Cessation with Physical Activity (SCwPA)
      intervention among an African American (AA) church-based sample of adult current smokers.

      II. Conduct post-intervention focus groups to obtain feedback from pilot participants
      regarding the acceptability of the SCwPA project design and procedures.

      III. Examine how physical activity (PA) and the timing of PA initiation affects the
      mechanisms underlying cessation among an AA church-based sample of adult daily smokers who
      are attempting to quit.

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 3 arms.

      ARM I (PRE-QUIT PHYSICAL ACTIVITY): Participants receive telephone-based cessation counseling
      over 15-20 minutes 1-2 weeks before assigned quit date and nicotine patch for 6 weeks.
      Beginning 2 weeks before the assigned quit date, participants receive a Walking Program guide
      and engage in the SCwPA comprising brisk, self-paced walking with a goal of 150 minutes of
      exercise activity per week for 5 weeks.

      ARM II (QUIT DAY PHYSICAL ACTIVITY): Participants receive telephone-based cessation
      counseling over 15-20 minutes 1-2 weeks before assigned quit date and nicotine patch for 6
      weeks. Beginning on the assigned quit date, participants receive a Walking Program guide and
      engage in the SCwPA comprising brisk, self-paced walking with a goal of 150 minutes of
      exercise per week for 5 weeks.

      ARM III (NO PHYSICAL ACTIVITY): Participants quit smoking on an assigned date and receive
      telephone-based cessation counseling over 15-20 minutes 1-2 weeks before assigned quit date
      and nicotine patch for 6 weeks.
