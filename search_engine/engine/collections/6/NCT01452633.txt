      laparoscopic port sites to decrease post operative pain. One reason for this lack of a clear
      conclusion is the fact that prior studies included small and large port sizes. Many small
      port sites have little pain associated with them so showing a reduction with medicine is
      statistically difficult. The investigators have noted that larger, lateral port sites which
      require fascial closure are the sites that patients consistently note pain at. Our protocol
      will include the use of 0.25% marcaine injections at all the surgical ports other than the
      large lateral port used for gynecologic laparoscopy. Patients would then be randomized and
      surgeons would be blinded as to which patients receive the marcaine or a saline injection at
      the large lateral port site. Visual analog pain scales will be assessed at 4 and 24 hours
      after surgery. An additional two arms have been added to include 50 patients randomized to
      0.25% marcaine or saline injection just prior to incisional closure in the absence of any
      preincisional intervention.
