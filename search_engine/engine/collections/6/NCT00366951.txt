      of continuing the pregnancy. Labor induction in the presence of an unripened cervix is
      associated with prolonged labor, chorioamnionitis, and cesarean delivery. Numerous mechanical
      and pharmacological methods have been used for cervical ripening. There are limited numbers
      of rigorous studies comparing the efficacy of the various methods. One of the most common
      mechanical methods for cervical ripening is placement of a Foley catheter with a 30 cc
      balloon inside the cervix, with or without the use of oxytocin. The Foley balloon will
      disrupt the amniotic membrane surface and cause the release of prostaglandin, a natural
      chemical from the cervix, to facilitate the ripening process. Oxytocin will be used
      concurrently as the induction agent. Recently, a modification of this method, extraamniotic
      saline infusion (EASI) has become more popular. The EASI method involves similar procedure
      including the placement of Foley catheter inside the cervix; in addition, saline solution
      will be infused through the catheter. This additional step is thought to further facilitate
      the disruption of amniotic membrane surface. Both methods are safe and become the standard
      treatment for cervical ripening. However, there are no published trials so far comparing the
      two methods. The objective of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of Foley
      catheter with oxytocin and EASI with oxytocin for induction of labor requiring cervical
      ripening. The study is designed to be a single masked randomized trial.
