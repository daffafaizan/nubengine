    
      COMBAT-MI is an investigator-driven, randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled clinical
      trial aimed at evaluating the effect of Remote Ischemic Conditioning and exenatide, alone and
      in combination, on Myocardial Infarct size in 428 STEMI patients (107 per group) (ST segment
      elevation myocardial infarction). Patients with TIMI (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction)
      flow grade > 1 will be excluded. The study has a 2 x 2 factorial design (Remote Ischemic
      Conditioning , Exenatide, both or neither). The primary end-point will be Myocardial Infarct
      size measured by Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging (CMRI) performed 3 - 7 days after primary
      Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (pPCI) (expressed as % of left ventricular (LV) mass).
      Sample size has been calculated in 274 patients with TIMI 0-1 available for analysis of the
      primary end-point, and inclusion will end when this number is reached, which will require,
      according to the current rate of TIMI 0-1 in our STEMI population, to randomize 428 patients.
      Secondary end-points will include myocardial salvage index, based on angiographic and CMRI
      derived estimations of the area at risk, and frequency of Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events
      (MACE) and of major adverse events during admission.
