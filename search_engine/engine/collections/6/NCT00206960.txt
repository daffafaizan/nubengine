      greater Copenhagen area. The patients were randomized to treatment with either low doses of
      the typical antipsychotic compound, zuclopenthixol, or the atypical drug, risperidone.
      Patients and controls were examined at base-line and patients were re-examined after 3 months
      of treatment.The study has resulted in two finish Ph.D. theses (Torben Mackeprang and
      Birgitte Fagerlund).

      We are at present conducting a five-year follow-up study of the same cohort of patients and
      controls and plan a ten-year follow-up as well. The follow-up studies focus on brain
      structure (MRI), brain function, information processing, and psychopathology. We will
      correlate changes in structure and function to treatment, but no interventions
      (pharmacological or otherwise) are planned.
