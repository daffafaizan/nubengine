    
      This is a Phase I/II, open label, dose ranging study of the safety, tolerance, and
      anti-inflammatory activity of HE3286 in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Patients will
      receive study treatment (one of three open label doses) in addition to their current stable
      dose of methotrexate. Safety (via monitoring of vital signs, physical examination changes,
      ECG results, laboratory results, and adverse events), pharmacokinetics profiles (of HE3286
      and methotrexate) and anti-inflammatory activity will be assessed over a treatment period of
      29 days.
