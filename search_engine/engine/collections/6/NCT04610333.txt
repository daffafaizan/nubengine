      schools (30 upper secondary schools and 13 schools of health and social care). The schools
      included a total of 76 school teachers for teacher training (44 teachers from upper secondary
      schools and 32 teachers from schools of health and social care). Each included teacher will
      be asked to recruit a class of students (15-30 students) to test the effectiveness of the
      modified MBSR programme (in total approx. 1.000 students).
