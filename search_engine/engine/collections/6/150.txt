plasma androgens in women i. normal and non-hirsute females,oophorectomized and adrenalectomized patients .1. in a group of 20 normal non-hirsute females age 17 to 38, 18 non-hirsute patients with varied genito-urinary disorders, 8 oophorectomizedand or adrenalectomized patients plasma testosterone was measured by themethod of finkelstein et al. (1961) . conjugated androsterone andconjugated dhea were determined by a modified method of migeon + plager(1955) .2. mean baseline values in normal females were .11 .06 ug/100 mltestosterone, 11.8 5.5 ug/100 ml conjugated androsterone, and 29.5 15.5ug/100 ml conjugated dhea . no significant response to hcg could be seendexamethasone affected the conjugated dhea significantly, but did notseem to affect conjugated androsterone or testosterone .3. the non-hirsute patients showed essentially the same pattern . aneffect of dexamethasone on the levels of conjugated androsterone wasdemonstrated .4. oophorectomized women had baseline values for the conjugates in therange of normals . testosterone, however, was low with an average of.016 ug/100 ml . in the adrenalectomized patients no androgens weredetectable .
