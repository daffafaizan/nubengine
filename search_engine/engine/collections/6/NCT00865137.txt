    
      Stable kidney transplant recipients who are participating in the clinical trial FG-506-14-02
      and who are currently being treated with FK506E (MR4) under fasted conditions and who have
      had no changes in any of their medications for at least seven days will be enrolled in the
      sub-study. Following enrolment, all patients will remain on all their medication and the same
      dosing regimen throughout the study.During the study two 24 hour blood concentration time
      profiles will be collected, each one on the last day of Period 2 and Period 3 of the
      sub-study as follows:

      Profile 1 on Day 7 under fasted conditions

      Profile 2 on Day 14 under non-fasted conditions

      A total of five scheduled visits are planned.

      At least 24 patients with two complete, evaluable profiles are needed to estimate the effect
      of food on the oral bioavailability of FK506E (MR4).

      Blood sampling - For each sample a 2 mL aliquot of whole blood will be collected. The total
      blood volume for the two profiles taken per patient will be approximately 40 mL.
