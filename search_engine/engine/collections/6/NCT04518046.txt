    
      Sitravatinib is a spectrum-selective receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor that inhibits
      several closely related RTKs including the TAM family (Tyro3/Axl/MERTK), VEGFR2, KIT, and
      MET.

      NIVO/IPI are monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that inhibit the immune checkpoint proteins
      programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) and cytotoxic T- lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4),
      respectively.

      The current study is designed to evaluate the triple combination of sitravatinib plus
      NIVO/IPI in patients with solid tumor malignancies that have shown favorable responses to
      NIVO/IPI combinations in previous clinical trials. Combining sitravatinib and NIVO/IPI is
      predicted to have complementary effects in triggering a tumor-directed immune response.
