      and with a corresponding low energy intake. A high energy flux is achieved by high energy
      expenditure, equivalent to high physical activity and with a corresponding high energy
      intake, respectively.

      The protocol of this randomized, intra-individual nutrition intervention includes 12 one-day
      interventions with 3 different levels of energy flux and 4 different diet conditions.
