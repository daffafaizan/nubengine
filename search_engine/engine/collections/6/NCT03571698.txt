      applied with different size electrodes on the functionality, pain, range of motion (ROM), and
      muscle strength in patients wtih knee osteoarthritis (OA).

      Material and Metod: Sixty patients with knee OA who received physical therapy for knee pain
      and functional disability at Istanbul University, Faculty of Health Sciences, Division of
      Physiotherapy were included. These patients divided into three groups randomly. Group 1
      applied exercise programme. Group 2 performed exercise programme with NMES with standard size
      electrodes (5×5 cm²). Group 3 performed exercise programme with NMES with large size
      electrodes (10×20 cm², 3×18 cm², 10 3×7.5 cm², 7×14 cm²) NMES was applied for 20 minutes to
      Group 2 and Group 3. The patients attended 18 treatment sessions 3 times per week in the
      physical therapy clinic and underwent assesment before treatment and after 6 weeks of
      treatment. Pain was measured with Visual Analog Scale (VAS), range of motion (ROM) was
      measured with digital goniometer, muscle strength was measured with ''Hand-held''
      dynomometer, functional status were measured with WOMAC (Western Ontario and McMaster
      Universities) Index and stair climbing test, balance was analysed with one leg standing test.
      Patients satisfaction was scored with Global Change Scales.
