      pain variables across various procedures that historically have significant levels of
      persistent post-surgical pain. Further, bivariate correlations at different time points will
      be examined to see how DVPRS along with Pain Assessment Screening Tool and Outcomes Registry
      (PASTOR) correlates with other measures.

      Methodology/Technical Approach A total goal of 250 participants will be queried regarding
      their postoperative pain experience following shoulder arthroscopy and knee arthroscopy.
      Descriptive multidimensional tools (the DVPRS and the electronic Pain Assessment Screening
      Tool and Outcomes Registry (PASTOR)) will be used preoperative either during their
      preoperative surgical visit or the day of surgery and extending to 6 months postoperatively.
      As these tools have been utilized in previous studies for the prediction of persistent post
      surgical pain, the DVPRS will additionally be evaluated for its predictive validity as it is
      a short, easy-to-administer, bedside tool.
