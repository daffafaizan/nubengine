      spontaneous healing is poor and untreated defects predispose to osteoarthritis. Common
      current strategies such as arthroscopic debridement, microfracture, autologous osteochondral
      grafting, use of allografts and autologous chondrocytes implantation (ACI) still have
      drawbacks such as long and complex rehabilitation times, technically challenging operation
      techniques, defect-size limitations, donor-site morbidity, limited graft material and high
      costs. Furthermore many techniques show unsatisfactory long term results due to inferior
      quality of repair tissue as compared to native cartilage or have yet to prove the cost versus
      benefit. These drawbacks could be overcome by using a tissue engineered nasal cartilage
      graft, thereby reducing donor site morbidity without introducing additional risk of
      complication or technically challenging techniques.

      This study is a phase I, prospective, uncontrolled, investigator initiated clinical trial
      involving 25 patients, with the objective of demonstrating safety and feasibility in the use
      of engineered nasal cartilage grafts for repair of articular cartilage. The specific surgical
      target of the trial is the repair of one or two full-thickness cartilage defects from 2 cm2
      to 8 cm2 (per lesion, not exceeding a total of 8 cm2 for all lesions) due to traumatic injury
      on the femoral condyle and/or trochlea of the knee.
