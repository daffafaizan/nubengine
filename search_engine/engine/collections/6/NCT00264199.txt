      shown that many of these patients have areas of viable myocardium that are not effectively
      contributing to heart function.

      Further, chronic congestive heart failure is associated with some degree of insulin
      resistance in both skeletal and cardiac muscle.

      GLP-1 is a naturally occurring peptide hormone that acts as an incretin and has been
      intensively studied by many groups in association with type II diabetes and it has clearly
      shown its glucose lowering potential with very little risk of hypoglycemia in several trials.

      Recently GLP-1 has been shown to improve cardiac function in dogs with pace-induced
      cardiomyopathy, and in an open-labeled study it did improve cardiac function in patients with
      acute myocardial infarctions.

      Comparison: 48 hours of treatment with intravenous GLP-1 compared to placebo. Effect on
      global and regional left ventricular function, exercise capacity, insulin sensitivity and
      substrate metabolism.
