      therapy and avoidance of consequences. Over the years numerous risk factors were detected
      which emphasizes the importance of its prevention. Within these studies some possibilities,
      but no strictly defined rules of action for pharmacological or neuropsychological prevention
      are described. This is why in this randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study, the
      investigators want to compare two agents that were found to prevent postoperative delirium to
      a certain level, even in combination: the investigators arrange the patients within four
      study groups, one receiving Haloperidol, one Ketamine, one both and one placebo. The patients
      receive the study drug only once right before induction of anesthesia. After the day of
      recruitment there is the day of operation and a follow-up of three days (5 days of
      observation in total, where the investigators will test cognitive function with Mini Mental
      Status Examination (MMSE), Delirium Observation Scale (DOS), Nursing Delirium Screening Scale
      (Nu-DESC) or Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC). Additionally the
      investigators will measure and compare pre- and postoperative Cortisol, NSE and S-100beta
      levels.
