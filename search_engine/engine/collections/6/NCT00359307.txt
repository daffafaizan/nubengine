      atherosclerosis through a collaboration with the Framingham Heart Study. Since
      atherosclerosis is a disease of chronic inflammation of the arterial vessel wall, genetic
      variants in molecules that are responsible for the migration of leukocytes are likely to
      explain some of the genetic diversity in the rate of heart disease and strokes. Therefore we
      are conducting a molecular epidemiology study of the genetics of atherosclerosis using
      materials and clinical data already collected by the Framingham Heart Study. The Heart Study
      is a prospective epidemiological study of the natural history of heart disease and stroke
      that has involved individuals residing in Framingham, Massachusetts since the 1950s. We will
      compare risks of individuals with particular genotypes for developing atherosclerosis and its
      sequelae, coronary artery disease, heart attack, peripheral vascular disease, and stroke. If
      correlations of genotype with risk of atherosclerosis can be found, then this will facilitate
      new treatments of this disease based on interference with particular components of the human
      immune system.
