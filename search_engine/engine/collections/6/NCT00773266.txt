      to correct for aphakia without capsular support, partly combined with anterior or complete
      pars plana vitrectomy. Primary outcome measurements included visual acuity (6m Snellen
      charts), central endothelium cell count (cECC) and postoperative intraocular position of the
      IOL assessed with anterior segment optical coherence tomography (OCT).
