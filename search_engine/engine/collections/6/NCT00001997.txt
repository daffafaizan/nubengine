      levels in Group A are 200 to 500 cells/mm3; in Group B - 1 to less than 200 cells/mm3.
      Further stratification is by p24 positive or negative, antiviral therapy for more or less
      than a year, and zidovudine (AZT) versus didanosine (ddI). The duration of PEG IL-2 treatment
      is a maximum of 28 weeks. This is an outpatient study; patients will be observed for four
      hours after the first dose of PEG IL-2 and for one hour after subsequent doses.
