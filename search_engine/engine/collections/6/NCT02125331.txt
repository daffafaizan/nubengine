    
      This study is required to demonstrate that the non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP) measurement
      algorithms on two commercially available multifunction hemodynamic acquisition modules, the
      Patient Data Module (PDM) equipped with the DINAMAPÂ® SUPERSTAT algorithm ("PDM-SUPERSTAT")
      and the Patient Side Module (PSM) equipped with Datex-Ohmeda GE algorithm
      ("PSM-Datex-Ohmeda"), provide accurate NIBP measurements in accordance with the guidelines
      provided by the most recent International Organization for Standardization (ISO)
      81060-2:2013.

      Notably, the new ISO 81060-2:2013 supersedes the previous 2009 version of this standard, and
      this study is being conducted in accordance with the most recent applicable standards.

      This study will assess neonate, infant, children, pediatric, adolescent, and adult patients
      as well as adults with chronic atrial fibrillation in a population that requires non-emergent
      heart catheterization.
