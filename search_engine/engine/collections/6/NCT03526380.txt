      tailored for optimal delivery in the site setting. The translation strategy will be evaluated
      using the RE-AIM framework, which includes Reach (e.g., number of individuals receiving
      intervention), Effectiveness (e.g., patient/client outcomes), Adoption (e.g., numbers
      trained), Implementation (e.g., fidelity of intervention delivery) and Maintenance (e.g.,
      sustained in routine practice over time) with mixed qualitative and quantitative methods with
      intervention recipients.
