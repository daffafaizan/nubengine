      difference between acute AIH and chronic AIH. In this phase, the investigators analysed the
      serum biochemical results such as ALT,AST,IgG,PT,INR and so on, and also compared the
      histological performance. Finally, we compared the percentages of biochemical remission in
      the two groups, and the time from initial treatment to biochemical remission has also been
      put into the analysis. Now, the investigators are preparing for submitting the manuscript of
      phase 1.
