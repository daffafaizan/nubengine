      of evaluating whether the patient is true T0 or has remnant tumor in need for consolidating
      radical treatment. Methods for better selection of patients that potentially can avoid
      cystectomy is therefore needed.

      15O-labeled water (H2O) is the gold standard for PET quantification of regional tissue
      perfusion. 15O-H2O has been validated as a freely diffusible tracer for measuring perfusion
      in the myocardium and cerebral blood flow and 15O-H2O PET is the golden standard for
      noninvasive imaging to quantify tumor blood flow (TBF).

      Method: Patients scheduled for NAC followed by radical cystectomy due to histologically
      documented MIBC stage cT2-4a in the urinary bladder will be included. A 15O-H2O PET/MR scan
      will be performed at time of inclusion (baseline) and again after NAC prior to cystectomy.

      Hypothesis: We hypothesize that changes in tumor architecture and perfusion estimated with
      15O-H2O PET/MR measurements and clinical evaluation during NAC can identify patients with
      complete local response to chemotherapy and therefore select patients to avoid radical
      cystectomy.

      Perspectives: This study will be the first to use 15O-H2O as tracer in bladder cancer. If
      proven efficient, evaluation of patients undergoing NAC with 15O-H2O PET/MR could potentially
      safely select patients for a true bladder sparring approach and potentially give some
      patients the choice of chemotherapy monotherapy, or in combination with other systemic
      oncological treatments like immunotherapy. If successful, this should be followed by
      randomized studies to document the clinical benefit and potentially reduce cost and increase
      quality of life by safely selecting patients for bladder sparring treatment of bladder
      cancer.
