      significantly the diurnal somnolence compared to placebo confirming its wakening effect
      against EDS and demonstrating its anti-cataplectic effect when administrated on an individual
      titration scheme established on basis of individual benefit/tolerance ratio.This long-term
      safety pragmatic study will provide information about long-term treatment of BF2.649, and
      also allow patients who satisfy of BF2.649 treatment in previous or on-going studies of
      Bioprojet continuing to benefit this product.This is an open-label, naturalistic pragmatic,
      prospective longitudinal uncontrolled, multi-centre international trial assessing the safety
      and effect of long-term therapy of BF2.649 in treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness in
      narcolepsy, on 12-month follow-up.
