      Disease Collaborative Network and the patients/loved one's group Castleman's Warriors
      (Castleman's Awareness and Research Effort).

      Castleman Disease (CD) is a rare and poorly understood lymphoproliferative disease. The
      multicentric CD subtype (MCD) involves enlarged lymph nodes in multiple regions of the body
      and can be fatal if untreated. MCD patients demonstrate acute inflammatory crisis due to
      upregulation of inflammatory agents most notably IL-6 and VEGF followed by multiple organ
      failure and death.

      Unlock the Cell aims to identify the pathways the disease takes through flow cytometry
      studies. The purpose of the CD Research study is to collect blood samples and/or buccal swabs
      or saliva samples and medical information of MCD patients and compare them to control samples
      so researchers can understand the causes of MCD, and design treatments based on our findings.

      In this study, the investigators will analyze inflammatory markers, cells, and signaling
      pathways in prospectively collected blood samples using biochemical and RT-PCR techniques,
      proteomics, genomics, immunohistochemistry, storage for future use, cell culture treated with
      external stimuli, flow cytometry, and other molecular tests. A secondary aim is to collect
      excess stored tissue samples (e.g., lymph node, bone marrow) from previous procedures and
      store these samples along with unused blood samples for future research purposes to be
      performed at the University of Pennsylvania or shared with other Castleman disease
      researchers and biobanks.
