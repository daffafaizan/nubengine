           localization of thoracic lesions following intravenous injection of indocyanine green
           (ICG), determine if intravenous ICG leads to the intra-operative detection of
           intra-thoracic lesions or metastatic lymph nodes not readily identifiable on
           conventional diagnostic imaging modalities, and determine if intravenous ICG improves
           surgical resection.

        -  At the time of surgery, the indocyanine dye will be injected intravenously. The
           investigators will use a dose of 0.5 mg/kg administered prior to VATS.

        -  The "filtered" near-infrared light causes the indocyanine green dye to fluoresce so that
           the surgeon can identify the lesions most likely to contain tumor cells.The surgeon will
           also look at lymph nodes to see if metastatic disease can be found in this location
           using this technique. The lymph nodes are processed to look for metastasis.
