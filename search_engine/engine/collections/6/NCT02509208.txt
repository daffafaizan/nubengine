    
      Patients who require surgery for iliac crest bone graft (ICBG), pelvic osteotomy or spinal
      fusion will be screened for this multicenter, prospective, non-randomized, open-label study.
      All qualified subjects will be treated with the SurgiClotÂ® haemostatic dressing (a completely
      soluble dressing consisting of solid nanofibers of electrospun dextran with embedded
      lyophilized human fibrinogen and thrombin proteins).

      The safety and performance of the SurgiClot dressing will be evaluated in up to 40 subjects
      enrolled in Europe. Subjects will be followed for six weeks after the surgery.
