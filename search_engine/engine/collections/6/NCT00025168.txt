        -  Determine the time to progression, local control, and survival of patients with locally
           advanced, unresectable pancreatic cancer treated with induction gemcitabine and
           irinotecan followed by gemcitabine and concurrent radiotherapy.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive induction gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes and irinotecan IV over 90
      minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 2 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Within 2 weeks of completing induction chemotherapy, patients receive gemcitabine IV over
      30-60 minutes on days 1, 4, 8, 11, 15, 18, 22, 25, 29, and 32. Patients undergo concurrent
      radiotherapy 5 days a week for 5.5 weeks.

      Patients are followed every 8 weeks for 6 months and then every 3 months for 1.5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 60-120 patients will be accrued for this study within 1-2
      years.
