      A or B are born to mothers with type O blood. An estimated 20 percent of pregnancies are ABO
      incompatible, but only a very small proportion of blood type A or B babies born to O type
      mothers develop overt ABO hemolytic disease. Despite the relative rarity of ABO hemolytic
      disease, it is common practice among pediatricians and family practice physicians to perform
      routine blood typing and antibody screening on all newborns born to type O mothers.

      A very accurate and reliable laboratory measure of red blood cell destruction is the plasma
      carboxyhemoglobin level (COHb). COHb levels can be determined using a minute amount of blood,
      obtained at the same time the newborn's heel is pierced to obtain blood for the mandatory
      newborn screen (performed on all newborns prior to discharge) in order to avoid an additional
      invasive procedure.

      Our hope is to determine whether routine blood typing and anti-globulin testing of infants
      born to type O mothers is necessary, or if these tests should instead be obtained only in the
      context of significant visible jaundice. This would help clarify the proper management of a
      very common problem in the newborn, and minimize the potential for subjecting infants of type
      O mothers to unnecessary blood tests, unwarranted treatment, and prolonged hospitalizations.
