      approximately 30,000 people. Chronic disease of the respiratory tract, which is responsible
      for early death, affects both the upper and lower airways.

      We propose to utilize cells (blood lymphocytes and nasal epithelial cells) that are readily
      accessible and are known to express the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator
      (CFTR) and therefore candidates to express markers of the downstream consequences of CFTR
      deficiency.

      A marker that indicates the inflammatory state of the lung would be useful to identify
      infective/inflammatory exacerbations as opposed to worsening due to pulmonary vascular
      disease or simply upper airway infection. This marker might help to guide therapy for
      intensity and duration. Evidence in mice suggest that lymphocytes may be a driving force for
      inflammation in the CF lung, particularly during exacerbations, and also that human CF
      lymphocytes have dysfunctional production of cytokines.

      Specific Aims:

      To identify markers in nasal epithelial cells or blood lymphocytes that distinguish CF
      patients from those with functional CFTR (healthy volunteers and patients with asthma). If
      successful this could become a marker for CFTR correction by drugs or other systemic
      therapies.

      To identify markers in blood lymphocytes that will identify inflammatory status (ie,
      distinguish an active exacerbation from return to clinical stability) in CF patients. This
      could become a marker for infectious exacerbations of CF airway disease.
