      Department of Affiliated Cancer Hospital of xiangya School of Medicine Central South
      University, and the State Key Laboratory for Natural Medicine and Biomimetic Drugs Perking
      University. The primary objective is to measure the thioredoxin reductase activity using
      blood and lung cancer tissue and measure thioredoxin reductase messenger ribonucleic acid
      (mRNA) and protein expression using lung cancer and pericarcinomatous tissue in early
      staged(Ⅰ~ⅢA) non-small lung cancers, to study the correlations of thioredoxin reductase
      between blood and tissue. The secondary objectives are to measure the thioredoxin reductase
      activity between non small lung cancers and lung benign lesion patients to identify the
      difference between tumor and lung benign mass.
