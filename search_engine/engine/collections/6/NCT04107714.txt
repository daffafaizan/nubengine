      a child's mental illness secret is a common strategy to avoid stigma. Both secrecy and
      disclosure have pros and cons for parents and their children. Therefore, the decision
      whether, when, and to whom to disclose a child's mental illness is complex. Interventions can
      provide guidance for systematic consideration and a well informed decision.

      The manualized peer-led group intervention "Honest, Open, Proud" (HOP) supports people with
      mental illness in their decision whether to disclose mental illness. Research showed positive
      effects of the intervention on stigma stress, disclosure-related distress and quality of
      life. Based on HOP, "Starting the Conversation" (STC) was developed to systematically guide
      parents through their decision whether and how to disclose a child's mental illness.

      At the moment, there is no data regarding feasibility and efficacy of STC, but two pilot RCTs
      of STC are currently underway, one in Western Australia and one in Wisconsin, USA. The aim of
      the current study is to evaluate feasibility and efficacy of STC as a webinar in a pilot RCT
      in German.
