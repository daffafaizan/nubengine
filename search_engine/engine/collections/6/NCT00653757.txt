        -  To assess the feasibility of radioimmunoguided intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT)
           for stage I-IV prostate cancer.

        -  To determine the toxicity and tolerance of this regimen in these patients.

        -  To determine the tumor response based on physical examination and serial measurements of
           the serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels in these patients.

        -  To determine the outcome of patients treated on this study with radioimmunoguided IMRT
           compared to 2 control groups of patients treated at Mayo Scottsdale Clinic (MSC).

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo radioimmunoguided intensity-modulated radiotherapy once daily, 5
      days a week for 8Â½ weeks. Beginning the last week of radiotherapy, some patients receive
      leuprolide acetate intramuscularly every 3-4 months or goserelin subcutaneously every 3
      months for 6 months, 12 months, or until disease progression.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3-4 months for 1 year, every
      6 months for 4 years and annually thereafter
