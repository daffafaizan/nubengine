      people infected with HCV.(1) HCVcauses chronic inflammation of the liver leading to chronic
      hepatitis, which can advance to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma and significant
      extrahepatic complications.(2) Additionally, HCV has been shown to have a significant
      negative effect on apatient's overall quality of life, including decreased work hours and
      productivity and increased healthcare costs.(3) Cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma
      related to HCV infection represent the most common indications for liver transplantation duo
      to poor treatment options.(4) Until recently, interferon-based treatments were thebackbone of
      HCV treatment options.(5) Unfortunately,therapy was only modestly effective and
      associatedwith significant side effects.(6) Therefore, research has focused on HCV
      eradication using oral antiviral therapy.

      Recent clinical studies have demonstrated efficacy using the nucleotide analogue inhibitor
      sofosbuvir(Sovaldi; Gilead Sciences, Inc., Foster City, CA) as the backbone in treatment of
      non transplant and post transplant recurrent HCV.(7) Both the ION-1 and ION-2 trials
      demonstrated nearly 99% efficacy in the treatment ofnontransplant, noncirrhotic HCV
      patientsusing sofosbuvir in a fixed-dose combination with theNS5A inhibitor ledipasvir
      (Harvoni, Gilead Sciences,Inc.), both with and without ribavirin.(8,9) The side effect
      profile of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (LDV/SOF) hasbeen relatively mild and the drug has been well
      tolerated in trials, especially compared with previous interferon-based regimens.

      The ION trials report that LDV/SOF therapy was primarily complicated by headaches or fatigue
      inapproximately 10% of patients. Less frequently, patients experienced rashes, nausea,
      diarrhea, and insomnia.Serious side effects, such as nephrotoxicity, were not demonstrated by
      the ION-1 and ION-2 trials; however, these trials were conducted in a controlled clinical
      setting with rigorous exclusion criteria. Such trials are not always entirely reflective of
      the general patient population. Early data suggest possible risk of renal impairment during
      treatment with the use of direct antiviral drugs(10) this study is about renal safety and
      changes in eGFR in patients with chronic HCV undergoing direct acting antiviral therapy
      according to 2018 guideline.
