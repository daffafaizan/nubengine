      heterogeneity, including variable degrees of upper motor neuron (UMN) and lower motor neuron
      (LMN) impairment. While ALS is classically defined as a neuromuscular disorder, approximately
      15% of individuals also develop cognitive and/or behavioral dysfunction of the frontotemporal
      variety, ranging in severity from ALS with cognitive or behavior impairment to a frank form
      of dementia consistent with FTD2

        -  Recent consensus criteria capture this heterogeneity by defining these conditions
           together as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis frontotemporal spectrum disorder (ALS-FTSD)3

        -  There are emerging and in-progress interventional clinical trials underway that aim to
           arrest ALS and/or FTD disease progression; however, there are limited objective and
           quantitative biomarkers to directly track disease progression during life. Multi-modal
           neuroimaging provides an ideal candidate biomarker for clinical trials because ALS-FTSD
           affects a distributed neuroanatomic network and we can reliably measure
           neurodegeneration of grey matter (GM) and arterial spin labeling based perfusion MRI
           (pMRI) measurements of cerebral blood flow (CBF). However, there are many unaddressed
           technical challenges associated with measuring disease progression using neuroimaging
           techniques in a multi-center setting. The overall aim of this protocol is to leverage a
           team science approach to develop disease-specific candidate neuroimaging outcome
           measures for ALS-FTSD clinical trials.
