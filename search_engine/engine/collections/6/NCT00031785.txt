        -  Determine the effect of megestrol on weight in patients receiving radiotherapy for lung
           cancer.

        -  Determine the quality of life of patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter study. Patients
      are stratified according to histology (non-small cell lung cancer vs small cell lung cancer),
      and type of treatment (radiotherapy vs radiotherapy and non-cisplatin-containing chemotherapy
      vs radiotherapy and cisplatin-containing chemotherapy). Patients are randomized to one of two
      treatment arms.

      All patients undergo thoracic radiotherapy beginning on week 1 and continuing for a total of
      5-7 weeks.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral megestrol once daily beginning within the first 3 days of
           radiotherapy and continuing until 12 weeks after the completion of radiotherapy.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo once daily beginning within the first 3 days of
           radiotherapy and continuing until 12 weeks after the completion of radiotherapy.

      In both arms, quality of life is assessed at baseline, at the completion of radiotherapy, and
      at 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20 weeks after the completion of radiotherapy.

      Patients are followed at 4 and 8 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 98 patients (49 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
