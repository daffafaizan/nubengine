    
      Survey experimental study will be done in the first 6 months as regard antimicrobial drugs
      pattern and organism's sensitivity and resistance pattern in VAP patients.

      In the next six months, clinical implementation of ASPs and infection control bundle will be
      applied on VAP patients. Then, in the later six months the investigators will study the
      outcome of VAP patients as regard:

        -  Amount of cost of antibiotics.

        -  Appropriates of antibiotic use (initiation, duration & time of discontinuation).

        -  Rate of resistance

        -  Clinical outcome, infection rate &length of stay.

      Regular reports on antibiotic use and resistance will be admitted to relevant staff every one
      month. Also, audit and feedback about resistance and optimal prescribing will be applied
      every one month for ICU stuff as an open discussion.

      The stewardship consulting team will include microbiologist with clinical experience in the
      field of antibiotic use and infection control. Stewardship team also will include the
      relevant ICU staff and an experienced clinical pharmacist.
