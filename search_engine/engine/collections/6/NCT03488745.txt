      IntelliCare, as well as phone coaching that will focus on how to use the apps. IntlliCare is
      composed of separate apps that each target a specific aspect of mental health (e.g., reducing
      worry). The apps are interactive and designed for users to engage in short time bursts (e.g.,
      less than a minute). IntelliCare was originally designed to be paired with phone coaching
      that focuses on how to use the apps and overcome barriers to usage.
