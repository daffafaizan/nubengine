      position sense, pain, kinesiophobia, and quality of life in patients with multiple sclerosis.

      Design: Randomized controlled trial. Setting: Outpatient clinic. Participants: Fifty patients
      with multiple sclerosis. Interventions: Fifty patients who met the inclusion criteria were
      randomized to an isokinetic exercise (n:25) or home exercise programme (n:25). Sequentially
      numbered opaque envelopes were used for randomization.

      Outcome measures: The outcome measures were the peak torque/body mass index of quadriceps and
      hamstring muscles at 60°/s and 180°/s velocities, the hamstring/quadriceps ratios at the same
      velocities, absolute angular errors of the 15°, 45°, and 60° and the mean absolute angular
      error of joint position sense of the less and more affected knees, and the scores of Multiple
      Sclerosis Quality of Life-54, Visual Analogue Scale, and Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia.
