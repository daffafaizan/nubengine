      elevated risk of ill-health, behavioural problems, and own delinquency and unemployment later
      in life. Positive parenting comprise an important factor for children's positive and healthy
      development. Incarcerated parents may have difficulties to engage in positive parenting due
      to disadvantaged situations affecting parenting negatively such as drug addiction, poverty,
      or lack of experience of positive parenting in their own childhood. Previous research has
      suggested that interventions to prevent the intergenerational effect of criminality should be
      targeting family factors where positive parenting has been emphasised. Internationally
      developed parenting interventions for incarcerated parents suggest an impact on parenting
      outcomes such as positive parent-child interaction, parenting knowledge, empathy, parent
      stress, increased child contact and active parenting, However, the majority of the programmes
      evaluated to date have been conducted in the US, with a prison and probation context with
      limited generalisability to the Swedish system. In Sweden, the parenting programme for
      incarcerated parents, "For our children's' sake" (FOCS) was developed in 2012-2014 with the
      aim to support positive parenting for the child's healthy development and is currently
      delivered in Swedish prisons. The aim of this project is to evaluate the effects of the FOCS
      parenting programme on parenting outcomes through a controlled trial with a parallel
      implementation process evaluation.
