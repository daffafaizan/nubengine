      stiffness in individuals with T2DM. The investigators will conduct a double-blind trial,
      randomized, placebo control group, each group 12 male and female patients of 35-65 years of
      age with T2DM, with no hypertension or treated with insulins. Randomization will determine
      who will receive the intervention during 8 week trial (Green tea extract capsule, 400 mg 1
      time daily with the first bite of each meal or approved placebo capsules), both groups also
      will continue with their usual treatment. The clinical findings and laboratory test include a
      metabolic profile and biosafety, wich will be baseline and at 8 weeks. Body weight, body fat,
      body mass index (BMI) and blood pressure will be determined during the inicial and final
      visit, likewise, hemodynamics parameters of arterial stiffness like the aortic pulse wave
      velocity (PWVao), central pulse pressure (PPao), aortic augmentation index (IAxao) and
      central systolic blood pressure (cSBP) by an oscillometric monitoring system via BPLab Â®.
      Adverse events and adherence to treatment will be documented. The statistical analysis:
      Mann-Whitney U Test and Wilcoxon exact test. It is considered with significance at p<0.05.
