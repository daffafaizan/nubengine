      safe and well tolerated dose in participants with lupus nephritis. This study will look at
      side effects and lab results in participants who take ixazomib, along with the
      characterization of its pharmacokinetics (PK). This study is designed as a randomized,
      sequential-panel, multiple rising dose study.

      The study will enroll approximately 40 participants. The study population will consist of 4
      Cohorts. At least 5 participants (4:1 active:placebo) will be recruited into the 0.5 mg dose
      group (Cohort A), at least 5 participants (4:1 active:placebo) in the 2.0 mg dose group
      (Cohort B), 8 participants (6:2 active:placebo) in the 3.0 mg dose group (Cohort C), and 8
      participants (6:2 active:placebo) in the 4.0 mg dose group (Cohort D). Participants in each
      Cohort will be asked to take one capsule on Days 1, 8 and 15 in 28-day cycle, for 3 cycles.
      PK samples will be collected to measure concentrations of ixazomib. The starting dose in
      Cohort A will be 0.5 mg followed by administrations of 2, 3 and 4 mg in subsequent cohorts.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States and Europe. The overall time
      to participate in this study is up to 196 days. Participants will make 19 visits to the
      clinic during the treatment period and will make follow-up visits monthly for 3 months for
      follow-up assessments.
