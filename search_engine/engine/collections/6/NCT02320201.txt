    
      Bladder overactivity in the pediatric population presents a more challenging clinical
      situation than in adults after failure of medical therapy, as other treatments with proven
      efficacy such as botulinum injections and interstim sacral nerve stimulators are too invasive
      for the routine use in children. A non-invasive, effective way to improve overactive bladder
      in this population would have a great impact on a child's quality of life.
