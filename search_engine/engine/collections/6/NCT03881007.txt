      chlamydia and syphilis detected at any site whilst individuals are on daily and pre/post sex
      Listerine cool mint (LCM) vs. placebo mouthwash.

      The study has a double-blind, cross-over design, in which subjects will be screened at the
      ITM and, if eligible, will be enrolled and randomized to group 1 (LCM) or group 2 (placebo).
      After 3 months, a crossover will occur and subjects will switch to the other intervention.
      Each participant will therefore be enrolled for 6 months (2 x 3 months, no wash out period).

      Subjects will be recruited from the existing PrEP cohort at the Institute of Tropical
      Medicine Antwerp. A total of 320 subjects will be recruited (160 in each arm).
