      Clara, CA, USA) is the most mature device for mitral regurgitation. Another transcatheter
      edge-to-edge mitral valve repair device, the PASCAL system, has been shown to be feasible to
      reduce MR severity. Both the MitraClip and PASCAL devices need a complex steerable deliver
      system and thus complex process to steer the device to mitral valve. An easy-to-operate
      transcatheter edge-to-edge mitral valve repair system (ValveClamp) with larger coaptation
      width was thus recently developed in China. The ValveClamp (Hanyu Medical Technology,
      Shanghai, China) is the first edge-to-edge mitral valve repair system for interventional
      operation in China, which is composed of the front clamp, the rear clamp and the closed ring.
      The purpose of the multi-center trial is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the
      ValveClamp for degenerative mirtal regurgistation.
