      knee disorders, including anterior cruciate ligament rupture, patellar tendinopathy,
      iliotibial band syndrome, and patellofemoral pain (PFP). The aim of this study was to verify
      the clinical reliability of ankle dorsiflexion range of motion (ADROM) measurement with
      weight bearing (WB) using an app on the smartphone (iHand) and to verify if there is
      correlation between the limitation of the ADROM and the PFP.
