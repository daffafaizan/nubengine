      patients with SMA. There will be a total of five visits. All subjects will be evaluated at a
      screening visit no more than four weeks before starting their standard of care nusinersen
      treatment to determine their eligibility for participation. Eligible patients will complete
      their standard induction intrathecal nusinersen treatment on day 1, 15, 29 and 60 followed by
      maintenance doses every four months. Subjects will be reevaluated after completing the
      loading doses at 2 months followed by every four-month evaluations for the total duration of
      the treatment of 22 months.

      Currently, there is no data published on patients receiving this treatment over the age of
      18. Without published data collected from research, it is difficult for adult patients to get
      approval from their insurance companies to receive this treatment. This study hopes to
      collect data, in order to make this treatment option easier for patients with SMA to access
      and in general learn how well nusinersen is working in adult patients with SMA overtime.
