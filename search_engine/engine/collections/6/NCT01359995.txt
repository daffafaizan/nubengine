      mimicked herpetic anterior uveitis and graft rejection initially, were diagnosed as CMV
      endotheliitis after aqueous tapping for CMV polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Topical
      ganciclovir was used to control and prevent the reactivation of CMV without systemic
      application and their clinical courses were presented after this treatment modality.

      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the outcomes of topical ganciclovir in patients
      with cytomegalovirus endotheliitis receiving penetrating keratoplasty at National Taiwan
      University hospital.
