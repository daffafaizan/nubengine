      and one of which will not. The samples will be drawn from the employees of a metro-Milwaukee
      hospital, and will consist of obese (Body Mass Index, or BMI, of 30 or greater) employees
      only.

      The primary outcome will be change in weight over the study time period as measured by the
      BMI. Secondary outcome measures will include quality of life, blood pressure, tests of blood
      sugar, cholesterol, presence of depression, lifestyle wellness score, health care costs and
      productivity.
