    
      Session 1 - baseline testing

        -  5-minute warm-up; 1RM calculation for both right and left legs using a supine leg press
           machine; isometric quadriceps strength measurement using a dynamometer; muscle thickness
           measurements of both right and left quadriceps muscle using ultrasound technology.

        -  After day 1 testing; randomly allocate subjects to either control group or experimental
           group

      Sessions 2-13 - 6 weeks of exercise protocol, 2x/per week

      Both the experimental and control groups will complete the same protocol for the entirety of
      the study:

        -  5- minute warm up

        -  Using a single-leg press exercise machine: Subjects complete the testing protocol with
           either partial blood flow restriction (cuff inflated to 100-250 mmhg depending on size
           of person) or no blood flow restriction (placebo inflation) on right limb.

             -  Protocol: 30 repetitions - 15 repetitions - 15 repetitions - 15 repetitions with
                each set separated by ~30-90 seconds.

             -  Right and left legs will be alternating, but only one leg will have the occlusion
                cuff

      Session 14 - Re-test

      - Re-check 1RM, isometric quad strength, as well as muscle thickness of quadriceps with
      ultrasound
