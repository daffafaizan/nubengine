      calcineurin/NFAT pathway inhibiting endothelial cell proliferation and angiogenesis, which
      could be very useful in preventing PWS recanalization.

      The combined use of PDL to induce PWS blood vessel injury, and topical antiangiogenic agents
      to prevent PWS blood vessel angiogenesis and recanalization after laser therapy, will improve
      PWS lesion blanching.
