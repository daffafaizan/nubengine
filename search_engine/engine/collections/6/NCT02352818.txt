        1. Gather prospective clinical data on all consecutive patients undergoing complex
           difficult CTO PCI procedures including including patient demographic date, cardiac risk
           factors, procedural technical data (contrast volume, radiation exposure, procedure time
           and procedural success/outcome rates.

        2. Evaluate the safety and performance of various CTO dedicated guidewires, devices (such
           as the CrossBoss/Stingray anterior dissection re-entry device) and other recognised and
           approved techniques (retrograde wire escalation, retrograde dissection re-etry
           techniques).

        3. Evaluate the incidence and severity of recognized complications such as coronary
           dissections, coronary perforations (+/- need for emergency pericardiocentesis), acute
           kidney injury, radiation injury, access site vascular complications.

        4. Evaluate the medium-term outcome (recurrence of symptoms, major cardiovascular events
           (cardiac death, myocardial infarction, target lesion revascularization, target vessel
           revascularization) during a routine out-patient consultation (planned as part of normal
           standard care) at 1 year post successful CTO PCI. After this consultation, the patient
           may choose to have cardiology follow-up at the UZ Leuven or with his/her referring
           cardiologist.
