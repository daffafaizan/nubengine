      the very low birth weight (VLBW) infant is clamped immediately. When immediate cord clamping
      occurs, up to 50% of the fetal-placental blood volume may be left in the placenta acutely
      increasing vulnerability to hypovolemia (low blood volume). In the investigators previous
      randomized control trial, it was found that infants who received a simple delay in umbilical
      cord clamping for 30-45 seconds experienced significantly lower incidence of bleeding in the
      brain and fewer systemic infections throughout the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) stay
      and had higher scores on muscular control and function at 7 months corrected age. In the
      investigators current Phase 2 randomized controlled trial, examines the motor functioning of
      infants randomized to immediate cord clamping (ICC) or delayed cord clamping (DCC) at 7
      months corrected age (age based on due date and not the pre-term birth rate).

      Our objective for this new grant from the Thrasher Foundation is to examine the differences
      in the long-term effects of ICC vs. DCC on developmental outcomes of our study infants at
      18-22 months corrected age. The investigators hypothesis is that the positive effects of DCC,
      less bleeding in the brain and less infection, may also result in better motor and mental
      functioning at 18-22 months corrected age. Differentiation between cognitive and motor
      function is more obvious in the developing toddler than in younger infants. The diagnosis of
      cerebral palsy becomes more definitive with age and cognitive skills such as expressive and
      receptive language continue to emerge.
