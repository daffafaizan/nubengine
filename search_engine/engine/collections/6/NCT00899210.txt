      Primary

        -  Describe the kinetics of postoperative changes of serum matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)
           (MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-7, MMP-9) and their inhibitors (TIMP) (TIMP-1, TIMP-2) as a function
           of surgical technique.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the predictive value of postoperative risk of recurrence.

        -  Correlate the risk of recurrence with surgical technique.

        -  Determine whether elevated serum levels of MMP are a better marker than the
           carcinoembryonic antigen of hepatic or extrahepatic recurrence.

        -  Determine whether the postoperative serum of HGF/SF is correlated to changes in plasma
           levels of MMPs.

      OUTLINE: Blood samples are collected periodically before and after treatment to analyze for
      metalloproteinases and their inhibitors.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at day 45 and then every 3 months
      for 2 years.
