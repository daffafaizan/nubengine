      non-invasive brain stimulation is a promising and safe treatment for stroke-related cognitive
      difficulties. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an FDA approved
      treatment for depression, and is used commonly to treat people for their depression. In
      studies of rTMS for depression and other disorders, individuals have experienced improved
      cognitive function. Thus, we are testing here whether cognitive function in individuals with
      chronic stroke could be improved by rTMS.
