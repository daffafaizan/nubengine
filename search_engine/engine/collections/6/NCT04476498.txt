      enteral nutrition in patients with swallowing disorders. Fistula and peristomal infection
      rates are one of the most common early complications which are caused by bacterial
      transmission through the oropharyngeal passage of the tube and by bacterial translocation out
      of the stomach into the abdominal wall. Retrospective data have shown that if pull-PEGs are
      attached with a gastropexy suture, the abdominal wall and stomach are fixed tightly and
      peristomal infection rates can be reduced significantly.

      This randomised study wants to compare the peristomal infection rate of standard pull-PEGs
      and pull-PEGs with gastropexy suture. Peristomal infection rate is detected by classical
      inflammation rates including erythema, exsudates, and induration, development of pus, or
      focal peritonitis.
