      an analgesic antipyretic, treating symptoms of cold, antiphlogistic and management of pain
      with rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthrosis, lumbago. On the other hand, this nonsteroid
      anti-inflammatory drug sometimes causes gastric and duodenal ulcers and this ulcer leads to
      the gastrointestinal bleeding which may be cause of death.

      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of lansoprazole versus gefarnate in
      patients with a history of gastric or duodenal ulcers receiving daily nonsteroid
      anti-inflammatory medication.
