      sensitivity, involving several signaling pathways, makes children more vulnerable to
      different environmental, infectious factors that could trigger the different pathologies of
      premature babies. Mast cell, via its mediators, seems to play a key role.

      Dosage of serum tryptase levels which is easily accessible and the work by Vitte let us
      imagine that the younger the child, the greater the mast cell expression, thus opening a
      capital pathway in the comprehension of immune system phenomena in premature babies and
      investigators can hope that by performing regular workups of serum tryptase levels,
      investigators could validate that some premature babies will express this activity in a more
      important manner. The relationship to eventual pathological phenomena such as necrotizing
      enterocolitis, but also bronchopulmonary dysplasia could then be highlighted.
