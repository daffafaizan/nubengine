      (DEU), suffering from Urinary Incontinence (UI) who are cared for in a home environment, by
      one or more caregivers (CGR). The TENA SmartCare Change Indicator is an accessory to TENA
      absorbing incontinence products. This clinical investigation is intended to demonstrate that
      use of TENA SmartCare Change Indicator has the ability to reduce the number of manual checks
      between daily changes of absorbing incontinence products. Secondarily, the investigation will
      evaluate number of leakages, skin redness, usability and fecal incidence. Furthermore, the
      safety will continuously be monitored through analyzing device-related adverse events
      reported during the investigation.
