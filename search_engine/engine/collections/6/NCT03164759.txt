      sucess rate is very high but to keep faliure rate as low as possible patient selection is
      very important especially regarding bone density to achieve high primary stability. Primary
      stability plays an important role in successful osteointegration of dental implants. This
      study was done to correlate between the bone density pre operatively measured on CBCT
      represented by HF unit and implant stability measured post operatively by ostell device
      represented by ISQ unit
