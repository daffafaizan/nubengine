      effective feminization compared to oral conjugated equine estrogen but did not result in an
      otherwise different biochemical profile in this limited number of heterogeneous patients. OBE
      (oral beta estradiol) and TBE (transdermal beta estradiol) provide safe and effective
      alternatives to OCEE (oral conjugated equine estrogen) to induce puberty in girls, but larger
      prospective randomized trials are required.
