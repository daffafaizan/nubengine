    
      This is a phase 2, multicenter, randomized, open-label study to estimate the efficacy of
      talimogene laherparepvec as a neoadjuvant treatment followed by surgery compared to surgery
      alone in subjects with completely resectable stage IIIB, IIIC, or IVM1a melanoma.

      Arm 1: Talimogene laherparepvec for 6 doses followed by surgical resection of melanoma tumor
      lesion(s).

      Arm 2: Immediate surgical resection of melanoma tumor lesion(s) Following surgery, adjuvant
      systemic therapy and/or radiotherapy may be administered at the investigator's discretion and
      per the institutional standard of care.

      Subjects will be followed for safety approximately 30 (+15) days after surgery and for
      disease recurrence, subsequent anticancer therapy, and survival every 3 months (±30 days) for
      first 3 years after the end of the safety follow-up period and then every 6 months (±30 days)
      until death, subject withdraws full consent, or up to 5 years after the last subject is
      randomized.
