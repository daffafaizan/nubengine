      controlled pilot trial, with a 38- week follow-up. Patients diagnosed with bipolar disorder
      (BD) according to DSM -5 criteria for mild depression or subsyndromal depressive symptoms are
      assigned to one of the following 3 treatment groups: 1) psychopharmacological treatment plus
      Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT); 2) psychopharmacological treatment plus
      structured group psychoeducation; 3) treatment as usual (TAU), including standard psychiatric
      care with standard pharmacologic treatment. After written informed consent is signed,
      patients meeting the inclusion criteria are randomized (2:2:1 ratio) through a Random
      Allocation Software. All three groups are assessed at baseline (t0), immediately after
      completing the program (t1; 8 weeks) and at follow-up six months after randomization. The
      assessments include the following variables: depression, anxiety, general and social
      cognition, global functioning, BDNF, and other clinical variables. The evaluator who
      collected the biomarkers and the clinical and psychometric data will be blind to treatment.
      The interrater variability between all researchers will be checked.
