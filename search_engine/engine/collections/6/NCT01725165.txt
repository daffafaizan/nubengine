      I. Determine whether oligometastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with no
      disease progression after first line therapy have prolonged progression free survival (PFS)
      when treated with local consolidation therapy (LCT) of residual disease (radiation or
      surgery) followed by maintenance or surveillance as per physician choice compared with no
      LCT.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the overall survival. II. Safety/tolerability of LCT. III. Time to progression
      of prior metastatic lesions. IV. Time to appearance of new metastases (central nervous system
      [CNS] vs. extra-CNS, treated lesion vs. new site).

      V. Quality of life (QOL).

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I (IMMEDIATE LCT): Patients undergo ablation of all residual local and metastatic sites
      of disease by surgery and/or external beam radiation therapy (EBRT). After completion of LCT,
      patients undergo either surveillance or maintenance treatment at the discretion of the
      treating physician.

      ARM II (DELAYED/NO LCT): Patients undergo standard maintenance therapy or clinical
      observation, based on physician choice. Patients may cross-over to Arm I due to Response
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) progression or toxicity at the treating
      physician's discretion.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 9 months.
