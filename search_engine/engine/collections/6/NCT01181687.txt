      pain measurement tools exists, among them the Comfort behavioral scale (van Dijk, 2005),
      developed from the original Comfort scale (Ambuel, 1992). The psychometric properties of the
      Comfort scale have been tested in several studies, but so far no Norwegian version of the
      scale has been developed and tested. Neither has the scale been tested in spontaneously
      breathing children undergoing minor surgery. The aim of this study is to establish incipient
      psychometric properties of the Norwegian version of the scale among children aged 0-3 years
      admitted for elective minor surgery.
