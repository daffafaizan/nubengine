      improvement of insulin sensitivity and the preservation of beta cell function in post-partum
      women following a first diagnosis of gestational diabetes. Our long-term goal is to test
      resveratrol for the secondary prevention of gestational diabetes and type 2 diabetes. We have
      developed six conditions that should be satisfied by the study to justify project expansion.
      Therefore, we will be testing hypotheses and computing estimates for the following six
      outcomes: (1) recruitment numbers, (2) adherence to study treatment, (3) adherence to study
      visits, (4) insulin sensitivity measured at 12 months post-partum, (5) beta cell function
      measured at 12 months post-partum, and (6) adverse events.

      The study is a single-site, parallel, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. The
      study population consists of women recruited during pregnancy who had a confirmed first
      diagnosis of gestational diabetes, who do not have either diabetes or pre-diabetes when
      re-tested 3 months post-partum, and who have stopped breastfeeding by 9 months post-partum.
      They study intervention is resveratrol (or identical placebo) twice daily for a total of 12
      weeks from 9 months to 12 months post-partum. Our planned sample size is 112 women based on
      the hypothesis testing and estimation considerations for the six above-mentioned outcomes.
