      impact on pelvic floor function and quality of life (QOL), while seldom having the potential
      to be life-threatening. Prevalence of POP increases with age. In women older than 80, 11%
      undergo a surgical procedure. The incidence of degenerative diseases and multiple
      co-morbidities increases with age, and advanced age is also associated with an increase in
      morbidity generally for gynecologic procedures. Furthermore, greater comorbidity beforehand
      can predispose patients to postoperative complications such as bleeding, hematoma, pain,
      infectious. As a result hospital stays are longer and the surgical results are compromised.

      Surgical techniques should optimize functional results and minimize complications. In POP
      surgery, younger women are good candidates for sacrocolpopexy (SCP), because of the improved
      long term functional result, while women older than 80 may have a satisfactory outcome with
      fewer complication with a vaginal repair with mesh (VMR) or native tissue (NTR). The
      increasing prevalence of POP, and the increasing population of women aged 70-80 requires an
      evaluation of the appropriate surgical management since women in this age group may be
      candidates for all types of surgical repair.
