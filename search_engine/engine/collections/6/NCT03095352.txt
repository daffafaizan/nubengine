      above. In this study, biomarker research to be performed on tumor biopsies and peripheral
      blood samples will be performed to explore the immunologic and genomic mechanism of action
      underlying treatment with pembrolizumab and carboplatin versus carboplatin alone. This
      protocol includes tissue and blood correlative exploratory endpoints including changes in
      tumor PD-L1 (programmed death ligand 1) gene expression, tumor and peripheral blood immune
      composition and cytokine expression, plasma tumor DNA, circulating tumor cells, and tumor
      myelocytomatosis (MYC) oncogene expression using tumor biopsy and peripheral blood testing
      before and after treatment; correlations with these markers and disease control rate will be
      assessed.
