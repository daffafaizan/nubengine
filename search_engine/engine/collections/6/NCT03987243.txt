      real-time, visual feedback on the distribution of pressure between them and their seat
      cushion. This type of feedback works as a compensatory strategy for lack of sensation and
      allows the individual to visually observe pressure distribution they are not able to feel.
      Additionally, the participants will be provided with structured pressure ulcer prevention
      education, grounded in the principles of social cognitive theory, regarding pressure ulcer
      risk and use of weight shifts.

      The pressure mapping system, which will be used during training, provides virtual modeling of
      the desired outcome (reduced pressure) and is an important part of the education module.

      The findings of this study will inform clinicians and investigators of whether use of mobile
      seat interface pressure mapping as a compensatory-based intervention has a positive impact on
      trunk movement and self-efficacy for completing weight shifts in wheelchair users who lack
      sensation. Another contribution of this work is an exploration of the relationship between
      self-efficacy and movement in wheelchair users.
