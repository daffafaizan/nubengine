      I. To determine time to objective progression, response rate (objective and PSA response) and
      duration of response in men with hormone refractory prostate cancer treated with
      estramustine, docetaxel and bevacizumab.

      II. To determine the toxicity of this regimen in men with hormone refractory prostate cancer.

      III. To study the relationship of baseline VEGF levels in urine and plasma and changes in
      these levels to response and duration of response to treatment with bevacizumab, docetaxel
      and estramustine.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive oral estramustine 3 times daily on days 1-5 and docetaxel IV over 1 hour
      followed by bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 2. Treatment repeats every 21 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed at least every 3 months for 2 years.
