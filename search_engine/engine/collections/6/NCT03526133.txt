      underwent in-laboratory polysomnography (PSG) and simultaneously wireless polygraph. The PSG
      oximeter and the wireless polygraph were worn on different fingers of the same hand. All
      sleep studies were reviewed by one blind investigator according the 2017 American Academy of
      Sleep Medicine recommendations. The number of desaturations from wireless polygraph at the 3
      predefined threshold levels (of ODI-2%, ODI-3%, or ODI-4%) was derived automatically using
      proprietary algorithm. Moderate to severe OSA was defined as AHI â‰¥ 15 events/h. The
      diagnostic accuracy of ODI-2%, 3%, and 4% for the diagnosis of moderate-severe OSA were
      calculated for cut-off values from 1 to 20 desaturation events/h. The sleep actimetry was
      compared with the sleep stages from PSG, most of the statistical metrics applied for
      diagnosis were used to evaluate the applicability of this proposed method. Finally, the
      snoring events computed by the smartphone application were compared with the events heard by
      a specialist and the statistical comparison metrics were evaluated.
