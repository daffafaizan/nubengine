      prophylaxis.(26) Neubotulinum Toxin Type A, (Neu-BoNT/A), (Neuronox® ) (Medytox Inc,
      Ochang-eup, Cheongwon-gu, Cheongju-si, Chungcheongbuk-do, Republic of Korea), also known as
      Meditoxin in Korea, is a newly manufactured BoNT-A (Neu-BoNT/A) that was developed to provide
      features close to onabotulinum toxin A (5). Neuronox was tested in a murine model, and its
      effect on muscle force generation was equivalent to Botox® (ona-BoNT/A) (6). A previous
      multicenter randomized controlled trial showed that Neuronox and Botox® have equivalent
      efficacy and safety for the treatment of spastic equinus in children with cerebral palsy (6).
      However, 50 unit of Neubotulinum Toxin Type A (Neuronox) and 100 unit of Neubotulinum Toxin
      Type A (Neuronox) has not yet been investigated in cervical dystonia. This study is the
      extension of the NCT03805152
