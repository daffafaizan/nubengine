      subsequent treatment delivery using MR-linac technology. The MIRABELLE study will apply the
      MR sequences developed in LN-negative volunteers/patients to the context of node-positive
      breast cancer patients with the aim of reducing the delineated nodal volume thereby
      facilitating dose-escalation to involved LNs. The benefit of using MRI for LN localisation as
      compared to conventional CT imaging will be investigated by determining whether a higher dose
      can be delivered using MRI- as compared to CT-based delineation. Any increase in dose will be
      deemed a success as this has potential to improve tumour control. In addition, inter-observer
      errors in outlining will be explored to investigate whether these are reduced using MRI.
      Reduced inter-observer errors would result in smaller margins for error such that less normal
      tissue could be irradiated.
