      indications where tissue aging and senescence play significant roles. Shorter leukocyte
      telomere length has been linked to impaired glucose tolerance, Type 2 Diabetes, and coronary
      heart disease. Telomere length and telomerase activity have been shown to be significantly
      lower in CAD patients. Telomere length may play an important role in predicting
      cardiovascular disease and diabetes. TA-65 may not only ameliorate the symptoms associated
      with these disease states, but be a preventive measure as well.

      In this study, the researchers will investigate whether telomerase activator (TA)-65 can also
      improve the metabolic dysregulations associated with metabolic syndrome including oxidative
      stress, inflammation, high blood pressure and dyslipidemias.
