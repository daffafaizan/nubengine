        -  To determine whether the anal cytology screening outcome derived from specimens
           collected by a flocked nylon swab are equivalent to those derived from Dacron swab
           specimens in men who have sex with men.

        -  To determine whether the number and type-specific identification for human
           papillomavirus derived from specimens collected by a flocked nylon swab are equivalent
           to those derived from Dacron swab specimens.

      OUTLINE: Dry sterile Dacron swabs and flocked nylon swabs are used to collect intra-anal
      cytology specimens for anal Pap testing and human papillomavirus typing. Participants undergo
      a digital rectal examination and high-resolution anoscopy. If lesions are identified, an anal
      biopsy is performed for histological examination.
