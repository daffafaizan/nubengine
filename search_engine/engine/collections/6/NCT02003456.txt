      muscle (myocardium) are alive but receiving inadequate blood supply. This information can be
      helpful in identifying the best course of treatment. This type of study involves the use of
      two radiotracers: rubidium-82 (to measure blood flow) and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose or FDG (to
      measure whether heart muscle cells are alive). Currently, each of these radiotracers is
      imaged at separate times, several hours apart. The purpose of this study is to evaluate
      methods that could allow the entire study to be performed at one time.
