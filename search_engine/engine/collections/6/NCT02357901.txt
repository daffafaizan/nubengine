      induction phase with SUBOXONE (buprenorphine/naloxone) sublingual film for 3 days followed by
      a 4- to 11-day SUBOXONE sublingual film open-label run-in dose-adjustment period to achieve
      buprenorphine dosages ranging from 8 to 24 mg according to the SUBOXONE sublingual film
      prescribing information.

      This is a 24-week non-residential study with participants being randomized after meeting
      randomization criteria. On Day 1 and Day 29 (± 2 days) participants will receive subcutaneous
      injections of 300 mg RBP-6000 or placebo. Thereafter, participants will receive 4 injections
      (once every 28 days ± 2 days) of either 300 mg or 100 mg RBP-6000 doses or placebo.
