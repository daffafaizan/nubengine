      least 1 dose of venetoclax. The study includes two different groups: a retrospective group
      (all patients who have received at least one dose of venetoclax before enrolment) and a
      prospective group (patients receiving treatment with venetoclax after enrolment). All
      patients in both groups will be observed for up to 48 months from the treatment start. In the
      prospective cohort only, QoL will be assessed at the time of study entry (i.e. baseline) and
      thereafter at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 24, 30, 36, 42 and 48 months of follow-up and at treatment
      discontinuation (due to any cause).
