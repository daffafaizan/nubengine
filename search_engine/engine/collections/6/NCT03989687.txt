      on first permanent molars over a period of 2 years. Pediatric patients (under <10 years of
      age) will receive a glass ionomer sealant on all four permanent first molars. One side will
      be randomly selected with rubber dam isolation and the contralateral side will have no rubber
      dam isolation for the placement of the sealant. Over a 2 year period, every 6 months the
      sealants will be assessed for retention.

      The glass ionomer sealant material will be Fuji Triage (GC America). The following dental
      materials that will be used are cotton rolls, non-latex rubber dam, topical benzocaine,
      dental mirror, glass ionomer dispensing gun, dental explorer, triturator for the glass
      ionomer, cotton gauze, suction tip, air-water syringe.
