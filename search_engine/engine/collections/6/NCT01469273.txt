      treated with 1 x 1 ml ECN-SUSPENSION for 10 days and observed until the age of 12
      months.Treatment-group E (newborn) will receive EcN-Suspension on the first 10 days of life
      and will be observed for the next 12 months. Treatment-group L (infants at the age of 6
      months) will receive EcN-Suspension on the first 10 days of their seventh month of life and
      will be observed for the next 6 months.The corresponding control group will remain untreated
      and will be observed only for 12 months. According to the hospitals daily routine the
      inclusion and exclusion criteria will be checked. All newborns meeting the inclusion criteria
      will be included into the trial. Patients' anamnestic data and general health status are
      recorded at the initial control.Controls are performed according to the time schedule
      normally used in the hospital functioning as a trial site. According to this, during each
      monthly control data on the efficacy and safety are recorded. The final control for assessing
      the tolerance and efficacy of the trial medication is conducted along with a physical
      examination after an observation period of 12 months.In this study, diarrhea is defined as
      increase of stool frequency to >3 watery or loose stools in 24 hours on at least two or more
      consecutive days.The prophylaxis against gastrointestinal infections with EcN-Suspension is
      expected to result in a decrease of the number episodes of diarrhea in comparison to the
      untreated control. The primary efficacy criterion is the number of episodes of diarrhea
      caused by gastrointestinal infection within the first 12 months.
