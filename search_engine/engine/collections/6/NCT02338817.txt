      The Diabetes Sentry device, which is non-invasive and is worn on the wrist will be used while
      an inpatient at the University of Florida Health & Shands Hospital. Participants will be
      monitored for the duration of the observational period on the unit, an expected average will
      be 24 hours. The device is designed to alarm during periods of perspiration and drops in body
      temperature. When this occurs, a blood draw will be taken to test for glucose, lactate, and
      ketone values at those times if there is not an already scheduled clinical care blood draw
      for normal clinical care.
