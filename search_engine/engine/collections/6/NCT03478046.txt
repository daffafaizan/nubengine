      the daily variation in these levels in individuals with insulin resistance and metabolic
      syndrome; (2) Investigate the short-term responses of fetuin-A phosphorylation and changes in
      insulin resistance that occur with a single session of aerobic exercise; (3) Characterize and
      compare the total and temporal changes in fetuin-A phosphorylation and insulin resistance
      that occur with an 8 to 10% weight loss induced by chronic exercise training and dietary
      modification, and; (4) Investigate the influence of weight loss on the short-term responses
      of fetuin-A phosphorylation and changes in insulin resistance that occur with a single
      session of aerobic exercise. Our hypothesis is that phosphofetuin-A levels are tightly
      correlated with insulin resistance and that lifestyle modifications will improve insulin
      sensitivity and decrease phosphorylated fetuin-A levels.
