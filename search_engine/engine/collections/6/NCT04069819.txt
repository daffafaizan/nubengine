      second messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Treatment with cilostazol against
      cerebral ischemic injury ameliorates negative effects of cerebral hypoperfusion through the
      PDE3- cAMP signaling cascade with subsequent activation of inducible transcription factor
      cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), suggesting the importance of the CREB signaling
      pathway.

      Activation of CREB promotes the gene expression of neuroprotective molecules that activate
      subsequent anti-apoptotic pathways with the gene expression of brain-derived neurotrophic
      factor (BDNF). BDNF also regulates neurogenesis, proliferation, and survival of neural stem
      or progenitor cells, as well as neuronal survival. In addition, CREB and BDNF signaling play
      an important role in the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder .

      Psychopharmacotherapy with antidepressants or mood stabilizers provides an effective
      treatment for depression after stroke, but alternative therapy by activation of CREB and BDNF
      signaling may exert beneficial effects on various aspects of negative mood. Drugs that
      activate CREB and BDNF signaling may provide a potential therapeutic approach for treatment
      of poststroke depression via neural cell survival and proliferation of neural progenitor
      cells.

      The aim of the current study is to evaluate the potential adjunct antidepressant effect of
      cilostazol in adult patients with MDD. Furthermore, we will assess the relationship between
      HAM-D score and BDNF as well as their role as a therapeutic targets of MDD.
