      method which is effective for treating both psychiatric and non-psychiatric disorders, such
      as posttraumatic stress disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, pain syndromes and for
      improving motor function in neurodegenerative diseases or following stroke. rTMS uses series
      of brief pulses of magnetic field applied to the surface of the head for a period of time
      (e.g. 20 minutes). The effects of rTMS are transient, and critically dependent upon the
      location, frequency and intensity of stimulation. Several studies have provided evidence that
      rTMS can influence the excitability and function of neurons (neuromodulation) for up to one
      hour, both near to, and distant from, the site of stimulation. However it is still unclear
      how these transient local and distant changes in function induced by specific rTMS protocols
      are mediated. In this project we will combine expertise in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI),
      Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) and rTMS neuromodulation to develop and test protocols
      for examining the changes produced by non-invasive brain stimulation on healthy subjects.
      rTMS will be applied outside the scanner using standard TMS coils and MRI/S at 7 Tesla will
      be acquired before and immediately after rTMS. Our aim is to increase the understanding of
      how the two different rTMS protocols, inhibitory (1 Hz) and excitatory (5 Hz), applied over
      the primary motor cortex of the presumed dominant hemisphere, affect functional connectivity
      and neurochemistry in the brain.
