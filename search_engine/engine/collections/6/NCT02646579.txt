      pain, increased muscle strength, increased proprioception and increased functional
      performance among individuals with chronic musculoskeletal conditions of the lower
      extremities, such as plantar fasciitis, Achilles tendinopathy, and patellofemoral pain
      syndrome. Specific aims are to determine if individuals with chronic musculoskeletal
      conditions of the lower extremities receiving dry needling to both spinal and peripheral
      sites exhibit differences in pain, muscle strength, proprioception, and unilateral hop test
      scores compared to individuals with chronic musculoskeletal conditions of the lower
      extremities receiving dry needling to peripheral sites only.
