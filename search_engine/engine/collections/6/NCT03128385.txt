      (CP). As children with hemiplegia primarily have one better funcitoning side of their body
      and one more affected side, they often tend not to use the affected extremity resulting in
      the phenoema of developmental disregard. Recent evidence suggests that constraint-induced
      therapy (CIT) is the most effective technique to improve the use of the affected hand and
      reduce the developmental disregard in children with CP. However, despite the cumulative
      evidence supporting the effects of pediatric CIT, the concerns of feasibility and gaps of
      current knowledge prompt us to conduct this current proposal. The concerns of the feasibility
      include this approach is emotionally problematic at early stages and researchers suggested
      that the orginal CIT protocols may be too intrusive for children and their families. The gaps
      of current knowledge include: no study has directly investigated the effectiveness
      differences between various CIT models; no study examines, monitors and compares the
      psychosocial outcomes while receiving the CIT protocols for children and their parents
      systematically and comprehensively; and no study investigates the possible clinical
      characteristics of children that may influence the training effects of the various CIT
      models.

      Investigators will recruit a total of 60 children with CP from the CP Association, medical
      centers, and special educational systems and participants will be assigned to the two
      intervention groups. The intensive CIT is delivered by the group-based design with 6 hours a
      day for 6 days (36 hours in total) and the distributed CIT will be delivered by
      individualized home-based intervention with 2.25 hours a day, two times a week, for 8 weeks
      (36 hours in total).
