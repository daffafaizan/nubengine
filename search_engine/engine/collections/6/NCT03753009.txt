      years) with keratoconus were enrolled in the study. Twenty eyes of 15 patients underwent I-ON
      CXL, while 20 eyes of 13 patients underwent epi-off CXL. Corrected distance visual acuity
      (CDVA), spherical equivalent, maximum keratometry (Kmax), posterior elevation of the thinnest
      point and thickness of the thinnest point mean values were evaluated. A Student t test was
      used to compare baseline and 12, 24, and 36 month postoperative data. Keratoconus progression
      in function of preoperative Kmax value and cone location was evaluated at 36 months.
