    
      This is a Phase I/IIa, open-label, study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and
      immunogenicity of INO-3112 [6 mg of VGX-3100 (2 separate DNA plasmids respectively encoding
      E6 and E7 proteins of HPV 16 and HPV 18) and 1 mg of INO-9012 (DNA plasmid encoding human
      interleukin 12)] delivered by electroporation (EP) in up to 25 (twenty-five) participants
      with HPV positive head and neck cancer. The immunotherapy was studied in the following two
      groups of participants:

        1. Participants who received immunotherapy before and after definitive surgery (Cohort I)

        2. Participants who received immunotherapy at least 2 months after chemoradiation therapy
           (Cohort II).
