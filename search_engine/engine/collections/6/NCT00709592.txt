      with anti-thymocyte globulin followed by donor peripheral blood stem cell transplant (PBSCT)
      works in treating patients with hematologic malignancies. Giving reduced intensity total-body
      irradiation and anti-thymocyte globulin before a donor peripheral blood stem cell transplant
      helps stop the growth of cancer cells. It may also stop the patient's immune system from
      rejecting the donor's stem cells. When the healthy stem cells from a donor are infused into
      the patient they may help the patient's bone marrow make stem cells, red blood cells, white
      blood cells, and platelets. Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can make an immune
      response against the body's normal cells. Giving total-body irradiation together with
      antithymocyte globulin before transplant may stop this from happening.
