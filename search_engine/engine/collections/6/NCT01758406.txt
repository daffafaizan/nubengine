      transplantation is the ultimate approach to treating heart failure, but this is costly and
      excludes patients who are poor candidates for transplantation given their co morbidities, or
      for whom a donor organ is unavailable. Currently, there is no effective intervention to
      regenerate dead heart muscle after a heart attack. Our hypothesis is that CSCs regenerates
      myocardium. In this study all eligible patients are randomly allocated into two study groups
      by a permuted block randomization method: group A (case group) received 5-10 millions
      autologous cardiac stem cells, group B (control group) just received placebo. They follow up
      for 18 months.
