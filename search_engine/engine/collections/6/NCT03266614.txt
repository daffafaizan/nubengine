    
      This study is a randomized trial evaluating "Recovery 4 US", a social media program aimed at
      the enhancement of community participation and overall recovery of individuals with
      psychiatric disabilities.This innovative e-mental health program integrates Internet and
      mobile technologies and is designed to be a self-sustaining recovery-oriented virtual
      community for individuals living with a disabling mental illness based on the principles of
      Photovoice.

      The "Recovery 4 US" program which includes a mobile phone application and a password
      protected website, has three main components: 1) receipt of daily hope-inspiring message,
      paired with a corresponding visual image; 2) creation and viewing of recovery-oriented
      Photovoice works; and 3) opportunity to attend community events initiated by members of the
      "Recovery 4 US" community.

      The benefits of the "Recovery 4 US" program will be evaluated through a randomized trial with
      n=60 participants. The study will take place at the Boston University Center for Psychiatric
      Rehabilitation. Participants will be randomized to the experimental group (provided with a
      smartphone and access to "Recovery 4 US" application and website) or the control group
      (provided with a smartphone but without access to the "Recovery 4 US" app or website). We
      anticipate participation in the program will be associated with reduced loneliness, increased
      hopefulness, community participation, and overall recovery.

      The recruitment goal for this study was amended to n=70.
