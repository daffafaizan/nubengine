      conventional transurethral resection technique (TURBT) in non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer.
      These advantages consist mainly in the reduction of obturator nerve reflex and obtention of
      surgical samples according to oncological principles. Advantages in terms of tumor recurrence
      in the short-term, when compared with TURBT, remain uncertain. Herein several randomized
      control trials aim to assess comparative outcomes in the short and long term.

      A higher rate of detrusor muscle is found in the EBR-BT samples than in the conventional
      samples resulting in a better staging and at least theoretically the need for fewer re-TURBT
      indications. However, a detailed and scrupulous description of the histopathological samples
      is lacking and, it is assumed that the presence of detrusor in the sample without solution of
      continuity with submucosa and tumor is sufficient to stage. As in surgical samples of other
      organs, the objective of EBR-RT is not only to obtain detrusor, but also clean margins that
      ensure the radicality of the tumor.

      The hypothesis of the investigators' is that EBR-BT will results in an increased rate of
      pathological specimen with the presence of detrusor muscle and free-tumor margins, hence a
      more accurate stage than TURBT and a decrease in 3-months recurrence at short-term (3 months)
