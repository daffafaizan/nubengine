    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the extent that RO4929097 induces its own metabolism using a 20mg dose on
      Regimen I and a 50mg dose on Regimen II by comparing Cycle 1 Day 1 and Day 10 plasma
      pharmacokinetic parameters.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the effect of the strong inhibitor of CYP3A4, ketoconazole, on RO4929097
      plasma pharmacokinetics.

      II. To evaluate the effect of the strong inducer of CYP3A4, 2D6 and 2C9, rifampin on
      RO4929097 plasma pharmacokinetics.

      III. To evaluate the effect of RO4929097 on the plasma pharmacokinetics of CYP450 substrates;
      midazolam (CYP3A4), omeprazole (CYP2C19), tolbutamide (CYP2C9) and dextromethorphan (CYP2D6)
      after single dose and chronic administration.

      IV. To assess the influence of polymorphisms in CYP3A4, 3A5, 2C9, ABCB1, and 2D6 on RO4929097
      plasma pharmacokinetics V. To assess any evidence of clinical activity (CR, PR, SD) in
      patients with advanced solid tumors.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment regimens.

      Regimen I (low-dose of RO4929097): Patients receive low-dose RO4929097 orally (PO) once daily
      on days 1-3, 8-10, and 15-17 and midazolam hydrochloride IV over 1 minute, omeprazole PO,
      tolbutamide PO, and dextromethorphan hydrobromide PO on days 1 and 10. After completion of
      course 1, patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      Arm A: Patients receive low-dose RO4929097 PO once daily on days 1-3, 8-10, and 15-17 and
      ketoconazole PO once daily on days 1-10 for course 2 only. For course 3 and beyond, patients
      receive low-dose RO4929097 on days 1-3, 8-10, and 15-17. Courses repeat every 21 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Arm B: Patients receive low-dose RO4929097 PO once daily on days 1-3, 8-10, and 15-17 and
      rifampin PO once daily on days 1-10 for course 2 only. For course 3 and beyond, patients
      receive low-dose RO4929097 on days 1-3, 8-10, and 15-17. Courses repeat every 21 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Regimen II (high-dose of RO4929097): Patients receive high-dose RO4929097 PO once daily on
      days 1-3, 8-10, and 15-17 and midazolam hydrochloride IV, oral omeprazole, oral tolbutamide,
      and oral dextromethorphan hydrobromide on days 1 and 10. After completion of course 1,
      patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      Arm A: Patients receive high-dose RO4929097 once daily on days 1-3, 8-10, and 15-17 and oral
      ketoconazole once daily on days 1-10 for course 2 only.

      Arm B: Patients receive high-dose RO4929097 once daily on days 1-3, 8-10, and 15-17 and oral
      rifampin once daily on days 1-10 for course 2 only.

      In all arms, treatment with RO4929097 repeats every 21 days for >= 3 courses in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo blood sample collection at baseline and periodically during study for
      pharmacokinetics studies and evaluation of SNPs in CYP2D6, CYP2C9, ABCB1, and CYP3A4/5.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up for 30 days.
