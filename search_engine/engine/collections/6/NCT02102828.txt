      thromboprophylaxis in joint replacement surgeries. Since Aspirin 325mg twice daily has been
      recently included as a nationally approved venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis in the
      Surgical Care Improvement Project (SCIP) protocols for low risk total knee arthroplasty (TKA)
      patients, it is necessary to optimize multimodal prophylaxis methods. These include reduced
      tourniquet time, early mobilization, and mechanical compression devices (MCDs). MCDs are
      commonly used as part of the in-hospital VTE prophylaxis measures; however, it has not been
      demonstrated in clinical trials that optimal prophylaxis methods would be enhanced by
      prolonged use of a MCD after discharge. In order to achieve this, a potentially valuable
      solution has recently been made available to the outpatient population. The Cothera
      VPulse(tm) is a MCD that combines rapid intermittent sequential compression with cold
      therapy. It is designed for single patient use in the home and includes technology to track
      patient compliance. The purpose of this study is to examine if there is a difference in DVT
      occurrence over 3 weeks after tourniquet-less TKA and multimodal prophylaxis with or without
      extended MCD use in a cooling device/MCD system.
