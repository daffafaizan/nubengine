      I. To determine the response rate to MK-2206 (Akt inhibitor MK2206), defined as complete
      response (CR) + partial response (PR).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine response rate to MK-2206 in patients with phosphatase and tensin homolog
      (PTEN) loss or phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, catalytic subunit alpha
      (PIK3CA) mutation in a pretreatment biopsy from a metastatic site.

      II. To determine progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). III. To determine
      the time to treatment failure (TTF), and duration of tumor response (DR).

      IV. To determine the safety profile and tolerability of this regimen in this patient
      population.

      V. To determine effect of PTEN, v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF),
      PIK3CA, and AKT mutations and semi-quantitative grading of PTEN expression on clinical
      response.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive Akt inhibitor MK2206 orally (PO) on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Treatment repeats
      every 28 days for up to 24 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months.
