    
      COPD is characterised by persisting airway inflammation which leads to a progressive and
      irreversible deterioration in lung function with the eventual development of respiratory
      symptoms which may become disabling. Periodic episodes of worsening symptoms or exacerbations
      are a major cause of additional morbidity, mortality and health care utilization. Currently
      available therapies have limited efficacy in reducing airway inflammation or preventing
      exacerbations.

      Macrolides such as erythromycin have been shown to have potent anti-inflammatory effects in
      in vitro experiments and in other lung conditions such as cystic fibrosis and bronchiectasis
      as well as in open label studies in COPD. We hypothesised that long term therapy with oral
      erythromycin would reduce airway inflammation and reduce the frequency of exacerbations in
      patients with COPD. If these properties are demonstrated this therapy can have potentially
      important benefits if effective in this condition.
