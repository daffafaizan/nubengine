      pulmonary dysfunction, diabetes, hypertension, and other co-morbid risks. NIH panel
      recommendations state that even a 10% short-weight loss would greatly reduce these risks. GI
      Dynamics' GI Sleeve represents a viable alternative to other short-term pre-surgical weight
      loss methods. GI Sleeve is a device that can be implanted and removed through minimal
      invasive endoscopic techniques. This endoscopic procedure brings potential benefits to
      patients in that it is minimally invasive, efficacious, and allows patients to recover faster
      with less morbidity and mortality.
