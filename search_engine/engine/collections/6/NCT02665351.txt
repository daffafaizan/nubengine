      influenza-associated lower respiratory tract complications (LRTC). The secondary objective
      was to assess safety and tolerability. Adults confirmed with influenza by polymerase chain
      reaction (PCR) and/or immunofluorescence assays during the seasonal peaks of 2011-2014 were
      assessed for eligibility. Consented individuals were randomized to receive either peramivir
      600mg every 24 hourly or 300mg every 12 hourly for 5 days. In subjects not achieving clinical
      resolution by day 5, the same regimen could be continued until day 10 (virologic results
      unknown to clinicians).Renal-dosage adjustment, if required, was performed according to
      protocol.

      The study's primary endpoint was change in influenza RNA load over time. The secondary
      endpoints were viral shedding indicated by culture and RNA negativity at day 5, and drug
      tolerability.

      Additionally, a priori comparisons of these endpoints with historical controls treated with
      standard courses of oral oseltamivir (75mg bid for 5 days) in the same clinical settings were
      performed.
