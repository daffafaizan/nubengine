      are candidates for surgery will be eligible. They will receive a contrast-enhanced breast
      ultrasound after the intravenous injection of a microbubble contrast agent which will show
      the microvascularity. A subset of women will also have ultrasound elastography performed of
      the abnormality to evaluate its stiffness.
