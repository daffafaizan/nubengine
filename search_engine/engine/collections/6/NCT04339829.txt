      (NSCLC).The incidence of CNS metastases in patients with EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC is 24%
      at first diagnosis almost doubles over the course of the disease. Several data has shown
      treatment with first generation EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) can reduce the risk of
      progression in the CNS, compared with chemotherapy or WBRT.Pre-clinical data showing that
      brain homogenate dacomitinib concentrations is similar to plasma in mice. While, there are
      evidence show that dacomitinib have efficacy in NSCLC patients with BM. This phase II study
      was designed to prospectively evaluate the efficacy and safety of Dacomitinib in NSCLC
      patients with BM.
