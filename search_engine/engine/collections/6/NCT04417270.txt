      higher mortality. Patients with controlled blood glucose have a lower mortality rate than
      those who are uncontrolled. However, a rigid blood glucose control - which may lead to
      hypoglycemia- is associated with higher mortality rates. Thus, adequate glucose monitoring is
      important for hospitalized diabetic patients.

      Previous studies have shown that CGMS, in the outpatient setting, engender better glycemic
      control thereby reducing risk of hypoglycemia. CGMS offer a replacement for finger stick
      blood glucose monitoring which may not identify an incidence of hypoglycemia until symptoms
      drive the patient to test. Furthermore, finger stick blood glucose monitoring is painful and
      time consuming thus causing many patients to avoid this aspect of diabetes self-care
      management.

      Freestyle Libre CGMs sample interstitial fluid glucose subcutaneously. Measurement
      frequencies typically range from 1 to 15 minutes and most commonly are every 5 minutes.

      Previous studies in hospitalized patients living with diabetes mellitus on basal bolus
      regimen have shown:

      • Use of the CGM increased detection of both hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic events versus
      those sensed by POCT.

      One investigation identified 88 postprandial hyperglycemic excursions in patients with CGM
      use as opposed to 61 in those with POCT. Another noted that when comparing the CGM use with
      that of POCT, the former identified 55 hypoglycemic events whereas the latter only found 12.

      • No difference in mean daily glucose CGM and POCT readings. In a study of 38 patients, the
      investigators noted no difference in mean daily glucose between the CGM and POCT.
