      diabetic patients with Hp2-2 phenotype which were not randomised to treatment under ICARE
      study. Patients will be randomised to either vitamin E 400 IU/d or Placebo upon sampling for
      EFI study.

      The patients will be tested for endothelial function by a method of Post Ischemic Flow
      mediated Dilatation.

      all patients will undergo a baseline Endothelial Function test and then start taking the
      study drug for 2 months. at the end of two months of therapy the patients will undergo a
      second endothelial function test, then therapy will be stopped for 2 weeks and a cross over
      will be performed for an additional 2 months of therapy which in the end the third and final
      endothelial function test will be done.

      An interim Results analysis is set to be done once the first 20 patients completed the
      protocol. In case of significant differences between the groups, study principal
      investigators will decide about study completion.
