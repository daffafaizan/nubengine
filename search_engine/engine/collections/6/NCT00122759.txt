           most instances to alleviate symptoms of pain and distress. It usually consists of an
           association of opiates and benzodiazepines.

        -  In some instances, pain and agitation persist despite this combined sedation regimen. In
           such cases, the clinicians have the choice between increasing dosage of these 2
           substances which may increase their adverse effects (mainly hypotension) and/or adding a
           neuromuscular blocking agent which is not devoid of adverse effects (mainly the onset of
           neuromyopathy of critical illness).

        -  This study will assess the safety, efficacy and cost-effectiveness of adding ketamine, a
           well known anesthetic agent, to a combination of midazolam and sufentanil when this
           combination is not sufficient to reach acceptable sedation target.
