      investigational new drug for the treatment of the elevated blood sugar associated with type 2
      diabetes. Other benefits may include reduced total and LDL cholesterol, and reduced blood
      pressure. With chronic treatment, reduced visceral fat may also be seen. Ketoconazole
      (racemic) is an approved drug for the treatment of a variety of fungal infections. The
      approved racemic ketoconazole inhibits cortisol synthesis. In patients with Cushings Disease
      racemic ketoconazole reduces glucose, cholesterol and blood pressure. Elevated cortisol may
      be a contributing causal factor in the development of type 2 diabetes; clinical trials with
      racemic ketoconazole have been carried out in these patients. The results of these clinical
      trials support the concept of treating type 2 diabetes through a lowering of plasma cortisol
      and provide evidence of the safety and tolerability of racemic ketoconazole. Racemic
      ketoconazole has, however, been associated with liver toxicity which is generally mild in
      nature. However, in rare cases (1:10,000 to 15,000 patients) severe liver toxicity may occur,
      and in extremely rare cases this adverse event may be irreversible and life-threatening.
      Preclinical results suggest that DIO-902 may be both safer and more efficacious than the
      racemic mixture.
