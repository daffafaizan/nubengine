      cancers and are a major cause of significant morbidity. It was reported that 16- 62% of OSCCs
      develop from premalignant lesions, which often presents clinically as white or red mucosal
      patches known as leukoplakia and erythroplakia. The role of miRNA in cancer has been
      reiterated and established by many studies that have shown that miRNA signatures (i.e., mRNA
      expression profiles) can be useful for classifying human cancers. These studies have
      identified "cancer related miRNAs" through investigating expression profiles in matched
      normal and tumor tissues, as well as in body fluids. In addition, a vast number of studies
      have shown that miRNAs can play a role in regulating the expression of oncogenes and tumor
      suppressor genes, whereas others have shown that miRNA gene deletion or mutation can lead
      cancer initiation, progression and metastasis . Several potential mechanisms have been
      suggested for the ability of metformin to suppress cancer growth in vitro and vivo:

      (1) Activation of LKB1/AMPK pathway, (2) Induction of cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis, (3)
      Inhibition of protein synthesis, (4) Reduction in circulating insulin levels, (5) Inhibition
      of the unfolded protein response (UPR), (6) Activation of the immune system.

      This study is performed to evaluate metformin effect on the patients premalignant lesion
      versus maintenace follow ups.
