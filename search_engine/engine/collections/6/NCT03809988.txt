    
      Pre- and post-menopausal women age â‰¥ 18 years with HR-positive and HER2-negative with ABC
      that had previously received first-line endocrine therapy in combination with palbociclib and
      had achieved clinical benefit during palbociclib-based treatment. Patients relapsing on a
      palbociclib-based regimen in the adjuvant setting are also eligible. Patients are not
      eligible if they are candidates for a local treatment with a curative intention. Evidence of
      either measurable and biopsiable metastatic disease (as for Response Evaluation Criteria In
      Solid Tumors (RECIST v.1.1)) or non-measurable disease with bone lesion is required.
      Pre-menopausal women must be under treatment with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone
      (LHRH) analogues.
