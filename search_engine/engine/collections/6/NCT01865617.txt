      I. To evaluate the feasibility and safety of adoptive T cell therapy using ex vivo expanded
      autologous CD8 positive (+) and CD4+ CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells for
      patients with advanced CD19+ B cell malignancies.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the duration of in vivo persistence of adoptively transferred T cells, and
      the phenotype of persisting T cells.

      II. To determine if adoptively transferred T cells traffic to the bone marrow and function in
      vivo.

      III. To determine if the adoptive transfer of CD19 CAR-T cells results in depletion of CD19+
      B cells in vivo as a surrogate for functional activity.

      IV. To determine if the adoptive transfer of CD19 CAR-T cells has antitumor activity in
      patients with measurable tumor burden prior to T cell transfer.

      V. To determine if the adoptive transfer of CD19 CAR-T cells is associated with tumor lysis
      syndrome.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of autologous CD19 CAR T-cells followed by
      a phase II study.

      Patients receive anti-CD19-CAR lentiviral vector-transduced autologous T cells intravenously
      (IV) over 20-30 minutes on day 0. Treatment may be repeated in no less than 21 days with or
      without additional lymphodepleting chemotherapy if there is persistent disease in the absence
      of unacceptable toxicity.

      DOSE DENSE EXPANSION COHORT: An additional cohort will receive a second anti-CD19-CAR
      lentiviral vector-transduced autologous T cell infusion without additional lymphodepleting
      chemotherapy 10-21 days after the first infusion if adequate CD19 CAR-T cells can be produced
      and appropriate criteria are met.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for at least 15 years.
