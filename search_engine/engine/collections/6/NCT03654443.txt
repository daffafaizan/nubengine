      setting of the Intensive care unit (ICU). Prior to patient recruitment the tool will be
      translated by the method of translation-back translation by Greek and English native
      speakers. The study is designed as a prospective randomized crossover clinical trial.
      Patients will be randomly allocated into two study groups. In Group I the CPOT tool is
      administered prior to a painful stimulus (ITime0), during the painful stimulus (ITime1) and
      soon afterwards (ITime2).In Group II the CPOT tool is administered prior to a non painful
      stimulus(IITime0), during a non-painful stimulus (IITime1) and soon afterwards (IITime2).
      After these trials the patients in the two groups will crossover into the other group and the
      whole process will be repeated. The painful stimulus is set to be the passive turning of the
      patient into the bed and the non painful stimulus is the cleaning of the arm or leg. 20
      minutes afterwards the CPOT tool is administered once again in both groups in order to obtain
      the values when there is no stimulus (ITime3). The tool is administered by two trained
      members of the study team in a blind manner. Both of the observers administer the tool at the
      same time but one of them is positioned in the ward of the patient and the other one behind a
      curtain with no contact with the observer but only with the patient and the monitor.
