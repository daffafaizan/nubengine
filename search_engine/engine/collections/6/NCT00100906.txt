      Primary

        -  Determine the ratio of dendritic cells (DC) to circulating immature cells (ImC) before
           and after treatment with 3 different doses of tretinoin in patients with stage IV renal
           cell cancer.

        -  Assess in vitro immune response assays to tetanus toxoid and influenza virus peptide
           before and after treatment with tretinoin and interleukin-2 in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the frequency of treatment-related side effects in these patients.

        -  Determine clinical objective response and progression-free survival of patients treated
           with this regimen.

        -  Correlate DC:ImC ratio with clinical objective response in patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Correlate the extent of change of the DC:ImC ratio with tretinoin dose and tretinoin
           blood levels in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label study. Specimens are stratified according to
      patient prognostic factors, tumor bulk, and extent of dendritic cell to circulating immature
      cell ratio derangement. Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 tretinoin doses.

      Patients are followed for up to 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 27-36 patients (9-12 per treatment arm) will be accrued for
      this study within 2 years.
