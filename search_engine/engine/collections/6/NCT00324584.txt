      continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) (face-to-face visits) with an intensive
      coaching using the Web and the cellular phone network for data transmission and Short Message
      Service (SMS). This telecommunication device is called GlucoNet. The specific objectives are
      to measure the efficiency of GlucoNet in improving metabolic control, reducing health care
      costs and improving the quality of life of patients.
