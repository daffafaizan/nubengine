    
      This is a multiple center, randomized, double-blind, Phase 2 study of NBP administered to
      women with metastatic breast cancer who receive nab-paclitaxel as therapy. Nab-paclitaxel
      will be administered at a dose >260 mg/m2 every 3 weeks for 4 planned cycles. Subjects will
      begin receiving NBP orally at a dose of 400 mg administered every 12-hours (BID) or matching
      placebo 5 days (10 doses) prior to starting nab-paclitaxel therapy and continue to
      self-administer it BID until Visit 6/Day 100/Week 15. The primary objective is to evaluate
      the efficacy of NBP relative to placebo at preventing or reducing symptoms associated with
      nab-paclitaxel induced toxic neuropathy (CIPN). The secondary objectives include an
      evaluation the efficacy of NBP relative to placebo at preventing or attenuating taxane
      induced acute pain syndrome (TAPS), the evaluation of the safety and tolerability of NBP
      relative to placebo and to determine if NBP administration impacts the pharmacokinetics of
      nab-paclitaxel or if nab-paclitaxel affects the pharmacokinetics of NBP.
