      be based on the interactions between genetic predispositions and social-environmental
      influences (e.g. ACE) via affecting neurobiological and cognitive processing, goals of this
      project are 1) characterization of loneliness to understand whether people suffer from
      mental/somatic disorders, feel lonelier and this effect is particularly strong in those with
      a history of ACE, 2) understanding the determinants of chronic loneliness by investigating
      certain personality dispositions such as rejection sensitivity and justice sensitivity,
      genetic predisposition for loneliness and social environments during childhood and
      adolescence and 3) inquiring into the social-cognitive correlates of these potential
      determinants in people's life today
