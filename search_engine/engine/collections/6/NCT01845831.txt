    
      Specific Aim 1: To determine whether in-hospital glycemic control, as measured by mean daily
      blood glucose concentration and frequency of hypoglycemic events, is different between
      treatment with sitagliptin (Januvia®) in combination with basal insulin (glargine) and basal
      bolus regimen (glargine and rapid-acting insulin analog) in general medicine and surgery
      patients with T2D. Patients with T2D treated with diet and/or OAD or with low total daily
      dose insulin therapy (≤0.6 unit/kg/day) will be randomized to receive sitagliptin plus
      glargine insulin (group 1) or basal bolus regimen with glargine once daily and rapid-acting
      insulin (lispro or aspart) before meals (group 2). If needed, patients in the 2 treatment
      groups will receive supplemental (correction) doses of rapid-acting insulin before meals for
      BG > 140 mg/dl.

      Specific Aim 2: To determine the efficacy and safety of an A1C based discharge algorithm in
      controlling BG after discharge in patients with T2D. Patients who participate in the
      in-hospital (Aim 1) arm will be invited to enroll in this open label prospective outpatient
      study. The total duration of the study is 6 months. Patients with HbA1c ≤ 7% will be
      discharged on the combination of metformin and sitagliptin (Janumet ®) twice daily. Those
      with HbA1c between 7% and 9% will be discharged on metformin and sitagliptin (Janumet ®)
      twice daily plus glargine insulin at 50% of the inpatient glargine dose. Those with HbA1c >
      9% will be discharged on metformin and sitagliptin (Janumet ®) twice-daily plus glargine
      insulin at 80% of the inpatient dose.
