        -  Determine the safety and possible effectiveness of antineoplastons A10 and AS2-1 in
           patients with serious or immediately life-threatening stage II, III, or IV mantle cell
           lymphoma.

        -  Evaluate the response to, tolerance to, and side effects of this regimen in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

      Patients receive gradually escalating doses of antineoplaston A10 and antineoplaston AS2-1
      intravenously 6 times daily until the maximum tolerated dose is reached. Treatment continues
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Tumors are measured every 8 weeks for 6 months, every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months
      for the third and fourth years, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study.
