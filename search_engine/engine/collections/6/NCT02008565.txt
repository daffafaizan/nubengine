      the use of anal sphincter exercise training with biofeedback to usual care (educational
      pamphlet) in the treatment of women suffering from fecal incontinence (FI). We will test the
      following null hypotheses:

        1. there is no difference in outcomes between women randomized to loperamide and women
           randomized to oral placebo for treatment of FI;

        2. there is no difference in outcomes between women randomized to anal sphincter exercises
           with biofeedback and women randomized to usual care (educational pamphlet) for FI
           treatment;

        3. there is no difference between women randomized to both treatments together and women
           randomized to either FI treatment alone; and

        4. there is no correlation between anal manometry measurements and digital anal squeeze
           strength or measures of FI severity and bother.

      A supplemental study, Stool Metabolome and Microbiome in Women with Fecal Incontinence in
      CAPABLe, will evaluate the stool metabolome and microbiome in women with fecal incontinence
      and unaffected age matched controls.
