      acceptability, and initial efficacy/clinical significance of a tobacco relapse prevention
      intervention designed for low-income African Americans.

      In this study, the team will estimate effect sizes for a culturally specific (CS) relapse
      prevention intervention compared to standard relapse prevention in a sample of low-income
      African American smokers and examine predictors of time to smoking relapse.

      In a community-based clinical trial, adults who recently quit smoking (N=100) will be
      randomly assigned to one of two experimental conditions: (1) CS Relapse Prevention or (2)
      Standard Relapse Prevention. The primary outcome variables collected will include
      biochemically verified point prevalence abstinence (ppa) at 6-weeks and time to smoking
      relapse (TTR) over 3-months. This study will test daily hassles, cessation self-efficacy,
      coping strategies, and adherence to NRT as individual difference factors that may affect
      response to CS relapse prevention.
