      the development of obesity and obesity-related diseases such as fatty liver are of relevance
      in humans, e.g. for classification of afflicted individuals regarding risk or outcome after
      intervention. During 3 years, the investigators will include 480 obese individuals (4 cohorts
      of 120 individuals) who undergo a treatment program (either surgical or non-surgical), and
      follow them up for at least 3 years. Every 6 months, a visit is planned at the obesity center
      where the initial intervention has been performed. Within the visits, anthropometry (Body
      Mass Index (BMI), excess body weight (EBW), bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA)), quality
      of life (SF36 score, Impact Of Weight On Quality Of Life (IWQOL) questionnaire), and sample
      collection for laboratory analyses (inflammatory markers, hormones, flora composition,
      micronutrients, metabolomics etc.) will be performed. Patients will be recruited from 3
      centers in Germany. The long-term expectation from this model project is to find
      gastrointestinal parameters allowing to predict outcome and sustainability of different
      intervention strategies. In addition, intervention programs will be compared regarding
      long-term outcome and quality of life changes.
