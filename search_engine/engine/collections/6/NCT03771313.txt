    
      This is an open-label, single center, prospective study of patients with a diagnosis of
      cystic fibrosis (CF) and a history of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA),
      also known as oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (ORSA), being treated with
      intravenous ceftaroline. Patients will have intravenous ceftaroline dosed according to
      current recommendations based upon its approved usage in pediatric patients for community
      acquired pneumonia. The investigators will analyze pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic
      (PD) data using serum concentrations of ceftaroline measured at various time-points following
      infusion of ceftaroline to develop PK/PD guided dosing strategies of ceftaroline in pediatric
      CF patients that would be tailored to account for bacterial susceptibility and disease
      progression and determine if current dosing regimes used are appropriate for this patient
      population.

      Blood samples will be collected prior to infusion of ceftaroline and at approximately 1 hour
      (+/- 10 minutes), 1.5 hours (+/- 10 minutes), 3 hours (+/- 30 minutes), and 6 hours (+/- 30
      minutes) after initiation of infusion. The blood samples (0.5 to 1 ml) will be collected
      through intravenous access, venipuncture, or capillary blood puncture. Samples will be
      centrifuged at 1500g at 4°C for 15 minutes within 15 minutes of collection. Serum will be
      separated into two aliquots of a minimum of 0.2 mL and stored at -70°C until analysis.
      Determination of serum ceftaroline concentrations will be measured using high-performance
      liquid chromatography (HPLC) method with ultraviolet (UV) detection.

      Key clinical data (PK/PD) that will be collected includes age, sex, genotype, growth
      parameters, airway microbiology, sweat chloride values, pulmonary function test (FEV1),
      concomitant medications, and comorbid disorders (i.e.: CF related diabetes, CF liver disease,
      short gut, renal dysfunction, pulmonary hypertension, coagulopathy).
