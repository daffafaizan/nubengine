      losartan (50mg) on salience processing in healthy participants will be examined. The study
      will adopt a previously validated visual Oddball fMRI paradigm, starting 90 minutes after
      subjects receive 50mg losartan or placebo. The task requires participants to respond to
      emotional and novelty oddballs. Neural activity will be assessed by the acquisition of
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data.
