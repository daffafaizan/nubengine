      be given as single doses at separate visits. The product administrations comprise 30 minutes
      of chewing. Periods without NRT, lasting for at least 36 hours, will separate treatment
      visits. Before and after the start of product administration at each treatment visit, blood
      will be sampled for pharmacokinetic analyses, pre-dose, and during 8 hours after start of
      product administration. Used gums will be collected and analyzed to determine the amount of
      remaining nicotine. Subjects will also be monitored to capture any adverse events that may
      occur. Treatment labels will be concealed from subjects and study personnel.
