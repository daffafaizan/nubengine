electron microscopy of cytoplasmic inclusions within /macrophages/ ofhuman tissue .the fine structure of inclusions found within the cytoplasm ofmacrophages of human lung, spleen, skin, lymph node, and rectum has beendescribed .the inclusions appear as concentric or whorled lamellae arrangedaround a core . each lamella is constructed of discrete, parallelfilaments . the inclusions do not resemble currently described virusesor virus-like particles, nor do they resemble asbestos bodies or otherknown atmospheric pollutants or ingestants .there is some resemblance to lipid phase systems as well as mast cellgranules,. possibly the inclusions represent partial intracellulardigestion of phagocytized tissue membranes or ingested mast cellgranules, respectively . differences and similarities exist between theinclusion bodies of macrophages and the granules of mast cells . suchvariations could be due to alterations in mast cell granule morphologybefore or after macrophage ingestion .cytologic distinctions between macrophages laden with mast cellgranules and mast cells proper, remains obscure and requires additionalexperimental evidence for clear electron microscopic differentiation ofthese two cell types .the exact nature of these highly structured bodies remains speculative
