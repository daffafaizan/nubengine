      diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder are tested with quantitative EEG
      (QEEG) and ERPs to supplement the neuropsychological examination. In the majority of cases a
      systematic four weeks trial on stimulant medication is offered, and the clinical effects are
      evaluated at the end of the try-out period. This procedure is a clinical routine. In this
      study patients and parents were asked if they were willing to complete a second QEEG/ERP test
      on a single dose of stimulant medication shortly before the onset of the four weeks trial.
      They were explained that the aim of the study was to search for predictors of clinical
      response. They were also informed that this second test was completely voluntary. (In fact
      the vast majority were quite enthusiastic). The patients were characterized as responders
      (REs - medication continued) or non-responders (non-REs - medication stopped) based on
      explicit criteria. The single-dose induced changes in ERPs (and behavioral parameters from
      the attention test; number of errors, reaction times) were examined, and differences between
      REs and non-REs were calculated.

      If the analysis of data show that one or several variables are significantly different in REs
      and non-REs with large effect sizes, these findings may eventually result in the development
      of a useful clinical tool.
