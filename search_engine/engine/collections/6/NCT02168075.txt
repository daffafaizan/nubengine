      intracranial pressure. Another study of Sorani showed dose-response relationship between
      mannitol and intracranial pressure (ICP) in traumatic brain injury patients.

      In this study, authors would investigate that mannitol increments can provide more brain
      relaxation in patients undergoing craniotomy for supratentorial brain tumor removal.
