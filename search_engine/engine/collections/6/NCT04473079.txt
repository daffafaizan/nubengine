      standard 14-day H. pylori eradication treatment among H. pylori-positive participants with
      non-ulcer dyspepsia.

      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled trial, with two parallel arms. Participants will be
      randomized to receive probiotic or placebo as adjuvant to the standard anti-H. pylori
      treatment. Each participant will be enrolled in the study for 12 weeks, during which they
      will receive the anti-H. pylori treatment and co-administration of investigational product
      (IP; for two weeks), followed by IP supplementation alone (for four weeks), and they will be
      followed-up 4 weeks after last IP administration.
