        -  Compare local tumor control in patients with stage II or III prostate cancer treated
           with neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy with standard vs high-dose conformal
           radiotherapy.

        -  Compare the incidence of biochemical failure (prostate-specific antigen (PSA) greater
           than 2 ng/mL at 6 or more months after initiation of radiotherapy and PSA rising from
           nadir level by at least 50%), development of metastases, and survival in patients
           treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the acute and late radiation-induced side effects of these regimens in this
           patient population.

        -  Compare aspects of quality of life, health economics, models of normal tissue, and tumor
           control in patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      prostate-specific antigen, T stage, and Gleason score. Patients are randomized to one of two
      treatment arms.

      All patients receive neoadjuvant androgen deprivation with luteinizing hormone-releasing
      hormone agonists every 4 weeks beginning 3-6 months before initiation of radiotherapy and
      continuing until completion of radiotherapy.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo standard conformal radiotherapy for 6.5 weeks.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo high-dose conformal radiotherapy for 7.5 weeks. Quality of life
           is assessed at baseline, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.

      Patients are followed every 6 months for 2 years and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 800 patients will be accrued for this study.
