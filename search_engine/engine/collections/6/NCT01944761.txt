      developed countries. With treatment advances over the last 25 years, survival rates have
      improved dramatically. However, survival is often achieved at considerable cost. Cranial
      radiation is frequently required for effective tumor control, and is associated with
      significant neuro-toxicity, including white matter damage and cognitive morbidity. In order
      to achieve the best possible outcome for survivors, and ultimately conquer the long-term
      consequences of this disease, new interventions must be developed to ameliorate the
      neuro-toxic effects experienced by children. radiation injury can now be used to guide the
      development of interventions designed to rescue neural tissue. Furthermore, various new
      agents and activities with potential to stimulate neuro-recovery are now available. The
      potential value of exercise for rescuing the brain from neuro-toxic effects, for instance,
      has recently been reported. Next, neuro-cognitive processes that are particularly sensitive
      to the effects of cranial radiation have been identified and can serve as behavioral assays
      to test the effectiveness of these new interventions. Finally, novel neuro-imaging tools are
      available to perform in vivo evaluations in order to delineate potential mechanisms of
      neuro-recovery. We intend to integrate these new research findings to develop and evaluate a
      physical exercise-based intervention targeted at rescuing brain tissue of children with brain
      tumors from the neuro-toxic impact of cranial radiation.
