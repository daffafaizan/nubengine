      glucocorticoids (GC). To avoid over- and under- replacement, an individual daily dose scheme
      and adequate dose adjustment during stressful events is essential. Recent patient surveys
      revealed nonadherence to treatment, concerns about GC and dissatisfaction with the provided
      information.

      The aim of this trial is to evaluate the adherence, concerns and satisfaction with
      information in German patients with primary and secondary AI (PAI/SAI) and the influence of a
      standardized education program.

      Patients with AI on GC therapy will be assessed by questionnaire, including the Medication
      Adherence Report Scale* (MARS), Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire* (BMQ, adapted for AI)
      and Satisfaction with Information about Medicines Scale* (SIMS).*Â©Professor Rob Horne.

      The study includes one cross-sectional-analysis and one longitudinal study (patient survey
      before and after participation at the standardized education program in Germany).
