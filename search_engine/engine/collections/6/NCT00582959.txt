      beam imaging, for verification of treatment set up accuracy of cancer patients receiving
      radiation therapy. Currently, treatment accuracy is checked via use of 2-dimensional
      projection x-rays taken with the megavoltage treatment beam and electronic portal imaging
      devices (EPID). Typically 2 orthogonal portal images are obtained to confirm patient
      positioning accuracy. This method of treatment verification, however, usually provides images
      of poor quality and lacks true 3D information, thus making it difficult for the radiation
      oncologist to definitively confirm treatment accuracy. New generation EPIDs are capable of
      obtaining higher quality images at significantly lower imaging doses. Thus, for the same
      total imaging dose new generation EPIDs permit acquisition of many projection images rather
      than just 2 or 3. The combination of more images and higher quality images should permit more
      definitive assessment of treatment accuracy. We propose here to test the clinical
      practicality and reliability of a new prototype portal imaging system.
