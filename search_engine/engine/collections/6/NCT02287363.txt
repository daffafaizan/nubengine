      paralysis when they are hyperthyroid. Due to their imbalanced predilection to the disease,
      genetic variance is considered to be critical to the pathogenesis. In addition, since
      proximal limb skeletal muscles are the major sites of target, and they are also believed to
      play a role in the disease generation. Thus, we intend to analyze the genetic and
      morphological variances between TPP patients and pure hyperthyroidism patients and
      simultaneously the relation between genetic variance and morphological difference. In this
      way, we hope to provide evidence for a better understanding of the disease.
