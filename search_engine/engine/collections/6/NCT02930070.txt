      leading causes of death in hospital. In 2016, the third international consensus has modified
      the definition of sepsis from infection with >=2 of systemic inflammatory response syndrome
      (SIRS) criteria to infection with >=2 of sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score.
      This new definition, which well reflects the organ dysfunction nature of sepsis, however
      makes it difficult to diagnose sepsis in general wards. An alternative of process was put
      forward to compensate this weakness. For each infection patient in general, access a quick
      SOFA (qSOFA), if it is above 2 score, then conduct laboratory examination to get a SOFA
      score. This process is helpful to find out sepsis, but undoubtedly leave out some patients
      who meet the SOFA criteria without qSOFA >=2. Besides, there are also some patients who has a
      qSOFA >=2 however do not meet the SOFA criteria. Whether those patients have better survival
      rate is unclear. This prospective cohort is aimed to compare prognosis of patients with
      different SOFA, qSOFA score, therefore access the diagnostic accuracy of qSOFA in the
      diagnosis of sepsis, eventually evaluate the feasibility of using qSOFA as a complete
      replacement of SOFA in general wards.
