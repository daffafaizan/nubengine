      ablation of neoplastic prostate tissue via nanoparticle directed irradiation. The patient
      population consists of men with low to intermediate risk localized prostate cancer with MRI
      visible and confirmed focal areas of prostate cancer using MR US Fusion Guided Biopsy. The
      patient also has no disease detected via ultrasound guided biopsy outside of areas visualized
      on MR imaging.There is one arm/group to this study: Up to forty five (45) patients will
      receive a single intravenous infusion of AuroShell particles 12 to 36 hours prior to MRI/US
      guided laser irradiation using an FDA cleared laser and an interstitial optical fiber.

      Efficacy and acute volume of ablation will be assessed by contrast-enhanced MRI 48 - 96 hours
      after laser illumination to allow time for the appearance of coagulative necrosis and prior
      to reconfiguration of tissue by lytic action. An appearance of a 'void' on MRI would be more
      generally expected than lesion shrinkage. Efficacy of focal ablation of prostate tissue will
      be assessed by MRI /Ultrasound guided biopsy at 3 months (primary endpoint) and again at 1
      year after laser treatment. Per standard of care patient follow up will continue on a 6 month
      basis beyond the one year follow up but will be outside the scope of the study.
