      and explore different innovative sampling methods to obtain information on lung PK. The aim
      of the study is not to generate safety or efficacy data of the selected licensed drugs. The
      choice of drugs is based on general considerations regarding therapy of airway diseases and
      the physical-chemical properties of the compounds. It is not driven by the compounds per se.
