      southern and southeastern China, where the incidence rate has been documented between 10 and
      150 cases per 100,000 population per year. For advanced or metastatic NPC, chemotherapy
      remain the mainstay of treatment. The 130-nm albumin-bound formulation of paclitaxel
      ([Abraxane, ABX ];Celgene,Summit,NJ) is a promising new agent with more efficient entry to
      the tumor microenvironment via caveolae-mediated transcytosis and preferential uptake by
      cancer cells. Superior activity of ABX-based regimens without the necessity for
      antianaphylactic pretreatments been shown in various solid tumors compared with the
      traditional solvent-based paclitaxel-based ones. However, the safety and efficacy of
      combination of ABX and cisplatin (DDP) has not been determined in patients with advanced NPC.
      In this single center, non-randomized phase IIa study, investigators seek to determine the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose limiting toxicity (DLT) of ABX-DDP, and perform an
      exploratory study of its efficacy as measured by tumor response.
