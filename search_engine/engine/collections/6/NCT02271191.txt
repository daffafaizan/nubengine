      calcium channel blockers, beta-adrenergic blockers have been used alone or in combination.
      Nicardipine, classed as a calcium channel blocker, has a peripheral vasodilator effect via
      relaxation of smooth muscle fiber and sympathetic nerve inhibition. Nicardipine expands the
      renal artery and increases glomerular filtration rate. Previous studies reported the renal
      protective effect of nicardipine in cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass and
      robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery.

      The aim of this study was to demonstrate the effect of nicardipine on renal function with
      creatinine clearance , serum cystatin C, urine output and fractional excretion of sodium
      during deliberate hypotension for spine surgery.
