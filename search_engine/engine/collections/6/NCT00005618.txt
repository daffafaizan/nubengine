      relapsed and/or refractory, chronic, accelerated, or blastic phase chronic myelogenous
      leukemia. II. Determine the pattern of clinical adverse experience in this patient population
      administered this drug.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to disease stage (chronic phase vs accelerated
      phase or blastic phase). Patients receive arsenic trioxide IV over 1 hour on consecutive days
      or weekdays only for a total of 25 days followed by 3-5 weeks of rest. Treatment continues
      for a maximum of 6 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.
      Patients with responding disease are followed at least monthly.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10-27 patients will be accrued for the chronic phase stratum of
      this study within 2 years. A total of 17-37 patients will be accrued for the accelerated and
      blastic phases stratum of this study within 2 years.
