      endurance activities, its benefits in team sports has been barely studied. In this randomized
      placebo-controlled study, we investigated the effects of BJ acute supplementation in
      improving neuromuscular performance and physical match activity in basketball.Testing
      sessions will comprised a neuromuscular test battery consisting of a countermovement jump
      (CMJ), isometric handgrip strength, 10-m/20-m sprint and agility T-test, followed by a
      40-minute simulated basketball match. Physical match activity (distances, speeds,
      accelerations and decelerations) will be monitored in real time using an inertial tracking
      system
