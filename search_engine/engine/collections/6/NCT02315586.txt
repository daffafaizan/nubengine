    
      Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic progressive disease that occurs primarily in
      older individuals, 55 to 75 years of age, with a median survival of approximately 3 years
      from time of diagnosis. At present, there are no effective treatments for patients with IPF.
      Levels of apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) have been found to be reduced in the lungs of patients
      with IPF, while administration of human apoA-I has been shown to reduce bleomycin-induced
      collagen deposition in a murine model. Here, we would like to assess whether apoA-I pathways
      modify lung cell biology in patients with IPF. This is a specimen procurement, clinical
      phenotyping and genotyping protocol that will assess whether holo-apoA-I and apolipoprotein
      A-I mimetic peptides, can attenuate key pathogenic manifestations of IPF, such as
      proliferation and extracellular matrix generation by pulmonary fibroblasts, which may serve
      as evidence to support future human clinical trials of apoA-I for the treatment of IPF.
      Furthermore, the identification of new apoA-I responsive genes and pathways that mediate
      fibroblast proliferation in IPF may provide insights into disease pathogenesis and identify
      new therapeutic targets. Lastly, if induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells can be successfully
      shown to model responsiveness of lung cells to apoA-I therapy, then this approach may be
      expanded with the goal of providing a personalized medicine analysis that could in the future
      guide selection of the most effective therapy for individual patients.
