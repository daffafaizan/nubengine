      radiotherapy for cancer or other serious medical illnesses has the potential to markedly
      increase the risk of gonadotoxicity leading to infertility in women. Females who are
      post-menarchal with these risk factors may be candidates for fertility preservation through
      oocyte cryopreservation before ovarian failure ensues. For example, sickle cell disease (SCD)
      is the most common hemoglobinopathy in the United States (3). Hypoxic conditions cause the
      abnormal hemoglobin molecule to undergo sickling which leads to painful microvascular
      occlusion. SCD is associated with multiple organ system dysfunction as well as neurological
      and pulmonary complications, which can lead to early mortality. Hematopoietic stem cell
      transplantation (HSCT) is the only treatment currently available for SCD that results in a
      complete cure. In patients who have undergone HSCT with a matched sibling, event-free
      survival has been as high as 85%-95%. Multiple studies have unfortunately demonstrated that
      infertility and premature ovarian insufficiency are quite common following HSCT. Specifically
      in our patient population with sickle cell disease, we have recently found largely preserved
      ovarian function prior to transplantation, but profound gonadotoxicity following transplant
      (unpublished). This underscores the clinical need for additional, effective fertility
      preservation methods for our at-risk populations.
