    
      Asthma is a complex, heritable disease that affects more than 11.2% of the U.S. population,
      which represents approximately 9 million children and 23 million adults. Although the
      underlying characteristics of asthma exist in virtually all patients, the clinical expression
      of the disease and response to treatment are highly variable.

      The purpose of this study is to identify characteristics that will discriminate
      Difficult-to-Treat from Easy-to-Treat asthma in a defined inner-city population adherent to
      study-directed asthma treatment and management.
