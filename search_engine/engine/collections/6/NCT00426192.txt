      response. In addition to this immune response to CPB, a significant impairment of the
      responsiveness of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) to further immunological stimuli
      has been observed. The aim of our present study was to evaluate the ability of antioxidant
      therapy with mannitol or hemofiltration during CPB to modulate the observed immunosuppression
      after CPB.

      Methods With ethics committee approval, 52 patients undergoing elective CABG-surgery were
      prospectively enrolled and randomized into 3 groups (control, 50 g mannitol iv,
      hemofiltration during CPB). Blood samples were taken after induction of anesthesia (T1), 20
      min after separation from CPB (T2) and 24 h postoperatively (T3). Expression density of the
      monocytic surface receptor CD14, HLA-DR expression and cytokine release (TNF-ÔÅ° and IL10)
      after LPS-stimulation were evaluated.

      Results At T2, the CD14dim cell population was maintained in both intervention groups while
      in the control group there was a significant decrease of this proinflammatory monocytic
      phenotype. At T3, all groups developed a significant shift towards the antiinflammatory
      CD14bright population. No significant differences regarding HLA-DR expression or cytokine
      release could be demonstrated.

      Conclusion This study shows that the suppression of the stimulated immune response after CPB
      can be alleviated by iv administration of mannitol or hemofiltration. In the light of data
      showing that this depression of the immune response might affect the postoperative course of
      patients, these results could lead to an improvement of the management of patients undergoing
      cardiac surgery with CPB.
