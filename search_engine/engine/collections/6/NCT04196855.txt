      hormone. Parathyroid hormone is made naturally in the body and is released in response to low
      calcium levels. It helps to maintain bone health and repair bone damage. Parathyroid hormone
      and medicines like teriparatide can strengthen bones and are often given to people with
      osteoporosis (a condition that weakens bones, making them more likely to break) to reduce the
      risk of fractures. Recent studies have also shown benefits in people with stress fracture
      injuries, a form of bone damage sometimes caused by repetitive exercise. The investigators
      want to know if teriparatide is also beneficial to healthy, younger people who have a stress
      fracture injury.
