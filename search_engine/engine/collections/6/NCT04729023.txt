      vitrectomy (PPV) is one of the most widely used surgical therapies to proliferative diabetic
      retinopathy in the world.

      However, as a predictable consequence of PPV surgery, postoperative cataract is observed in
      79%-95% of phakic diabetes retinopathy patients after PPV in 6-24 months.Generally,
      subsequent cataract surgeries are required for the phakic patients within 6-16 months after
      the PPV surgery to improve visualization. While, the subsequent cataract surgeries not only
      bring additional economy and workload burden, but also increase the surgical risks because of
      the deep anterior chamber, zonular dehiscence, and inflammation. Since the two-step surgical
      approach has its defects, the combination of PPV and phacoemulsification is an ideal surgical
      option, which is only suggested in patients with severe lens opacities before the PPV surgery
      so far. For those with mild-moderate lens opacities, the benefits of combined surgery is
      unknown.

      This study is a multi-center prospective study, aimed to evaluate the effect of PPV combined
      with phacoemulsification cataract surgery in phakic diabetes retinopathy patients, and make a
      comparation between the combined surgery and the two-step surgery in patients without severe
      lens opacities.
