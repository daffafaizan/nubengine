      Jockey Club Mental Wellness Project for Women (JCWow) will be recruited. This study aims to
      test the effectiveness of ESM-derived personalized feedback in reducing symptoms of
      depression and anxiety using a randomised controlled trial. After given written consent, the
      participants will be required to undergo a 5 days baseline ESM data collection (week 0). Upon
      completion of baseline data collection, they will be randomly assigned to the intervention
      (ESM-F), active reference (ESM) or control (CON) group. The participants in the intervention
      group will participate in an ESM procedure (three days per week over a 6-week period) using
      through SMS system (week 1 - 6). This group will receive weekly standardised feedback on
      personalised patterns of positive affect. The active reference group will also participate in
      the same ESM procedure without a weekly feedback. The control group will not be required to
      undergo this 6-week data collection procedure. At week 7, all three groups will undergo
      another 5 days of post-intervention ESM data collection in order to examine the naturalistic
      and interventional changes on the depressive symptoms. From week 8 onwards, the participants
      will be contacted 5 times (week 8, 12, 16, 20 and 32) via telephone to follow-up their
      condition. After 32 weeks, both active reference and control group will receive the report.
