      it is expected to rise over the next 30 years. In Taiwan, COPD is estimated as the seventh
      leading cause of death in 2016, and has been gradually increasing in the past decades. COPD
      has been long considered to be a disease state characterized by airflow limitation that are
      not fully reversible, leading to abnormalities in control of breathing, worsening of
      respiratory mechanics and pulmonary function. However, COPD is no longer considered to affect
      only the lungs and airways, but also the rest of the body including decreases in respiratory
      and limb-muscle mass and function. When acute exacerbation occurs, lung function decreases
      rapidly. According to the previous studies, inspiratory muscle training (IMT), can improve
      the strength and endurance of the diaphragm, reduce dyspnea and breathing pattern, thus
      increasing the capacity of activities tolerance in patients with COPD. Although more and more
      studies are focus on diaphragm weakness and the effect of IMT in patients with COPD, the
      efficacy and intensity of IMT in patients with COPD is still controversial and the clinical
      use is limited. Whether increases intensity during IMT would lead to improvements in
      contraction pattern of respiratory muscle remained unclear. Therefore, the purpose of this
      study is to assess the activation patterns of diaphragm and sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscle
      during different loaded inspiratory muscle performance in patients with COPD after acute
      exacerbation.
