      PCA pumps can be programmed so that the button is backlit with a green light at the end of
      the lockout period, and the green light flashes when the medication is being dispensed. No
      studies have examined whether this type of visual cue would influence satisfaction or other
      patient outcomes (such as opioid consumption, PCA safety and patient anxiety) in children and
      adolescents, and no studies have examined whether pediatric patients' perspectives would be
      similar to those of adults.
