    
      The dose escalation phase of the study will follow a standard 3+ 3 dose escalation scheme
      with two dose levels of ganetespib (1-- mg/m2 and 150 mg/m2) administered weekly on Days 1
      and 8 of a 21-day cycle, in combination with a fixed dose of doxorubicin at 50 mg/m2
      administered on Day 1 alone. After 4-6 cycles of combination therapy, continuation of single
      agent ganetespib will be permitted for subjects who are deriving clinical benefit.

      Pharmacokinetic samples for plasma drug levels of ganetespib will be collected pre-dose and 4
      hours after completion of treatment on Day 1 and Day 8 of cycle 1 only in subjects in the
      dose escalation phase.

      The recommended Phase II dose determined at the end of the dose escalation phase will be used
      to conduct a safety dose expansion phase in relapsed/ refractory small cell lung cancer to
      determine if there is a signal of efficacy in this population.
