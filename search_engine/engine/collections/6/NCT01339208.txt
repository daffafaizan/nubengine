      videoconference diabetes consultations with diabetes self-management teaching is efficacious
      in reducing HbA1c in patients with type 2 diabetes in rural areas. The control group will
      consist of patients with type 2 diabetes receiving "usual care", i.e., who have not received
      a referral to the endocrinologist telemedicine team. Secondary outcomes include patient
      satisfaction, level of understanding of self-management skills, and hypoglycemia
