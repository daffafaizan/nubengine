      I. To identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-derived
      exosomes loaded with small interference RNA (siRNA) against KrasG12D (iExosomes) in
      metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients with KrasG12D mutation.

      II. To identify the dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-derived
      exosomes loaded with siRNA against KrasG12D (iExosomes) in metastatic PDAC patients with
      KrasG12D mutation.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of iExosomes. II. Assess the overall response rate of
      iExosomes in the chosen patient population.

      III. Assess the disease control rate (partial response + stable disease) with therapy.

      IV. Determine median progression-free survival (PFS) with this treatment. V. Determine the
      median overall survival (OS) with this treatment.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate optional tissue collection and serum-derived exosomes and circulating-free
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (cfDNA) for detection of DNA and ribonucleic acid (RNA) showing
      KrasG12D sequence; evaluate DNA and RNA showing KrasG12D sequence in optional tissue
      collection.

      II. Evaluate the siRNA content in blood and optional tissue collection.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Participants receive mesenchymal stromal cells-derived exosomes with KrasG12D siRNA
      intravenously (IV) over 15-20 minutes on days 1, 4, and 10. Treatment repeats every 14 days
      for up to 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Participants who respond may continue 3 additional courses.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 30 days, then every 3
      months for up to 1 year.
