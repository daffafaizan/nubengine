    
      This survey was designed to evaluate the safety (i.e., frequency of adverse events) and
      efficacy (i.e., hemostatic effect, rate of rebleeding after confirmation of hemostasis) of
      administration of lansoprazole intravenous 30 mg (Takepron Intravenous 30 mg) to a large
      number of participants in daily medical practice.

      For adults, 30 mg of lansoprazole is typically mixed in physiological saline (JP) or 5%
      glucose solution for injection (JP) and administered twice daily by drip infusion or
      dissolved in 20 mL of physiological saline (JP) or 5% glucose solution for injection (JP) and
      administered twice daily by direct slow intravenous injection.
