      multimodal analgesic strategies using different analgetics targeting different mechanism of
      the pain reception system are used. At the same time this may reduce the use of opioids,
      which commonly cause sideeffects such as nausea, vomiting, obstipation,urinary retention,
      itching, respiratory suppression and sedation.

      In spite of the use of a wide perioperative multimodal analgesia, pain after total knee
      arthroplasty (TKA), is stil a considerable clinical problem and need for optimisation of the
      immediate postoperative pain treatment. There is evidence that "high"dose glucocorticoids
      administered preoperatively reduces the level of pain and the use of opioids after surgery. A
      recent review did not give cause for concern regarding use of glucocorticoids in TKA,but
      found that data on longterm safety aspects are lacking, why no recommendations could be made.

      As the limited evidence presently points to af benefit of glucocorticoids without serious
      side effects, the treatment has been introduced as standard treatment in TKA at several of
      the departments participating in the Lundbeck Foundation Centre for fast-track Hip and Knee
      Replacement collaboration.

      This study is made to monitor the safety of high dose steroid injection before TKA, with
      regards to prosthesis infection within one year of surgery.

      We hypothesize that there will be no increase in infections in patients receiving steroid
      injection before TKA compared to a historical cohort of patents who did not receive a steroid
      injection before their TKA.
