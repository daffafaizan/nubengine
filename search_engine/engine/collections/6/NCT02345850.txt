    
      Chronic Graft-versus-Host Disease (GVHD) is a complication that affects many hematopoietic
      stem cell transplant (HSCT) survivors; it occurs when the new cells from a transplant attack
      the recipient's body. The current standard GVHD prophylaxis regimen for patients with
      hematologic malignancies undergoing HSCT involves a combination of immunosuppressive agents
      given for the first 6 months after transplant. Often, patients develop GVHD and continue on
      these agents for much longer periods. The combination of calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus
      and cyclosporine A) with methotrexate (MTX) is the most common GVHD prophylaxis used
      worldwide in the context of myeloablative conditioning transplants. This regimen demonstrates
      better control of acute GVHD, but is less effective against chronic GVHD. Management of
      chronic GVHD remains a challenge and it has become a significant health problem in transplant
      survivors with more frequent use of mobilized peripheral blood stem cells. Additionally,
      several issues arise with the standard approach including various toxicity symptoms and side
      effects, increased risk of thrombotic microangiopathy due to CNI, no prevention of other
      infectious diseases, and no prevention for disease relapse.

      This standard strategy of Tac/MTX will be used as a control in comparison to two other
      treatment plans both utilizing CNI-free methods: CD34 selected T-cell depletion in peripheral
      blood stem cell (PBSC) grafts, and infusion of bone marrow (BM) grafts followed by
      post-transplant Cyclophosphamide (PTCy). Study participants will be randomized to one of
      these three treatment arms.
