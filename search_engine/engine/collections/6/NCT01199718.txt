      growth. Over expression of CK2 has been documented in multiple types of cancers, including
      multiple myeloma, and inhibition of CK2 represents a potential therapeutic strategy to target
      a specific molecular defect perpetuating many cancers. CX-4945 has demonstrated potent
      inhibition of CK2 enzymatic activity. This study will evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics,
      and pharmacodynamic effects of CX-4945 when administered to patients with multiple myeloma.
