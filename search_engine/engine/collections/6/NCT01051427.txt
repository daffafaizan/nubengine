      are anterior and stop with an anterior packing. Some of them does not stop with this,
      therefore the investigators have to put into the nose a catheter balloon. This is very
      painful and has many after-effects in the nose.

      Surgiflo is a haemostatic matrix used for bleeding.

      The investigators have design a trial to know if some people can benefit from Surgiflo
      instead to put a nasal catheter.

      This a randomized trial with two arms. In one arm the investigators will put surgiflo and not
      in the other.The patient will be admitted to the hospital. The investigators will see the
      difference in the hospital staying and in the effects in the nose, including discomfort or
      pain. The investigators will report age, gender, other diseases or treatments of the
      patients,type and length of bleeding, transfusions needed, arterial tension, coagulation. To
      do that the investigators will make hematological tests for haemoglobin and coagulation. To
      know the discomfort of the device the investigators will give the patient an analog visual
      scale in the moment the investigators will put the device, the day after and in any of the
      next visits. The patient can go home again after 16h without bleeding and the investigators
      will see the patient again in the office after 15 days, 1, 3 and 6 months.

      All the patients will receive the same analgesic protocol so the investigators can compare
      the discomfort.

      The investigators have make statistic analysis, and they will need 24 patients for this
      trial. The investigators will need 2 years, approximately, to recruit them.
