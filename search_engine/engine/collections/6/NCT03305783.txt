    
      This is an observational, parallel-group study in 30 patients with gallstone disease and 10
      healthy control subjects. In patients undergoing cholecystectomy a 4h-meal test (liquid mixed
      meal) will be conducted at baseline (1-2 weeks before surgery) and again within 4 weeks after
      the cholecystectomy. Healthy subjects will be submitted to a single 4h-meal test.

      Secondary endpoints include changes in plasma glucose, insulin, glucagon, GIP, PYY, gastrin,
      CCK, fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF-19) and bile acids. Furthermore, secondary endpoints
      include changes in gastric emptying (evaluated by the paracetamol method).
