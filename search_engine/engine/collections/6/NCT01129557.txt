    
      This is a randomized, open-label, three-arm study comparing Diovan (valsartan, an ARB),
      Tekturna (aliskiren, a DRI), and the combination of valsartan + aliskiren (i.e. ARB + DRI).
      One hundred twenty subjects (40 per arm) will be treated with Tekturna, Diovan, or a
      combination of both drugs for 9 months on top of their usual antihypertensive treatment.
      Changes in urinary aldosterone excretion will be monitored during therapy to measure the
      incidence of aldosterone breakthrough, defined as any sustained positive change from baseline
      urinary aldosterone excretion by the completion of the 9-month study period. This frequency
      measure will be compared during ARB, DRI, and ARB + DRI therapy. Changes in urinary protein
      excretion will also be monitored alongside the urinary aldosterone levels to determine
      whether aldosterone breakthrough is associated with refractory proteinuria. This is an
      innovative study that will be the first to (1) examine aldosterone breakthrough during DRI
      therapy, and (2) explore whether addition of a DRI to an ARB protects against aldosterone
      breakthrough. In addition, this will be the first study to examine whether DRI therapy (alone
      or in combination with ARB) is effective therapy for hypertension in patients with
      non-diabetic proteinuric kidney disease.
