      evaluated to determine its effectiveness in improving symptoms of
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and related impairments. ACTIVATE is a
      computerized neurocognitive training program (ACTIVATE; see: www.c8sciences.com) that
      simultaneously targets eight core neurocognitive factors (i.e., sustained attention, working
      memory (WM), response inhibition, speed of information processing, cognitive flexibility and
      control, multiple simultaneous attention, category formation, and pattern recognition and
      inductive thinking). Youth between the ages of 7-11 will be recruited and assessed for ADHD
      and assigned to the ACTIVATE intervention. Assessment of outcomes will occur before, weekly
      during treatment, and immediately post-treatment.
