      leverages persuasive technology to enhance the lifestyle behavior change counseling efficacy
      of primary care providers. Using principles of behavior change theory and persuasion
      technology, the multidisciplinary design team utilized in-depth interviews and in-vivo
      usability testing to produce a prototype diabetes prevention counseling system embedded in
      the electronic health record. The core element of the tool is a streamlined shared goal
      setting module within the electronic health record system. The system also utilizes a
      pre-encounter patient behavior change goals elicitation survey to help tailor the goal
      setting session to patient preferences and encourage shared decision making. The patients
      also interact with a website that collects their longitudinal behavior change data and
      visualizes their progress over time and in comparison to other study members. The ADAPT
      system utilizes the influential powers of goal setting, tailoring, reminders, social
      comparisons, testimonials and other methods to integrate evidence based behavior change
      principles and persuasion techniques into routine primary care clinical encounters. If
      successful, the ADAPT system may represent an adaptable and scalable technology-enabled
      behavior change tool for all primary care providers.
