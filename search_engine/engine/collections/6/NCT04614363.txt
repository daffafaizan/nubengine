    
      This is a prospective, open label, single-center, single-arm, pilot diagnostic accuracy study
      to evaluate the tissue distribution of 68Ga-PSMA Positron Emission Tomography (PET)/CT in 50
      patients with high risk localized prostate cancer or biochemical recurrence.

      Subjects will receive a single IV dose of 3-7 mCi of 68Ga-PSMA (study drug) followed by
      PET/CT imaging 60-90 minutes after injection. All patients will be closely monitored with
      vital signs (blood pressure and heart rate), before and 2 hours following radiotracer
      administration.

      Patients will receive a phone call 2 days following PET/CT to assess for adverse events.

      To minimize bias, all PET/CT images will be interpreted by a board-certified radiologist. The
      radiologist evaluating the images will be blinded to the final outcome, such as the
      histopathology of any biopsies and the outcome of subsequent imaging.

      Patients with study-defined high-risk features who are eligible and scheduled for radical
      prostatectomy will undergo 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT injection. The results of the 68Ga-PSMA-11
      PET/CT may alter patient management in one of several ways, including the decision to not
      pursue surgical extirpation (e.g. in the event of extensive distant metastasis) in favor of
      systemic therapy. It is also possible that the extent of surgical resection may be altered,
      such as non-regional pelvic or retroperitoneal lymph node dissection. The alteration in
      planned surgical treatment from standard of care will be recorded as a secondary-end point.
