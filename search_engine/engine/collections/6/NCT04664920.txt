      user-centered exergame in older adults with major neurocognitive disorder (dementia). On one
      appointment, the participants will perform a user-centered exergame for about 30 minutes. The
      exergame will include specific cognitive and motor functions. As the difficulty of the
      training game is user-centered, the participants will always be challenged on an appropriate
      level. Stepping exercises will be used to control the video game scenario. The video game
      scenario will include different cognitive functions. The body movements will include
      different physical aspects including balance, strength and Pelvic Floor Muscle Training
      (PFMT). During the exergame performance, different qualitative assessments will be performed
      to determine usability of the exergame including acceptance and game experience protocol
      (think aloud method). After the exergame performance, the participant will answer individual
      and guideline-based interview questions about usability including their individual
      experiences (duration about 20 min). This study contributes to fundamental research
      investigating how user-centered exergame training can be applied in older adults with
      individual needs.
