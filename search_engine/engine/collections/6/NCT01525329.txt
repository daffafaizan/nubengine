      methylaminolevulinate photodynamic therapy (MAL-PDT), versus MAL-PDT alone, as treatment for
      actinic keratoses (AKs) in immunosuppressed organ transplant recipients (OTRs) and an
      immunocompetent control group. Objectives: 1) Determine whether topical pretreatment with
      5-FU selectively increases the amount of photosensitizer (PpIX) produced within AK lesions,
      relative to non-pretreated lesions. 2) Determine whether the combination treatment improves
      lesion resolution and reduces the incidence of new AKs. 3) Determine whether biomarkers in
      tissue and blood are predictive of patient responsiveness to 5FU (PpIX induction, new lesion
      incidence, and clinical toxicity).

      We plan to enroll 20 organ transplant recipients and 20 normal patients, with AKs on face,
      scalp, ears, forearms or back of the hand through Dermatology and Transplant Clinic at
      Cleveland Clinic. Women of childbearing age must use contraception and have a negative
      pregnancy test.

      Study participants will apply 5FU daily for 6 days; MAL/PDT is administered on 7th day. PpIX
      will be measured in lesions using a noninvasive dosimeter. Biopsies will be taken from
      selected lesions, and AKs will be photographed. Participants will be asked to complete a
      questionnaire to document adverse events. Patients are evaluated at day 14, and months 3, 6,
      9, 12, to document AK clearance and new lesion appearance.
