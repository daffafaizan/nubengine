      reported to have deficits in both physical and psycho-social health. In cancer survivors
      exercise has been shown to improve fitness, increase bone density and lean body mass, enhance
      self-esteem, and reduce fatigue. These changes have a positive effect on the survivor's
      physical functioning and quality of life. However, there are few studies which have examined
      the effects of strength training or studies aimed at determining optimal exercise
      prescription in this population. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to compare two
      strength training prescriptions (once-a-week vs. twice-a-week strength training) to determine
      which prescription (if any) results in greater benefit for survivors. It is hoped that the
      results of this study will lead to a better understanding of how strength training improves
      the health of survivors and will help inform future exercise guidelines for this population.
