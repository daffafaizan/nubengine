      the sensitivity was low, since not all species grew well in culture. Recently, molecular
      methods based on PCR amplification of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene or the
      fungal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) followed by capillary sequencing has been used to
      identify bacteria and fungi. However, the resolution of such capillary sequencing-based
      method (<100 sequencing reads/sample) is too low to capture the major collection of
      microorganisms in a sample. Less abundant but possibly pathogenic microorganisms associated
      with short cervical length remain undetectable. To address the current gap in this field, we
      propose to more comprehensively survey microbial communities in the cervix of pregnant women
      by PCR amplification of the 16S rRNA region, ITS or other genomic regions with taxonomic
      classification potential. This will be followed by next-generation sequencing (>40,000
      sequencing reads/sample), which has been proven to capture the majority of microorganisms in
      a sample.
