      Iodine-131 Anti-B1 Antibody consolidation for patients with diffuse large B-cell NHL who
      achieved a response (PR, CRu, CR) following first-line CHOP chemotherapy. The secondary
      efficacy endpoints are to determine the complete response rate, duration of response,
      duration of complete response, progression-free survival, and time to treatment failure. The
      pharmacokinetic endpoint is to determine the total body residence time following the
      dosimetric dose. The secondary safety endpoints are to determine the incidence of adverse
      experiences, hematologic toxicity (e.g., nadir, time to nadir, and time to recovery), use of
      supportive care, percent of patients converting to human anti-murine antibody (HAMA)
      positivity, and survival.
