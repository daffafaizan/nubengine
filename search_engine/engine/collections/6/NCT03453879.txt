      In obstetric emergency situations (OES) inadequate non-technical skills (NTS) are the leading
      causes of substandard care.

      Aim:

      Based on live audio and video (AV)-recordings of real (OES) the aim is to describes how the
      NTS and the clinical performance are related.

      Method:

        1. Inclusion of the teams. OES teams from the delivery ward at two Danish hospitals, Aarhus
           University Hospital and Horsens Regional Hospital are AV-recorded are collected and
           saved for analyzing with consent from all participant.

        2. Develop a scoring tool to rate clinical performance in OES. 12 Ekspert Senior
           Obstetricians from different maternity units in Britain, Norway, Sweden, Denmark and
           Iceland volunteered to join the Delphi panel and develop a clinical performance tool.

        3. Rate clinical performance. Using the developed tool in 2) to rate live teams

        4. Rate NTS Recording of teams will be rated by the validated list: Assessment of Obstetric
           Team Performance with the validated tool from Pamela Morgan: AOTP. Furthermore important
           observations will be code. Video assessments is planned for 2016-2018

        5. Explore the association between clinical performance and NTS in OES. Results from 3) and
           4) will be compared.

      Discussion:

      We expect that this study will add to the knowledge of NTS and the effect on clinical
      performance in OES.
