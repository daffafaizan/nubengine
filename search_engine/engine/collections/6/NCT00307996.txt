      atherosclerosis in hemodialysis patients. This study investigates whether CoQ10
      administration is effective for protecting oxidative stress in hemodialysis patients. The
      subjects were recruited from day-time hemodialysis patients in Iwata City Hospital. 100 mg
      CoQ10 was administered every HD for 6 months. Several oxidative and antioxidative markers
      were measured in plasma at pre, 1, 3, 6 months and after washout.
