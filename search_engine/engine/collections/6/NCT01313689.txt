      prognosis. There is a continued need for new therapies for these CLL patients, as
      demonstrated by the limited responses and substantial toxicities with existing therapies.
      This is supported by the lack of a consensus around standard of care treatment for CLL
      patients with bulky fludarabine-refractory disease. The objective of this study was to
      confirm the response rate and disease control in the refractory setting through a controlled
      trial comparing ofatumumab with the physicians' choice of therapy in fludarabine-refractory,
      bulky lymphadenopathy patients. After 24 weeks of treatment with ofatumumab, patients were
      further randomized to either extended ofatumumab treatment or observation. Patients on the
      physicians' choice arm had the option of receiving ofatumumab if they experience progressive
      disease.
