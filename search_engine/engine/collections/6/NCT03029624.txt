      nerve stimulation in 25 subjects with refractory overactive bladder as defined by the
      American Urological Association.. The eCoin neuromodulation device will be implanted
      subcutaneously in the right or left leg of patients with urgency urinary incontinence. After
      a 4 week implant healing period, subjects will have their devices activated (turned ON).
      After 3 months of device therapy (occurring 4 months post-implant), the primary endpoint will
      be assessed. It is anticipated that subjects will reach the full therapeutic effect at
      approximately 3 months of therapy. Subjects will be followed for an additional 9 months to
      assess the safety of maintenance stimulation therapy with fewer sessions occurring during
      this time interval.
