      Primary

        -  Determine the progression-free survival at 12 weeks of patients with non-rapidly
           progressive castration-resistant prostate cancer treated with everolimus as first-line
           therapy.

        -  Assess the activity and safety of this regimen in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the progression-free survival at 24 weeks of patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine the percentage of PSA response from baseline to 12 weeks in patients treated
           with this regimen.

        -  Determine the changes in PSA-doubling time in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral everolimus once daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up at 28 days and then every 3
      months.
