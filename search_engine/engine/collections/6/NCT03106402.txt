      University Hospital from 2013 to 2015 were reviewed. CMLs, which is any cystic fluid
      collections after cataract surgery, were confirmed by preoperative and postoperative optical
      coherence tomography(OCT) on preoperative, postoperative 1month and 3months examinations.
      CMLs were classified into two groups: cystic macular edema(CME) and microcystic macular
      edema(MME).
