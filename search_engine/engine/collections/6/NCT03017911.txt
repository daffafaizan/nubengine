      receive oral and written patient information describing the study deployment and follow-up.
      Patients will be followed up until PICC Line removal if it occurs during the first 3 months
      after placement or until death if it occurs during the first 3 months, or during 3 months in
      the absence of complications.

        -  Infectious complications are described in accordance with IDSA 2009 guidelines and
           include bloodstream infection, endocarditis, local infection and septic

           diagnosed fortuitously.

        -  Mechanical complications are defined as impairments related to PICC Line device:
           occlusion, rupture, accidental removal.

        -  Hemorrhagic complications are defined as hematoma or bleedings of puncture site.

      In the event of PICC Line-related complications, patient will be followed up for an
      additional 3 months, from the date of complication diagnosis, i.e. maximum follow-up duration
      of 6 months.

      Each week during the first month, then once monthly during the follow-up (i.e. W1, W2, W3,
      W4, M2, M3, +/- M4, M5, M6), all patients data related to the PICC Line retention or removal,
      use and all its related complications will be collected.
