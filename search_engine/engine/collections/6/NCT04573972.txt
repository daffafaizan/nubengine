      activity with another person are more effective than incentives for individual exercise.
      Physical inactivity and social isolation are growing epidemics linked to increased morbidity
      and mortality particularly among aging Americans. This research aims to address both problems
      by encouraging co-productive physical activities among college students. Co-productive
      physical activity mean anything involving physical activity that two people can do together,
      e.g., walking their dogs or shopping together. Additionally, in light of the COVID-19
      pandemic, walking together in this study means either walking while communicating digitally
      or over the phone, or by physically walking together while wearing a mask, staying 6 feet
      apart, and following the recommendations from health professionals. A small randomized
      controlled trial will test the effectiveness of social incentives relative to traditional
      incentives in promoting walking behavior. Participants who are rewarded for walking together
      will be compared to those who are rewarded for walking even when alone. The results will
      indicate whether social incentives are more motivating than traditional incentives for
      walking behavior.
