      CT-simulation (for study purposes only). Retrospectively, 3D treatment fields will be
      designed using the CT-simulation data, and compared to the actual treatment fields planned
      using x-rays. Coverage of the tumour volume will be assessed, together with doses, field
      sizes and beam positions, to determine relative undercoverage of tumour and overcoverage of
      normal tissue between the two planning methods, if any.
