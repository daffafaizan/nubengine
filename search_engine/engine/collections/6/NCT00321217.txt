      play an important role in its pathogenesis. Genetic factors are also involved in determining
      the prognosis of RA. Identifying the genetic factors that predispose to mild or aggressive RA
      is not easy and up to now only a few of these factors -like certain HLA-DR species- are
      known.

      The Rheumatology department of the Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre (RUNMC) has
      collected a unique inception cohort of over 500 patients with RA, that have been followed
      from an early stage of disease for up to 10 years with detailed measurements of disease
      activity, joint damage and other characteristics of disease progression.

      In this project we use this patient group to study polymorphisms in a large battery of genes
      for their effect on RA disease activity/progression.
