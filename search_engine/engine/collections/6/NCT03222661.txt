      cause of blindness worldwide, affecting 1 in 90 individuals (1). In the US population
      approximately 14 million individuals aged 12 years or older have visual impairment (defined
      as distance visual acuity of 20/50 or worse), of which more than 11 million individuals (2)
      could have their vision improved to 20/40 or better with refractive correction.

      Uncorrected refractive error impacts all aspects of life, including, but not limited to, loss
      of employment opportunities, inability to care for family, and inability to receive an
      education. SVOne is smartphone-based autorefractor, powered by wavefront aberrometry, due to
      its portability and accuracy it presents as an effective and accessible method of detecting
      refractive error and dispensing spectacles for better vision (3).

      In this study, for each patient, a single clinician will determine final prescription through
      manifest refraction, while a different clinician will determine final prescription using
      SVOne exam protocol. Sphere, cylinder and axis will be converted to power vectors and
      compared by linear regression analysis.
