    
      Chronic Fatigue Syndrome/Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME) is a complex medical condition,
      characterized by severe disabling fatigue with no known cause, no established diagnostic
      tests, and no universally effective treatment. No studies have evaluated symptomatic
      treatment using oral melatonin plus zinc supplementation in CFS/ME. The primary endpoint was
      to assess the effect of melatonin plus zinc supplementation on self-reported fatigue.
      Secondary measures included self-reported outcomes of sleep problems, anxiety/depression,
      dysautonomia, QoL and side-effects during treatment.
