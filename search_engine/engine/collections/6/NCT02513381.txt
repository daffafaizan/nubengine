      irregular periods, excessive hair growth on body, acne and cysts in the ovaries. PCOS is also
      associated with increased risk of problems later in life like diabetes, high cholesterol
      levels and heart disease. One of the risk factors for having increased incidence of such
      problems in PCOS patients could be low vitamin D levels as many women with polycystic ovary
      syndrome (PCOS) are vitamin D deficient. Vitamin D supplementation may have a beneficial
      effect on insulin levels and fat around the abdomen. It has been seen in previous research
      studies that low level of vitamin D is related to a greater risk of diabetes and heart
      disease. Low vitamin D levels are also associated with fat in the liver. The amount of fat in
      the liver is a sign of early liver disease. So, in this study the investigators want to
      supplement women having PCOS and vitamin D deficiency with vitamin D (3,200 IU) and examine
      the effects on hormones related to PCOS and risk factors for diabetes and heart disease in
      them.
