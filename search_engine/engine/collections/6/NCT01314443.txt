      (CVD), the rate in which CVD risk is normalized is relatively slow. This suggests a need to
      better define co-therapies that target oxidative stress and inflammatory responses that
      otherwise impair vascular function. In this randomized placebo-controlled clinical study,
      smokers undergoing smoking cessation with or without nicotine replacement therapy will
      receive dietary supplementation of gamma-tocopherol (500 mg/day) or placebo for 7 days. Their
      vascular function and biomarkers of CVD risk (inflammatory proteins, antioxidants, oxidized
      lipids) will be assessed prior to, and at 1 day and 7 days during smoking cessation with and
      without gamma-tocopherol supplementation to define potential mechanisms by which
      gamma-tocopherol may accelerate the restoration of vascular function and assist in reducing
      CVD risk.
