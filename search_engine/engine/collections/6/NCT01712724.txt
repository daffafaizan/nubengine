      Program following Stroke (TRI-REPS) will be randomized to either AT+RT or AT alone. Mobility
      (6 minute walk test), and cognition (Vascular Cognitive Impairment Harmonization Standards)
      will be measured pre- post 6 months of exercise. Secondary measures will include body
      composition, and biochemical changes. This project will help to determine an exercise
      treatment strategy that will guide best practice guidelines aimed at promoting mobility and
      brain health in people post-stroke.
