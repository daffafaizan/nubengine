    
      A single-arm cohort (Cohort A, 40 to 110 patients) will evaluate safety and efficacy of
      margetuximab plus INCMGA00012. In a 4-arm cohort (Cohort B Part 1, 50 patients per arm),
      patients will be randomized to margetuximab plus chemotherapy plus INCMGA00012, margetuximab
      plus chemotherapy plus MGD013, margetuximab plus chemotherapy, or trastuzumab plus
      chemotherapy. A checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) (INCMGA00012 or MGD013) will be selected from
      Cohort B Part 1 and evaluated in a randomized 2-arm cohort (Cohort B Part 2, 250 patients per
      arm) of margetuximab plus chemotherapy plus INCMGA00012 or MGD013, or trastuzumab plus
      chemotherapy.
