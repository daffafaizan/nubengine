    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, ascending single dose of
      rhu-pGelsolin infusion study. Thirteen subjects (10 active and 3 placebo) will be dosed at 3
      mg/kg and 5 subjects (3 active and 2 placebo) will be dosed at 6 mg/kg. In addition,
      twenty-two subjects (18 active and 4 placebo) will be dosed at 6 mg/kg per day for 3 days.
      The Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) and Steering Committee will review the preceding
      dose safety data, and agree the tolerability prior to the enrolment for next higher dose.
      Blood samples will be collected during 1 hour infusion through 72 hours post dose for PK
      assessment after each dose.
