      enrolled at two sites, Duke University in Durham, North Carolina and New York University in
      New York, New York. This is an unblinded, randomized trial to assess the acceptability and
      effectiveness of the oral health intervention among individuals with mild dementia (MD). The
      study will utilize qualitative and quantitative methods to learn about the oral health
      outcomes in individuals with mild dementia.

      The study lasts 6 months. The first three months is the active intervention phase in which
      coaching and educational modules are delivered. The second three months is the maintenance
      period in which no coaching or educational modules are presented to participants. As a team,
      the study coordinator, the oral health evaluator (a dental hygienist), and the
      interventionist will conduct three visits with the participants and their care partners;
      baseline, 3-month (end of the active intervention phase), and 6-month (end of three-month
      maintenance phase).

      The intervention protocol will include three groups; two treatment groups and one control
      group. All participants will receive oral health education material at the baseline visit.
      Treatment Group 1 and Treatment Group 2 will be given a smart electronic toothbrush. Only
      Treatment Group 2 will receive the in-home and telephone coaching throughout the duration of
      the study and will be instructed to record daily brushing habits. The coaching sessions
      include individualized instruction on oral hygiene technique, cueing strategy development, or
      oral hygiene monitoring and coaching. Treatment Group 1 and the Control Group will not
      receive the coaching sessions.
