      increased risk of cardiovascular and renal events. Although erythropoiesis stimulating agent
      (ESA) has been used to correct anemia, use of ESA (hemoglobin level at approximately 13 g/dL)
      did not reduce cardiovascular or renal events in diabetic CKD patients. Subgroup analysis of
      a recent randomized study suggested that use of darbepoetin alfa targeting Hb between 11 and
      13 g/dL may preserve renal function better than targeting Hb between 9 and 11g/dL in
      non-diabetic CKD patients.
