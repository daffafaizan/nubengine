      ability to learn and accomplish selected behavioral goals, with deficiencies in these
      processes found in a range of mental illnesses. The primary goal of this project is to
      evidence potential synergistic benefits on cognitive control processes using a video game
      ("Body-Brain Trainer", or BBT) that integrates cognitive and physical challenges in a
      complimentary fashion. Healthy adults will be recruited for a longitudinal experiment and
      randomly assigned to one of four study groups: 1) BBT, 2) "Brain Training" (BBT played with a
      gamepad controller), 3) "Body Training" (BBT without any cognitive demands), and 4) an
      expectancy matched placebo control group. Individuals will engage in eight weeks of training
      within our Neuroscape Laboratory, with pre- and post-training assessments evaluating
      physical, cognitive, and neural measures. The completion of this project will result in a
      more sophisticated understanding of how the integration of cognitive and physical training
      potentially impacts cognitive control processes, setting the stage for more effective
      interventions for mental illness and learning-related impairments.
