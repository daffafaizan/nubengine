    
      Safety Objectives: 1) To determine preliminary safety, reactogenicity, and tolerability of
      VEE IA/B V3526 in VEE-na√Øve healthy volunteers after single dose subcutaneous (SC)
      administration; 2) To evaluate virological safety by assessing serum viremia and viral
      shedding in nose and throat.

      Immunogenicity Objectives: 1) To assess the humoral immune response (plaque reduction
      neutralizing antibody titer (PRNT)) against VEE subtype IA/B after SC administration of
      different dose-levels of the VEE IA/B V3526 vaccine candidate; 2) To assess duration of
      immune response over six months after the VEE IA/B V3526 vaccination based on PRNT; and 3) To
      identify two suitable VEE IA/B V3526 vaccine dose-levels for future administration in dose
      optimization and expanded safety studies.

      Exploratory Objectives: 1) To collect and store serum for future development of
      immunogenicity assays (e.g., ELISA) against multiple VEE subtypes IA/B, IE, IIIA, and other
      possible subtypes; 2) To collect and store serum for future use in the development of a
      passive transfer challenge model; 3) Collect VEE IA/B V3526 positive serum (Positive Control
      Serum) at the Day 21 visit.
