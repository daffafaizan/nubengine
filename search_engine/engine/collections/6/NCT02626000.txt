      3). In phase 1b talimogene laherparepvec is to be administered in combination with
      pembrolizumab to adults with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck
      (SCCHN). Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) is to be evaluated based on the first 18 DLT-evaluable
      participants. An expansion cohort of up to an additional 22 treated patients could be
      enrolled to further evaluate the safety and to estimate the efficacy of the combination of
      talimogene laherparepvec with pembrolizumab and to support a decision to initiate the phase 3
      part of the study. The phase 3 part of the study is designed as a multicenter, randomized,
      doubleblind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy, as assessed by overall
      survival, of treatment with talimogene laherparepvec with pembrolizumab versus placebo with
      pembrolizumab in adults with recurrent or metastatic SCCHN.
