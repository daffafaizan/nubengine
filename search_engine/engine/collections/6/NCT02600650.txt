      boosting supplement or sham supplement for 4 weeks. The supplement will be administered daily
      in capsule form. The control group will be given a sham capsule containing the carrier
      components of the supplement. Participants will be asked not to modify their current
      lifestyle. Salivary testosterone levels will be assessed prior to the intervention to collect
      a baseline measurement for each subject, and following the intervention to evaluate any
      changes in hormone levels.
