    
      In this study, participants with potential ACS will be randomized to traditional "rule out"
      care (Group A) or to traditional care plus CT coronary angiography (Group B) in a ratio of
      1:2 traditional versus traditional plus CT coronary angiography.

      In Group A, all management and disposition decisions will be made by the healthcare providers
      caring for the participant. Participants will be admitted to hospital, admitted to cardiac
      diagnostic unit, or discharged to home. Diagnostic testing and treatment will be decided by
      the team caring for the participant. Follow up will comprise telephone interviews after 30
      days and 1 year from triage/presentation.

      In Group B, participants will receive initial cardiac troponin and creatinine blood tests.
      Upon return of normal laboratory values, the participants will receive a CT coronary
      angiography an estimated 90 minutes after the initial values assessment or as soon as the CT
      scanner is available. Participants with negative test results will be discharged; follow up
      will comprise telephone interviews after 30 days and 1 year from triage/presentation.
      Participants with positive test results will be admitted to the hospital for further
      management dictated by the admitting team.
