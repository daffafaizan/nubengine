      study to investigate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of eltrombopag in pediatric
      patients with previously treated chronic ITP. In Part 1, patients will be randomized to
      receive eltrombopag or placebo in a 13-week double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment
      period. After completing Part 1, patients will begin Part 2, in which they will receive
      eltrombopag in an open-label manner during a 24-week treatment period.
