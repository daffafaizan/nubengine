      abdominal stretch marks will be confirmed by a board certified dermatologist. The right and
      the left side of the abdomen will be randomized by binary randomization to treatment with CA
      cream or the vehicle cream. Therefore each patient will serve as their own control.

      Each half of the abdomen will be subjected to topical treatment with CA 1% Cream formulated
      in PCCA Lipoderm® base or PCCA Lipoderm® base as the placebo vehicle treatment based on prior
      randomization. The creams will be given to the patient in blinded fashion: Cream A
      (containing CA) and cream B (vehicle/placebo) with instructions apply both formulations daily
      at night.

      Patients will be asked to return to clinic at 6 weeks and 12 weeks for follow up assessment
      for a total of 3 sessions (baseline, 6 weeks, 12 weeks). High-resolution digital photographs
      of the stretch marks will be taken at baseline and at each follow-up visit to document
      clinical response. Two physician graders blinded to the photographs and the treatments will
      assess cosmetic outcome on a six-point analog scale

      The width of the treated stretch marks in each subject will also be measured at the baseline
      and 8 weeks after the final treatment. The difference of the width will be converted into the
      percentage of reduction from the baseline.

      Subjects will also be asked to complete two surveys at each visit. The two surveys include
      patient satisfaction with cosmetic and clinical outcome based on a five-point scale.
