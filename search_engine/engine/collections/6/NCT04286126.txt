      treating OCD; however, many patients show only a partial response, and more than 25% of
      patients show no improvement with these treatments. Repetitive transcranial magnetic
      stimulation (rTMS) is a promising alternative, using powerful, focused magnetic field pulses
      to stimulate target brain areas. So far, at least two stimulation targets have consistent
      evidence of efficacy in OCD: the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) and the orbitofrontal
      cortex (OFC). Patients often show a strong response to one target but not the other. It is
      not well understood why some patients respond, while others do not.

      The investigators previously developed methods for discovering neurophysiological subtypes of
      depression based on resting state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) measures of
      functional connectivity (RSFC) in relevant brain networks; diagnosing them in individual
      patients; and using them to predict individual differences in rTMS response. Subsequently,
      motivated by recent studies characterizing individual variability in the topology of these
      functional networks, the investigators have optimized methods for improving the accuracy of
      these predictions by accounting for individual variability, stabilizing the selection of
      treatment-predictive features, and increasing robustness in replication samples through
      regularization. Here, the investigators propose applying these methods to discover novel
      network-based subtypes of OCD and develop prognostic neuroimaging biomarkers for predicting
      differential treatment response to rTMS targeting the DMPFC or OFC, which could subsequently
      be tested in a randomized clinical trial.
