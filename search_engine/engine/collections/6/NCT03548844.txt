      rectal cancer after neoadjuvant treatment. This radical procedure inevitably has the risk of
      major short and long term morbidity and anorectal function impairment. Additionally,
      abdominal perineal resection(APR) with permanent stoma is still applied to some low rectal
      cancer patients, even though major response had been achieved after neoadjuvant treatment.
      Previous studies have proposed "wait and see" strategy in clinical complete response
      patients. The local recurrence rate is still high due to residue adenocarcinoma lesion.

      Local excision is a conservative alternative approach associated with low mortality and
      morbidity and high quality of life. In this study, the investigators proposed local excision
      in good responders (cT0-1N0) 4-8 weeks after neoadjuvant treatment. Patients with
      pathologically verified complete response (ypT0-1cN0) are randomized to observation (local
      excision group) or complementary rectal excision (total mesorectal excision group). The
      purpose of this prospective randomized controlled study is to compare local excision versus
      total mesorectal excision in pathological complete response (ypT0-1cN0) mid- or low-rectal
      cancer after neoadjuvant therapy.
