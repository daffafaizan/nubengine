      LVA, detected by isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ)-based
      quantitative proteomic analysis, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and Oxidative
      Stress Panel Kit. For clinical correlation, magnetic resonance (MR) volumetry was implemented
      for precise lymphedematous limb volume measurements. Correlations were made between changes
      in oxidative stress, limb volume, and cellulitis before and after LVA.
