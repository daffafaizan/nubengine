    
      Design Ex vivo vibrational spectroscopic analysis of existing stored vulval and lymph node
      tissue samples collected from patients who have undergone treatment for vulval disease.
      Vibrational spectra are to be correlated with consensus histopathology and multivariate
      analysis to be used to evaluate the classification accuracy of vibrational spectroscopy ex
      vivo.

      Aims

        1. To establish vibrational spectral signal characteristics across a range of known vulval
           skin conditions.

        2. To evaluate the ability of vibrational spectroscopic techniques to differentiate
           different vulval skin conditions.

        3. To evaluate the ability of vibrational spectroscopy to detect diseased lymph nodes in
           women who have undergone surgery for vulval cancer.

        4. To further the understanding of biochemical changes in a range of known vulval skin
           conditions.
