      displayed in Figure 1. The Rush IRB has waived consent for this quality improvement trial.
      Data from the EHR will be used beginning December 1, 2019. The first care manager (CM) will
      begin enrolling patients into IntelliCare in September, 2020. Additional CMs will begin using
      IntelliCare at approximately 3 month intervals. In September 2021, support for IntelliCare
      from the evaluation team will be withdrawn, to examine the sustainability of the IntelliCare
      Platform.

      Patients Data from all patients, aged 18 or older, enrolled collaborative care from December
      1, 2019 through August 31, 2022 will be used to evaluate the IntelliCare service. All CCT
      patients who are 18 or older, and have a smartphone will be offered enrollment.
