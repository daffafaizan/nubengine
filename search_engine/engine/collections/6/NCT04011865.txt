      laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (LRP) as determined by the treating surgeon. All
      participants will undergo tests and questionnaires to determine urinary and erectile
      function, biopsies to determine perioperative surgical, functional and oncological outcomes.
      These assessments will be conducted pre-operatively, post-operatively and at certain
      follow-up time points up to 12 months.
