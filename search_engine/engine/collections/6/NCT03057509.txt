      this study intervention.

      Many patients who are diagnosed with carcinoid tumor undergo treatment with long acting
      release (LAR) octreotide. It is presently standard for all patients to receive equal doses of
      octreotide. However, the response to the treatment with the same dose of medication may vary
      substantially from one person to another. This study uses a novel form of PET/MR imaging to
      try and better understand how to treat carcinoid tumors, and may in the future allow doctors
      to tailor treatment dosing based on PET/MR findings and select the right drug dose for an
      individual person. It is important to note that the participant method of treatment and the
      dose of the participant medication (Octreotide LAR) will not change in this study.

      The imaging technique used in this study is called Ga-68-DOTA-TOC PET/MR scanning.
      Ga-68-DOTA-TOC is a radioactive tracer that is given by vein to participants before PET
      scanning. The scanner then detects radioactivity from the tracer that is attached to cells
      within the body and uses this information to create images (pictures) on a computer screen
      that can then be analyzed.

      These types of scans are investigational. "Investigational", meaning that the scans are still
      being studied and that research doctors are trying to find out more about them. It also means
      that the FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved these types of PET scans
      for this type of cancer.
