      asthma is an inflammatory disorder. Consequently, modern pharmacotherapy of asthma provides
      wide use of anti-inflammatory drugs. But asthma also is a paroxysmal disorder: many
      specialists and even some guidelines underline paroxysmal clinical picture of asthma. Besides
      this, according to some authors, neurogenic inflammation may play important role in asthma
      mechanism. It is known that some other neurogenic inflammatory paroxysmal disorders exist,
      and they are migraine and trigeminal neuralgia. Antiepileptic drug phenytoin is very
      effective in therapy of trigeminal neuralgia - more than in 70-80% of cases. Other
      antiepileptic drugs, salts of valproic acid, are effective in the treatment of migraine. If
      bronchial asthma also is paroxysmal inflammatory disease, like migraine and trigeminal
      neuralgia, it is possible that some antiepileptic drugs also are very effective in asthma
      therapy.

      We perform a double-blind, placebo-controlled 3-month trial for evaluation of phenytoin
      efficacy in therapy of bronchial asthma in children. Phenytoin is a well-known, comparatively
      safe and effective antiepileptic drug with low cost. According our previous data, phenytoin
      is effective drug for asthma therapy in adults.

      Comparison: children will receive investigational drug in addition to their usual routine
      antiasthmatic treatment, compared to patients received placebo in addition to their usual
      routine antiasthmatic treatment.
