      ambulances (paramedics) and prehospital EMS physician units. For example, legal conditions
      restrict opioid-based analgesia to physicians. Based on pre-defined standards regional
      emergency dispatch centers deploy both kinds of emergency units.

      In recent years telemedicine emerged as a complementary system in EMS that may provide remote
      medical expertise and sustain or even improve quality of medical treatment on-scene.
      Particularly, based on the results of the projects Med-on-@ix and TemRas (telemedical rescue
      assistance system), emergency telemedical services were gradually implemented in daily
      routine of the EMS of the city of Aachen, Germany.

      In this retrospective study the quality and adverse events of analgesia by telemedically
      supported paramedics shall be compared to conventional treatment by on-scene EMS physicians
      in the EMS of the city of Aachen, Germany.
