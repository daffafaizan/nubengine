      respiratory muscle overloadleading to severe dyspnea. During exercise, the increase in neural
      respiratory drive is notable to match ventilatory demand, correlated with breathlessness.
      Non-Invasive Ventilation may improve neural respiratory drive uncoupling and exercise
      tolerance. The aim of this study will be prove if Non-Invasive Ventilation and High flow
      nasal cannula during exercise reduces neural respiratory drive and improves dyspnea, measured
      with paraesternal electromyography
