      nasopharyngeal carcinoma has not been defined yet. Generally induction chemotherapy is given
      to those patients in order to shrink the tumor volume and facilitate the following radiation
      therapy.However, the standard chemotherapy regimen has not been defined yet.Combination of
      cisplatin and fluracil is the commonly used regimen with tolerable toxicity. Recent studies
      have found that docetaxel has good efficacy on nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients, and
      capecitabine can be safely used instead of fluracil. Thus, in this study, we use the
      combination of Docetaxel+Cisplatin+Xeloda (DCX) to treat locally advanced and metastatic
      nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients, in order to evaluate the efficacy and safety profiles.
