      to inhaled anesthesia in major surgery. The investigators will compare the hemodynamic datas
      which are collected from PiCCO-Technology hemodynamic monitoring and cerebral oxymerty which
      are collected from INVOSâ„¢ Cerebral/Somatic Oximeter.The investigators hypothesize that total
      intravenous anesthesia provide more hemodynamic stability, less extravascular lung water
      index (EVLWI), lower anesthesia cost and fewer postoperative complication.
