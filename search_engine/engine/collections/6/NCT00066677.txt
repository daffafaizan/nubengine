        -  Determine the progression-free survival of patients with previously treated metastatic
           pancreatic adenocarcinoma treated with bevacizumab with or without docetaxel.

        -  Determine the objective response rate and overall survival of patients treated with
           these regimens.

        -  Determine the incidence of thromboembolic events in patients treated with these
           regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment
      arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15 and docetaxel
           IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive bevacizumab as in arm I. In both arms, courses repeat every 28
           days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 46 patients (23 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
