    
      In vertebroplasty a bone cement is injected in one or more fractured vertebra. The indication
      is pain that needs high doses of analgesics.

      The cement is a well known product called poly methyl metacrylate (PMMA) normally used fixate
      joint prosthesis.

      Vertebroplasty is done in local anaesthesia. The treatment was introduced in 1984 in France
      and today thousands of patients have been treated worldwide, but so far no randomized
      controlled trials have been published.
