    
      Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is a common and potentially severe toxicity associated to
      haploidentical peripheral blood (PBSC) hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (Haplo-HSCT),
      which was described previously in the context of immunotherapies for acute lymphoblastic
      leukemia such as chimeric antigen receptor T-cells and blinatumomab.

      CRS is characterized by immune system activation with a high level of circulating
      inflammatory cytokines including IL-6. Haplo-HSCT recipients have a high incidence of
      post-transplant fever, with elevated IL-6 in absence of documented infection. CRS occurs more
      frequently when using PBSC, and severe cases have been associated to delayed engraftment,
      increased transplant-related mortality and lower survival.

      Tocilizumab an IL-6 receptor-targeted monoclonal antibody has been effectively used to treat
      CRS in several scenarios, including Haplo-HSCT. Therefore, there is considerable interest for
      the development of a successful strategy for CRS prevention with tocilizumab, potentially
      eliminating complications. However, it is currently unknown whether the use of this
      monoclonal antibody can adversely affect the outcome of Haplo-HSCT recipients.
