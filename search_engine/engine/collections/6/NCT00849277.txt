      the respiratory tract. The illness is usually self-limiting. Hospitalization and deaths
      mainly occur in high-risk groups (elderly, chronically ill). Response to vaccination is
      subject to high levels of variability due to age, stress, nutritional stage, etc.

      Lactic acid bacteria are naturally commensal bacteria in the small and large intestines.
      These bacteria protect the host against potential pathogens by competitive exclusion and also
      by the production of antibacterial agents known as bacteriocins. It has only been recently
      shown that another mechanism whereby probiotic bacteria may provide a health benefit is by
      modulating immune responses.

      Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota (LcS) is widely consumed in fermented milk products.
      Several studies, in animals as wells as in humans, report on the immunomodulatory functions
      of LcS.

      The aim of this multicentre, randomized, placebo controlled, double blind study (RCT) is to
      assess if probiotic treatment with Lactobacillus casei Shirota improves the protection
      against influenza(-like) infections after vaccination with trivalent influenza vaccine in
      elderly residing in nursing homes.

      Trial endpoints:

        1. Clinical outcome: difference in incidence in upper respiratory tract infections
           (influenza-like illness)

        2. Serological outcome: difference in influenza vaccine specific serum IgG between
           probiotic and control treatment
