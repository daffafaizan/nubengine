      I. Determine the objective response rate in patients with stage IIIB or IV bronchoalveolar
      carcinoma (BAC) or adencarcinoma of the lung with BAC features treated with bortezomib.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the progression-free and overall survival of patients treated with this drug.

      II. Determine the time to disease progression in patients treated with this drug.

      III. Determine predictors of response, based on molecular correlative studies of tumor and
      blood, in patients with treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to prior epidermal
      growth factor receptor inhibitor therapy (yes vs no).

      Patients receive bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds on days 1 and 8. Courses repeat every 21 days
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for survival.
