    
      On arrival in the operating theatre, each patient will undergo a baseline lung ultrasound
      examination.

      The anesthetic technique and monitoring will be standardized. The radial artery will be
      cannulated after induction of anesthesia for blood gas monitoring.

      Lung ultrasound examinations will be performed 5 minutes following induction of general
      anesthesia and 5 minutes after insufflation of the abdomen with carbon dioxide. In the event
      of a desaturation needing an intervention (increase of FiO2 or PEEP), ultrasound imaging will
      be repeated before and after the intervention. Presence of a pneumothorax or endobronchial
      intubation will be assessed during each examination. Fifteen minutes after arrival and
      immediately before discharge from the recovery room, lung ultrasound examinations will also
      be performed.

      FiO2 and vital signs will be recorded at each ultrasound examination. Arterial blood samples
      will be collected simultaneously. Pain rating using the visual analog scale and diaphragmatic
      function will be assessed during the preoperative ultrasound examination and before discharge
      from the recovery room.
