    
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the recommended dose of ibrutinib when
      administered in combination with R-DHAP (rituximab + dexamethasone + cytarabine + cisplatin)
      or with R-DHAOx (rituximab + dexamethasone + cytarabine + oxaliplatin) in patients with
      relapsed or refractory B-cell malignancies eligible for autologous stem cell transplantation
      (ASCT) by assessing the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) observed during the dose escalation part
      of the study. Assessment of the MTD will be performed by the analysis of the dose-limiting
      toxicities (DLTs).
