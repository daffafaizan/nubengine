      Motivation Inventory (IMI).

      Subjects will be randomized at the time they request neuraxial analgesia to one of three
      groups: Group 1: patient controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) with bupivacaine 1mg/mL; Group
      2: PCEA with fentanyl 1 mcg/mL plus bupivacaine 0.8 mg/mL; Group 3: PCEA with fentanyl 2
      mcg/mL plus bupivacaine 0.625 mg/mL. Labor analgesia will be initiated in all groups using
      fentanyl 15 mcg plus bupivacaine 2.5 mg administered intrathecally. A basal infusion rate for
      the PCEA will be set at 8 mL/h with patient administered boluses of 8 mL every 10 minutes and
      a one hour limit of 32 mL. Breakthrough pain in all groups will be managed using
      anesthesiologist administered boluses of bupivacaine 1.25 mg/mL without fentanyl.

      The patient as well as individuals who evaluate the study patient will be blinded to the
      group assignment. Samples of maternal venous blood Â½ teaspoon (2 mls) and cord blood 2ml (1/2
      teaspoon) will be collected after the delivery of the fetus. Blood concentrations of fentanyl
      and bupivacaine will be ascertained using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)
      analysis. Success of breastfeeding using the LATCH assessment tool will be measured by the
      lactation nurses within 24 hrs of delivery. At 6 weeks and at 3 months postpartum, follow-up
      phone calls by the anesthesia service will be made to assess for duration of breastfeeding.
      Also, the patient's obstetrician will be contacted to obtain the patient's Edinburgh
      Postnatal Depression Score to assess for postpartum depression, which may be a variable in
      decreasing breastfeeding success.
