    
      This study aims to compare the effects of extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT) to placebo
      with use of a sham control group on walking distances in subjects with lower limb
      intermittent calf claudication. Extracorporeal shockwave therapy will be applied using the
      PiezoWave2 shockwave system. All applications will be in adherence to the manufacturer's
      instructions and provided by trained staff. The device will be targeted at the gastrocnemius
      muscles of the affected lower leg for several minutes at each treatment session. Participants
      in control group will undergo the identical process as if treatment were being given but with
      the shockwaves not being administered and a sham device alternatively used. Participants will
      have several assessments prior to and after the shockwave treatment in order to quantify the
      effect. Assessments will include Maximum Walking Distance (MWD), Claudication Distance (CD)
      and Quality of life questionnaires.
