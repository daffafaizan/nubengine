      using an optimized stimulation protocol as compared to a placebo stimulation on visual
      attention in the MCI-AD. A two-parallel-group, randomized, placebo-controlled design will be
      used. In addition, the cognitive transfer of tDCS will be evaluated. Repeated tDCS sessions
      will be performed in 10 consecutive sessions (2 weeks: Monday to Friday) over one preselected
      ROI together with ongoing visual attention training. During the stimulation, investigator
      will use the visual matching task. Before the repeated stimulation sessions, participants
      will undergo the neurocognitive examination. Behavioral examinations of the trained and
      untrained tasks (i.e. the transfer tasks) will be performed to assess the baseline
      performance. MRI protocol consisting of T1, T2, FLAIR, and fMRI during the task performance
      (visual matching task), resting state fMRI, and DTI sequences will be acquired before and
      after the whole 10-day stimulation protocol in order to search for active vs. placebo
      tDCS-induced changes in brain activation and resting state functional and structural
      connectivity and to identify neural correlates of behavioral changes. Behavioral assessment
      of the trained task and the transfer task will be repeated immediately after and again at a
      one-month follow-up visit after the end of the last stimulation session
