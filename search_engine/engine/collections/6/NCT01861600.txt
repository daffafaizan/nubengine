      2-palmitic vegetable oil on stool composition and characteristics and to investigate the
      effect of both high 2-palmitic vegetable oil and oligofructose in infant formula on stool
      softness and bacteria. Because some studies demonstrate the benefit of high concentrations of
      a non-digestible carbohydrate in the formula, we will study 2 concentrations of added
      oligofructose.
