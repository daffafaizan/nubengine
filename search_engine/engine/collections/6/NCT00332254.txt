      personal suffering. Injury predisposes to OA even after surgical correction (1, 2).
      Definitive therapy for established OA is lacking and current treatments are increasingly
      questioned with regard to long-term safety. Interleukin-1 is instrumental in OA pathogenesis
      (3-5). Recent studies by Chevalier demonstrated that intra-articular use of IL-1ra was safe
      in patients with established OA (6). We hope to show that IL-1ra will provide symptomatic
      benefit after knee injury as well as decreasing cartilage breakdown.

      The trial will consist of trial administering 150mg of Anakinra, or placebo, within 30 days
      of an acute knee injury that requires surgical repair. We hypothesize that higher IL-1 in
      synovial fluid after injury will predict greater symptomatic response to IL-1ra. Outcome
      measures will be functional and pain assessments at regular intervals before and after
      surgery (7, 8). Cartilage catabolism will be assessed with two primary measures. First we
      will assess degree of chondropathy via direct cartilage visualization and scoring at the time
      of arthroscopic repair (9). Secondly, the impact of IL-1ra on the inflammatory milieu will be
      determined through analysis of serum and synovial fluid cytokine levels and cartilage
      biomarkers at enrollment and again at the time of surgical repair.

      The impetus for this study is based on previous work done in animal models of OA, showing
      prevention of cartilage damage following surgically induced ACL injury (10-12). We believe
      that intra-articular delivery of anakinra within a short time following knee injury will
      improve patient function and pain reporting and will also prevent chondropathy that results
      from injury.
