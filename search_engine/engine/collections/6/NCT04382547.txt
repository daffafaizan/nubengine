      of severe covid-19 associated interstitial pneumonia using allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells.
      The positive outlook for the effectiveness of MSCs is due to the following:

        -  knowledge of the leading role of immunopathogenetic mechanisms in the development of
           acute interstitial lung diseases and the pronounced immunomodulating properties of MSCs;

        -  high tropism of MSCs to lung tissue when administered intravenously;

        -  the ability of MSCs to stimulate tissue regeneration and the effective use of MSCs in
           the treatment of acute damage to the myocardium and kidneys, which will contribute to
           the treatment of multiple organ failure;

        -  positive results of preclinical studies of the method of treatment of viral pneumonia in
           animals, and the first clinical studies in patients.
