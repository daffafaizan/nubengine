      men,although this topic remains unexplored in women.There is evidence suggests that some
      classes of antihypertensive drugs such as diuretics and beta-blockers have more negative
      impact on male sexual function than other classes such as calcium channel blockers(CCBs) and
      angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors(ACEI).Some data suggest that angiotensin Ⅱ
      antagonists（ARBs) not only do not exacerbate sexual function in males,but even improve it.

      Treatment with multiple antihypertensive medications was often necessary to attain
      blood-pressure goals recommended by guidelines.More than two third of patients with 2 or 3
      degree of essential hypertension require combination therapy at the beginning of treatment to
      avoid target organ damage and to minimize the accidence of adverse events.

      CCBs were recommended by both JNC-7 and ESH / ESC 2007 hypertension guidelines as the basic
      for the treatment of hypertension.The purpose of this study is to compare the impacts of
      different CCB-based antihypertensive drugs combination on sexual behavior in both male and
      female patients with essential hypertension,thus provide evidences for physicians to increase
      patients adherence to the treatment regimens beside lowing blood pressure.
