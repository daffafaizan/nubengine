      randomization will be conducted in Assiut University Hospitals and carried on 60 pediatric
      patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery under general anesthesia.

      After induction of general anesthesia and endotracheal intubation, patients in group B and
      group C will be placed in the supine position and transversus abdominis plane block will be
      performed under ultrasound guidance. After skin preparation, the linear ultrasound probe
      connected to a portable ultrasound unit will be placed in the axial plane across the
      mid-axillary line midway between the costal margin and the highest point of iliac crest.
      needle attached to a syringe filled with the Local anesthetic solution will be inserted until
      it reaches the plane between the internal oblique and transversus abdominis muscles.

      After careful aspiration to exclude vascular puncture, injection of bupivacaine will be
      performed leading to separation between the internal oblique and the transversus abdominis
      muscles which will appear as a hypoechoic space on ultrasound. This procedure will be
      repeated on the opposite side .

      Laparoscopic procedure will be started 20 minutes after completion of bilateral transversus
      abdominis plane block and 0.01 mg/kg iv atropine will be given before pneumoperitonem. Intra
      abdominal pressure will be maintained at 10-12 mmHg.

      The use of opioids during the procedure will based on the cardiovascular response to
      stimulation; a heart rate increase of 20% from baseline will be interpreted as insufficient
      analgesia and will be treated with fentanyl in doses of 1mcg / kg.
