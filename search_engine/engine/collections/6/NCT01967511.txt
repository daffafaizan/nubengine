        -  Specific aim 1: To establish a library of fibroblasts, DNA, plasma and serum from
           patients with FMD, SCAD and CvAD and unaffected healthy control subjects.

        -  Specific aim 2: To perform a fully powered cross-tissue systems analysis of the key
           regulatory gene networks and disease drivers underlying FMD, SCAD and CvAD.

        -  Specific aim 3: To cross-compare the molecular and genomic profiles of FMD, SCAD and
           CvAD to establish the degree of biologic similarity among these disorders.
