      I. To determine if the use of navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) in the
      radiation oncology clinic is feasible.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To investigate the relationship of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) dosimetry and lesion
      involvement in the motor tracts identified using nTMS and the presence or absence of motor
      deficits evaluated by objective and subjective measures (Manual Ability Measure [MAM]-20,
      Euroqol [EQ]-5 Dimensional [D]-5 Level [L], and MD Anderson Symptom Inventory [MDASI]-Brain
      Tumor [BT] questionnaires).

      II. To determine if nTMS of contralateral motor tracts provides a viable internal control,
      considering handedness.

      III. To aid in the design of a prospective, randomized clinical trial that will limit
      radiation dose to brain metastases located in close proximity to the motor cortex with the
      goal of improving functional and quality of life outcomes measured by occupational therapy
      tasks and the MAM-20, EQ-5D-5L, and MDASI-BT questionnaires.

      IV. To explore the utility of electroencephalography (EEG) in correlation with nTMS and
      reported functional outcomes measured by occupational therapy tasks and the MAM-20, EQ-5D-5L,
      and MDASI-BT questionnaires.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo nTMS over 1 hour. Patients also perform 4 tasks that test grip and pinch
      strength and the ability to use and feel with their hands for 1 hour.
