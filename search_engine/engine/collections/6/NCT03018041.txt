    
      The study is designed as a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, multi-center trial
      of 174 renal transplant recipients. Patients will be randomized to oral supplementation of
      marine n-3 PUFA 2.5 g / day or control in a 1:1 fashion.

      The primary endpoint is change in estimated glomerular filtration rate after 156 weeks in the
      treatment group compared with the control group. Secondary endpoints include the following
      variables: proteinuria, plasma inflammatory biomarkers, blood pressure, resting heart rate,
      fasting serum glucose / HbA1c, lipid and lipoprotein concentrations, number of graft
      rejections and graft losses, and number of cardiovascular events and deaths.

      Patients from Akershus University Hospital will also participate in a sub-study, where renal
      graft biopsies will be performed to assess the degree of fibrosis and chronic allograft
      damage index (CADI) and markers of fibrosis.
