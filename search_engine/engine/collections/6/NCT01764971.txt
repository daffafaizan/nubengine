    
      -  First identify the presence of cognitive, behavioral and/or minimal neurological deficit
           in patients with chronic ITP and correlate these changes with radiological evidence of
           minimal CNS bleeding.

        -  Second investigate the correlation between these behavioral and/or minimal neurological
           deficits and duration, site and severity of bleeding (a total of 200 patient of
           persistently low platelet count < 20x 10 9 for at least more than one month duration).

        -  The aim is to assess the behavioral changes in chronic ITP patients, and to assess the
           possible relation of such changes to duration and recurrence of very low platelet count
           as well as pattern of bleeding excluding frank intracranial hemorrhage.
