      birth control is recommended (the producers advice two reliable forms) for both men and women
      because ribavirin has teratogenic and/or embryo-lethal effects in animal studies.

      In cases of pregnancies during paternal exposure to peginterferon alpha and ribavirin
      elective termination of the pregnancy is usually recommended. However three cases of births
      after paternal exposure are reported with no birth defects. Cases of abnormalities after
      paternal exposure to ribavirin are lacking.

      Also studies on the influence of ribavirin on sperm in human are lacking.

      The aim of this study is to study the effect of peginterferon alpha and ribavirin on
      spermatozoa in men using these medication.
