      after marketing, with regard to the following clauses under conditions of general clinical
      practice, in compliance with the regulation "Re-examination Guideline of New Drugs".

        1. Serious adverse event/adverse drug reaction

        2. Unexpected adverse event/adverse drug reaction that have not been reflected in the
           approved drug label.

        3. Known adverse drug reaction

        4. Non-serious adverse drug reaction

        5. Other safety and effectiveness information Eraxis was first approved as a new medicine
           on 30 May 2008. As required for any new medication approved by Ministry of Food and Drug
           Safety (MFDS), information on safety and effectiveness of new medication should be
           researched on certain number of subjects taking the drug in the setting of routine
           practice during the initial 6 years after the approval of new drug(until 29 May 2014).

      However, minimal required number of subjects was not met during the original reexamination
      period (30 May 2008 ~ 29 May 2014). Therefore, according to an order from MFDS on 02 Mar
      2015, Eraxis PMS was requested to collect the rest of required subjects by 02 September 2016
      in prospective and retrospective approach.
