      enrollment and overall event rates as defined by heart failure decompensation, heart failure
      hospitalization, death, and ventricular arrhythmic events. The registry will also assess
      clinical outcomes including quality of life (QOL), physical activity habits, and events
      rates, along with device diagnostics such as Activity Log Index and heart rate
