      concentrations of SUBLIVAC FIX Phleum (SP) that includes 3 doses (10,000 AUN/mL; 40,000
      AUN/mL; 80,000 AUN/mL) and placebo to demonstrate a dose response signal and to estimate the
      minimal effective dose of SP. The study will be conducted in the target population of
      seasonal allergic subjects in a fully validated Environmental Exposure Chamber (EEC) system.
      The EEC system is a facility that has temporal uniformity of airborne allergen (pollen)
      exposure to subjects. Use of the EEC ensures exposure to relatively consistent levels of
      allergen. This facility has been used in a number of immunotherapy trials and is an improved
      challenge model of AR compared to the previously used nasal provocation test. Treatment
      duration of this study is extended to 10 months.
