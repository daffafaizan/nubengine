      Medical Center (CCHMC) for delivering anesthesia during an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD).
      Because there is a lack of evidence to delineate the best techniques, pediatric
      anesthesiologists select the technique based on clinical preference and experience. One
      anesthetic technique involves the use of general anesthesia with the placement of an
      endotracheal tube, and maintenance with an inhalation agent, such as sevoflurane (IS). These
      patients may be extubated under deep anesthesia in the operating room, and allowed to awaken
      in the post anesthesia care unit. A similar technique involves the placement of an
      endotracheal tube, and anesthetic maintenance with a continuous infusion of propofol (IP).
      These patients are also extubated under deep anesthesia in the operating room, and allowed to
      awaken in the postoperative care unit. The third technique does not use an endotracheal tube
      and anesthetic maintenance occurs with continuous infusion of propofol with the patient
      breathing oxygen through their natural airway (NA). Our objective in this study is to compare
      outcomes between these three established anesthetic techniques.

      Children in the study will be recruited from Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center
      Operating Room Schedule. They will be cared for in the Operating Rooms and Post Anesthesia
      Care Unit.
