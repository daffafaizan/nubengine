      patient in one nursing interaction.The study was conducted on 80 mechanically ventilated
      adult patients admitted to intensive care units of Alexandria Main University Hospital and
      Damanhour Medical National Institute. The most common procedures provided by nurses in direct
      care for those patients were vital signs measurements, central venous pressure measurement,
      suctioning, feeding, laboratory sampling, general care, repositioning, and administration of
      medications. Physiological parameters measured were end-tidal carbon dioxide using
      capnography, vital signs using bed side monitor, and oxygen saturation using pulse oximeter.
