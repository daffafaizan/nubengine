      mothers by twelve weeks postpartum. Infant feeding, sleep routines, growth, and
      socioemotional and cognitive development can be adversely affected by maternal PPD. These
      negative effects can last into childhood. Previous studies have shown that strong social
      support is protective against PPD. The 2014 Cochrane Review on this topic comments that
      simple, inexpensive interventions to decrease rates of PPD are needed and that interventions
      led by lay-people and done in groups may be helpful to decrease rates of PPD. More recent
      studies focus on interventions for mothers already showing symptoms of postpartum depression,
      not on preventing these symptoms from developing.

      The proposed work is important, because it capitalizes on recommendations for future research
      from the 2014 Cochrane Review on Psychosocial and Psychological Interventions for Preventing
      Postpartum Depression. The proposed work is also innovative, because it involves a preventive
      intervention from lay-people in a group setting, with new moms benefiting from each other. At
      the completion of this project, it is our expectation that mothers in the intervention group
      will have sustained decreased rates of PPD.
