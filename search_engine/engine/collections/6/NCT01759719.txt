      deformation during or after deployment and a biomechanical analysis have suggested increased
      susceptibility for such a complication for the platinum chromium (PtCr) coronary stent
      platforms .

      The aim of this analysis is to assess the incidence of longitudinal stent deformation for
      PtCr stents in a large single centre all-comers population .

      Methods: Quantitative angiographic analysis (QCA) of PtCr stents deployed in consecutive
      all-comers patients treated in our Laboratory from January 2011 to August 2012 will be
      performed by an independent core laboratory. In particular QCA : nominal stent lenght ratio
      will be calculated for every PtCr stent.

      Clinical follow up with data about overall and cardiac mortality, myocardial infarction and
      target vessel revascularization will also be performed.
