    
      This study is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind study to evaluate the efficacy
      and safety of oral ibrexafungerp (formerly "SCY-078") compared to placebo in female subjects
      12 years and older with RVVC. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy
      of oral ibrexafungerp in preventing recurrences of VVC in subjects with RVVC based on
      Clinical Success. Approximately 320 subjects are planned to be enrolled into the study. All
      subjects will receive treatment with oral fluconazole for their acute episode present at
      screening. Subjects who respond to fluconazole for their acute episode will be enrolled in
      the prevention of recurrence phase of the study and randomized to ibrexafungerp or placebo.

      Subjects who fail treatment with fluconazole for their acute episode will be included in a
      nested open label Sub-Study, in which they will be offered one-day oral ibrexafungerp for
      their unresolved acute episode.
