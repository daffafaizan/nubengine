      interoperator variability. VISITAG SURPOINT calculated a marker tag index value by combining
      contact force, power setting, and duration of energy delivered. Use of VISITAG SURPOINT has
      accurately predicted sites of pulmonary vein reconnection and regional changes in late
      gadolinium enhancement (LGE) and T2 (edema) intensity 24 hours post ablation. Prospective use
      of the ablation index improves first pass pulmonary vein isolation and 1-year freedom from
      atrial tachyarrhythmias compared to conventional treatment.

      There remains a paucity of data regarding if ablation guided by index values and VISITAG
      SURPOINT results in durable scar formation in humans in general and compared to conventional
      approaches. In addition, the relative contribution of the components of VISITAG SURPOINT
      impact scar formation in-vivo and across a broad diversity of atrial anatomies. Such data are
      critical in patients that present with various degrees of atrial myopathies, arrhythmia
      substrate, and anatomies.
