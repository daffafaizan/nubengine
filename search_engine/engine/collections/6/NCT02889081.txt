      investigators obtain the data of participants' folic acid and vitamin D supplement intake
      through the questionnaire at 12-14 gestational weeks. And the investigators collect
      participants' blood samples during gestation to directly detect the biological exposure
      levels of folate and vitamin D. In the follow-up, skin barrier function is evaluated at time
      of infant 24-48 hours, 42 days and 6 months. During 6 months from birth, the incidence of AD
      is investigated on offsprings. This cohort study is aimed to (1) clarify the association
      between prenatal key nutrients with offspring AD; (2) assess the role of maternal key
      nutrients in the skin barrier of offsprings. It will be a good evidence for the AD prevention
      and a meaningful protocol to reduce the incidence of AD by its unique design.Univariate and
      multivariate association analyses will be performed to identify risk factors to AD by using
      multivariate logistic regression model.
