      denture cleaning the aim of this study was to evaluate, in vivo, the efficacy of 0.5% sodium
      hypochlorite (NaOCl) as a denture cleanser and its effect on color stability and surface
      roughness of complete dentures. The patients' satisfaction with the denture cleaning method
      was also assessed.
