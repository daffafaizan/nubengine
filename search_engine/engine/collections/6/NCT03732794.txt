    
      The AtriCure CryoICE Ablation System is being studied to ablate cardiac tissue during surgery
      for the treatment of Persistent and Long-standing Persistent atrial fibrillation in open
      concomitant cardiac surgery.

      The effectiveness of the device will be demonstrated by establishing that the device
      effectively eliminates persistent and long-standing persistent atrial fibrillation in a
      clinically significant proportion of treated patients.
