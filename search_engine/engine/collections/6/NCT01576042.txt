      strategy of catheter ablation (n=25) vs. state-of-the-art pharmacologic therapy (n=25). To be
      considered for enrollment in this pilot trial, patients must be at least 18 years of age and
      must have an ICD for a primary or secondary prevention indication, have ≥ 1 documented ICD
      shock or ≥ 3 ATP therapies for VT in the absence of a reversible cause that in the opinion of
      the treating physician requires further therapy and be eligible for both catheter ablation
      and at least 1 antiarrhythmic medication. Patients will be followed at 3 and 6 months and
      their vital status will be determined via a phone call at 12 months. Data on the safety and
      efficacy of therapies used in the pilot study will be collected. Of particular interest are
      adverse events resulting from the catheter ablation procedure and major side effects from
      antiarrhythmic medications.
