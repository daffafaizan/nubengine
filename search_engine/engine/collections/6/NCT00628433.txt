      options available to patients with ulcerative colitis. In preclinical experiments, HE3286 has
      shown activity in animal models of ulcerative colitis. Additionally, HE3286 has shown to have
      anti-inflammatory activity associated with corticosteroids but without the side effects
      associated with corticosteroid use, such as immune suppression and bone loss.
