      Linköping and at Sahlgrenska University Hospital are included and randomized for either
      physical training according to a validated training concept for elderly and cognitive
      impaired patients named HIFE ( High Intensity Functional Exercise) together with a
      standardized written instruction for home training of physical exercises or only a
      standardized written instruction for home training. Goal Attainment Scaling will be used to
      set measurable goals together with the patient. The training will take place in a facility
      where physiotherapists are available either at the two centers or close to the patient´s
      home.Those physiotherapists at the centers responsible for the training will contact and send
      the local physiotherapists a manual and give instructions about the HIFE concept and will
      also stay in contact for the whole intervention i.e. 12 weeks ( one hour two times a week). A
      minimum of 18 out of 24 session will be required.
