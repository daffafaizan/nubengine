      moderate Atopic Dermatitis, and will be conducted on a maximum 25 included subjects.

      The clinical study will include 4 study visits, after inclusion visit, and the maximum
      duration of the study for each subject will be 3 months : Day 1, Day 29, Day 57, Day 85.

      In case of AD flare suspicion, the investigator may recommend a complementary visit. Any
      complementary visit will be confirmed by investigator according to the subject's information:
      photographs and PO-SCORAD sent by the subject. If visit is confirmed, it will be scheduled as
      soon as possible.

      The objectives are:

        -  to collect clinical AD severity data in order to evaluate natural AD evolution with
           clinical and subject's scales, during a three-month period.

        -  to collect non-invasive instrumental AD data on a target area and on adjacent area:
           cutaneous hydration, epidermal barrier conditions and colorimetric parameters on
           cutaneous erythema

        -  to examine clinical and instrumental AD data

        -  to collect illustrative photographs of AD lesions
