      patients with chronic critical limb ischaemia (CLI) are not eligible for revascularization
      procedures, often leaving amputation as the only option. Consequently, exploring new
      strategies for revascularization of ischemic limbs is of major importance. Preclinical
      studies and pioneering clinical trials suggest that administration of bone marrow (BM)
      mononuclear cells (MNC) into ischemic limbs enhances neovascularization, improves tissue
      perfusion and prevents amputation. However, no definite proof is available as the clinical
      studies thus far have been small and lacked double-blinded controls.

      JUVENTAS is a randomized, double-blinded placebo-controlled trial in 109 - 160 patients with
      CLI to investigate the potential clinical effects of repeated intra-arterial infusion of
      BM-MNC in these patients (the exact number of patients to be included cannot be specified in
      advance because of the planned group sequential interim analyses). In addition, it will study
      the functional characteristics of the BM-MNC obtained from CLI patients and relate BM-MNC
      dysfunction to clinical outcome.
