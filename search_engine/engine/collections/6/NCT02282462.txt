    
      This study is a prospective, multi-center randomized clinical trial at 6 sites. Pre-operative
      evaluation and the decision for surgical intervention will proceed as currently performed at
      each center. That is, neither inclusion in nor exclusion from this study will affect the plan
      of care for patients other than the approach to chest tube management, which is determined by
      randomization among 4 methods that are in common clinical use. Each enrolled patient will be
      randomized to either regulated pleural pressure using the Thopaz+ digital chest drainage
      device or unregulated pleural pressure using a traditional system (multi-chambered system
      e.g. Pleur-Evac, Atrium-Maquet or similar device as is routine at each institution) and also
      randomized to either active suction (-20 cm H2O) or passive drainage.
