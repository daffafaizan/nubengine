      PCI. MACEs were defined as cardiac arrest, cardiac rapture, malignant arrhythmia and cardiac
      death. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to demonstrate the
      prognostic value of EOS% in in-hospital MACEs. All patients were divided into 2 groups
      according to the best cut-off EOS% value, including reduced EOS% group and control group. Cox
      regression analyses and KM survival curve were used to calculate the correlated between EOS
      with in-hospital MACEs.
