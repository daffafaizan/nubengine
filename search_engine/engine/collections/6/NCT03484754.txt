    
      Three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies have shown that a single injection
      of OnaBotulinum Toxin A (OnaA) into the corrugator and procerus (frowning muscles) allows for
      a significant decrease in patients with a depressive episode characterized resistant.

      However, the effectiveness of this method of treating depression can not currently be
      considered established.

      The main objective of our study is therefore to evaluate the efficacy of OnaA injections in
      the glabellar zone with a different methodology, using lateral muscle injection orbicularis
      oculi (involved in crow's feet wrinkles). ) as another injection zone in comparison.

      The efficacy will correspond to the number of responders at 6 weeks in the two groups of
      injection.

      This evaluation will be done at 6 weeks, then at 3 months (S12).
