      stimulation surgery, we will measure the electrical activity in the STN during Deep brain
      stimulation surgery, and measure how this activity is changed during administration of
      Dexmedetomidine. We hypothesize that dexmedetomidine does not change the firing rate and
      pattern in the STN.
