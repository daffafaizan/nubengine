      and moxifloxacin) in a 4*4 cross over sequence balanced for first order carry over effect.
      Twelve subjects will be assigned to each sequence (6 males and 6 females). The volunteers
      will be enrolled sequentially by cohort of 8 subjects.

      ECG measurements will be compared with ECG parameters collected after administration of
      placebo (Nacl 0.9%). The test sensitivity will be assessed using a positive control
      (moxifloxacin 400 mg per os) known to induce delays in QT intervals.
