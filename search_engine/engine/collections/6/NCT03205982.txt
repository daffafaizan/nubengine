      suppression through adherence to antiretroviral (ART) therapy is a critical determinant of
      successful transmission prevention and long-term outcomes in HIV-infected patients. However
      only about 25% of persons living with HIV (PLWH) in the US are virally suppressed,
      demonstrating the need for effective interventions that enhance ART adherence. mHealth is a
      tool that has proven useful in supporting behavior change, but most mHealth tools for PLWH
      have not been well-developed or evaluated. Given the dearth of useful and likeable apps, the
      need for improving medication adherence in PLWH, and the great promise of mHealth, the
      investigators propose to build and test a user-centered smartphone app linked to a smart pill
      box targeting ART adherence in PLWH. Self-report of medication adherence is often criticized
      since it typically overestimated adherence especially in unmasked trials. Current adherence
      assessments, such as patient recall, pill counts and pharmacy refill data, typically detect
      missed doses long after they occur. This study will use real-time, wireless monitoring
      strategies via the Wisepill dispenser, for measuring ART adherence.
