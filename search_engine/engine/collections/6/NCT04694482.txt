      PTSD symptoms, as a consequence of the high number of deaths and the restricted measures
      adopted by the Italian Government to stem the spread of the virus.

      The aims of the study are: (1) to investigate potential psychopathological changes over time
      in a sample of patients affected by different psychiatric disorders (schizophrenia, bipolar
      disorder, major depression, anxiety/Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), personality
      disorders); (2) to compare patients and healthy controls in terms of post-traumatic symptoms.

      Outpatients affected by different psychiatric disorders are recruited during their routine
      visits and demographic/clinical variables are collected from their medical records.

      Psychopathological status and PTSD symptoms are retrospectively assessed using specific
      psychometric scales, such as Brief Psychiatry Rating Scale (BPRS), Clinical Global Impression
      (CGI), Disability Scale (DISS), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), Hamilton Depression
      Rating Scale (HAM-D), Montgomery and Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), Young Mania
      Rating Scale (YMRS), Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS), IES-R.

      The assessment is performed over time at three time points: T0 corresponding to the outbreak
      of the pandemic (January-February 2020), T1 which was the lockdown period (March-April 2020)
      and T2 corresponding to the reopening and restarting (May-June 2020).

      Descriptive analyses of the whole sample will be performed. Then, mixed linear regression
      models will be run to investigate the change over time in patients' psychometric scores and
      whether it differs among different diagnostic groups. Moreover, same analyses will be
      performed to compare patients and healthy subjects in terms of change of IES-R scores over
      time.
