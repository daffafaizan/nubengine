      severe sepsis in developed countries. However, in sub-Saharan Africa, simple therapies such
      as IV fluids and early antibiotics are frequently under-utilized. Furthermore, although
      tuberculosis is a common cause of severe sepsis in the region, accurate and timely diagnosis
      of tuberculosis-associated severe sepsis remains elusive.

      The aims of this study are (1) To assess the impact on survival of a simple evidence-based
      protocol for severe sepsis, (2) To evaluate the cost of implementation for a simplified
      severe sepsis protocol (3) To develop a clinical diagnostic score for identifying
      tuberculosis in HIV positive patients with severe sepsis (4) To assess the performance of the
      Xpert TB/RIF rapid PCR system for diagnosing tuberculosis in HIV positive patients with
      severe sepsis.
