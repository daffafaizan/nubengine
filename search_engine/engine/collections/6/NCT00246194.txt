    
      This is a 2-year, prospective (a study in which the patients are identified and then followed
      forward in time for the outcome of the study), multi-center (at multiple sites), longitudinal
      (study that involves repeated observations of the same outcomes in the same people over long
      periods of time), observational study (study in which the investigators/ physicians observe
      the patients and measure their outcomes) in adults with schizophrenia (mental disorder
      characterized by a breakdown of thought processes and by poor emotional responsiveness).
      Physicians will determine the appropriate treatment for their patients, according to their
      usual practice. Patients starting treatment with long-acting risperidone injection (an
      antipsychotic medication) and meeting all the study criteria will be enrolled in the study.
      They will receive a dose of 25, 37.5 or 50 mg of risperidone every 2 weeks by intramuscular
      injection, and continue their treatment for schizophrenia according to usual care by their
      physicians. Patients will be asked questions at baseline and every three months for a period
      of two years to assess: efficacy of the medication, how well the patient is functioning, use
      of healthcare resources (eg, emergency room visits and hospitalizations) patient work status,
      quality of life and patient satisfaction with the medicine. Safety will be monitored
      throughout the study duration of 2 years.
