      is feasible and well tolerated by a group of treatment seeking CUD patients (Aim1). The
      investigators are also hoping to preliminarily determine if a course of rTMS reduces cannabis
      cue-induced craving (Aim2). Additionally the investigators want to preliminarily explore the
      mechanistic underpinnings of any observed effect by collecting functional magnetic resonance
      imaging (fMRI) data during cannabis cue-administration before and after the treatment course
      (Aim 3). These aims will be addressed through an open label study in which 10 treatment
      seeking cannabis use disordered participants will be given 20 sessions of Active excitatory
      rTMS applied to the DLPFC. TMS will be delivered in an accelerated fashion over two weeks (2
      sessions each day, five days each week). TMS will be applied in conjunction with a validated
      two-session Motivational Enhancement Therapy (MET) behavioral intervention.
