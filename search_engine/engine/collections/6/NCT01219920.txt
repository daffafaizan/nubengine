    
      Survival of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer is correlated with the proportion of
      patients who receive all the three active drugs in the course of the disease, but not with
      the proportion of patients who receive any second-line therapy. In a sequential strategy, not
      all patients who progress after first-line chemotherapy are able to receive second-line
      treatment. Moreover, there is a correlation between the response rate to chemotherapy and the
      postchemotherapy radical resection rate of metastases.

      Therefore, a way to improve the outcome of metastatic colorectal cancer patients could be to
      administer a first-line regimen containing the three active agents.
