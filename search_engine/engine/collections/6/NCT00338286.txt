      to the effects of chemotherapy and to chronic disease itself. This is a randomized,
      open-label, multicenter, international study to further examine the safety of the study drug
      used with standard supportive care (i.e., packed RBC transfusions) compared to standard
      supportive care alone, when used to treat anemia associated with chemotherapy. This study
      will be done in subjects with metastatic breast cancer who are being or will be treated with
      first-line chemotherapy with standard dose schedules of taxane monotherapy, or a taxane plus
      trastuzumab, or an anthracycline plus either a taxane or cyclophosphamide. The study
      hypothesis is that epoetin alfa, when used as supportive anemia care, does not increase the
      risk of tumor progression or death. The study treatment will be compared to the control
      treatment by comparing progression-free survival, i.e., the number of months from the date a
      patient is randomized into the trial to the date of the first documented disease progression
      or death. In addition to their chemotherapy, half of the subjects will be assigned to receive
      study drug (epoetin alfa) and half of the subjects will be assigned to standard supportive
      care for anemia. Subjects treated with the study drug will receive standard supportive care
      (packed RBC transfusions) plus 40,000 IU epoetin alfa given subcutaneously once a week until
      4 weeks after the last cycle of chemotherapy or until disease progression, whichever comes
      first.The hypothesis is to test that epoetin alfa, when used as supportive anemia care, is
      non-inferior to control (standard supportive care alone), as measured by progression free
      survival (PFS). Patients treated with the study drug will receive standard supportive care
      (packed red blood cells (RBC) transfusions) plus 40,000 IU epoetin alfa given subcutaneously
      once a week until 4 weeks after the last cycle of chemotherapy or until disease progression,
      whichever comes first. Dose adjustments (dose escalation, dose reduction, dose interruption,
      and dose resumption) of epoetin alfa will be based on hemoglobin (Hb) and confirm to
      prescribing information.
