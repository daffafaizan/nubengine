      effect of rTMS on improvement of freezing of gait (FOG) in people with PD. The primary
      endpoint is the improvement of FOG, and the secondary endpoint is the improvement of motor
      symptoms and cognition. All participants need to complete the informed consent before they
      are enrolled into the trial. Demographic data includes age, sex, medical history, drug
      history, disease duration, modified Hoehn-Yahr stage, and UPDRS score are collected. Gait
      function are evaluated with time up and go (TUG), freezing of gait questionnaire (FOG-Q), and
      Gait-up device analysis before trial starting. Cognitive function including mini-mental state
      examination (MMSE), clocking drawing test, Wechsler memory scale (WMS)-world list test and
      spatial span test, trial making test A and B, category fluency test (animal naming), and beck
      depression inventory-II are tested by trained neuropsychiatrists. Pre-treatment brain image
      examined by magnetic resonance image (MRI) and blood sampling for synapse protein level are
      performed. The participants are then arranged to receive theta burst stimulation for 5 days
      by Magstim RapidÂ® system (Super Rapid 2) equipped with air cooled coil (D70), stimulating on
      supplementary motor area (SMA). After the intervention, post-treatment evaluation including
      gait function, motor symptoms, cognition, brain MRI, and blood sampling will be performed
      again with the same methods at 1 month later. Any adverse event during the trial period will
      also be recorded. The trial is expected to be conducted in Shuang-Ho hospital, Taipei Medical
      University.
