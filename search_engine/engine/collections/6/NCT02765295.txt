      period, eligible patients will be, based on the randomization codes kept in sealed envelopes,
      randomly assigned to two groups.On the basis of usual care [ambroxool (30mg thrice daily), or
      N-acetylcysteine (0.2g thrice daily)/ serrapeptase (10mg thrice daily), or carbocisteine
      (500mg thrice daily) and/or chest physiotherapy (10 min, twice daily)], patients were
      randomized to receive either hydrogen (66.7%, 3L/min, 1 hr twice daily) inhalation or oxygen
      inhalation (3L/min, 1 hr twice daily) via nasal canula for 12 months. A follow-up visit at
      month 3 following end-of-treatment was also scheduled. The primary endpoint was the annual
      frequency of bronchiectasis exacerbations. Hospital visits were scheduled at baseline and
      months 1, 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15, respectively. At 3 months after the end-of-treatment, a
      follow-up visit will be scheduled for all patients.
