      Treatment (GET Living) compared to Typical Pain Management (TPM) in adolescents with chronic
      musculoskeletal pain. Participants will be randomized into GET Living or TPM, and will be
      instructed to not seek new treatments for pain for the duration of the study. Both treatments
      consist of 12 1-hour patient sessions delivered twice a week across 6- weeks and 3
      parent-only sessions.
