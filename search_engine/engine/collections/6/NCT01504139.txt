      various stimulations in the follicular phase and treatment with GnRH antagonist protocol
      followed by GnRHagonist as induction of ovulation. Furthermore the aim is to explore whether
      the luteal phase can be supported with small daily boluses of hCG without the administration
      of exogenous P, while maintaining good reproductive outcome.
