      with pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) is still controversial. Experience is reported from
      consecutive patients ablated with PVI for atrial fibrillation and treated with dabigatran,
      rivaroxaban, or apixaban from Nov 2011 until Dec 2014. Patients paused their NOAC treatment
      for 24 hours before ablation. Patients were routinely followed up after 3 months with a
      standard formular focused on possible adverse events (major bleeding complications or
      thromboembolic events) to NOAC treatment. Adverse events related to the use of NOAC were
      registered during treatment or during 3 months of follow-up.
