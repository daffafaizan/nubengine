      with 100% oxygen. After 5 minutes an PaO2/FiO2 will be calculated and compared with a
      PaO2/FiO2 during ventilation with FiO2 - 30%.

      The patients will be divided in two sections: Section A are the patients with less than 24
      hours mechanical ventilation until weaning start. Section B are the patients with more than
      24 hours until weaning start.

      The patients in every section will be further divided in two groups. Group 1 will be weaned
      starting with a PEEP equal with P mean during BiPAP, Group 2 will be weaned starting with a
      PEEP equal with PEEP during BiPAP.

      Further, the weaning will be conducted after an known algorithm. The differences in the
      oxygenation and decarboxylation will be measured after 30 and 120 Minutes for Group A and
      after 30, 120, 240, 360 Minutes for Group B.
