      year old individual was 4.2% and the individual between 20 to 59 was 19.6% . The genesis and
      perpetuation of Low back pain (LBP) has many underlying factors among which one is proposed
      by Janda's concept of pelvic crossed syndrome. This condition describes a pattern of tight
      and weak muscles around the pelvis. Marked postural deviation is seen such as increased
      lumber lordosis and depending on this lordosis the muscle involvement can be distinguished.
      The center of the gravity is slightly anterior to S1 or S2, which means pelvis position, is
      key to faulty or good alignment.

      Various studies have been done on muscle imbalance Lower crossed syndrome (LCS) using
      Stretching and Muscle energy Technique (MET). Both have shown superior effects when compared
      to other treatment modalities/techniques. However there is paucity of literature on
      effectiveness of stretching and MET in management of LCS.
