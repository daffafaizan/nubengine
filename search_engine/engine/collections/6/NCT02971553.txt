      reliable end-expiratory pressures in a manikin model, even with a high mask leak. Whether
      this PEEP valve provides reliable PEEP in vivo and whether this translates to clinical
      beneficial outcomes remains to be proven.

      The aim is to study whether lung aeration can be improved by adding a device for positive end
      expiratory pressure (PEEP) to better distend the airways in neonates more than 28 weeks
      gestation.
