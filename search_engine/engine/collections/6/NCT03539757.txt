    
      The purpose of this study is to develop noninvasive MRI methods for detecting,
      discriminating, and measuring liver fibrosis and congestion in the adolescent and adult
      Fontan population by correlating quantitative imaging measurements with histopathologic data,
      using a cross-sectional approach.

      Over 5 years, approximately 40 pediatric and adult subjects (approximately 8 subjects per
      year) undergoing clinically-indicated liver biopsy for the evaluation of either 1) focal
      liver lesions/masses, or 2) suspected liver fibrosis/parenchymal disease will be recruited to
      participate in this study. Subjects will undergo research MR imaging within Â±2 weeks of the
      liver biopsy procedure. A variety of MRI biomarkers will be correlated with histopathologic
      data obtained from the clinically indicated liver biopsy.
