      secondary coagulation dysfunction after trauma is special and complex, which has not been
      fully explained, leading to limited treatment and prevention methods. Coagulation disorders
      caused by traumatic brain injury is a systemic manifestation of local injury, which can
      activate platelets and promote platelet aggregation, activate thrombin, and promote the
      production of fibrin, leading to the formation of thrombosis. However, in non-injured areas,
      pro-coagulant molecules from damaged brain tissue reach the body through the broken
      blood-brain barrier, and also activate platelets and thrombin, promoting the formation of
      blood clots. Lipid peroxidation products are closely related to the occurrence of coagulation
      dysfunction. The effects lipid peroxidation products on platelets, thrombin and anticoagulant
      pathways may be a novel mechanism of secondary coagulation dysfunction in traumatic brain
      injury.
