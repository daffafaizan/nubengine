      and drug-naÃ¯ve MDD patients before and after antidepressant treatment. Meanwhile, the current
      study indicated that antidepressants might affect insulin secretion independently of the
      therapeutic effects on MDD. Therapeutic strategies considering both treatment effectiveness
      and glucose-insulin homeostasis in MDD patients are necessary.
