        1. To define the cellular and molecular biomarkers of atopic dermatitis in skin biopsies
           and blood samples from a pre-adolescent pediatric population and correlate it with
           disease severity.

        2. To measure the skin barrier in atopic dermatitis.

        3. To determine quality of life in atopic dermatitis through various questionnaires.

      Objectives for the non-invasive biomarkers sub-study:

        1. Develop a panel of non-invasive biomarkers in tape strips and serum.

        2. Correlate mRNA expression from tape-striped skin with individual markers of severity
           (EASI, SCORAD, pruritus and TEWL).

        3. Correlate mRNA markers in blood with severity scores.

        4. Correlate serum protein markers with severity scores.

        5. Compare biomarkers based on patient age.

        6. Correlate the biomarker candidates from tape strips and blood with the "gold standard"
           set of biomarkers derived from age-matched skin biopsy samples
