      systemic testosterone availability is associated with decreased muscle mass, strength and
      aerobic capacity, decreased bone-mineral density and increased risk of hip fracture, waning
      sexual interest, inpaired spatial cognition and increased risk of visceral obesity, impaired
      glucose tolerance and coronary artery disease. Luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion often fails
      in healthy older individuals. In addition, aging is marked by an acceleration of LH pulse
      frequency, loss of high-amplitude LH pulses and disorderly release of LH and testosterone, as
      measured by the approximate entropy statistic. The mechanisms that underlie such complex
      adaptations are not known, but appear to involve multiple loci of regulatory failure.
