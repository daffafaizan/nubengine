    
      This is a prospective, non-randomized, single center study designed to measure and determine
      the changes in cerebral blood flow in a cohort of single ventricle patients followed across
      all three stages of surgical (Fontan) reconstruction. In addition, cerebral blood flow
      response to hypercarbia will be determined after the first 2 operations as a measure of
      cerebral blood flow reserve and the "intactness" of the cerebral autoregulatory system. MRI
      data from this cohort will be compared with that collected in age-matched healthy children
      and in a cross sectional group of patients who will not necessarily be followed through all
      stages of surgery, but may undergo one or two of the MRI evaluations depending on their stage
      of surgery. Neurological exams and EEGs will be performed. Medical history, cardiac
      catheterization data, where available, will also be collected. Factors such as
      cardiopulmonary bypass time and socioeconomic class will be controlled for.
