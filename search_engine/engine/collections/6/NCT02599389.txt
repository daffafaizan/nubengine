      proportion of patients with in-stent restenosis a 18 months after the intervention of the
      first stenosis reduction): standard balloons would be less effective than active balloons
      themselves less effective than in combination with the excimer laser. Reducing the risk of
      In-Stent Restenosis has major implications for the treatment of patients because it reduces
      the use of arterial bypass or amputation, if unable to perform revascularization.

      Based on these promising results of efficiency, we can hypothesize that the active balloons
      in combination with the Excimer laser would improve the quality of life of patients while
      reducing the cost of their treatment, this compared to only assets balloons. This same
      improvement in quality of life with reduced costs of care would be observed for only assets
      compared to standard balloons. In health economic terms, it is therefore likely that the
      strategy combining assets balloons and Excimer laser is dominant over assets balloons
      themselves dominant over standard balloons.
