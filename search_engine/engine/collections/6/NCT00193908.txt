      measures are often used although there are few controlled trials. Commonly employed agents
      for established reactions have included sorbolene (10% Glycerine), silver sulphadiazine,
      hydrocolloid dressings, topical steroids, salt water or bicarbonate of soda water solution
      bathing and hydrogen peroxide. One trial found that Cavilon No-Sting Barrier film reduced
      Grade 3 skin reaction compared to sorbolene, although this film did not contain any
      moisturising agents.

      General Hypothesis: That in a paired double blind randomised study peak and overall skin
      reactions experienced by post mastectomy breast cancer patients receiving radiotherapy may be
      reduced by Cavilon Durable Barrier Cream (CDBC) compared to Sorbolene.

      Alternative Hypothesis of primary outcome: the frequency of grade 3 or more skin reaction
      will be reduced from 35% to 25% for skin care using sorbolene or CDBC respectively.

      Alternative Hypothesis of secondary outcome: the mean area under the curve (AUC) of total
      skin reaction will be reduced from 9 to 8 for skin care using sorbolene or CDBC respectively.
