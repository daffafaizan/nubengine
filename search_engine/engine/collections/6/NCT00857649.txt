      antagonist. Pre-clinical studies have demonstrated that memantine can decrease the neuronal
      toxicity associated with excessive glutamate release and calcium overload in neurons. Results
      from clinical trials in patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer's Disease (AD) have
      demonstrated memantine's efficacy and safety by showing positive treatment effects on
      cognitive, global and functional decline.

      This 24-week randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre study examines the
      effect of memantine 20 mg, administered once daily, on cognitive and behavioural symptoms in
      outpatients diagnosed with moderate to severe AD and significant psychopathology.
