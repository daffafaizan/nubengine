      symptoms.But HRT has also some disadvantages including breast cancer,cardiovascular disease
      and so on, especially long period of HRT. It makes us to find the non-hormone therapy. So we
      want to investigate the exercise on the effect of climacteric symptoms.Doing exercise is
      helpful for avoiding and treating many disease,including climacteric symptoms.In our previous
      research,we found that playing exercise can treat moderate climacteric symptoms.
