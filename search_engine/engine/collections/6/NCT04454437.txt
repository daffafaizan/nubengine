    
      This is a Phase IIb, single arm, multicenter study of sacituzumab govitecan in locally
      advanced or metastatic TNBC patients who are refractory or relapsing after at least 2 prior
      standard chemotherapy regimens for unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic breast
      cancer, and these regimens will qualify regardless of triple-negative status at the time they
      were given. The primary endpoint of the trial will be the ORR per RECIST v 1.1 by Independent
      Review Committee (IRC) in all treated patients.

      Patients will be treated until progression requiring discontinuation of further treatment,
      unacceptable toxicity, study withdrawal, or death, whichever comes first. Tumor response and
      progression will be assessed using RECIST v 1.1 and assessment by Investigator at the trial
      center will be sufficient for decisions on continuation of treatment. An independent analysis
      of response will also be performed by IRC, but this will not be used to make treatment
      decisions. All patients will visit the Investigator at regular intervals for assessment of
      safety parameters and AEs.
