      stone treatment. Additionally, the treatment choices vary depending on the localization of
      the stone and its dimensions. In the European Urology Association (EUA) guidelines, it states
      the RIRS method can be used to treat stones up to 2 cm in the kidney. Due to RIRS the
      operation and scopy durations and hospital stay have clearly reduced compared to the standard
      treatment of percutaneous nephrolithotomy. However, the high hydrostatic pressure applied to
      the renal pelvis during RIRS may cause unwanted results in the postoperative period such as
      hydronephrosis and loss of renal parenchyma. During the operation, the stone may move during
      deep inspirium and expirium sequences linked to deep ventilation which may lengthen the
      operation and scope durations and brings risks such as perforation during laser lithotripsy
      application. In this study we aimed to apply single lung ventilation during the operation
      (one of the indications for single lung ventilation is to increase surgical view and ease
      manipulation) to minimize renal movement on that side and reduce peroperative and
      postoperative complications.
