      predominantly small vessels with destruction of their walls and subsequent ischemic damage of
      peripheral nerves. Neural damage may or may not coexist with the damage of other organs.
      Examples of conditions associated with VN include diabetes, microscopic polyangiitis,
      eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Churg-Strauss), granulomatosis with
      polyangiitis (Wegener's), rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus and others. VN
      is painful in about 80% of patients of whom 40% suffer from the pain intractable with
      pharmacological therapy. Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) is a noninvasive
      method of modulation of brain plasticity. In this method, series of magnetic stimuli are
      delivered to the cerebral cortex, where they turn to electric current and depolarize
      repetitively the targeted neurons. If the stimulation is repeated during subsequent days it
      is capable to modify the activity of targeted cortical area for weeks or even months and by
      this way to achieve therapeutic effect. rTMS is widely regarded as one of alternative methods
      to alleviate pain associated with various kind of neuropathies. The purpose of this study is
      to compare the effectiveness of analgesic effect of rTMS in vasculitic neuropathy with sham
      stimulation.
