    
      The patients will be divided into 2 groups

      conventional group: The patients who included this group will undergo conventional
      pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) or pylorus preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy (PPPD). We will
      identify and isolate superior mesenteric vein (SMV) before pancreatic resection. The surgeon
      will dissect tissue around superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and uncinate process of pancreas
      along the SMA.

      Experimental group:

      The patients who included this group will undergo PD or PPPD including total pancreatic
      mesopancreas excision and superior mesenteric artery approach. Before pancreatic transection,
      the surgeon will isolate superior mesenteric vein (SMV) and superior mesenteric artery (SMA).
      And the surgeon will dissect nerve plexus and lymph node around SMA. inferior
      pancreaticoduodenal artery (IPDA) and first jejunal artery will be identified and the surgeon
      will ligate according to surgical margin. Anastomosis will be performed as usual manners.

      Postoperative manage is same in two groups. The investigators will compared 2 years
      recurrence free survival rate between conventional and experimental groups.
