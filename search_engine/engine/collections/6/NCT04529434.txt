      diseases and diarrhoeal diseases in children compared with traditional houses. And healthy
      houses are also likely to reduce the incidence of all-cause morbidity incidence, disease
      severity, improve growth and well-being. The primary endpoints will be assessed in children
      under 13 years of age through weekly household visits for three years. All homes will have
      access to basic vector control, such as insecticide treated nets (ITNs). Access to early
      diagnosis and appropriate malaria treatment will be assured. Approximately 2,750 Tanzanians
      living in 550 houses in Mtwara region, of which 110 are new design houses (Star Homes) and
      the remaining 440 traditional African houses will be participating in this study. 330
      children living in the novel design houses and 1320 children in traditional homes will be
      followed for three years for the assessment of malaria, respiratory tract infections and
      diarrhoea. Mosquito density will be assessed from all 550 houses where tent/light trap will
      be used for mosquito catch at night in all study houses. Acceptance of the novel designed
      houses will be assessed using mixed methods. Acceptability surveys will be conducted with 550
      household heads concurrently with in-depth interviews with 30 purposively selected heads of
      the households in the intervention arm. Ten focus group discussions will be conducted each
      comprising 10 heads of households making it to be 100 heads of households.
