    
      This correlative science study will be a minimum risk assessment of tumor and plasma samples
      collected as part of a Phase II clinical trial of RAD001 in patients with HRPC. Prior to
      enrollment or at the time of signing consent in the Phase II trial, patients will be
      approached to participate in the correlative science study. Patients who agree to participate
      will be assigned a separate study number which will be used to identify their molecular,
      genetic, genomic and biomarker assessments using the tumor and plasma samples. Clinical
      outcome results from the accompanying Phase II trial will be used for correlative assessments
      in this study, however, results from this correlative science study will be kept separate
      from the assessments and reporting of the clinical trial.
