      based on a study in press in Leukemia Research. This study demonstrated that there are
      synergistic interactions between cytosine arabinoside and lovastatin against human leukemia
      cell lines. In particular, this synergistic activity was observed in MTT assay. Given that
      there is such synergistic interaction in vitro it is reasonable to determine whether such
      interaction occurs in vivo. The proposed trial thus uses standard doses of HiDAC with
      incrementally increasing dose of lovastatin. This particular trial will follow an accelerated
      titration for lovastatin. The first dose level will be lovastatin at 0.5 mg/kg/day, divided
      into two daily PO doses given Q 12 hours on Days 1 -7 for a total of 14 doses. Doses should
      be rounded to the nearest 20 mg. After each subject reaches day 14, subsequent subjects will
      be treated at incrementally increasing doses that are 1 mg/kg/day, 2 mg/kg/day, 4 mg/kg/day,
      8 mg/kg/day, 12 mg/kg/day, 18 mg/kg/day, and 24 mg/kg/day, with all doses divided into two
      daily PO doses given Q 12 hours on Days 1 - 7 for a total of 14. If MTD is not reached at the
      24 mg/kg/day dose level, further dose escalations will occur with a 33% increase in dose at
      each level, rounded to the nearest 20 mg/kg/day.
