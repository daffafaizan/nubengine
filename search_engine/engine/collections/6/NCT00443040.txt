    
      This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was designed to evaluate the efficacy
      and tolerability of two dose levels of asimadoline on the duration of post-operative ileus in
      subjects undergoing laparoscopic or hand-assisted laparoscopic colon resections. Subjects
      meeting entry criteria were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive either asimadoline 1.0 mg,
      asimadoline 3.0 mg or a placebo. One hundred and fourteen subjects were planned, and in the
      event that a subject was converted from a laparoscopic surgery to an open surgery
      (laparotomy), that subject would be discontinued from the trial and followed for safety only.
      The protocol allowed subjects converted to open procedures to be replaced. The first dose was
      administered approximately 90 minutes pre-operatively, and subsequent dosing was b.i.d. for
      up to 10 post-operative doses. Subjects were dosed with study drug only while in the
      hospital. After discharge, they were followed for an additional 28 days. Total study duration
      for each patient was approximately 5 to 6 weeks.
