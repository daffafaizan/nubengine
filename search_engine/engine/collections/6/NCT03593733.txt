      3 days and complete physical performance recovery may not be achieved. Incomplete recovery
      might result in underperformance and injury. During congested schedules, recovery strategies
      are therefore required to alleviate post-match fatigue, regain performance faster and reduce
      the risk of injury. Recovery from exercise can be an important factor in performance during
      repeated bouts of exercise.

      The strenuous exercise induces muscle cell structural damage, which results in increased
      plasma concentrations of muscle enzymes such as CK and LDH. The efflux of CK and LDH proteins
      from muscle may be attributed to increased permeability of the plasma membrane or
      intramuscular vasculature (or both). Thus, a reduction in these markers has been proposed as
      an indicator of recovery after strenuous exercise that induces muscle damage.
