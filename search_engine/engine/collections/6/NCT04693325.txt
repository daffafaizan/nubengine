      to regain quality of life and health. The number of organs available for transplantation is
      insufficient with a widening gap between supply and demand. Nowadays, centers accept older
      and higher risk donor organs with co-morbidity, often leading to non-function, complications
      and with half of the patients back on dialysis within 15 years. Furthermore, many donor
      kidneys have to be discarded as too damaged and beyond repair. Increasing the quality and
      therefore transplantability of these high-risk donor organs could significantly increase the
      donor kidney pool.

      Using prolonged normothermic perfusion of marginal donor organs, the investigators aim to
      kick start regeneration in the kidney before transplantation, improving function and survival
      long-term. Furthermore, the choice to accept or decline a donor kidney organ is currently
      based on subjective criteria and causes great uncertainty amongst clinicians. There is a dire
      need for tools to aid in decision making and reduce this uncertainty. Biomarkers predictive
      of graft regeneration are lacking. Samples from perfused kidneys and donor recipients will be
      collected and analysed to allow the formulation of a kidney fitness index.
