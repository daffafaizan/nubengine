      ureter stone patient.There was no known well of efficacy of CT for predicting the outcomes in
      ureter stone patient in ED.

      Hypothesis of this study are some findings of non-contrast CT may be helpful to predict the
      clinical outcomes of pain severity (multidose of painkiller), admission and revisit to ED
      within 5 days after discharge. Investigators analyzed multiple variables including age, sex,
      initial clinical findings, and various CT findings to assess their association with outcomes;
      multidose of painkiller in ED, admission at ED and revisit to ED within 5 days.
