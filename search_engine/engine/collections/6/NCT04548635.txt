    
      Subjects will be randomly assigned to either the VR-PAT intervention group or Control group.
      Subjects and caregivers in both groups will perform daily dressing changes (as prescribed by
      their physician) and afterward will answer questions about their pain and any medications
      used. Subjects and caregivers in the intervention group will answer additional questions
      about their experience using the VR-PAT, ease of use, and helpfulness. Surveys will be
      repeated with each dressing changes for one week.
