      replacement therapy clinical trial for SMA Type 1 delivering onasemnogene abeparvovec-xioi.
      Patients will roll over from the parent study into this long-term study for continuous safety
      monitoring for up to 15 years. The last visit of the parent study or early discontinuation
      from the parent study may serve as the visit at which the informed consent form process is
      conducted for the AVXS 101-LT-001 long term follow-up safety study. Patients will return
      annually for follow up study visits for five (5) years, and then will be contacted via phone
      annually for ten (10) years. Additionally, patient record transfers from their local
      physician and/or neurologist will be requested in conjunction with the annual study visits
      and phone contacts for review by the investigator.

      If the patient is unable to return to the original investigative site, the sponsor will
      arrange with the patients' local established physician to serve as an additional investigator
      to conduct the required assessments.
