    
      This is a prospective, observational, post-marketing safety surveillance registry of UC
      participants treated with Remicade or another standard therapy. Registry centers are targeted
      to enroll a total of 2000 participants (1000 Remicade participants and 1000 standard therapy
      participants) and to follow them for a period of up to 5 years. Participants who started the
      registry on standard therapy may switch over to Remicade.
