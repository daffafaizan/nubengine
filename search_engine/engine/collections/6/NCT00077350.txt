    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the antitumor response rate (by tumor measurement per the RECIST criteria) in
      patients taking this combination in the setting of second line treatment for NSCLC.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the rate of stable disease, time to treatment progression, duration of
      response, and survival of patients taking this combination treatment.

      II. To estimate the safety and tolerability of this combination in this phase II trial of
      patients with relapsed NSCLC.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the potential effects of MDR polymorphisms in patients taking Triapine® in
      this combination.

      II. To evaluate the effect of Triapine® and gemcitabine on RRM1, RRM2, and p53R2 protein
      expression per IHC and gene expression per RT-PCR from baseline diagnostic paraffin embedded
      blocks.

      III. To evaluate both germline (peripheral blood) and tumor DNA for the presence of p53
      mutations.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive 3-AP (Triapine^®) IV over 2 hours and gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days
      1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed for up to 1.5 years.
