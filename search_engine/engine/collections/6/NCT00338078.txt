      failure but it is unknown whether quality of life and heart function also improve. We aim to
      test whether the quality of life, exercise capacity and heart function are improved with
      nocturnal oxygen therapy during 6 weeks with nocturnal oxygen from oxygen concentrator or
      nocturnal air from placebo concentrator.
