    
      This cohort study is designed on the basis of Body Age tests, executed by a private Danish
      health care company in the period from 2010 to 2013.

      The dataset comprises pre- and post Body Age tests from >4000 individuals. They used a
      standardised protocol and educated staff ( physiotherapists or with a degree in sports
      science) to carry out the tests. Body Age tests apply biometrics, fitness level and health
      status data of the employee. The test results are characterized by a Body Age score, which
      defines the employee's biological age (in years).

      This design categorises as a register study why The Danish National Committee is not applied
      for.
