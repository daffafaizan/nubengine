      optimizes resolution of the bowel wall and contents. Traditionally, high-attenuation oral
      Contrast material in the form of iodine solutions or barium suspensions has been used to
      obtain bowel distension in MDCT examinations

      Traditional high-contrast oral agents like iodine solutions, and barium suspensions which due
      to overcorrection problems in PET-CT interpretation lowers the accuracy of diagnosis.
      Negative oral contrast agents like water, air, fat containing agents used with 12.5% corn oil
      and polyethylene glycol has been used in radiological studies. Milk with 4% fat content has
      also been tested out in radiological studies and found to be effective. As it is more easily
      available, palatable, and acceptable especially, by children it needed to be tested in the
      visualization of the GIT in the PET-CT studies compared to other negative contrast agents.
