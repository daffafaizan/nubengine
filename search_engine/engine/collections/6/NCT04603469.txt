      particularly relevant for children with developmental delays as to avoid placement of an IV
      while awake. However, children with Down Syndrome experience bradycardia with induction of
      anesthesia using sevoflurane. It is unknown if this bradycardia is isolate or results in
      hypotension, thus requiring treatment. Isolate bradycardia without hypotension does not
      require treatment and should be avoided as many of these patients have underlying cardiac
      anomalies.
