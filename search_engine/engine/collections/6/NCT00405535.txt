      the best of currently available treatments. Some evidence suggests the the neurotransmitter
      glutamate may be a useful target for new treatments for OCD. The amino acid glycine, if given
      orally in adequate dosages, can have specific effects on one particular glutamate receptor
      molecule in the brain, that might be helpful with OC symptoms. This randomized, double-blind
      protocol will have study participants who suffer with OCD take either a glycine preparation
      or placebo for 12 weeks. Clinical measures (e.g., Y-BOCS, NIMH-OC) will be recorded at each
      visit to determine whether those taking the glycine experience clinical benefit.
