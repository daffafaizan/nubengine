      carotid artery (ICA) occlusion have an annual risk of 5-8% of recurrent ischemic stroke.
      While in China, the incidence of middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion is higher than in
      western countries. The annual risk of recurrent ischemic stroke in patients with symptomatic
      ICA or MCA occlusion has not improved over the years. The proportion of recurrence that was
      minor disabling was rather high.
