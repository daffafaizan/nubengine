      The reactive hyperemia peripheral arterial tonometry index (RHI) was measured before coronary
      angiography and coronary lesions were assessed angiographically by SYNTAX Scoring system. The
      investigators all subjects and examined the occurrence of cardiovascular events (CV death,
      non-fatal myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke, unstable angina pectoris,
      hospitalization for HF, coronary revascularization, or non-fatal aortic and peripheral
      vascular disease).
