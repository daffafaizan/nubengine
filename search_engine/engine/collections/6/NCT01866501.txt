      proximal humerus IO insertion site to determine if one technique resulted in more consistent
      successful placement of the IO needle set with a higher level of confidence among device
      operators performing the techniques. Results suggest that a combination of the best features
      of the 4 techniques may lead to optimal IO needle set placement more consistently. This study
      is needed to validate the "Blended" proximal humerus IO insertion technique to confirm that
      use of the technique results in proper site identification among device operators and results
      in increased confidence.To most closely evaluate the Blended proximal humerus insertion
      technique and how it is received by clinicians who perform these procedures in actual
      patients, device operators will include licensed/certified clinicians including, emergency
      medicine technicians/paramedics and nurses.
