      convenience sample of patients presenting to the adult or pediatric ED with a chief complaint
      of headache. Subjects will only be enrolled when a physician or research assistant who is
      familiar with the study protocol is available to enroll patients. Written, informed consent
      will be obtained from each patient. Consent will include a discussion of the risks and
      benefits. In addition to parental informed consent in the pediatric population, age
      appropriate verbal assent will be obtained from pediatric subjects. After 30 minutes, the
      treating provider will be permitted to administer a "rescue medication" of their choice for
      further treatment. If there is an untoward event that requires the patient to know which IVF
      dose was administered, patient will unblinded and will not continue in the study.
