      muscles, significant loss of trunk position sense, insufficient pressure control center while
      sitting, decreased trunk performance, and trunk asymmetry during walking. It has been
      reported that trunk function with balance and walking ability in stroke patients is a useful
      determinant of daily life activities, balance and walking ability. Balance disorders may be
      the result of changes in the sensory and integrative aspects of motor control. In the
      subacute phase, more than 80% of the subjects who have had stroke for the first time have an
      imbalance in their balance. After a stroke, upper motor neuron damage can cause
      unconditioned. This results in physical inactivity and decreased cardiorespiratory fitness.
      Respiratory muscle weakness and changes in thoraco-abdominal motion may be associated with a
      decrease in tidal volume and lower exercise tolerance.
