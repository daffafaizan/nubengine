      results in immediate increases in time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA)
      compared to a minimal educational intervention.A sample of 43 overweight adults 35 to 64
      years of age participated in a one week pedometer-based feasibility trial monitored by
      accelerometry. Participants were randomized into a one-week education-only group or a group
      that also wore a pedometer. Accelerometer-measured MVPA was measured over 7 days at baseline
      and post-intervention.
