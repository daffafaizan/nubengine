      associated with pregnancy may be particularly hazardous for both mother and fetus in a subset
      of these patients. The period of greatest risk is peripartum while these patients are under
      the care of the obstetrician and anesthesiologist. Exposing a compromised patient to general
      anesthesia is further complicated by the cardiovascular stress response to intubation and
      surgery, the cardiorespiratory implications of mechanical ventilation, the cardiac depression
      and vasodilation from general anesthetics, residual post-operative respiratory depression
      from general anesthetics and narcotics and the stress of weaning from mechanical ventilation
      and post-operative pain.

      In the Adult Congenital Heart Program, obstetric patients are followed the by a specialized
      team of cardiologists, obstetricians and anesthesiologists who also follow all pregnant women
      referred with acquired cardiac disease. From this referral practice approximately 100
      patients per year are now followed during their pregnancy and delivery. In conjunction with
      the ongoing system we intend to identify all parturients who delivered at the University
      Health Network (Toronto General Hospital) or Mount Sinai Hospital between the years 1986 and
      2001. We will evaluate the anesthetic management of all women with heart disease whose
      pregnancies were followed at the University Health Network and/or Mount Sinai Hospital
      between 1986 and 2001.
