    
      Approximately 700 reproductive age women (18-45) with an Etonogestrel (ENG) contraceptive
      implant in place for more than 1 year will be enrolled. Participants will undergo a blood
      draw for measurement of ENG concentration (serum) and genotyping (whole blood) and complete a
      questionnaire regarding their demographics and contraceptive, gynecological, and obstetrical
      history. The research investigators will also consent participants for use of their genetic
      samples and clinical data in future unspecified research.

      The serum samples will be de-identified for ENG analysis, which will be done using a liquid
      chromatography-mass spectrometry method. Additional whole blood samples collected at the
      enrollment visit will undergo DNA extraction. A candidate gene study was conducted using the
      first 350 participants. The research investigators selected 120 genetic variants for 14
      target genes involved in progestin metabolism, regulation, and function for this candidate
      gene study. A Genome Wide Association Study will be performed using all 700 participants.
      Genotyping will be performed using a custom MultiEthnic Global Array chip through the
      Colorado Center for Personalized Medicine.
