      neuropsychological, brain, cardiac, and pulmonary evaluations for this very well
      characterized cohort of subjects. Measures of spleen and renal function and markers of DNA
      damage will continue to be collected. Assessment of other target organs in sickle cell
      disease including pulmonary and cardiac function will be performed in addition to evaluation
      of developmental aspects of sickle cell disease (SCD) and potential HU toxicity.
