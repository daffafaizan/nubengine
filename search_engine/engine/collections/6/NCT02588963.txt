    
      Randomized controlled clinical trial including children up-to 3 years-old who attend daycare
      centres in O Porto.

      To evaluate the Primary Prevention of Respiratory infections it was created and ministered to
      children's caregivers an education health session, regarding the prevention of respiratory
      infections of children, according to caregivers needs.

      It is known that parental perceptions influence their behaviour in respect to the care of
      their unwell child. Sometimes misunderstandings occurred because parents' expressions of
      concern or requests for additional information were sometimes perceived as a challenge to the
      clinicians' diagnosis or treatment decision, which leads to unnecessary and unwanted
      prescribing of antibiotics. Health professionals should provide consistent information that
      promotes parental self-efficacy in the care of their unwell child.

      To evaluate the Secondary Prevention of Respiratory Infections it was applied to children
      with signs of upper respiratory infections (rhinorrhea, cough and nasal obstruction) a nasal
      clearance protocol, developed by Guy Postiaux. This protocol consists on the application of
      physiological serum in the nostrils of the child, followed by forced nasal inspiration. The
      protocol is applied for 3 consecutive days, according to established criteria suggested by
      Postiaux. This intervention is indicated on Upper Respiratory Infections, such as rhinitis or
      rhinopharyngitis, with large amount of secretions in the upper airway and it is an effective
      adjuvant for medication. Forced nasal inspiration is able to create sufficient gas velocity
      to act on the pressure of the middle ear, through the eustachian tube, and may have an
      important role in the prevention of otitis.
