      Nursing Home Vision-Specific Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) instrument, and; 2.) to
      evaluate the responsiveness of this instrument. Responsiveness will be assessed in two
      independent preliminary prospective intervention evaluations. The first responsiveness
      evaluation will involve a new spectacle intervention and the second will involve first eye
      cataract surgery. In addition, we will examine the association between the responsiveness of
      this instrument, and changes in visual functioning measures and other demographic variables.
