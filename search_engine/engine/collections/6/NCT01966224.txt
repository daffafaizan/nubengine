    
      A further safety assessment of the JRC sensitive and non-sensitive subjects who were in Group
      1, 2 and 3 of the Phase 1A study will be further assessed in terms of current skin test
      reactivity, re-vaccination safety and continued safety.

      Group 1: will receive 2 mg CryJ2-DNA-LAMP plasmid vaccine by intramuscular (IM) injection.
      The dosing regimen for this group will be to receive one (1) booster dose. This group will be
      followed for 80 days (+/- 10), assessing skin reactivity and immune response.

      Group 2: will receive 2 mg CryJ2-DNA-LAMP plasmid vaccine by intramuscular (IM) injection.
      The dosing regimen for this group will be to receive one (1) booster dose. This group will be
      followed for 80 days (+/- 10), assessing skin reactivity and immune response.

      Group 3: will receive 2 mg CryJ2-DNA-LAMP plasmid vaccine by intramuscular (IM) injection.
      The dosing regimen for this group will be to receive one (1) booster dose. This group will be
      followed for 80 days (+/- 10), assessing skin reactivity and immune response.
