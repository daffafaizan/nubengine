      with oral antidiabetics, excluding the insulinized patients. They will then be randomly
      assigned by cluster, to the intervention group (individual education) or control (usual care)
      in the context of each health center participating in the project. After randomization
      centers, all professionals who decide to cooperate receive a training process on methodology
      for measuring results (clinical and questionnaire variables), while assigned to the
      experimental intervention, will also receive training on how to carry out the program of
      diabetologic education proposed. The follow-up period for both groups is 18 months obtained
      as clinical determinations: glycosylated hemoglobin (metabolic control), blood pressure,
      lipid profile, smoking and BMI; and as results reported by the patient through
      questionnaires: quality of life related to health, level of physical activity performed or
      adherence to the Mediterranean diet.
