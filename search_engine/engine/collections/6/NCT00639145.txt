      transmission of HIV-1, some questions remain regarding the safety of these therapies and
      their potential impact on the uninfected infant.

      The overall goal of the project is to establish a voluntary exposure-registry and perform
      observational surveillance on HIV - positive pregnant women who are exposed to antiretroviral
      products during the prenatal period, in order to evaluate the outcome of the pregnancy and
      safety of the products in HIV-positive pregnant women, and their infants.
