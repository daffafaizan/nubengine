      control intervention (modified DEF). Hypotheses relate to parent and child outcomes
      associated with the intervention. Hypothesis 1: Compared to mothers who receive the control
      intervention, mothers who receive the mABC intervention will show more nurturing and
      sensitive parenting, enhanced neural activity during parenting-relevant tasks, and more
      normative patterns of DNA methylation, autonomic nervous system activity, and cortisol
      production. Hypothesis 2: Compared to infants of mothers who receive the control
      intervention, infants of mothers who receive the mABC intervention will show more organized
      and secure attachment patterns, better behavioral regulation during stressors, more advanced
      social-emotional development, and more normative patterns of DNA methylation, autonomic
      nervous system activity, and cortisol production. Hypothesis 3: Enhanced maternal sensitivity
      will mediate effects of the mABC intervention on improved infant outcomes.
