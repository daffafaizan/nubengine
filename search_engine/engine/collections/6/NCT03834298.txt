    
      This is an adult and pediatric prospective, longitudinal study in which we will measure
      symptoms, QOL and inflammation at baseline and again at 2, 4 and 6 weeks after starting stand
      of care (SOC) four food elimination diet (FFED) (Aim 1). Newly or previously diagnosed
      patients with EoE with active disease who will be undergoing SOC FFED will be offered entry
      into the study by the PI's or their local co-investigators at each of their institutions. EoE
      patients who are in remission on SOC FFED from Aim 1 will be recruited to participate in this
      food reintroduction trial in Aim 2. Eligible subjects will undergo SOC sequential food
      reintroductions and during the food introduction, ESTs will be performed at 2 and 4 week
      intervals during a clinic visit. If inflammation is detected by the EST, this food will be
      eliminated from the diet for six weeks and a repeat EST will be administered at this time to
      assess inflammation. If inflammation has resolved based on EST results, food reintroduction
      will resume. If no inflammation is detected by the EST at the 4 week interval, a new food
      will be added. EST will be performed after each food reintroduction as outlined above. Based
      on known allergenic properties of these foods, the order of food reintroduction will be soy,
      eggs, wheat and milk.
