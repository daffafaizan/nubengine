      25 years. The physiopathology involves a failure in the negative regulatory mechanisms of the
      inflammatory responses in the intestines, along with an excessive production of TNF-α by
      T-lymphocytes and macrophages of the lamina propria.

      Anti-TNF-α antibodies usually give good therapeutic results, in particular in patients who
      are resistent or dependant on steroids. Nevertheless, in Crohn disease, the destructive
      T-lymphocytes - macrophage interactions, their inhibition by anti-TNFα, and the impact of
      these antibodies on cellular signaling remain largely unknown.

      Two groups of 10 patients with active Crohn disease, with or without azathioprine, and
      requiring the start of anti-TNF treatment are included in this study. Rectosigmoïdal biopsies
      and blood tests will be done before starting the treatment and after 10 weeks of treatment.
      Surface antigens, cytokines and cellular molecules and the number of apoptotic cells will be
      analyzed by FACS, and the quantification of RNA will be analyzed by RT-PCR.

      This will therefore enable us to study, before and after anti-TNF-α, in patients treated or
      not with azathioprine, on intestinal and blood lymphocytes, the production of cytokines
      involved in the lymphocyte-macrophage interaction, and the potential role of regulatory T
      cells.
