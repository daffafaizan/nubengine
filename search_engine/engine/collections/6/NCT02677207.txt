    
      To evaluate the effects of the nicotinic allosteric modulator JNJ-39393406 on psychometric
      performance and residual depressive symptoms in patients who have been diagnosed with
      unipolar and bipolar depression but currently DO NOT meet criteria for an episode of Major
      Depression or Manic Episode.

      Hypothesis: Allosteric modulation of the a7nAChR with JNJ-39393406 improves psychometric
      performance and residual depressive symptoms in patients with unipolar major depression
      disorder (MDD) or bipolar depression (BPD).

      Outcome measurements:

        -  BACS

        -  MADRS
