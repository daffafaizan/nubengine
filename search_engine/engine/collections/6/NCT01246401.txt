      among HIV+ persons in jails and prisons meeting DSM-IV criteria for opioid dependence who are
      transitioning to the community. HIV treatment outcomes (HIV-1 RNA levels, CD4 count, Highly
      Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) adherence, retention in care), substance abuse (time to
      relapse to opioid use, % opioid negative urines, opioid craving), adverse side effects and
      HIV risk behavior (sexual and drug-related risks) outcomes will be compared in 150 recruited
      prisoners and jail detainees in Connecticut (CT) and Massachusetts (MA) who will be
      randomized 2:1 to either XR-NTX or placebo. The primary outcome of interest will be the
      proportion with a HIV-RNA <400 copies/mL at 6 months. Secondary outcomes include mean CD4
      count, antiretroviral adherence, retention on HAART and in HIV care, HIV risk behaviors,
      time-to-relapse to opioid use, percent opioid negative urines, retention on d-NTX and HIV
      quality of life. Primary and secondary outcomes will be assessed for an additional 6 months
      after completion of the intervention. If this placebo-controlled trial of XR-NTX among
      released HIV+ criminal justice system (CJS) persons with opioid dependence demonstrates
      efficacy and safety, it is likely to become an evidence-based intervention to intervene with
      this extremely marginalized population in a way that will meet Healthy People 2010's goals to
      increase the quality and years of life, decrease health disparities particularly among
      minorities, break the cycle of addiction, reduce the numbers of people within the CJS and
      launch a number of new and innovative trials and second generation questions for future
      research. As such, the individual, our health care system and society have a high likelihood
      to benefit. This will not only be true for strategies here in the U.S., but may have even
      greater application for geographic areas where the interface between opioid disorders and HIV
      is even greater.
