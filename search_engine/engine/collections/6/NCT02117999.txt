      irregular astigmatism and corneal opacity. This disorder typically begins during the second
      decade of life and, in severe forms, may need a corneal transplantation. Corneal
      cross-linking with riboflavin and UV-A is a procedure intended to halt keratoconus
      progression. It generates additional chemical bonds between stromal proteins in order to
      stiffen the corneal tissue. Standard CL includes epithelial removal and stroma soaking with
      dextran-enriched 0.1% riboflavin solution for 30 minutes before being exposed to
      ultraviolet-A radiation using a 3mW/cm2 lamp for 30 minutes.

      Epithelial debridement exposes the cornea to a risk of side effects, such as pain for the
      first two post-operative days, temporary loss of visual acuity during the first three months,
      and serious complications, such as infection and stromal opacity due to corneal scarring.

      Iontophoresis is a non invasive technique in which a weak electric current is used to enhance
      the penetration of hypotonic 0.1% riboflavin-5-phosphate solution into the corneal stroma
      through the intact epithelium. After iontophoresis, the corneal tissue is irradiated using a
      10 mW/cm2 for 9 minutes (T-ionto CL). From previous experimental work (Lombardo M. et al.
      JCRS 2014 and JCRS 2015), the investigators provided evidence that T-ionto CL increases the
      stiffness of human corneas with results almost comparable with standard CL. The new procedure
      holds the promise to be as effective as the standard procedure while minimizing all the
      related risks. It is object of the present clinical trial to randomize patients with
      progressive keratoconus to T-ionto CL and standard CL and compare efficacy and safety of
      treatments.
