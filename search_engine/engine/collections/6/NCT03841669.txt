      -Brain hypothesis: Exercise -induced changes in peripheral markers of cardiovascular health
      (e.g., cardiorespiratory fitness, peripheral vascular function) will precede and partly
      explain (statistically mediate) some of the exercise -induced changes in functional and
      structural features of areas defining visceral control circuits. (1B) Brain- to -Body
      hypothesis: Exercise -induced changes in functional and structural features of areas defining
      visceral control circuits precede and partly explain (statistically mediate) consequent
      changes in autonomic and neuroendocrine mediators of cardiovascular function that are under
      neural regulation, including baro-reflex sensitivity and heart rate variability. Aim 2: To
      determine the neurobiology of exercise self--reported correlates of cardiovascular function:
      (2A) Exercise will induce changes in visceral control areas engaged by functional magnetic
      resonance imaging (fMRI) tasks, and these changes will partly explain exercise- induced
      reductions in cardiovascular responsivity to challenges in daily life. (2B) Exercise will
      induce changes in visceral control areas engaged by an functional magnetic resonance imaging
      (fMRI) emotion processing and regulation paradigm, and these changes will partly explain
      exercise- induced improvements in affect measured in daily life by EMA and by conventional
      self- report instruments. The public health significance of this research is that it is
      designed to more precisely define and refine neurobiological targets to improve
      cardiovascular function and health.
