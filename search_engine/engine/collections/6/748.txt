an electron microscopic study of developing gallbladder epithelium in the rabbitthe gall bladder epithelium of theadult rabbit consists of two types of cells.the first and more common type shows features associated with absorption,notably microvilli, limited pinocytosis, some lysosomes and an elaboration ofthe lateral cell membrane and intercellular spaces.  the mitochondria areconcentrated in a subapical band.the second and more infrequent type is a dark rod-shaped cell of unknownfunction but which may be a dehydrated epithelial cell.foetal epithelial cells lack the functional adult characteristics; the mito-chondria are uniformly distributed.  in addition they display basal granulesand apical apocrine bullae.epithelial cell damage and white cell infiltration occurs between 24 daysafter birth or just after.just before birth some epithelial cells are very large and pale with smoothoutlines, others are more dense and display vigorous pinocytosis.adult characteristics are acquired at or immediately after birth and pino-cytosis subsides.  it is believed that water resorption occurs before thefunctional changes which allow continuous passage of water into thecirculation.
