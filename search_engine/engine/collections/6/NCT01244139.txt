      another protein called LINGO-1. It is believed that LINGO-1 is one of the reasons why nerves
      in the brain of patients with MS do not repair well. It is thought BIIB033 may improve MS by
      repairing damaged nerve tissue. LINGO-1 is also present in the brain of healthy people.

      Subjects will take part in the 215MS101 study for up to 28 weeks. This includes a 4-week
      screening period, a 2 week treatment period in which 2 doses of BIIB033 are given, and a
      post-dosing safety follow up period of up to 22 weeks (depending on dose cohort).

      The study tests vary at each of the individual visits and may include:

      medical history evaluation, height and weight assessment, physical examination, neurological
      examination, vital signs assessment (pulse, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and
      temperature), MS performance score, electrocardiogram, cardiac monitoring, routine blood and
      urine tests, drug concentration testing of the blood, hepatitis and HIV tests, blood clotting
      tests, brain MRI scan, lumbar puncture, and drugs of abuse screen and pregnancy test.
