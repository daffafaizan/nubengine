      being developed as an irrigation solution during intracameral lens replacement surgical
      procedures of the eye. OMS302 irrigation solution may induce and maintain an adequately
      dilated pupil and reduce postoperative symptoms of discomfort such as eye pain and
      irritation. The use of OMS302 irrigation solution may eliminate the need for pre-operative
      dilation of the eye and could reduce the postoperative use of an anti-inflammatory and pain
      medications following surgery.
