      immune-ablative conditioning for patients with sickle cell disease and other
      transfusion-dependent anemias should sufficiently achieve engraftment while decreasing the
      incidence of treatment-related toxicities and achieving an acceptable incidence of graft
      versus host disease. Utilizing mismatched unrelated volunteer donors and haploidentical
      related donors will increase the number of patients able to undergo hematopoietic stem cell
      transplant (HSCT) for these diseases. Additionally, the institutional availability of
      virus-specific, donor-derived cytotoxic T lymphocytes should address complicated viral
      infections refractory to standard anti-viral therapy.

      The purpose is to:

        -  To provide alternate donor transplantation from cryopreserved stem cell grafts that are
           fully characterized for safety and potency to patients with severe sickle cell disease,
           beta-thalassemia major, or Diamond-Blackfan anemia who do not have matched sibling
           donor, matched unrelated donor or cord blood donor options.

        -  To utilize a reduced-intensity conditioning regimen to achieve minimal treatment-related
           morbidity and mortality while attaining sustained donor engraftment and donor chimerism
           >20% in order to rescue disease phenotype, specifically in SCD patients.

        -  To utilize ex-vivo T-cell depletion methods to prevent graft-versus-host disease in the
           setting of mismatched donor transplantation.

        -  To utilize additional donor cell products to ensure sufficient immune reconstitution in
           the immediate post-transplant period, to improve mixed chimerism or provide non-specific
           anti-viral activity in patients with virus reactivation in the post-transplant period.

        -  To utilize calcineurin inhibitor-free regimen in an effort to minimize/prevent central
           nervous system toxicity
