      includes 6 monthly group sessions focused on achieving changes in dietary habits and hence
      ease adaptation after surgery.

      In addition, lipid-lowering treatment will be adjusted and standardized following the
      Institut Catal√† de la Salut clinical practice guidelines. Cholesterol-lowering drugs will be
      withdrawn immediately after the surgical intervention to asses LDL cholesterol remission
      during follow-up.

      After surgery, a standardized protocol will be followed for the two groups in relation to
      dietary recommendations and physical activity, as well as the initiation of lipid-lowering
      medication after the intervention, in order to avoid the bias that may arise due to an open
      study.
