      lipid-lowering treatment with rosuvastatin on the carotid intima-media thickness as a
      surrogate marker of cardiovascular risk and to obtain whether CIMT correlated with the plaque
      components in coronary arteries evaluated with Intravascular Ultrasound Virtual Histology
      (IVUS-VH).
