      require effective postoperative pain control. Blockade of dermatomes between T6 and L1
      commonly provides effective postoperative analgesia. Epidural and caudal blocks are
      considered to be the gold standard regional analgesia techniques as they provide both somatic
      and visceral analgesia. Currently, ultrasound guidance is commonly used for caudal block
      performances to demonstrate the cannula placement and the deposition of local anesthetic.
      Additionally, erector spinae plane block can be a safer alternative for blocking the similar
      dermatomes. In the present study, the aim is to compare postoperative analgesic effects of
      these two ultrasound-guided techniques in pediatric patients undergoing upper abdominal
      surgery. The primary outcome of this study is the follow-up of FLACC/VAS pain scores.
      Secondary outcomes are time to first analgesic requirement, number of patients who require
      rescue analgesic, possible side effects (nausea, vomiting, itching, urinary retention,
      bradycardia, hypotension, respiratory depression), time to first mobilization, length of
      hospital stay and chronic pain due to incision after 2 months.
