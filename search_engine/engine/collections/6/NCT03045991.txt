      disability. Empirical evidence shows that exercise combined cognitive training may induce
      neuroplastic changes that modulate cognitive function. However, evidence about the effects of
      combined exercise-cognitive trainings on physiological biomarkers, cognitive and physical
      functions in stroke patients with cognitive decline is still less. The present study aim to
      investigate the effects of sequential combination of exercise-cognitive trainings on
      cognitive, physical, and daily function. In addition, the physiological mechanism of the
      combination training on cognitive function by several biomarkers including the brain-derived
      neurotrophic factor (BDNF), antioxidative marker, HbA1c, and plasma lipid level will be
      investigated. This study is a single-blind randomized controlled trial. Participants will be
      randomly assigned to SEQ group in which sequentially perform physical exercise and cognitive
      training or to CI group of control intervention.
