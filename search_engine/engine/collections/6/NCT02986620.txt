    
      The study will be conducted as follows:

        1. Retrospective phase clinical and molecular data of patients analyzed for IDH1/2
           mutations will be retrospectively collected in the centers that have already introduced
           IDH1/2 mutational screening in their practice from cases collected according to standard
           procedure (Ficoll and lysis in RLT buffer).

        2. Prospective phase: each participating center already performing IDH1/2 mutational status
           on samples of their AML patients at diagnosis or relapse - on freshly isolate
           mononuclear cells from bone marrow and/or peripheral blood using Ficoll density gradient
           preparation - will prospectively collect the clinical and molecular data.
