      The dramatic increase in the prevalence of overweight and obesity among adults in the United
      States during the past two decades is related to increased cardiovascular disease,
      hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, and other chronic diseases. With 63.9% of working-age
      adults employed, worksites are targets for prevention and intervention programs to control
      overweight and obesity. Worksite interventions have the potential to reach a large number of
      individuals in a common and shared environment.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      This is a group-randomized trial involving 20 elementary schools in Jefferson Parish public
      schools. Schools will be the unit of randomization; 10 schools will be randomly allocated to
      implement the intervention, and 10 schools will serve as controls. The primary aim of the
      program is to reduce mean body weight. Secondary aims relate to changes at both the
      individual level and the environmental level. The intervention will address the two major
      determinants of overweight and obesity: physical activity and diet. A School Wellness
      Committee at each site will be instrumental in identifying and implementing components of the
      intervention.
