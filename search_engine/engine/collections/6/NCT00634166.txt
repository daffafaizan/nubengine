      study that will evaluate the effects of topical therapy with Sulfamylon速 For 5% Topical
      Solution on autograft healing in subjects with thermal injuries requiring meshed autografts
      against a similar historic control population in which Sulfamylon速 For 5% Topical Solution or
      mafenide acetate or other mafenide salt forms were not used. Prospective subjects meeting the
      entrance criteria will receive Sulfamylon速 solution as topical antimicrobial treatment on
      moist dressings following initial meshed autograft procedure (Day 1). Sulfamylon速 solution
      will be used every 6-8 hours, or as needed, to keep the dressing moist. The graft will be
      evaluated on Days 5-7, Days 12-14 and Days 18-21, unless the subject is discharged, dies, or
      experiences graft loss / regrafting of the initial meshed autograft prior to Assessment 4
      (Days 18-21).
