      become mainstay diagnostic techniques for the diagnosis and evaluation of lesions of the
      pancreas, the upper gastrointestinal tract, as well as adjacent structures, including lymph
      nodes. Cytology specimens provided from FNA cannot fully characterize certain neoplasms such
      as lymphomas or mesenchymal tumors. Core biopsy specimens for histological examinations are
      needed to provide accurate diagnoses.

      ProCore needles (ProCore, Wilson-Cook Medical Inc. Winston-Salem, NC) were designed to obtain
      histological and cytological samples. Studies comparing ProCore needles with standard FNA
      needles showed no significant difference in diagnostic accuracy, histological core tissue
      procurement or mean number of passes.

      To overcome the above mentioned limitations (mainly suboptimal core tissue procurement
      rates), a new novel SharkCore needle (Beacon Endoscopic, Newton, MA, USA) has been designed
      and approved for clinical human use by the FDA.

      The objective of the study is to compare the new EUS guided histology biopsy needle SharkCore
      to the currently used EUS histology needle, ProCore, for the histological diagnosis and
      evaluation of lesions.
