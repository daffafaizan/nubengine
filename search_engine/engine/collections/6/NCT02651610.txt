    
      This is an open-label randomized trial in patients with HER2-negative metastatic breast
      cancer. Patients will be treated with either taxane alone (investigator choice of paclitaxel
      or docetaxel) or taxane with bavituximab. Paclitaxel will be given 3 of 4 weeks, docetaxel
      will be given once every 3 weeks, and bavituximab will be given weekly. All therapy will
      continue until disease progression, toxicity, withdrawal or consent, investigator decision,
      or study termination. Efficacy (overall response rate) is the primary endpoint while safety
      is the secondary endpoint.
