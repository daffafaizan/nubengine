      smartphone resilience intervention + smartphone sleep feedback, or waitlist control
      +smartphone sleep feedback in a randomized clinical trial in a sample of 75 Mayo Clinic
      employees. Specific self-report outcomes include: well-being, stress, anxiety, depression,
      fatigue, resilience, self-compassion, and burn-out, assessed at pre-, post- and 3-month
      followup. Objective outcomes, derived from smartphone-driven self-monitoring, include sleep
      quality and emotional experiencing, assessed throughout the six-week intervention period. The
      investigators will explore whether changes in objectively measured sleep quality and
      emotional experiencing will mediate treatment effects on self-report outcomes. The
      investigators will also explore whether treatment effects are more robust in self-selected
      versus randomized groups by drawing on the investigators' existing data.
