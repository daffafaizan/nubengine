      I. To evaluate 24 month breast photographic cosmetic scores with 9 fraction radiation
      compared to standard hypofractionation.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate Breast-Q patient reported outcomes (PROs) compared to historical control in
      breast conservation.

      II. To evaluate the incidence of acute and late radiation complications, based on Common
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 4.0 toxicity.

      III. To evaluate the local and local regional recurrence rate. IV. To compare the direct and
      indirect patient costs for radiation therapy compared to historical controls as well as
      quality adjusted life years, utilizing the Breast-Q Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs) and the
      EQ-5D.

      OUTLINE:

      Within 12 weeks after breast conserving surgery, patients undergo hypofractionated radiation
      therapy for 9 fractions over 2 weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 2-8 weeks, 6 months, and
      annually for 3 years.
