    
      Part 1: In each study period, subjects will receive a single dose of KD025 Tablet, in the fed
      state. Additionally, in order to assess the effects of inhibition and induction of CYP3A4 and
      the elevation of gastric pH on KD025 exposure, subjects will receive multiple doses of
      perpetrator drugs in Periods 2 to 4; a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, itraconazole, in Period 2; a
      proton pump inhibitor, rabeprazole, in Period 3; and a strong CYP3A4 inducer, rifampicin, in
      Period 4.

      Part 2: In period 1, subjects will receive a single dose of KD025 Tablet, in the fed state.
      In period 2, in order to assess the effects of inhibition and induction of CYP3A4 and the
      elevation of gastric pH on KD025 exposure, subjects will receive multiple doses of a proton
      pump inhibitor, omeprazole.
