    
      This is a proof of concept, single-center, open-label study of an FDA-approved drug,
      vorinostat, a Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, for patients with Class 2, high-risk
      uveal melanoma with localized eye tumors. The primary aim is to test if vorinostat can
      transform aggressive class 2 uveal melanoma cells into cells that look more like normal
      melanocytes as observed in the laboratory. Uveal melanoma patients that meet the inclusion
      criteria outlined in this protocol will be consented and asked to provide a fine needle
      aspiration (FNA) biopsy of their uveal melanoma primary tumor. This biopsy will be submitted
      for gene expression analysis to determine the phenotype of the tumor. A total of 10 patients
      who meet the criteria of Class 2 uveal melanoma and no radiologic evidence of metastases will
      be treated with 400 mg of vorinostat daily for 15 days. On Day 15, patients will be asked to
      provide a second FNA biopsy prior to receiving the standard of care local definitive therapy
      either plaque radiotherapy or enucleation.
