      sufficiently clarified. Also, the number of patients in each country is limited. As such, it
      is considered difficult to fully investigate this disease without international
      collaboration. Therefore, we have established the International Registry of NLSD / TGCV.
      Also, all patients with Jordans' anomaly of peripheral polymorphonuclear leukocytes are
      established as the subjects of entry when starting the registry, to allow entry of patients
      with NLSD due to genes other than mutations of ATGL and CGI-58 genes.

      Time Perspective:This study is both Prospective (registering patients who are diagnosed with
      NLSD / TGCV) and Retrospective (registering only the medical record of previous patients).
