      in vascular surgery patients.

      The aim is to demonstrate that the application of the Prevena™ IMS significantly reduces the
      incidence of postoperative wound infections. The wound infections will be classified
      according to Szilagyi.

      The treatment phase begins following vascular surgery with wound management using either the
      Prevena™ IMS or a standard wound dressing, depending on the group to which the patient was
      randomly assigned. It involves a minimum stay of 7 and maximum 10 days in hospital.
