      Primary immunodeficiency diseases (PID) represent candidate genetic disorders for new
      therapeutic approaches. Our laboratory is developing new therapies for patients with PID
      using autologous CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). Newer therapies may circumvent
      problems with allogeneic HSC transplantation, especially graft rejection and
      graft-versus-host-disease. We are particularly interested in three PID: Dedicator of
      CytoKinesis-8 (DOCK8) deficiency, Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency type 1 (LAD-1), and GATA2
      Deficiency. For all three diseases the gene has been cloned. Testing new therapies for these
      diseases would be considerably enhanced by the acquisition of peripheral blood CD34+ cells
      from patients with these immunodeficiency diseases.

      Objectives

      To provide a source of granulocyte colony stimulating factor (Filgrastim) mobilized
      peripheral blood CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) for laboratory research studies for
      DOCK8 deficiency, LAD-1, and GATA2 Deficiency.

      Eligibility

      Patients 18-40 years old with DOCK8 deficiency, LAD-1, and GATA2 Deficiency who meet the
      eligibility requirements will be considered for this protocol.

      Design

      Patients 18-40 years old with DOCK8 deficiency, LAD-1, and GATA2 Deficiency will receive five
      days of G- Filgrastim followed by a single apheresis. CD34+ cells will be selected and frozen
      in aliquots by the Cell Processing Section of the Department of Transfusion Medicine. No
      treatments, or investigational therapy will be administered on this protocol.
