      the loss of 450-525 mL whole blood in eight to ten minutes and is known to reduce body iron
      stores with 200-265 mg iron depending on the donor's age, hematocrit and sex and accounts for
      25% of average tissue iron stores in men and up to 75% in women.In the present study, the
      investigators aimed at thoroughly evaluate normal biological variation of relevant biomarkers
      and hormones before the donation of 450 mL whole blood as well as the expected alterations in
      systemic levels of plasma iron indices and red blood cell measures up to 4 weeks after
      donation in healthy, non-anemic, young men and women

      Likewise, doping in sport is a major problem concerning both the health of the athletes and
      the integrity of sports. Despite major improvements in anti-doping work in recent years, it
      is still impossible to test for all existing and future doping strategies, such as
      manipulation with blood oxygen carrying capacity. A well-known doping strategy is autologous
      blood transfusion (ABT), and at present, the detection of ABT is a challenge for anti-doping
      authorities. The hypotheses for this study are that 1) ret% and abnormal blood profile score
      (ABPS) have higher sensitivity to micro-dose ABT compared to current variables in the Athlete
      Biological Passport (ABP); 2) The plasma concentration of hepcidin and erythroferrone (ERFE)
      is sensitive to micro-dose ABT; 3) Gender-specific variations in hematologic variables affect
      the interpretation of the athlete's biological passport.
