      and which strategy is best to prevent recurrence of AF. The KONVERT-AF trial investigates if
      in acute symptomatic AF the early (>2 hrs but within 12 hrs of the beginning of the
      arrhythmia) electrical cardioversion leads to a longer recurrence-free interval than the
      delayed cardioversion (> 36 hrs but < 48 hrs after the beginning of the arrhythmia) within
      the first 3 months after cardioversion. Primary endpoint is the time to the first recurrence
      of AF. The KONVERT-AF trial will be conducted as prospective, randomized, non-blinded
      multicentre study. It is planned to include 380 patients in 10-20 recruitment centres.
