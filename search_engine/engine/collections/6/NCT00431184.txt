      as bipolar disorder. Drugs that modulate the opioid system might be effective treatments for
      bipolar disorder. The profile and actions of the kappa-opioid system make drugs that target
      this system particularly promising as a treatment modality, with relatively low risk of
      addictive properties. Pentazocine is an approved drug for pain relief with a good side effect
      profile. It is predominantly a kappa opioid agonist with weaker side effects at mu opioid
      receptors, at which it is an antagonist. Data from our open-label pilot study of pentazocine
      had promising results. We will follow up on these findings with a double-blind,
      active-control study of individuals with bipolar disorder or schizoaffective disorder who are
      currently hospitalized with acute mania. The antimanic effects of pentazocine will be
      compared with an active control (ativan).
