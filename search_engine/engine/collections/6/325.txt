95. changes in serum non-esterified fatty acid levels in spon-taneous and in oxytocin induced labourthe nonesterified fatty acid (nefa)concentration of serum rises progressivelyduring the course of normal labor.the rise appears to be related to the durationof labor.  the use of oxytocin to induceand stimulate labor does not alter the normalpattern of rise in nefa provided it isgiven in physiologic dosage.  the levels ofnefa in the umbilical vein and theumbilical artery at delivery are comparable andalways significantly lower than thematernal level.  the maternal/fetal ratio variesbetween 1.7 1 and 3.9 1 in this series.following delivery the nefa levels beginto fall almost immediately.  the rateof fall is 10-30% of the delivery value in the 1sthour, 30-50% within 18 hr. and 50-70% within 36 hr.
