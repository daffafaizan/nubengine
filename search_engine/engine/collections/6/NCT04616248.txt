    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate the safety profile of in situ immunomodulation with recombinant Flt3 ligand
      (CDX-301), radiotherapy, agonistic anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody CDX-1140, and Poly-ICLC in
      unresectable and metastatic breast cancer patients with injectable palpable disease.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate the immune signatures in the tumor microenvironment before and after in situ
      immunomodulation with CDX-301, radiotherapy, CDX-1140, and Poly-ICLC.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To record the overall response rate (ORR) (complete response [CR] and partial response
      [PR]) of distant uninjected metastatic lesions in metastatic breast cancer patients with
      injectable palpable disease treated with in situ immunomodulation with CDX-301, radiotherapy,
      CDX-1140, and Poly-ICLC by immune-related Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors
      (irRECIST) response assessment, and compare intratumoral alone versus (vs.) intratumoral +
      intravenous administration of CDX-1140.

      II. To record the overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) in unresectable
      and metastatic breast cancer patients with injectable palpable disease treated with in situ
      immunomodulation with CDX-301, radiotherapy, CDX-1140, and Poly-ICLC, and compare
      intratumoral alone vs. intratumoral + intravenous administration of CDX-1140.

      III. Examine changes in the levels of T-cell subsets/myeloid derived suppressor cells
      (MDSC)/cytokines in peripheral blood (PB) of unresectable and metastatic breast cancer
      patients with injectable palpable disease treated with in situ immunomodulation with CDX-301,
      radiotherapy, CDX-1140, and Poly-ICLC.

      OUTLINE:Cohort A will evaluate safety of intratumoral administration of CDX-1140 in
      combination with CDX-301, radiotherapy and Poly-ICLC. Once cohort A is finished, patients
      will be enrolled to cohort B to evaluate safety of intratumoral + intravenous administration
      of CDX-1140 in combination with CDX-301, radiotherapy and Poly-ICLC.

      COHORT A: Patients receive recombinant Flt3 ligand intratumorally (IT) on days 1-5 and
      agonistic anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody CDX-1140 IT with Poly-ICLC IT on day 9 or 10.
      Patients also undergo radiation therapy on day 8 or 9. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4
      cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      COHORT B: Patients receive recombinant Flt3 ligand IT on days 1-5 and agonistic anti-CD40
      monoclonal antibody CDX-1140 IT and intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes with Poly-ICLC IT on
      day 9 or 10. Patients also undergo radiation therapy on day 8 or 9. Treatment repeats every
      21 days for 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 6
      months for 2 years.
