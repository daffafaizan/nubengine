    
      This study is designed primarily to compare the rate and extent of healing of diabetic ulcers
      in people treated with or without Vasculera while maintaining a standard of care (SOC)
      therapeutic regimen. The study will also examine the effects of Vasculera on anti-diabetic
      medication requirements and markers of microvascular disease. Subjects will be stratified by
      whether or not they receive hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) as part of their SOC treatment
      regimen. In addition, the study will examine the ability of Vasculera to improve glycemic
      control and reduce anti-diabetic medication requirements (oral or injectable insulin) and
      will gather preliminary information on the ability of Vasculera to improve microvascular
      blood flow and oxygen delivery peripheral tissues including ulcerative lesions.
