      improved substantially along the last three decades, as a result of relevant cooperative
      studies carried out in American and European institutions. Around 70-80% of the patients are
      cured with the available chemotherapy regimens.

      However, data about HL in developing countries are scarce. It is well established that
      patients in underprivileged societies present with malignancies in more advanced stages. In
      studies of HL patients treated in Brazil during the 80's, most patients presented with
      advanced disease.

      The creation of registry of patients with HL will provide a more reliable picture of the
      disease in the country, its prevalence in different areas and socioeconomic groups, and
      treatment outcomes. It will also foster the establishment of a network among hospitals in all
      regions of the country, which may serve as a platform for further development of cooperative
      studies engaging the main Brazilian Institutions.

      The data collection allows comparison of data entered into the registry against predefined
      rules for range or consistency with other data fields in the registry. Also, quality
      assurance addresses data validation and data analysis. Standard descriptive analyses will be
      carried out. For a crude association analysis, categorical data will be analysed using the
      chi-square or Fisher's exact test (two-sided). Survival curves will be estimated using the
      Kaplan-Meier method and compare using the log-rank test. Univariate and multivariate Cox
      regression analyses will be conducted to verify the prognostic factors regarding Progression
      free survival and Overall survival, adjusted for relevant prognostic clinical variables and
      treatment.
