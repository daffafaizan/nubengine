      of a radical curative dose of primaquine to the entire potentially infected population. In
      this study we will focus on patients who have had vivax malaria in the past year and so are
      very likely to harbour liver hypnozoites. Radical treatment is not given on the Thai-Burmese
      border because risks are considered to outweigh benefits, but it is recommended in Thailand.
      We believe that this policy could be changed if there was sufficient information.

      Patients who have received chloroquine only treatment could be considered as incompletely
      treated. We plan to conduct a carefully documented evaluation of radical treatment in such
      patients. Through this we aim to determine the incidence of vivax malaria in patients living
      in a vivax endemic area following radical treatment. This will provide information on the
      safety and tolerability of primaquine, used in the context most likely during an elimination
      programme, and also will provide information on the incidence of vivax malaria. Adults and
      children > 6 months old with a documented P.vivax infection in the last 12 months will be
      recruited. In conjunction with a parallel study evaluating epidemiology in treated vivax
      malaria, we will be able to characterize the relapse history of P vivax. This will provide
      the foundation for further studies evaluating the efficacy of primaquine regimens.
