      comparison to the ROTEM thromboelastometry system.

      To include a measurement of the entire range of the test system, subjects with a medical
      management need that requires the measurement of their hemostasis status (such as PT/PTT,
      INR) or are at risk for being hypo-coagulable or hyper-coagulable will be included in this
      study.
