      Primary

        -  Determine the safety and feasibility of two different schedules of denileukin diftitox
           followed by active immunotherapy comprising autologous dendritic cells infected with
           recombinant fowlpox-CEA(6D)-TRICOM vaccine in patients with metastatic CEA-expressing
           malignancies.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the immune response to this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine, preliminarily, clinical response rate and/or time to progression in patients
           with assessable disease treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo leukapheresis for collection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells
      (PBMCs). PBMCs are cultured with sargramostim (GM-CSF) and interleukin-4 for the production
      of dendritic cells( DC). DC are mixed with recombinant fowlpox-TRICOM to produce the vaccine.
      Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts according to timing of study enrollment.

        -  Cohort 1: Patients receive denileukin diftitox IV over at least 15 minutes once in week
           0 and vaccine therapy comprising autologous DC infected with recombinant fowlpox-CEA
           (6D)-TRICOM vaccine intradermally and subcutaneously once in weeks 0 (beginning 4 days
           after the denileukin diftitox infusion), 3, 6, and 9. If < 2 of 6 patients experience
           dose-limiting toxicity, a second cohort of patients is enrolled.

        -  Cohort 2: Patients receive denileukin diftitox as in cohort 1 once in weeks 0, 3, 6, and
           9 and vaccine as in cohort 1.

      In both cohorts, treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed annually for up to 15 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 6-12 patients (6 per cohort) will be accrued for this study.
