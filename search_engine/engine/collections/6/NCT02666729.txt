      to quiver (shake rapidly with small movements) instead of beating in a normal rhythm. This
      condition can cause blood to remain in the atria instead of moving to the lower heart
      chambers. AF can cause a number of other health problems and can decrease your quality of
      life.

      Treatments for AF can include surgery, implantable devices, ablation and medication, to name
      a few. An ablation is a procedure that creates scar tissue in the heart to interrupt
      irregular heart rhythms and prevent them from coming back. The ablation procedure uses tools
      called catheters to treat the AF. Ablation catheters are thin, flexible plastic tubes that
      use electrical energy to create scars in the heart.

      The amount of force applied to the heart tissue where the catheter touches (called the
      contact force) might help determine the success of the ablation procedure. This study would
      help to determine whether or not the contact force makes a difference in an effective
      ablation. You will be tested on both sides, at the end of the procedure to see if any problem
      persists.

      Participants will be in this study for about 3 months. All visits in this study will
      correspond to standard of care visits.
