      There will be a maximum of 100 patients treated with the new device. You will be evaluated by
      your doctor to determine if you are able to participate in this research study. This
      evaluation will include reviewing your medical history, a physical examination, and special
      x-rays. These special x-rays are called CT scans and angiograms. Your doctor will explain
      what tests you will have done. A CT scan is a special x-ray that allows your doctor to see
      the size and shape of your aorta and your arteries. An angiogram uses a catheter (a hollow
      tube) that is placed into your arteries. Both tests use dye that can be seen on x-rays to see
      how the blood flows through your aorta and the surrounding arteries; for the CT scan it will
      be injected into a vein, and for the angiogram it is injected through the catheter into your
      arteries. These tests would be conducted whether or not you were participating in this
      research study. Your doctor will use this type of testing to determine if you are eligible to
      participate in this research study and as part of your follow-up care. Currently there are
      two aortic stent grafts manufactured by W.L. Gore & Associates that are approved by the FDA
      for experimental use. Your doctor will determine which device is more appropriate to treat
      your condition.
