        -  To assess the PSA response in prostate cancer patients who have a PSA-only disease
           recurrence after curative local therapy, during treatment with a combination herbal
           supplement.

        -  To qualitatively and quantitatively describe the toxicity profile of this herbal
           supplement.

        -  To assess changes in PSA doubling time for subjects treated with this supplement.

        -  To measure tissue GRP78, serum neuroendocrine markers, and circulating tumor cells, for
           correlation with treatment response and prostate cancer outcomes
