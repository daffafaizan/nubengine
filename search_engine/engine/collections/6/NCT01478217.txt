      semirecumbent position are included. Lower inflection point on pressure volume loop on
      ventilator Draeger Evita 4 with low continuous flow on volume controlled ventilation is
      measured with zero PEEP. Transthoracic lung ultrasound with linear probe is proceed on both
      hemithoraces when mechanical ventilation based on measured PEEP is started. We compare if
      real lung recruitment seen by ultrasound is the same as predicted by lower inflection point.

      The procedure is a part of routine everyday respiratory monitoring in our unit.
