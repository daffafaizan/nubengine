      of patients with MS. Data collected will be used to better characterize the natural history
      of the disease and to extensively evaluate the effectiveness and safety of medications
      approved for the treatment of MS. This will be done through the standardized collection of
      validated patient-reported outcomes (PRO) and clinician-reported outcomes (ClinRO), the
      prevalence and incidence of comorbidities and adverse events, medication utilization patterns
      and patient productivity measures.

      The design is a prospective, non-interventional, observational registry for patients with MS
      under the care of a licensed neurologist. Longitudinal follow-up data is collected from both
      patients and their treating neurologist (also known as "Providers" for a Corrona registry
      study) every 6 months (+/- 30 days) during routine clinical encounters using Corrona registry
      questionnaires. These questionnaires collect data on patient demographics, disease duration,
      medical history (including all prior and current treatments for MS), smoking status, alcohol
      use, disease activity and severity, pain, as well as other clinician- and patient-reported
      outcomes, comorbidities and adverse events, infections, hospitalizations, and other targeted
      safety outcomes. After the enrollment visit, MS patients and physicians will complete the
      follow-up questionnaires during regularly scheduled clinical encounters. The goal is to
      collect data from patients and providers at six month intervals. Adverse events may be
      volunteered spontaneously by the subject, or be discovered as a result of general questioning
      by the Investigator. During all Corrona related visits with the Investigator, subjects will
      be questioned regarding the occurrence of adverse events.
