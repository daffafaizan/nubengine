    
      This is a Phase 1, randomized, open-label, single-center, multiple-dose, 2-period, crossover
      study to assess the effects of multiple oral doses of dexlansoprazole, lansoprazole,
      omeprazole or esomeprazole on the steady-state pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics
      (PD) of clopidogrel in healthy participants.

      Participants were randomized equally into eight regimen sequence groups, 20 participants
      each. Participants randomized to Sequence Groups 1 and 2, 3 and 4, 5 and 6 and 7 and 8 were
      called proton pump inhibitor (PPI) Groups 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. Each sequence group
      consists of 2 regimens. Sequence Groups 1, 3, 5 and 7 dosed Regimen A (75 mg clopidogrel) for
      Days 1-9 of Period 1 and then crossed over to one of the following 4 regimens for Days 1-9 of
      Period 2: Regimen B (75 mg clopidogrel + 30 mg lansoprazole), Regimen C (75 mg clopidogrel +
      60 mg dexlansoprazole), Regimen D (75 mg clopidogrel + 80 mg [2x40 mg] omeprazole), or
      Regimen E (75 mg clopidogrel + 40 mg esomeprazole). Sequence Groups 2, 4, 6 and 8 began with
      either Regimen B, C, D or E for Period 1 and then crossed over to Regimen A for Period 2.

      On Day 9 of each period, blood samples were collected at predose and for 24 hours postdose to
      measure plasma concentrations of the active metabolite of clopidogrel. Platelet function was
      assessed daily prior to the dose of clopidogrel on Days 7-9 and 24-hours post Day 9 dose in
      each period. There was a washout interval of 10 to 14 days between the last dose of study
      drug in Period 1 and the first dose of study drug in Period 2.

      Study participants were confined to the study center for 10 consecutive nights in Period 1,
      followed by a 10- to 14-day washout interval and confined for an additional 10 consecutive
      nights in Period 2.
