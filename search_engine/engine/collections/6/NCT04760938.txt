      minors and parent/guardians, giving written informed consent will complete a screening
      survey. The screening survey will support research staff in determining whether participants
      meet the inclusionary and exclusionary data, including meeting scores on the Youth Outcome
      Questionnaire and the Revised Children's Anxiety and Depression Scale. If participants are
      eligible based on preliminary criteria, they undergo a screening interview. If participants
      are eligible following the screening interview and complete a second informed consent, minors
      and parents/guardians, they will be randomized in a partially-blind, parallel-group study
      conducted in the United States (7 Outdoor Behavioral Healthcare programs and up to 42
      CBT-licensed therapists).
