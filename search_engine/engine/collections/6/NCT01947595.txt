      subjects with prediabetes. These high risk non-Responder are randomized in two arms
      (intensified vs normal lifestyle intervention)with equal number of subjects (n=250). The
      results are compared with each other at the end of the study.

      The low risk Responder are randomized in two arms (normal vs. once lifestyle intervention =
      control group) with equal number of subjects (n=250).

      After the screening at baseline the 12 month lifestyle intervention starts for lifestyle
      intervention groups. The different therapy groups are formed as described before. The
      subjects with intensified lifestyle intervention get 16 consultations, the subjects with
      normal lifestyle intervention get 8 consultations, the subjects of the control group get one
      consultation to learn more about a healthier lifestyle. During the whole study there is a
      continuous supervision from physician and nutritional advisers and the subjects have to
      document a nutrition and an exercise protocol as well as subjective measurements. At
      baseline, after 24 weeks and at follow up 1, 2 and 3 years later there is an elaborate
      metabolic characterization of all subjects (also the Responder groups) a 75 g venous oral
      glucose tolerance test (OGTT) as well as an analysis of the distribution of body fat
      confirmed by MR-Imaging and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy by 3 T whole body imager.
