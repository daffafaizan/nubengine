      hospital with a capacity of 26 beds. The research was suspended between July 2015 and January
      2016. Patients who underwent rhinoplasty / septorhinoplasty operation between January 2015
      and March 2017 with open or closed technique were included in the study. The study included
      patients who were 18 years of age or older who underwent a rhinoplasty / septorhinoplasty
      operation voluntarily. Patients who had cold allergy, refused to participate, applied outside
      of the research protocol and required re-operation in the early postoperative period due to
      complications were excluded from the study. All patients were provided with training and
      brochures for preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative periods. The cold application
      was done with gel pads of the same size and weight (13 cm x 13 cm-approximately 100 g) for 20
      minutes per hour. Cold application was performed by the researcher in both groups for the
      first 4 hours. The patients in the short-term cold application group were given cold
      application by the researcher for 4 hours and 20 minutes per hour and the cold application
      was terminated. In the long-term application group, the first 4 hours of cold application
      were done by the researcher. Cold application after 4 hours; jel pads was applied at home by
      the patient's relative in accordance with the training given on the cold application
      protocol.
