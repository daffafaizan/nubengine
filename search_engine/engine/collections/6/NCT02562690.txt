      cardiovascular events, despite optimal medical treatment and coronary intervention. Such
      events are usually caused by increased stickiness of the blood causing a blood clot
      (thrombus) to block arterial blood vessels in the heart. Much of the medication to prevent
      recurrent thrombotic events increases the risk of bleeding complications. Identification of
      patients at recurrent thrombotic risk could allow targeted treatment with potent
      antithrombotic medications, with less potent agents in others to reduce bleeding. The
      investigators will assess the stickiness of the blood (i.e. thrombotic status) in patients
      who are admitted to hospital with ACSÍ¾ at baseline, at discharge from hospital and at 30 days
      post hospitalisation. Blood stickiness will be tested using a number of tests of thrombotic
      status including thrombin generation assays, Thromboelastography (TEG) and the near-patient,
      point-of-care Global Thrombosis Test (GTT). The results will be evaluated to assess the
      effect of disease process and clinical state on blood stickiness to gain further
      understanding of the condition and form the basis for future studies aimed at identifying
      patients who are at high risk of future cardiovascular events.
