      improvement in body mass index (BMI) and reduction in risk factors for type 2 diabetes and
      diabetes related cardiovascular disease, as well as evaluating the additive effect of
      metformin (as GlumetzaTM 500 mg Extended Release Tablets) and comparing an initial intensive
      exercise program with a standard exercise program. The study will recruit obese youth who are
      at risk for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.
