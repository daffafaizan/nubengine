      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of RAD001 (everolimus) in combination with
      carboplatin and PLD.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine safety/tolerability of the three drug combination of carboplatin, PLD and RAD001
      (everolimus).

      II. Determine preliminary analysis of anti-tumor activity of this regimen in patients with
      recurrent ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancers.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of everolimus.

      Patients receive carboplatin intravenously (IV) and PLD IV on day 1 and everolimus orally
      (PO) once daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2 months for 1 year.
