    
      This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to residual
      disease 1 cm or less vs more than 1cm, stage II vs III vs IV, and histology (clear cell or
      mucinous vs. serous or others). Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.

      Arm I: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours and carboplatin IV over 60 minutes on day
      1 for 6-9 cycles.

      Arm II: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour days 1, 8, and 15 and carboplatin IV over
      60 minutes on day 1 for 6-9 cycles.

      In both arms, cycles repeat 6 cycles every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Additional 3 cycles are given if clinical partial or complete response
      after 6 cycles.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total 600 patients (300 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 3 years. Assuming median progression-free survivals of 16 months and 21 months
      and a recruitment period of 3 years this can be achieved by recruiting 600 patients designed
      to have 80 % detect to a difference between the two arms at the two-sided 5% level of
      statistical significance.
