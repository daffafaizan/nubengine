      management of all aspects of the study, taking into account multiple factors including
      representation from clinics and hospitals that are participating in the trial, availability
      of skills and expertise related to trial conduct and statistical analysis, and content
      knowledge regarding acute illness, elective surgery, and the interventions that are being
      evaluated. Eligible patients will be randomized to a recommended set of standard of care
      treatments related to their surgery to identify those that improve outcomes as defined by
      hospital free days at 30 days from the date of the surgical encounter. The administration
      model is designed to provide effective operational and strategic management of the REMAP that
      operates in multiple UPMC facilities, is supported by multiple funding bodies and sponsors,
      and will evolve with addition of domains and interventions that are being evaluated.

      The ERP domain under the SUPER Core Protocol will evaluate the varying recommended
      combinations of perioperative treatments, in hopes to determine the optimal strategies for
      perioperative care based on surgery type and patient specific factors. In this study, patient
      care components within the preoperative, perioperative, and postoperative domains will be
      randomized with a machine learning REMAP technique. Optimal strategies combining the entire
      perioperative process will be analyzed that determine best outcomes for patients including
      hospital free days, reductions in postoperative nausea and vomiting, and improved pain
      control.
