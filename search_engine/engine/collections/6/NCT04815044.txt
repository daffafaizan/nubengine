      unplanned pregnancies than healthy women, and experience greater miscarriage, premature
      birth, birth complications, and postpartum depression. Having a disorder in which the
      overevaluation of the need to control body weight and food intake is pertinent, may cause a
      tremendous mental challenge to accept the bodily change through a pregnancy. Other studies
      have found that women with eating disorders seem to find motivation to refrain from the
      eating disordered behavior for the sake of the fetus, but that it is highly different whether
      this gives sustained or only a temporary remission.

      Eating disorders are rarely detected in the primary health care service, nor during pregnancy
      or during follow-up in fertility clinics. Meeting a health care provider in the pregnancy
      care service who does not know about the eating disorder or who does not understand the
      disease well enough, can also make the management and experience of pregnancy and weight gain
      extra difficult.

      The aim of this study is to increase the knowledge on how women with a hisory of eating
      disorders experience bodily changes through pregnancy, and how the pregnancy care service is
      experienced. The purpose of this data collection is to help design preparatory information
      for women with eating disorders who become pregnant, and to promote best practice guidelines
      for the health service in the meeting with, and follow-up of, pregnant women with a history
      of eating disorders.
