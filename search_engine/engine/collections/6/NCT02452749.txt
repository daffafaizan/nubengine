      United States, and is a leading risk factor for cardiovascular events, including myocardial
      infarction and stroke, and cardiovascular-related mortality with advancing age. Based on
      population based studies and clinical trials, both systolic blood pressure (SBP) and
      diastolic blood pressure (DBP) elevations are continuous, strong and independent risk factors
      for cardiovascular disease.
