      positive primary results after the double-blind phase, an optional higher dose extension
      treatment (OLE phase) is planned for eligible participants. The OLE will be carried out for
      approximately 96 weeks. Participants will be followed for safety for 48 weeks thereafter.
      Participants whose B-cell levels still did not replete to their baseline level or the lower
      limit of normal (LLN), whichever is lower, will move into the B-cell monitoring (BCM) phase
      following the safety follow-up phase. The study will end when all participants who were not
      treated with an alternative B-cell depleting therapy have repleted their B-cells to the
      baseline value or the lower limit of normal.
