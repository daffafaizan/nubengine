      for the assessment of iron overload in the liver: the newly developed ultra short echo time
      (UTE), R2*-UTE. The R2*-UTE technique, developed by St. Jude investigators from the
      Department of Radiological Sciences, will be first tested in healthy volunteers for
      feasibility and implementation of the technique. The technique will then be tested in
      research participants, who will have both the R2*-GRE and the R2*-UTE techniques performed,
      in addition to a liver biopsy for liver iron quantitation if clinically indicated.
      Quantitation of liver tissue iron will be done at Mayo Clinic Laboratory in Rochester,
      Minnesota.

      Primary Objective:

        -  To test the association of hepatic iron content (HIC) measured with the newly developed
           1.5T R2*-UTE technique and HIC quantified by liver biopsy in subjects with iron
           overload.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To explore the relationship between 1.5T R2*-UTE and 1.5T R2*-GRE measurements in
           subjects with iron overload.

        -  To explore the relationship between 1.5T R2*-UTE measurements with iron studies (serum
           iron and transferrin saturation) in subjects with iron.
