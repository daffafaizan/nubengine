      of individual differences in drugs for coronary heart disease treatment and its association
      with adverse consequences.The genomic genotype, DNA methylation and metabolome of 1000
      patients with coronary heart disease were determined using illumina high-density genotyping
      chip, high-throughput sequencing and high-resolution mass spectrometry. Blood exposures of
      statins and metoprolol and its metabolites was determined by UPLC-MS/MS.

      The biological network using cross-omics analysis was reconstructed to identify potential
      causative key genes, bacteria, and endogenous metabolite targets that cause differences in
      individual responses. A machine identification algorithm selecting clinical factors and
      multi-omics targets was used to establish a predictive mathematical model.

      A multi-center clinical cohort of 3000 coronal heart disease patients was used to verify the
      effects of various levels of omic targets on drug blood exposures, efficacy and toxic side
      effects. A comprehensive model based on multi-target combination of individualized drugs was
      constructed, and the predictive effect was clinically analyzed.
