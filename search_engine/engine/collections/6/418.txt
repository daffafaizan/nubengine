4612. flow considerations in regional cerebral hypothermiait is suggested that low flows are dangerousand may cause anoxia either directlyor by interfering with cooling.  sixty dogshave been subjected to local cerebralhypothermia by the method of femoral tocarotid cooling of arterial blood with per-fusion at a predetermined pressure ratherthan predetermined flow rate.  the cir-cuit is described and its advantages forclinical use mentioned together with its in-accuracies as a method of scientific investigation.these are chiefly concernedwith maintenance of systemic blood pressurewhich may require the injection ofpressor agents.  evidence for reduction in flowat low temperatures is discussedand evidence presented that this is not only dueto increase in viscosity but thatthere is an active spasm, manifested by'rewarming humps' which occur in thecooling graphs.  mean carotid flow rateswere determined by a revolution counterattached to a pump of fixed stroke volume,the output of which was linked to the per-fusion pressure and thus determined by the resistance.the place of added co2is discussed particularly in relation to the fallin partial pressure which accompa-nies the cooling of the blood.  the addition of 5% co2did not increase total carotidflows.  halothane had been used as an anestheticbecause of its sympatholytic ac-tion.  it has increased flows by 37% andabolished 'rewarming humps'.  rheomacro-dex used as a priming fluid instead of bloodproduced increased flow averaging 75%but did not abolish spasm.  it is suggested thatcooling faster than 1 c. per minuteis not intrinsically dangerous if spasm is preventedand high flow maintained by the methods described.
