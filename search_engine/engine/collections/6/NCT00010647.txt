      U.S. The knee is the most common site of OA and is a common cause of disability and the
      leading indication of total knee replacement in the elderly. There are presently no curative
      therapies for OA. Recently, increased attention has focused on the use of complementary and
      alternative medicine (CAM) therapies, such as acupuncture, especially for patients who have
      failed to respond to more standard therapy. Little is known of the long-term health services
      utilization and outcomes of patients with knee OA. This study will evaluate the cost
      effectiveness and overall outcomes of acupuncture for OA treatment.

      Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to receive either acupuncture or
      placebo. Surveys and questionnaires will be used to assess participants. Data will be
      collected on the short- and long-term utilization of health services as well as on pain and
      physical function.
