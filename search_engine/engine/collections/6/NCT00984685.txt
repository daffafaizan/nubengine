      often under diagnosed and under treated. It is an illness that can challenge a persons
      ability to perform even routine daily activities. Review of the charts of patients diagnosed
      with depression showed 80% of the patients do not have follow up appointments. We wondered if
      modified CHIS scale could identify the risk factors for medication non-adherence.

      We hypothesised that modified CHIS Scale an effective tool ,for identifying the compliance of
      patients with the antidepressant medication.

      We are conducting a retrospective cohort study at two of our residency based clinics by
      interviewing approximately 100 patients with CHIS Scale and PHQ9 Questionnaire on their
      office visits
