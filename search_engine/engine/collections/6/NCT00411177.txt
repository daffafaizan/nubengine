      on-line hemodiafiltration and high-flux hemodialysis regarding mortality, hospitalization
      rate, several clinical and laboratory parameters, and required medications.

      Seven hundred and eighty HD patients will be taken into the study. The study will last for
      two years with an intermediate analysis at the first year. The patients will be randomly
      placed in two groups:

        1. Post-dilution on-line hemodiafiltration,

        2. High-flux hemodialysis.

      In both groups, FX series high-flux helixone membranes will be used, duration of each session
      240 minutes, and blood flow rates 250-400 ml/min. ONLINEplus integrated Fresenius 4008S
      machines will be used for on-line post-dilution HDF. Substitution volume will be above 15
      liters in hemodiafiltration sessions.

      Echocardiography for determination of left ventricular geometry, pulse wave velocity analysis
      to assess arterial stiffness, evaluation of nutritional and inflammatory state, assessment of
      life quality, depression and cost analysis will be performed.
