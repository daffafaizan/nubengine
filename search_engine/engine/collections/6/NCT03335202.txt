      of microbial profiles. Both bacterial and fungal profiles will be analyzed by next generation
      sequencing.

      Clinical outcome parameters (lung function test, weight, calprotectin, elastase, blood
      parameters, self reported outcome) will be recorded and analyzed along with medication.
