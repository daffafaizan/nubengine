      (RA) for hand programs (SARAH) on functions have been shown in recent studies. Also, recently
      a usable web-based hand exercise program developed for patients with RA in UK. 1- The aim of
      our study is to develop and design a smartphone application for structured hand exercise
      program for patients with RA and to test its usability. 2- Evaluate the feasibility and
      effectiveness of smartphone app hand exercise app. In our study, a qualitative iterative
      design approach that includes focus groups of experts/patients was used. The mobile
      application was designed in 3 phases: PHASE 1: we conducted focus group meetings to
      compromise the content, feature and design of app in the first phase (Prototype version of
      smartphone software for RA hand training program/Mar-Hand-Therapy app). Focus Group were
      consisted two physiotherapist (PT), three hand therapists (HT) working in the field in
      different rheumatology or hand rehabilitation clinics, two software-computer engineers, 3
      patients with RA who had previously participated hand therapy. All focus group members (n=10)
      and 6 patients used the app for one week. All users filled the usability questionnaire, made
      the comments and advises. The revised version was tested again for one week. The last revised
      version completed after two weeks tested. 40 patients diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis
      will be included to the study. Participants randomized to digital intervention and waiting
      list control. After the 6-week digital intervention qualitative interviews have done with
      6-15 patients from intervention group to assess the feasibility of digital intervention. The
      primary outcomes are hand pain and function and exercise adherence.
