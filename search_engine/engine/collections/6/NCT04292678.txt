      burden associated with cancer. However, there have been limited studies that directly focus
      on supporting caregivers of advanced cancer patients who face serious problems in diagnosis
      and treatment process, at least as much as cancer patients. Besides, till date, no study has
      been conducted to determine the effects of progressive relaxation exercise on caregiver
      burden, fatigue and quality of life in those providing care for patients with advanced
      cancer. The present study investigates the effects of progressive muscle relaxation in a
      single-site, 2-arm, randomized, controlled study of 64 caregivers of patients with advanced
      cancer. Arm 1: relaxation; Arm 2: Attention matched control. The investigators hypothesize
      that progressive muscle relaxation will decrease severity of caregiver burden and fatigue and
      improve quality of life.
