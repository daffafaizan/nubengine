      hemiparesis. The investigator will assess the effects of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation
      (TMS) on motor function and examine how different areas in the human brain interact with each
      other using brain imaging and brain stimulation. The investigator will also evaluate the
      capacity for noninvasive stimulation to transiently modify brain activity supporting arm
      movement.
