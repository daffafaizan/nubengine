      Medical Center (URMC). We will administer a battery of validated assessments of substance
      use, overdose history and risk, opioid-related infection, and suicidal behavior at baseline
      and approximately 2- and 4-week follow-ups. We will assess both forms of overdose
      (unintentional, intentional - i.e., suicidal behavior) because each is common in intravenous
      drug users and they require systematic assessment to disentangle. All recruited individuals
      will receive one-to-three MI sessions as they begin the MAT that is part of standard hospital
      care. Patients will be offered computer-based CBT, which they will complete on the unit at
      their convenience. The CBT program records duration of use of the treatment modules, enabling
      us to track patients' level of CBT treatment participation. Patient-completed intervention
      feedback forms and treatment completion will be examined after 15 subjects have participated.
      Based on this feedback, we will pilot an adapted (MI plus CBT) treatment manual, obtaining
      additional feedback on acceptability. We will assess psychopathy, a constellation of stable
      traits and potentially important moderator of treatment effects, at baseline. We will assess
      potential mediators (i.e., motivation to change, self-regulation) using validated measures at
      baseline and at approximately 2- and 4-weeks post-discharge.
