      from subsequent ischemia. PC stimulus may be ( ischemic ; pharmacologic or Physical)

      Pharmacological PC may be induced by variable agents e.g. (Sevoflurane ;isoflorane, opioids
      etc)

      Ischemic PC includes local; remote and the idea is temporary interruption of blood supply to
      the organ so that liberation of protective mediators occurs. The liberated mediators have
      favorable effects not only upon the myocardium, but it extend to protect other organs against
      inflammatory activation; ischemia reperfusion injury

      Inotropic score (IS) is already an evident predictor of postoperative cardiac morbidity and
      mortality

      Aim of the work:

      Is to validate the impact of Sevoflurane versus ischemic & Sevoflurane PC upon postoperative
      inotropic score in adult patient undergoing open heart surgery
