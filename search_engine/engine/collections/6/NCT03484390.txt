      characterized by a reduced capacity to adapt to stressors, marked by poor regulation in the
      following domains: emotion, attentional function, and physiological stress. Mindfulness-based
      stress reduction (MBSR) holds promise for treating symptoms of trauma and PTSD as evidence
      suggests it targets these domains. The central hypothesis is that MBSR, which teaches
      non-judgmental awareness, can improve emotion regulation and attentional function, and
      diminish physiological stress dysregulation, which in turn will improve PTSD symptoms. We
      will examine changes in stress capacity and PTSD symptom severity among women survivors of
      intimate partner violence with PTSD after participation in an MBSR program.
