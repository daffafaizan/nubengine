      Schwa-Medico (TENSeco2 + auricular electrode + conductive gel) 25 Hz stimulation will be
      applied, intensity escalated up to 15 mA or below if tingling sensation.

      tVNS will be performed 1 hour daily for 1 month and we will assess EHOA symptoms (pain and
      function) at 1 month (end of the study)
