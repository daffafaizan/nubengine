      identification of intracranial infection is important so that, first, optimal treatment is
      initiated which may improves outcome, second, inappropriate antibiotic treatment and
      subsequent resistance are prevented, and third, it will promote shorter hospitalization and
      less cost. In several previous studies, the values of procalcitonin (PCT) and C-reactive
      protein (CRP) in predicting intracranial infection have been evaluated in neurosurgical
      patients. However, due to the limited number of studies, the results are not convincing
      enough and more investigations seems warranted to clarify their dynamic changes in
      neurosurgical patients without intracranial infection and their role in confirming the
      suspicion of intracranial infection or excluding intracranial infection from the differential
      diagnosis.

      The aim of the investigator's study is to observe the postoperative dynamic changes of BT,
      PCT, CRP, and white blood cell (WBC) count, and evaluate whether the use of two or more of
      these markers may improve the diagnostic accuracy for rational decisions about antibiotic
      treatment.
