      pain. A new piezoelectric technique for wisdom teeth extraction was developed and it showed
      promising results in terms of surgical effectiveness and patients post operative
      complications. The aim of the study is to compare the new technique with special designed
      piezoelectric tools with the traditional one in a randomized controlled way. The same
      procedures are to be followed for teeth extraction except for the use of a piezoelectric
      lever in one group and a manual lever in the other one. The study is a mono-center,
      pragmatic, randomised clinical trial (RCT) of parallel group design. The trial would have one
      week follow up. All patients referred to the Dental Department of S.Maurizio Hospital
      (Bolzano, Italy) for the extraction of wisdom teeth are considered eligible for the study.
