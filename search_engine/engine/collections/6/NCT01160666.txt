    
      Sj√∂gren's syndrome (SS) is a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by an increase in BAFF
      (BLyS) levels and a resulting B cell hyperactivity. B cells are involved in the pathogenesis
      of SS in both systemic and glandular features, and B cell downregulation may lead to a
      decrease of disease activity. Moreover, pathogenesis of SS is closed to that of Systemic
      lupus erythematosus, where Belimumab has been proven to be effective.

      This phase II open-label study has 2 mains objectives:

        -  To evaluate the proof of concept of efficacy of belimumab in subjects with SS

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of belimumab in subjects with SS Belimumab will
           be administered (10mg/kg on D0 D14 D28 and every 28 days for 24 weeks, with extension to
           48 weeks if responders) to all patients
