      University Hospital of Bras√≠lia (HUB). Has as its target population subjects diagnosed with
      breast and head and neck cancer undergoing radiotherapy. Three doses of urea cream are being
      tested. Participants are subjected to simple randomization technique, in which the members of
      the study are directly allocated in groups set forth, without any intermediate step. Patients
      are identified, go to a nursing consultation for general orientations about treatment. After
      the consultation, patients are invited to participate in the study. The patient should
      express its acceptance through the informed consent form. Data are being collected through
      interviews and medical records. Patients are being evaluated during three weeks, considering
      the toxicity of the intervention and the beginning of radiodermatitis. To evaluate the skin
      reaction will be applied scale of the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) - Acute
      Radiation Morbidity Scoring Criteria, Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)
      and Radiation-Induced Skin Reaction Assessment Scale (RISRAS). For reliable assessment and
      record of the evolution throughout the treatment and study, patients will be photographed
      weekly (D0, D5, D10, D15). Will be photographed major regions subject to evaluation: frontal,
      right side profile and left side profile with Photographic camera Nikon P510. The data will
      be inserted into Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS), version 18.0, for the
      analysis.
