      purpose of cooling or warming a patient while simultaneously allowing gastric decompression
      and drainage. Modulation and control of the patient's temperature is achieved by connecting
      the EnsoETM to an external heat exchanger. Two lumens connect to the external heat exchanger,
      while a third central lumen provides stomach access for connection to a fluid collection
      device with low intermittent suction for gastric decompression. The EnsoETM is made of
      standard medical-grade silicone. It is a single-use, disposable, non-implantable device with
      an intended duration of use of 72 hours or less. Distilled water circulates within the
      EnsoETM just like a water blanket.
