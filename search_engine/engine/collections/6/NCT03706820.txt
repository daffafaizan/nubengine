      of functional status with the following examinations: pulmonary function tests,
      echocardiogram, 6 minute exercise test, cardiopulmonary exercise test (in the absence of
      contra-indications) and finally right heart catheterization. Hemodynamic assessment will take
      place at rest and at exercise following the exercise protocol that was recommended by Herve
      et al (ERJ 2015) using a cycle ergometer at bedside.

      The purposes of the study are:

        1. to evaluate the response of the hemodynamic parameters at exercise compared to the
           resting parameters in this patient group.

        2. to discriminate between precapillary from postcapillary etiology of pulmonary
           hypertension.

        3. to correlate non-invasive parameters of functional limitation with invasive hemodynamic
           parameters.

        4. to assess the prognostic role of exercise induced pulmonary hypertension in the specific
           patient group.
