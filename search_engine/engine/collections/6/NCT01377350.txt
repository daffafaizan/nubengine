      affect lung mechanics (compliance) and the respiratory effort. Moreover, the associated state
      of oxygen de-saturation is compensated by an increase in the respiratory effort. These
      changes in the respiratory effort are reflected in chest wall dynamics and may provide the
      earliest non-invasive sign for lung congestion and deterioration in the heart failure.

      The research system comprises of patches attached to the patients' thorax that include motion
      sensors (Accelerometers) that measure the chest wall dynamics and the mechanics of lung
      inflation and deflation. The signals are acquired by a miniaturized device that amplifies and
      samples the signals, stores and analyzes the data and displays the trends on the screen.
