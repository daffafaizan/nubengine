      future generations by applying information emerging from social network studies to the
      development of new population-based behavioral interventions. There are a number of critical
      periods during fetal and infant development that appear to influence the later development of
      obesity. Interventions that prevent insult to these critical windows from occurring could
      improve children's life course trajectories. This project sets the groundwork for examining
      whether social networks could explicitly be utilized to prevent obesity from developing by
      transmitting health information and health behaviors that 1) prevent postpartum weight
      retention in first time mothers and 2) promote appropriate infant feeding practices. The
      secondary aim is to assess which individual-level network-related characteristics best
      predict postpartum body composition and infant feeding practices.
