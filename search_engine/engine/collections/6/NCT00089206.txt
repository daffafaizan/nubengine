        -  Determine the antitumor immune response in patients with unresectable stage III or IV
           melanoma treated with vaccine comprising multiple synthetic melanoma peptides,
           sargramostim (GM-CSF), and Montanide ISA-51.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive vaccine comprising multiple synthetic melanoma peptides,
      sargramostim (GM-CSF), and Montanide ISA-51 on days 1, 8, 15, 29, 36, and 43. Patients
      undergo removal of the lymph node draining the vaccination site on day 22 to assess immune
      response.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 29 patients will be accrued for this study.
