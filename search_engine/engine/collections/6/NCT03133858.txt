      of postoperative pain. Due to the complex and subjective nature of pain, an adequate pain
      therapy is an extremely challenging task, and the under- or overdosing of analgesics are
      common. An inadequate pain therapy leads to patient dissatisfaction, post-operative nausea
      and vomiting (PONV), inadequate nutrition, lack of mobilization, and an increased risk for
      the development of further complications, such as postoperative delirium (POD). Other
      long-term consequences of an insufficient postoperative analgesia include the chronification
      of pain and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Conversely, excessive opioid therapy may
      be associated with increased risk of POD. Subsequently, patients with POD have an increased
      risk for the consecutive development of postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD). The
      latter is marked by a progressive and permanent loss of cognitive abilities, which can
      ultimately lead to dementia. The use of patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) systems, which
      allow patients to self-administer analgesics, has been an improvement in the prevention of
      under- and overdosage of analgesics. Currently, there are two systems available: Conventional
      i.v. PCA with patients being dependent on an i.v. line and a PCA-pump and a
      patient-controlled, non-invasive administration of sufentanil sublingual tablets (ZALVISOÂ®).
      The aim of this investigation is to study patient controlled analgesia systems and to examine
      the incidence of POD, POCD and postoperative pain.
