      neurological and psychiatric disorders. In these patients a specific brain target is
      stimulated through an electrode with the use of an implantable pulse generator (IPG). In a
      functional MRI (fMRI) experiment, the investigators intend to perform imaging during
      stimulation ON and compare brain activations with the stimulation OFF condition. In this way,
      they aim to elucidate the involved brain network in deep brain stimulation. Since the
      connectivity of deep brain structures is complex, different activation patterns are expected
      in-between subjects and conditions. If specific activation patterns during the stimulation ON
      condition can be related to treatment response, this is of important clinical value. These
      findings can lead to an optimization of the deep brain target or even to different useful
      targets for brain stimulation.
