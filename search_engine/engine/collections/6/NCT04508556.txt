      of SARS-CoV-2 infection. These single use disposable breath capture devices can be used
      independently by individuals and shipped to be analysed in a central lab for the presence of
      SARS-CoV-2 using established existing PCR assays available in any reference lab. The aerosol
      collectors furthermore directly sample exhaled breath aerosols. As such they directly sample
      the primary transmission route for the virus. This could result in a higher rate of retrieval
      of viral RNA in infected individuals thereby increasing the sensitivity of the applied PCR
      assay. This is underpinned by the fact that CT abnormalities in the lower airways appear to
      occur prior to upper respiratory tract samples becoming positive in cases suffering from
      nCOVID19, suggesting lower airway viral loads could be higher. Combined, this could enable
      more widespread access to diagnostics, reduce the need for repeat testing, decrease the need
      for healthcare professionals to perform diagnostic tests and reduce cross-contamination risk.
