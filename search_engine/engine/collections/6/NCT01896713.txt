      cancer on an active surveillance program will undergo MS3TMRI followed by a standard TRUSBx
      and additional biopsies guided by the MS3TMRI results. The positive predictive value (PPV) of
      MS3TMRI-TRUSBx for cancer requiring consideration of therapy will be compared to the PPV of
      TRUSBx alone. MS3TMRI consists of T2, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), dynamic contrast
      enhanced MRI (DCEMRI), proton MR spectroscopy (MRS) interpreted by a radiologist and by CAD
      methods validated on whole mount prostate specimens.
