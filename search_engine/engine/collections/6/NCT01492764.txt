      chambers of the heart (ventricular tachyarrhythmias).

      During electrophysiological study, the investigators will map the localized sources of these
      heart rhythm disorders.

        1. The 'active' group will prospectively receive brief ablation at localized sources (Focal
           Impulse and Rotor Modulation, FIRM).

        2. The control group will be a historical cohort who have received traditional ablation for
           this disorder.

      All patients will be followed for up to 1 year to ensure that they have no recurrent
      arrhythmias.
