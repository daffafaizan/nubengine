      in the two treatment groups. Smoking cessation will be measured weekly through a composite
      measure of self-reported abstinence, end expired carbon monoxide (CO) of less than C10 ppm
      and urine cotinine dipstick measure of < 30 ng/ml. The primary endpoint will be point
      prevalence at 12 weeks. The four week continuous abstinence rate for the last four weeks of
      the treatment phase will also be evaluated. The point prevalence abstinence rates will also
      be obtained. The secondary objective is to determine whether smoking cessation is associated
      with a worsening of cognition and psychiatric symptomology. We hypothesize that subjects who
      achieve abstinence in the varenicline group will not show worsening on neurocognitive and
      symptom measures compared to abstinence subjects in the placebo group. Lastly, we will
      attempt to identify any clinical or topographic markers which predict cessation.
