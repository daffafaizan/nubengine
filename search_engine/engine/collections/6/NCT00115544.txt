      in a non randomised sequential open label cohort design, in 55 patients. Subjects were term
      and near term infants at medium or high risk of hyperbilirubinemia with TSB levels
      approaching the threshold for exchange transfusion. The first cohort began at a dose of
      stannsoporfin 0.75 mg/kg of birth weight intramuscularly. The dose was then increased to 1.5
      mg/kg for cohort 2, and saline was given (placebo) for cohort 3. Safety evaluations consisted
      of hepatic, renal and hematologic clinical laboratory tests along with serial physical
      examinations. Long term follow up of all patients to age 6 is planned.
