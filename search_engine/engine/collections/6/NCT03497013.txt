      were randomly allocated to active (n=30) or sham tDCS groups (n=30). All patients received
      2-mA anodal left/cathodal right prefrontal tDCS treatment (fifteen 30-minutes sessions:
      Monday to Friday once daily, every other week to do a group of treatment). Abnormal
      Involuntary Movements Scale (AIMS), Tardive Dyskinesia Rating Scale (TDRS), Assessment of
      Negative Symptoms(SANS), the Positive and Negative symptom scale(PANSS), and the Cambridge
      Neuropsychological Test Automatic Battery (CANTAB) were assessed in patients. All evaluations
      were scored at baseline, the end of 3rd weeks, 5th weeks, and 7th weeks. Side effects of tDCS
      were assessed with an experimenter-administered open-ended questionnaire during the whole
      experiment.
