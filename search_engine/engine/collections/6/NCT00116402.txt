    
      Our objective is to examine the mechanism of the additive/synergistic properties of
      b2-adrenoceptor stimulation and corticosteroid receptor activation in:

        -  Preventing neutrophil adhesion to specific endothelial ligands, e.g. ICAM-1 and

        -  Undergoing activation as a consequence of this adhesion.

      We hypothesize that combination therapy with salmeterol + fluticasone (FP) will:

        -  Augment the inhibition of adhesion of neutrophils obtained from the peripheral blood of
           study subjects in vitro, by blocking gIV-PLA2 translocation to the nuclear membrane as
           for eosinophils;

        -  Augment the inhibition of transendothelial migration of neutrophils into airways of
           subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease;

        -  Augment the numbers and concentrations of pro-inflammatory products in the
           bronchoalveolar lavage fluid; and

        -  Decrease the number of neutrophils in the bronchial tissue of endobronchial biopsies of
           treated patients.
