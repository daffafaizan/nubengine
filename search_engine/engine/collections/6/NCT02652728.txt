    
      This clinical trial is one of three clinical trials of the European-Commission (FP7)-funded
      "LENA" (Labeling of Enalapril from Neonates up to Adolescents) project: 50 children with
      heart failure due to dilated cardiomyopathy (LENA-Work Package (WP) 08 Trial) and 50 children
      with heart failure due to congenital heart disease (LENA-WP09 Trial) get treated with an
      optimal dose of enalapril ODMTs for up to 8 weeks after thorough, individualised titration
      and get invited to join the 10 months Safety Follow-up Study (LENA-WP10 Trial).

      In this WP08 Trial children between 1 month and less than 12 years, naive to enalapril
      treatment or switched from an Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE)-Inhibitor pre-treatment,
      receive an Initial Dose to investigate the reaction over 8 hours before a decision on the
      first dose is made. Always up to 7 days later a next higher dose is given at the hospital,
      the patient is supervised for 4 and then always 2 hours before a decision on the prescribed
      dose for the next dosing period is made. In this study protocol a target dose similar to the
      adult target dose (20 mg of Enalapril in a 70 year old adult result in 0.282 mg/kg/day
      enalapril) is defined. Enalapril ODMTs of 0.25 mg and 1 mg are available to allow for an
      individual dose titration scheme.

      Weight-dependently, pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) data are collected once in
      a full PK/PD day over 12, respectively 6 hours, and single PK/PD samples at each Dose
      Titration Visit and each bi-weekly Study Control Visit until the Last Visit after 8 weeks of
      treatment. Blood pressure and renal monitoring is performed at each visit before deciding on
      the dose level for the next treatment period.

      Pharmacogenomics and metabolomics exploratory studies are added as a sub-study to better
      understand the underlying disease, its progression as well as the impact of ACE-inhibition on
      cardiac outcome and renal function.
