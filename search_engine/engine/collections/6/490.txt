2953. the death of a parentin the case of depressive illnesses the deathof either parent prior to the child reach-ing the age of 15 seemed to be correlatedas a significant contributory factor.  withthis exception, statistical studies suggestthat it is the death of a mother in the first7 yr. of a child's life, as opposed to thatof a father, that is potentially an etiologi-cal factor for the future development ofpsychoses, delinquency and psychoneuroses.the case histories of 6 boys who had losttheir fathers were given.  in each instancethere was distinct evidence that the psychologicalsymptoms and behavioral disturb-ances were to be attributed in large measureto the effect of the death upon the child,and that in some cases the symptom choice wasto be correlated with specific cir-cumstances surrounding the death of the father.in some cases it was the unresolvedgrief reaction in the mother which helped toperpetuate the disorder in the child.  re-solution of this in the mother during therapyled to improvement in the child's func-tioning.  in other instances improvementoccurred especially when the child ceasedto be preoccupied with a close identificationwith the dead father.  those boys whowere involved most closely in their mother'sgrief reactions were the ones who weremost disturbed.  the brief treatment giventhese boys and their mothers appearedto be responsible for the considerableamelioration of symptoms that resulted.  ther-apeutic intervention is worthwhile,especially in those instances where there is anunresolved grief reaction in the mother.
