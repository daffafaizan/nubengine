        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of CCI-779 in combination with interferon alfa in
           patients with locally advanced or metastatic renal cell cancer.

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine, preliminarily, any antitumor activity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study.

      Patients receive interferon alfa (IFN-A) subcutaneously 3 times a week. Beginning on week 2,
      patients also receive CCI-779 IV over 30 minutes once weekly. Treatment continues in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of at least 6 patients receive escalating doses of CCI-779 and then IFN-A until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at
      which at least 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined,
      20 additional patients are treated at that dose level.

      Patients are followed at 30 days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 50 patients will be accrued for this study.
