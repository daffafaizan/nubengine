      (CNS). It is a complex, multi-factorial disease that includes inflammatory and
      neurodegenerative processes manifesting both focally in the form of lesions and diffusely in
      otherwise normal-appearing brain tissue. Recent data shows that ACTH can have beneficial
      effects on specific neurodegenerative diseases and it may have superior neuroprotective
      effects. Adding a regimen of ACTH to standard Avonex treatment may provide neuroprotection
      and promote remyelination.
