      area, known as herpes labialis, or commonly as cold sores, can cause discomfort, pain, and
      embarrassment. Traditional antiviral therapies are moderately effective in suppressing these
      recurrences. Studies have shown that the amino acid glutamine can affect HSV-1 reactivation
      in vitro. Glutamine has been studied in various clinical situations and has been found to
      decrease morbidity in critically ill patients (reducing nosocomial infections), in patients
      receiving chemotherapy or undergoing bone marrow transplantation (reducing severity of
      stomatitis, reducing incidence of infection, shortening hospital stay), and in patients with
      short gut syndrome (decreasing requirement for parenteral nutrition). No significant adverse
      consequences of glutamine therapy have been reported in these patients. We will conduct a
      randomized, double-blind, control-comparison crossover trial comparing the efficacy of
      glutamine versus glycine (control) to suppress recurrences of herpes labialis in patients
      with frequent episodes (greater than or equal to 6 per year). Based on our in vitro and in
      vivo data, we hypothesize that oral glutamine will decrease the number of recurrences of
      herpes labialis during a 5-month treatment period in participants with frequently recurring
      herpes labialis compared with control.
