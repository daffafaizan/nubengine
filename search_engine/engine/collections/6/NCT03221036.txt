      as an intravenous (IV) infusion. This study will investigate the efficacy and safety of
      vedolizumab IV as induction and maintenance therapy in participants with moderately to
      severely active ulcerative colitis (UC).

      The study will enroll approximately 302 moderately to severely active patients with
      ulcerative colitis.

      The Induction Phase contained 2 cohorts of participants: Cohort 1 participants will be
      randomized 1:2 in a double-blinded manner to receive:

        -  Vedolizumab IV 300 mg

        -  Placebo IV

      Cohort 2 participants will be treated with open-label vedolizumab. The second cohort was
      enrolled to ensure that the sample size of Induction Phase responders randomized into the
      Maintenance Study provided sufficient power for the Maintenance Study primary efficacy
      analysis.

      Participants will receive induction therapy of Vedolizumab 300 mg or matching placebo,
      intravenous (IV) infusion at Weeks 0, 2, and 6. At Week 10, participants will be assessed for
      clinical response based on complete clinic Mayo score. Results of Week 10 clinical response
      will determine the treatment pathway in maintenance phase.

      In the Maintenance Phase, participants who received vedolizumab in the induction phase and
      achieved clinical response at Week 10 will be randomized 1:1 in a double-blinded manner to
      receive vedolizumab IV 300 mg or placebo starting from Week 14 (i.e., Weeks 14, 22, 30, 38,
      46, and 54).

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in China. The overall time to participate in this
      study is 60 weeks. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic, and will be
      contacted by telephone, 6 months after last dose of study drug for a long term follow-up
      safety survey.
