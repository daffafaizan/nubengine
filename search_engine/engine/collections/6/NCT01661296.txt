      between the ages of 1-17 and adults between the ages of 18-85 who visit the dermatology
      outpatient clinic at PBM Hospital, Bikaner, with suspected CL. Informed consent was obtained
      from adults or from parents/legal guardians of minors for procedures and inclusion in the
      study. Individuals with any uncontrolled chronic medical condition, breast feeding, on
      immunosuppressive drugs or anticipated unavailability for follow-up were excluded from the
      study. Patients with more than 4 lesions were also excluded.

      Study procedures: The diagnosis of CL was established by clinical examination, history of
      residence in an L. tropica-endemic area, and by microscopic examination of Giemsa-stained
      lesion smears for parasites (Leishmania tropica bodies) or lesion biopsy. For patients who
      were both smear and skin biopsy negative, PCR was used to detect parasites in the lesion
      tissue. The lesion and surrounding skin were cleaned with stabilized 0.1% chlorine dioxide
      solution, and local anesthesia was administered by subcutaneous injection of 2% Lidocaine
      around the lesion. RFH therapy was administered by a single, controlled and localized
      delivery of radio frequencies into the lesion for 30-60 seconds using a current field
      radio-frequency generator (ThermoMed 1.8; Thermosurgery Inc. USA). Patients were be
      prescribed an oral NSAID and topical antimicrobial cream for 5 days. Cure of infection and
      any recurrence was monitored by clinical follow-up at days 10 and months 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12
      and 18 months post-treatment.
