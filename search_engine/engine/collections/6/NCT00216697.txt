      as bone marrow. It has poor prognosis, especially in patients who are relapsed repeatedly.
      Effective treatment is strongly expected in such relapsed patients in Japan. This is a open
      label multiple center study to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of bortezomib. This
      study is an extension or re-treatment study for patients who were administered with
      bortezomib in preceding Phase I/II study. For extension treatment, the same dose of the
      previous study will be administered into a vein as a bolus twice weekly followed by a 10-day
      rest (3-week cycle). For re-treatment, a recommended dose determined in Phase I/II study will
      be administered in 3-week cycle.
