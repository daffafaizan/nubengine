    
      Patients eligible for this study are critically ill patients with COPD admitted in Intensive
      Care Unit for an exacerbation of their chronic disease with hypercapnic acute respiratory
      failure. The patients will receive an Helium/Oxygen mixture or an Air/Oxygen mixture for a
      maximum of 72 hours during Non-Invasive Ventilation (NIV) and NIV-free sessions.

      During NIV sessions, gas mixtures will be administered using a ventilator suitable for NIV
      with either He/O2 or Air/O2 and a NIV facemask.

      Patients will be followed until hospital discharge and then contacted by phone up to the 6th
      month after randomization.
