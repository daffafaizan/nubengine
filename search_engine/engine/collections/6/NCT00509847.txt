      Choice of Drug

      Staphylococcus epidermidis is a relatively uncommon find in blood cultures, most cases being
      found in patients with intravenous lines through contiguous contamination and current
      clinical practice is often one of not using antibiotic treatment immediately, unless
      significant clinical signs and symptoms and/or patient status justifies intervention with an
      antibiotic. The latter tends to be vancomycin as many S epidermidis strains are resistant to
      other agents.

      hLF1-11 is hypothesized to have antibacterial effects against Staphylococcus epidermidis,
      amongst other strains.

      Should hLF1-11 be shown to be an effective antibacterial against Staphylococcus epidermidis,
      its use would be justified in other more serious hospital-acquired infections such as MRSA
      for which hLF1-11 has been shown (in preclinical in vitro and in vivo data) to display a
      strong therapeutic effect.

      Choice of Patient Population

      Based on preclinical data hLF1-11 has been shown to possess antibacterial effects on the
      selected bacteria (Staphylococcus epidermidis). Staphylococcus epidermidis is a commensal
      found in human skin. In current clinical practice hospital-acquired systemic Staphylococcal
      epidermidis is not routinely treated unless the bacteremia is accompanied by a clear clinical
      risk to the patient.
