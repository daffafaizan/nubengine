      Recently, sFlt-1, soluble FMS-like tyrosine kinase-1, has been shown to be a major molecule
      involved in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia. Higher sFlt-1 mRNA, higher serum levels of
      sFlt-1 as well as lower PlGF, placental growth factor, have been found in preeclamptic
      patients.

      We intend to check the angiogenesis profile of primiparas as compared to multiparas.
