      outdoor mobility. It differs from classical exercise programs in that it trains and
      encourages participants to embed up to 15 balance and strength exercises into daily recurring
      tasks performed as part of the daily life routine. The LiFE program simultaneously aims at
      preventing falls and promoting an active lifestyle in older adults. As LiFE requires 1:1
      supervision by trainers who administer LiFE exercises during seven visits in the
      participants' homes, it is both time consuming and resource intensive and therefore not
      suitable for widespread implementation. Hence, the aim of this study is to compare a
      group-delivered LiFE intervention (gLiFE) with the original LiFE intervention (iLiFE). More
      specifically, gLiFE is tested for its non-inferiority compared to iLiFE in terms of:

        -  Effectiveness: The gLiFE program is not less efficacious than the established iLiFE
           program in terms of reducing fall incidence expressed as number of falls per amount of
           physical activity (e.g., steps).

        -  Retention rate: The gLiFE program does not result in a lower intervention retention rate
           (i.e., percentage of the sample completing the 6-month and 12-month follow-up
           assessment) as compared to the iLiFE program.

        -  Implementation: Delivering the gLiFE program is less costly and more cost-effective than
           delivering the iLiFE program.

      In a multicenter non-inferiority trial, participants (n = 300; > 70 years; confirmed fall or
      high risk of falling) will be randomized into either the individual iLiFE (seven home visits)
      or gLiFE (groups up to twelve persons; seven group sessions).
