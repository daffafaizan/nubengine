      treatment option to whole breast irradiation after breast conserving surgery. Our group has
      previously reported results of a Phase I/II study of permanent breast seed implant (PBSI)
      using palladium-103 seeds as an alternative to whole breast radiotherapy for well selected
      breast cancer patients. The procedure is realised in a single session under light sedation
      and local freezing. After a median FU of 54 months no patients has recurred on a cohort of 67
      patients, and acute of delayed side effect compared favourably to external beam radiotherapy.

      Yet this study was a single centre study and the sample size did not allow evaluating
      appropriately the risk of serious adverse events (SAE). The current study propose evaluating
      SAE on a multicentre and larger cohort of 420 patients.
