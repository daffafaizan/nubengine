      destruction and absolute insulin deficiency. Studies on the pathogenesis of intestinal flora
      and type 1 diabetes have shown that as an "endocrine organ", intestinal microbes play an
      important role in regulating the secretion of the body. Bacteria in the intestine can not
      only directly synthesize hormones or hormone-like compounds, but also regulate the synthesis
      and secretion of corresponding hormones in the widely distributed intestinal endocrine cells,
      thereby participating in the regulation of various biological functions in the human body.
      This study uses fecal microbiome transplantation (FMT) to explore another potential treatment
      for type 1 diabetes.
