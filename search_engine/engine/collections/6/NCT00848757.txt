    
      This project is a clinical outcome study that merges the expertise of a senior Yale clinical
      investigator, the clinical and translational research resources of YCCI, the clinical and
      community expertise of the FHCHC Diabetes Team, and the high-need patient population of
      FHCHC. In addition to determining the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of an ILI for diabetes
      prevention in an inner-city community health center setting, this project will evaluate the
      effectiveness of pooling academic expertise with direct clinical services to disadvantaged,
      at-risk populations.
