      effects of placebo and two different doses of orally administered MD-1100 Acetate on gastric
      emptying, small bowel transit and total colonic transit will be compared and evaluated in
      patients with C-IBS.

      After eligibility is confirmed, the patient will return for baseline measurement of colonic
      transit to ensure that the transit profile is not greater than the mean transit profile of
      healthy controls in order to avoid a ceiling effect. A patient must have a geometric center
      of ≤2.65 at 24 hours, or ≤3.0 at 24 hours and ≤3.9 at 48 hours in order to be randomized to a
      5-day Treatment Period of study medication. Eligible patients will receive oral study
      medication for 5 days during which colonic transit will be measured.

      Approximately 36 (n=36) patients will be randomized to one of three different treatment
      groups: placebo (n=12), 100 ug MD-1100 (n=12), or 1000 ug MD-1100 (n=12). All dosing of study
      medication will be supervised at the Mayo Clinic.

      Patients will complete a daily Stool Diary to record bowel habits for 5 consecutive days
      during the Pretreatment Period and then for the 5 consecutive days of the Treatment
      PeriodPhysical examinations, vital signs, electrocardiograms, and clinical laboratory tests
      will be performed throughout the study and adverse events will be recorded for safety
      evaluation.
