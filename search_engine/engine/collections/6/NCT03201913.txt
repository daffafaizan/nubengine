    
      This is open-label, accelerated dose escalation study of TTC 352, a selective human ER
      partial agonist for treatment of metastatic ER+ breast cancer in patients who received and
      progressed on at least two lines of endocrine therapy with one that included a CDK4/CDK6
      inhibitor.

      The primary objective of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of
      TTC-352 for the treatment of metastatic ER+ breast cancer progressing after endocrine
      therapy.

      The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of TTC-352 will be determined using initial single-patient
      cohort escalations until grade 2 toxicity, then expansion to a modified-Fibonacci
      dose-escalation 3+3 design. Patients enrolled at each dose escalation step must complete the
      first 28-day cycle of treatment without a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), or be withdrawn
      because of a DLT, before additional patients may be enrolled for the next dose escalation
      step. The MTD dose level cohort will be expanded to a total of 9 patients, to further
      evaluate safety. In each cohort pharmacokinetics of TTC-352 will be evaluated.
