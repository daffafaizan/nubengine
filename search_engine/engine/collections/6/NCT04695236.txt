      were satisfied with mTICI 2b-3 reperfusion. Ultra-early intravascular hypothermia brain
      protection therapy was given to patients with intravascular hypothermia during thrombectomy
      to evaluate its safety and effectiveness.To study the cerebral protective effect of
      endovascular hypothermia therapy, the improvement in bleeding conversion rate, the
      improvement in infarct volume and cerebral edema, the improvement in prognosis quality of
      life and neurological function recovery, as well as the improvement in mortality and
      disability rate, etc., the specific evaluation criteria are detailed in the following
      experimental design.The endovascular hypothermia treatment of ischemia-reperfusion patients
      was explored.
