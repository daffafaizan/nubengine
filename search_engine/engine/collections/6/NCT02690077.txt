      coordinator, resident physician, charge nurse or nurse on the day of their planned cesarean
      section. Several variables of interest will be collected via the electronic medical record
      and within the OR. Additionally, assessment of patient satisfaction will be conducted
      following delivery. Questions from an 11-item questionnaire will be asked of the patient by
      the study coordinator, resident physician, nurse or charge nurses.
