    
      This study is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 4 study to
      evaluate whether treatment with dapagliflozin add-on to insulin reduces glucose variability
      in type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. The study will recruit type 2 Diabetes Mellitus patients with
      inadequate glucose control on insulin treatment with or without metformin or sulphonylurea.
      It is estimated that 90 type 2 diabetic patients will be enrolled. After randomization, a
      total 12 week treatment of dapagliflozin or matching placebo will be administered. Before and
      after treatment, tests for efficacy and safety outcomes will be performed.
