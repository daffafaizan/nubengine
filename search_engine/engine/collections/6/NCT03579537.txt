      muscular strength and endurance, functional capacity and quality of life of patients in
      Hemodialysis. Aerobic exercise and muscular endurance during dialysis increase blood flow at
      the muscular level with an increase in capillary surface area, which dynamizes the flow of
      urea and toxins from the tissues to the vascular compartment, which could improve the
      effectiveness of dialysis In addition, moderate regular exercise can modulate the
      inflammatory response, which would be beneficial in patients with chronic kidney disease
