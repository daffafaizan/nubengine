      PF-04603629 after observing (in both B0571001 and B0571002) a trend for a reversible increase
      in heart rate within the normal range, which occurred at efficacious doses. Thus, the
      compound was primarily terminated due to safety concerns, although there was no immediate
      safety risk to any subject in the study.
