      initiation in patients with PD. We have three aims, 1) to systematically evaluate cognitive
      rehabilitation in people with Parkinson's disease (PD), 2) to examine the neural mechanisms
      subserving cognitive rehabilitation in PD and 3) to assess the ecological validity of
      cognitive rehabilitation in PD. We will focus on a single aspect of cognitive function, the
      decision to initiate a movement. Movements can be internally generated (IG) or externally
      cued, and motor deficits in PD are typically linked to IG movements. The protocol is designed
      to drive beneficial neuroplastic changes using a paradigm similar to those that have shown
      promising results in traumatic brain injury patients. In addition, we will use fMRI to
      measure activity in underlying basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuits. Finally, because the
      goal of any research regarding the pathophysiology of disease is to improve the lives of
      patients with the disease, behavioral and neuropsychological measures will be correlated with
      fMRI measured functional abnormalities before and after training. Improvement in the
      initiation of movement has the potential to dramatically improve daily functioning including
      reducing falls, improving language production and improving proficiency of activities of
      daily living.
