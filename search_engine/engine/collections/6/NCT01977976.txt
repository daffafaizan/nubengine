      Kong who are scheduled for IVF treatment will be recruited. Women who have normal uterine
      cavity will be randomized into study and control groups in 1 to 1 ratio according to a
      computer-generated randomization list. Patients will be stratified according to the first or
      repeated cycle.

      For patients in the study group, in the cycle immediately preceding the scheduled IVF
      treatment, LH surge will be determined by daily serum LH level starting from 18 days before
      the next expected period. LH surge is defined as an elevation of LH to 2 times the level of
      the average of the previous 3 days and the absolute level of the LH should be more than or
      equal to 20 IU/L. Women randomized into the study group will have endometrial biopsy
      performed by pipelle 7 days after the LH surge (LH+7) and they will be instructed to use
      non-hormonal means of contraception during that cycle. All patients will then proceed to IVF
      treatment in the next cycle as scheduled. They will receive standard ovarian stimulation
      according to the departmental protocol and have a maximum of two embryos replaced 2 days
      after the oocyte retrieval. On-going pregnancy rates between the two groups will be compared.
