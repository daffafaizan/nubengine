      This randomized, controlled, efficacy trial will compare cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) to
      usual care (UC) for depression in heart failure. CBT will be integrated with an intervention
      to improve heart failure self-care, because depression and inadequate self-care are thought
      to be interrelated problems. It will also be integrated with clinical attention to primary
      caregiver stress. Basic heart failure education will be provided to all participants.
