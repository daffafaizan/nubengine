      Individuals with psychiatric disorders seem to be more prone to periodontitis. However
      periodontal disease and depression can be considered bidirectional risk factors. Periodontal
      diseases can also be an effect on depression. The purpose of the present study was to
      evaluate the gender-related differences in the relationship between periodontal diseases and
      depression in male and female adults.

      Material and methods: The study population consisted of 339 subjects. Two groups were formed
      from these patients: 171 females with periodontal disease (71 subjects with gingivitis, 100
      subjects with periodontitis); 168 males with periodontal disease (72 subjects with
      gingivitis, 96 subjects with periodontitis). Clinical periodontal and psychological measures
      were performed on females and males group.
