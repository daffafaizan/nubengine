      The stones might cause severe pain (due to acute obstruction of a renal unit) , deterioration
      of renal function and urinary tract infection. One of the causes of kidney stones is
      metabolic changes such as hypercalcemia or hyperoxaluria. Basic evaluation of kidney stones
      patients include measurements of calcium, phosphor and uric acid in the serum and is often
      negative. Thorough metabolic workup including 24 hours urine collection is not cost effective
      and is reserved for patients with frequent recurrence of stone disease.

      Metabolic abnormalities are often associated with bone demineralization, of which the
      patients are typically unaware. such changes can be detected by the CT scan. On the same
      scan, performed for identifying the stone, the radiologist can measure bone density, using
      the Hounsfield units, in the L2 vertebral body of and the acetabular area of the pelvis.

      In the study, in all patients undergoing CT scan due to renal colic, the bone density will be
      measured. Patients with abnormal bone density will undergo a complete metabolic workup
      including 24 hours collection of urine and measurements of urinary clearance of calcium,
      phosphorous, uric acid, oxalate and citrate . The investigators will look for correlation
      between osteopenic changes and metabolic abnormalities.
