    
      This study was designed as an open-label, prospective, controlled, blindly evaluated,
      monocentric phase II case series documentation in patients with inherited Epidermolysis
      bullosa (EB). The investigator either identified 1 EB wound ≥10 cm2 and ≤200 cm2 in size and
      divided it into 2 halves or selected 2 comparable wounds of ≥5 cm2 each. One (half of the) EB
      wound was treated with Oleogel-S10 and non-adhesive wound dressing. The other wound (half)
      was covered with a non-adhesive wound dressing only (Mepilex®) as control. Wound dressings
      were changed about every 24 to 48 hours until discharge from hospital or until the end of
      treatment at Day 14 in 'recent wounds' or Day 28 in 'chronic wounds'. This was an open-label
      study. The investigator, the participant, and the sponsor knew the identity of the treatment.
      Two independent experts were blind to treatment and assessed efficacy based on chronological
      series of cropped and coded photographs by wound (half) that were taken before start of
      treatment, during wound dressing changes and at the end of treatment on Day 14/Day 28.
