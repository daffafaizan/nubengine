      30 persons with chronic acquired apraxia of speech and aphasia. Speech samples will be
      elicited using commonly employed motor speech assessment protocols; an initial sample, a
      sample one week following the initial sample, and a sample at four weeks following the
      initial sample. The following measures will be obtained from the samples: percent consonants
      correct, percent fluent utterances, and duration of utterance. Stability of the measures will
      be examined.

      After the preceding measures have been analyzed, a series of four, single-subject
      experimental designs will be conducted. Four participants with chronic aphasia and apraxia of
      speech will receive a new treatment for aphasia and apraxia of speech applied sequentially to
      two sets of experimental picture picture stimuli. Outcomes will be measured in terms of
      speech production (measures described above) as well as in terms of language production.
