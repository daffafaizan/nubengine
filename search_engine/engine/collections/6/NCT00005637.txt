        -  Determine the safety and efficacy of extended low-dose temozolomide when combined with
           carmustine after radiotherapy in patients with malignant glioma.

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of this combination in this patient population.

        -  Determine time to progression as measured from baseline gadolinium-enhanced magnetic
           resonance imaging in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of temozolomide.

      Patients receive oral temozolomide once daily on days 1-28 and carmustine IV over 1-3 hours
      beginning within 72 hours after starting temozolomide. Courses repeat every 8 weeks for up to
      1 year in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of temozolomide until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 2 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-24 patients will be accrued for this study within 1-2 years.
