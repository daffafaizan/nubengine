      on the patient's falls risks factors (internal and external) and their falls risk perception
      in order to come up with a plan (together with the patient and their family, if present) to
      modify the hazards present at the patient's home. Together with a telephone follow-up to
      support the patient in their plan, it is expected that the patient would have a higher falls
      risk perception, lower falls risks present at home in order to prevent falling.

      In the clinical trial, the sample will comprise of 220 high-functioning elderly people (from
      65 to 80 years old) from the area which will be divided in two groups. The intervention group
      will receive a house call to perform the educational intervention with the PM ACTIVAS' model,
      while the control group will receive standard care from their health center. The research
      team will measure their internal and external falls risk factors and their falls risk
      perception at the beginning and at the end of the study. They will also receive a "Falling
      Prevention Kit" and a "Fall and Events Calendar" where they have to write every time they
      fall or trip and the day when it happened. At the end of the study, both groups will receive
      a house call to measure again their falls risk factors and perceptions in order to analyze if
      there has been any difference between groups regarding these factors.
