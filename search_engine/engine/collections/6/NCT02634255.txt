      physiological status 1 (ASA 1) patients, undergoing elective inguinal hernia repair and acute
      appendectomy, will be included to trial.

      Patients will be taken to the operating room without premedication. Spielberger's State-Trait
      Anxiety Inventory (STAI) will be administered to patients for determining anxiety level.

      Electrocardiogram, blood pressure and peripheric oxygen saturation (SpO2) will be monitored.
      After opening intravenous access on hand dorsum, ringer lactate solution will be given.
      Neuromuscular monitoring and drug injections will be done as described in "Good Clinical
      Research Practice (GCRP) in pharmacodynamic studies of neuromuscular blocking agents".

      TOF-Guard SX acceleromyograph (Organon-Teknika) will be monitored on corrugator supercilii
      muscle because of its sensitivity to laryngeal muscles. In induction of anesthesia, propofol
      2 mg kg-1 and fentanyl 1 mcg kg-1 will be administered intravenously. After loss of
      conscious, TOF-Guard SX will be calibrated and then 0.6 mg kg-1 rocuronium will be
      administered in 5 seconds. 20 milliampere (mA) current TOF stimulation (200 ms, square wave,
      2 Hz for 1.5 s) will be repeated in every 15 s. Patients will be intubated in TOF 0.1 time.

      STAI score, heart rate, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial
      pressure, SpO2, TOF 0.1 time and intubation conditions will be compared between two groups.
