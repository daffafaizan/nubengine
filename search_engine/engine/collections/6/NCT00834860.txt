      with hepatocellular carcinoma and other sex- and age-matched 100 chronic hepatitis C patients
      without malignancy will be conducted. The 100 chronic hepatitis C patients concomitant with
      hepatocellular carcinoma will receive pegylated interferon-alpha 2a plus ribavirin
      combination therapy at remission phase after oncological treatments and/or interventions. The
      other 100 chronic hepatitis C patients without malignancy receiving the same antiviral
      therapy will serve as controls. The primary outcome measurement is sustained virological
      response and safety, whilst the secondary measurement is rapid virological and early
      virological response.
