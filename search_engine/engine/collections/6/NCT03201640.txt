      preoperative preparation on anxiety in children at induction of anesthesia. The hypothesis is
      that utilisation of this novel 1st person immersive preparatory method will lead to an
      enhanced understanding of what will happen to the child (in addition to what the environment
      looks and sounds like) when they have their anesthetic. The investigators believe this
      enhanced understanding and preparation will lead to the reduction in anxiety levels before
      and during the induction of anesthesia, and will also lead to a reduction in postoperative
      negative behaviour disorders.
