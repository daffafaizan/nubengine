      patients suffering from pain and functional limitation. Depending on the severity of the
      impairment, the definitive treatment is surgical, but the old ages often associated and
      morbidities present in these patients some times limit such conduct. More effective
      treatments for pain control are necessary.

      OBJECTIVES: To evaluate quantitative and qualitative pain control in patients with
      osteoarthritis in knees after neurotomy of saphenous nerve by radiofrequency guided by
      ultrasound, compared to neurotomy by radiofrequency of genicular nerves guided by
      fluoroscopy.

      METHODS: This was a prospective, randomized clinical study and blind to the evaluators. Will
      include 20 patients with knee osteoarthritis grade III or IV, refractory to medical
      treatment. A group will be submitted to neurotomy by radiofrequency of genicular nerves
      guided by fluoroscopy and the other group will receive neurotomy by radiofrequency of
      saphenous nerve, guided by ultrasound. They will be assessed in pain intensity at rest and
      movement, functionality, satisfaction and adverse effects related to treatment. Patients will
      be evaluated 15 days, 1 month, 3, 6 and 12 months after the procedure.
