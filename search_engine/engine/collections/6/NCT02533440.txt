      procedure is commonly managed with a variety of interventions, including local infiltration
      with short-acting local anesthetics during surgery and the use of postsurgical opioid and
      non-opioid analgesics. Although this approach to managing postsurgical pain is considered the
      current standard of care, its reliance on opioid analgesics to provide analgesia beyond the
      duration of short-acting local anesthetics exposes patients to opioid-related adverse events
      (ORAEs) that may delay their recovery and have other deleterious clinical consequences. The
      primary objective of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of local infiltration
      of EXPAREL for the FAST dental implant surgery procedure compared to standard of care.
