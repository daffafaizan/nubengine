      Middle School of the El Paso Independent School District to implement smoke free youth
      coalitions as an after school activity. The coalitions will follow the Teens Against Tobacco
      Use (TATU) model developed by the American Lung Association, the American Cancer Society, and
      the American Heart Association. Participating youth will be trained to develop and deliver
      anti-tobacco presentations to younger students. Each school will have a separate youth
      coalition operating under the guidance of an adult coordinator. High school youth will
      present to middle school classes, whereas middle school youth will present to 4th and 5th
      graders.

      To evaluate the efficacy of the smoke-free presentations, the investigators will first match
      pairs of classrooms willing to have a presentation and then randomly assign one classroom in
      each pair to either receive a series of two presentations first (intervention condition) or
      later in the school year (control condition). The day after each presentation to a classroom
      in the intervention condition, investigators will administer a brief survey about tobacco to
      students in both the intervention class and its matched control class, who have not yet
      received a presentation. Analyses will compare intervention and control classrooms on tobacco
      susceptibility.
