      treat people who are undergoing allo-HSCT transplantation. This study will look at the
      efficacy and safety of vedolizumab in the prophylaxis of intestinal aGvHD in participants
      undergoing allo-HSCT transplantation.

      The study will enroll approximately 558 participants. Participants will be randomly assigned
      (by chance, like flipping a coin) in 1:1 ratio to one of the two treatment groups-which will
      remain undisclosed to the participant and study doctor during the study (unless there is an
      urgent medical need) along with background GvHD prophylaxis regimen:

        -  Vedolizumab 300 mg

        -  Placebo (dummy inactive intravenous infusion)

      This multi-center trial will be conducted Worldwide. The overall time to participate in this
      study is 12 months.
