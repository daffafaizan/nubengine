      existing hypertension and diabetes were compared. In the intervention group, a home care
      nurse followed a predefined treatment algorithm of pharmacologic antihypertensive therapy. In
      the control group, treatment decisions were made by each subject's primary care physician.
      The primary outcome measure was the difference between the 2 groups in teh change in systolic
      blood pressure after 12 months.
