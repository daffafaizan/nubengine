        -  Determine the PET response rate after zoledronic acid in patients with non-small cell
           lung cancer.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive 1 dose of zoledronic acid on day 1 followed by
      3'-deoxy-3'-[18F]fluorothymidine/PET to determine standardized uptake value.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12 patients will be accrued for this study.
