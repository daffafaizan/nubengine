    
      This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, rising-dose/by-cohort study of
      the efficacy and safety of Q8003 in inpatients with acute pain following unilateral
      bunionectomy surgery. Patients in each dosing group will receive either Q8003 (approximately
      50 per dosing group) or placebo (approximately 13 per dosing group), determined by random
      sequential assignment and blinded to patients and managing Investigators. Dosing groups will
      be enrolled sequentially in ascending order; only one dosing group will be open at a time for
      enrollment.
