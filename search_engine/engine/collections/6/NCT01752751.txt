      non-radiation oncology clinical settings to predict for toxicity in older patients during
      cancer treatments.1 The investigators hypothesize that the same tool (referred to throughout
      this document as the CGA) can be used in a radiation oncology clinic to predict for poor
      treatment tolerance. The primary objective of this study is to assess the association between
      pre-treatment functional status (as measured by the Independent Activities of Daily Living
      (I-ADL) components of the CGA) and poor tolerance to radiation therapy (as defined in section
      2.3.1). Secondary objectives include exploration of associations between pre-treatment I-ADL
      status on the CGA and the occurrence of any acute grade 3-5 toxicity from radiation therapy,
      or any decrease in Quality of Life (QoL) measures throughout radiation therapy as assessed by
      the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire. The investigators also want to compare the rate of physician
      reported acute toxicities to patient reported acute toxicities in an older cancer patient
      population, assess any association between elevated p16Ink4Î± expression in peripheral T
      lymphocytes and poor tolerance to or acute grade 3-5 toxicity from radiation therapy, and
      explore any association between other baseline components of the CGA and poor tolerance to or
      acute grade 3-5 toxicity from radiation therapy.
