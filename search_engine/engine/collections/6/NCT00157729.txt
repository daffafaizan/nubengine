      million patients, depending on obesity, ethnicity and age. Hypertension substantially
      increases the risk of both macrovascular and microvascular complications including stroke,
      coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, retinopathy, nephropathy and possibly
      neuropathy.

      In recent years, adequate data from well-designed randomized clinical trials have
      demonstrated the effectiveness of aggressive treatment of hypertension in reducing diabetic
      complications. In the epidemiological UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS), each 10 mmHg
      decrease in mean systolic blood pressure was associated with reductions in risk of 12% for
      any complication related to diabetes, 15% for deaths related to diabetes, 11% for myocardial
      infarction and 13% for microvascular complications. Currently the consensus guidelines
      recommend a blood pressure target of <130/80 mmHg in diabetic patients with hypertension,
      even though they recognize many people will require three or more drugs to reach this goal.

      MC-1 is a naturally occurring metabolite of vitamin B6, and thus has very low toxicity.
      Evidence from pre-clinical studies suggests that MC-1 has beneficial effects on hypertension
      and metabolic dysfunction. This trial will assess the effects of MC-1 alone and MC-1 in
      combination with an ACE inhibitor compared to placebo on hypertension and parameters of
      metabolic function in type 2 diabetic patients.
