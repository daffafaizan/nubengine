      training, but evidence on multitasking and facial recognition is lacking. Both multi-tasking
      and facial recognition are crucial for military and law enforcement personnel, and the
      respective organizations can consider these abilities during their respective recruitment and
      training processes.

      This study will test whether training on multi-tasking and facial recognition tasks can
      improve an individual's performance. Additionally, it will test whether their performance on
      other measures of attention and multitasking can predict changes post-training.

      Participants will go through 5 testing sessions span over 5 days. For each session,
      participants will complete a multitasking task and a facial recognition task. Participants
      are hypothesized to improve in their performance after 5 consecutive days of training on
      these 2 tasks. Additionally, participants will also complete 2 attention tasks, 1 face memory
      task, and 1 other multi-tasking task only on the first day. Both multitasking tasks are
      expected to correlate at baseline, and performance on the attention tasks may predict
      performance on multitasking tasks as these tasks require sustained and selective attention. A
      face memory task will also be used to account for each individual's baseline facial
      recognition ability.
