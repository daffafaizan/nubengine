      fractures, weak muscles and limited mobility. Mild to moderate forms of OI (type 1 and 4) may
      not require bisphosphonate therapy but would benefit from muscle training that leads to
      secondary improvement in bone strength (osteogenic treatment). The mechanostat theory states
      that bone adapts its strength to mechanical forces mostly imposed by muscle. According to
      this widely accepted theory, any treatment that strengthens muscle should also strengthen
      bones. Whole body vibration therapy (WBVT) with side-alternating platforms (Galileo™) uses
      the body's neuromotor reflex system to train muscles. Recent studies in children with
      cerebral palsy but also OI suggest that WBVT improves mobility and also bone strength. No
      randomized controlled trials exist in OI children.

      This randomized controlled study assesses the effect of 5 months whole body vibration
      training (2 x 9min/day) on muscle strength, motor function, bone structure and density. 24
      children >5 years with OI type 1 and 4 with limited mobility (CHAQ Score ≥0.13) will be
      randomized into a WBVT group and a control group matched by gender and pubertal stage.
      Children with OI will be recruited from specialist clinics in Birmingham, Manchester and
      Sheffield, as well as via advertisement on the Brittle Bone Society's homepage. Patients will
      be equipped with side-alternating vibration platforms for home use and train with increasing
      intensity. Outcome measures are tested pre- and post 5-months intervention. Dynamic muscle
      function is measured by mechanography (jumping force plates) and mobility by CHAQ
      questionnaire and a six-minute walk test. Changes in bone structure and density are assessed
      by DXA and peripheral QCT of the tibia.
