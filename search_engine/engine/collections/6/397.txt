1378. microcinematographic study of the mechanism of cancerousinvasion in cultures of normal tissue combined with malignant cellsnormal myocardium of newborn c3h mice wascultivated in vitro in contact withhomologous sarcomatous cells (strain n1 andstrain nctc) and studied by micro-cinematography for 22 days.  it was found thatthe tumor cells tend to move apart,and with more vigorous and rapid movementssome of them called 'commando's'make their way into the group of normalcells but are arrested wherever they meeta compact group of these cells.  this thendemonstrates, on the one hand, directaggresivity of the tumor cells and, on theother, the 'group' defence of the normalcells.
