      instability may cause supraspinatus muscle disease which is one of the commonest cause of
      shoulder pain and malfunction.

      Supraspinatus muscle failure usually results from tendinopathy that transforms from partial
      to full thickness tears.

      Basically shoulder impingement is a clinical diagnosis. The role of imaging in such condition
      is to identify the causal factors as well as to detect the involvement of tendon injuries and
      its extension as tears of the cuff muscles is difficult to be identified clinically.

      The decision making in the treatment of the supraspinatus muscle tears relies mainly upon the
      correct diagnosis of the type and extent of the tear. According to the diagnosis whether
      conservative or surgical treatment is chosen, even the type of the surgical intervention
      (open or arthroscopic) would differ according to the diagnosis.

      In addition identifying the extent of tendons retraction and the condition of the ruptured
      edges, as well as the quality of the muscle itself influences the management policy.

      To evaluate the painful shoulder a variety of imaging tests have been used; yet, for
      diagnosing a supraspinatus muscle tear the standard imaging modalities such as unenhanced
      magnetic resonance imaging, indirect and direct magnetic resonant arthrography, and
      ultrasound are used.

      US of the shoulder is utilized increasingly in healthcare settings to assess the integrity of
      the supraspinatus muscle. It is a non-invasive examination with practically no side effects.
      It is beneficial in the dynamic examination of the tendon during movement of the shoulder .
