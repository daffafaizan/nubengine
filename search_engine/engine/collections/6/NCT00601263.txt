      has continued to increase in prevalence over the past two decades. Inhaled corticosteroids
      have become the first-line treatment for persistent asthma even though significant side
      effects have been reported. New asthma medications, including leukotriene inhibitors and
      anti-IgE, have shown only marginal benefits. Patients have increasingly turned to
      complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) for treatment of their asthma, despite the
      uncertainty of its benefits due a lack of well-controlled scientific studies.

      We have developed a Chinese herbal formula composed of 3 herbs called ASHMI. It has been
      previously shown in murine studies that ASHMI (a formula containing Ling Zhi, Ku Shen and Gan
      Cao) has therapeutic effects on the major pathogenic mechanisms of asthma-airway
      hyperreactivity, pulmonary inflammation, and airway remodeling, as well as a down-regulating
      of TH2 response. A subsequent study in 91 asthmatic patients in Weifang, China found ASHMI to
      be a safe and effective alternative to prednisone for treating asthma and exhibited a
      beneficial effect on TH1 and TH2 balance. Based on these preliminary studies, we hypothesize
      that ASHMI will be a safe medication in atopic patients with asthma and will lead to
      identifiable changes in serum immunologic markers.
