    
      The goal of this 1-year project is to further refine and evaluate an existing and employed
      potentially highly sustainable and scalable service delivery model that leverages peer
      support organizations to increase mental health service access and utilization for children
      at risk for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) from socioeconomically
      disadvantaged, urban communities by improving the delivery of an evidence-based treatment
      (i.e., behavioral parent training [BPT]) currently delivered directly by Family Peer
      Advocates (FPAs) to parents of these children. Specifically, through an iterative,
      single-case cohort design, the investigators will work with FPAs to iteratively refine an
      existing and employed intervention model with three cohorts of parents (n= 6 families/cohort
      over 3 cohorts with a total sample size of 18 families). the investigators will collect
      information from parents before, during and after BPT to assess the impact of BPT on parents
      perceptions of their child's behavior and functioning, and parenting factors (e.g., parenting
      behavior, stress, depressive symptoms). In addition, the investigators will utilize this
      project to gain a better understanding of how best the position the FPA ADHD Model within the
      broader service delivery system through qualitative interviews with these parents to assess
      their experience and insights into improving the model. This research project is an effort at
      evaluating an existing intervention model and refining it through an iterative process.
