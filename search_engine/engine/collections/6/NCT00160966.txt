      risk factors of PVN are poorly understood. Tacrolimus (Tacr) and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF)
      are thought to be associated with a higher risk of developing PVN. However, the way in which
      Tacr or MMF might enhance the susceptibility for PVN remains largely unknown. In this
      prospective study we will analyze whether differences in immune-reactivity patterns (Th1,
      Th2, B cell and monocyte responses, sCD30, immunoregulatory antibodies) of renal transplant
      patients induced by different immunosuppressive regimens (cyclosporine A [CsA]/MMF, Tacr/MMF,
      Tacr/MMF with conversion to Tacr/Everolimus [ERL]) or by cytokine promoter gene polymorphisms
      may account for the different risks of developing PVN.

      Comparison(s): renal transplant recipients stratified according to their relative
      immunological risk (group 1: low risk (primary recipients without pre-immunization [PRA <
      5%]); group 2: moderate risk (group 2a: primary recipients with low pre-immunization [PRA
      6-20%]; group 2b: re-transplanted patients); group 3: very high risk (re-transplanted
      patients with a history of vascular rejection or recipients of a first graft with high
      pre-immunization [PRA > 20%]) randomized to be treated with one of three immunosuppressive
      regimens (CsA/MMF, Tacr/MMF, Tacr/MMF with subsequent conversion to Tacr/ERL).
