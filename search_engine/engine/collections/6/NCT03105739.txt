      conducted on children scheduled for minor surgery. Anesthesia was induced with sevoflurane,
      supplemented with propofol (3mg/kg) then maintained with nitrous oxide and sevoflurane 2-4%
      in oxygen. Analgesia was insured by peripheral nerve blocks. Included children were
      randomized into 2 groups:

        -  Awake: the LMA was left in place until the patient fully regained consciousness

        -  Deeply anesthetised: the LMA was immediately removed once the halogenated anesthetic
           turned off, and ventilation using facial mask was carried until spontaneous ventilation
           recovery.

      Respiratory complications that occurred during LMA removal until 20 minutes afterwards were
      recorded. Children with respiratory history and those for whom peripheral nerve blocks
      failed, were excluded.
