      were with severe lung disease requiring transplantation, and that the intervention was
      undertaken before any lung transplantation. The patients were eligible for inclusion if

      transplantation, medically stable, had no orthopedic or cardiac problems that would prevent
      them from exercising and had no transfer problem to the PR centre.

      Participants who meet the study inclusion criteria and complete the baseline assessments were
      randomly allocated into one of the two groups: namely Pulmonary Rehabilitation plus
      Inspiratory Muscle Training Group (IMT+PR) or Pulmonary Rehabilitation Group (PR) using a
      numbered series of 34 prefilled envelops specifying group assignment generated by a
      computer-based program.

      All patients underwent supervised PR program on 2 days per week for 3 months. Apart from
      that, participitant were asked to perform the home exercise program which was scheduled as 3
      days per week and fill out the exercise follow-up form. The study group was provided with IMT
      in addition to the standard program.
