      are performed under sedation or general anaesthesia. The safety profile of these methods for
      newborns is unclear. Alternative non-pharmacological interventions are changeable and might
      be time consuming. Oral glucose/sucrose administration has been the most frequently studied
      non-pharmacologic intervention in term and preterm neonates during painful procedures. In
      this study investigators aimed to compare oral 30% glucose and intravenous midazolam their
      efficiency on sedation during MRI.
