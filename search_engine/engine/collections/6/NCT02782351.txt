      cell malignancy by chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy, the single chain antibody
      sequence (scFv) against CD19 derived from a mouse hybridoma was widely employed. However, the
      immunogenicity of the mouse scFv sequence might be one of the reasons that CAR-T cells cannot
      persist in vivo for long. In present study investigators replace the mouse-derived scFv with
      a a humanized one and evaluate its safety and efficacy.
