      MammaPrint and BluePrint testing in any clinical setting. Study arm appendices will specify
      treatment arm, inclusion criteria, and number of patients needed. Approximately 2000 patients
      from 70-75 US based institutions will be enrolled.

      Treatment is at the discretion of the physician adhering to NCCN approved regimens of a
      recognized alternative.

      Clinical data will be collected and entered online at the time points listed: patient
      enrollment, time of treatment, 1 year post-treatment, and 2, 5, and 10 years post diagnosis.

      Objectives:

        -  Create a large scale, population-based registry of full genome expression data and
           clinical data to investigate new gene associations with prognostic and/or predictive
           value

        -  Utilize shared registry infrastructure to examine smaller groups of interest

        -  Generate hypotheses for targeted subset analyses and trials based on full genome data

      FLEX is an observational (phase IV) study.
