      is no longer responsive to 3TC. Given the significant incidence of 3TC-resistant HBV in
      patients receiving this drug as part of an antiretroviral regimen, other agents with anti-HBV
      activity are needed. ADV has shown promising anti-HBV activity in preclinical assessments and
      in Phase I, II, and III clinical trials. TDF, developed for the treatment of HIV infection,
      has in vitro activity against HBV. This study will compare TDF/3TC combination therapy with
      ADV/3TC combination therapy to determine which treatment regimen is more effective in
      patients coinfected with HBV and HIV.

      This study will include two populations of patients. Patients in Population A are on stable
      HAART that includes TDF and will either be in Group I (compensated liver disease) or Group II
      (decompensated liver disease). All patients in Population A will be randomly assigned to one
      of two arms: Arm 1 patients will receive 10 mg ADV daily and TDF placebo; Arm 2 patients will
      receive ADV placebo and 300 mg TDF. Patients in Population B are on stable HAART and have
      never taken TDF as part of their HAART. Population B patients will receive 300 mg TDF daily
      during the course of the study.

      Study visits will occur every 4 weeks for the 96-week study period. Targeted clinical and
      medication assessments and blood work assessing clotting time, liver function, and blood
      chemistry will be conducted at each study visit. HIV and HBV DNA viral load will be tested
      every 12 weeks. CD4 cell counts will be tested at Weeks 24, 48, 72, and 96.
