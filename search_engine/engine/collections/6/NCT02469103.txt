      capsule endoscopy (C2) and conventional colonoscopy will be performed one after another on
      the same day. Colonic mucosal inflammation will be scaled by physicians who review C2 videos
      and those who perform conventional colonosocpies independently. Physicians who review C2
      videos and colonoscopists will be blinded to the findings of colonoscopies and C2 videos,
      respectively.The accuracy of C2 in evaluating mucosal inflammation will be evaluated, using
      conventional endoscopy as the gold standard.
