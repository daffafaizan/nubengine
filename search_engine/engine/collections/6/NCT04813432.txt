      optimal contrast timing and enhancement in the late arterial phase to best depict
      arterialized lesions in the liver and hypoattenuating tumors in the pancreas(1-12). But even
      with the use of state-of-the-art protocols, inter-subject variations of optimal contrast
      enhancement in liver lesions and pancreas parenchyma are still very common. The aim of this
      study is to first analyze these alterations and to, secondly, use the newly gained knowledge
      to design a dose-neutral multiple arterial phase protocol. An optimized arterial phase
      protocol might improve the detection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and/or pancreatic
      adenocarcinoma.

      Purpose: To measure when the greatest difference in attenuation occurs in HCC compared to
      background liver parenchyma resp. in pancreatic lesions vs. pancreatic parenchyma. To
      describe the inter-subject variation of these enhancement times and to evaluate at which
      time-points an optimal late arterial phase can be achieved. The investigators will use the
      perfusion scanning technique, bolus-tracking and high body-weight-adjusted volumes of
      contrast media (CM).

      Anticipated results: The aim is to find the best time points for optimal CM-enhancement in
      HCC lesions and pancreas parenchyma. The results will show the extent of the inter-subject
      temporal enhancement differences and will be used to design an optimized late arterial phase
      protocol for clinical practice and future studies.
