      Primary

      - To estimate the objective response rate.

      Secondary

        -  To assess the safety.

        -  To describe the progression-free survival at one year.

        -  To examine the association between clonal cytogenetic abnormalities identified by FISH,
           and the objective response rate as well as the progression-free survival at one year.

      Target enrollment was 30 eligible patients. An 80% objective response rate at 1 month
      restaging after 6 cycles was considered as evidence of activity in this patient population
      while 60% was not considered activity. If at least 22 patients achieved objective response
      the treatment would be considered promising. With 30 eligible patients, the probability of
      observing this was 0.87 assuming a true rate of 80% and 0.09 assuming a true rate of 60%.
