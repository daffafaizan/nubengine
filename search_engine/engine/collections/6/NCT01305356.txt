      Prospective, randomized, controlled, non-inferiority, multi-center trial

      NUMBER OF STUDY CENTERS:

      25

      NUMBER OF SUBJECTS:

      299 Subjects (see "Study Population"). The subject population included subjects enrolled in 3
      separate Clinical Trials. (BMTI-2006-01, BMTI-2009-01, and BMTI-2010-01)

      STUDY POPULATION:

      Male and female subjects 18 years of age or older requiring a hindfoot fusion procedure
      involving a bone grafting procedure.

      TREATMENT GROUPS:

      Group I: Standard Rigid Fixation + Autologous Bone Graft Group II: Standard Rigid Fixation +
      Augment® Injectable Bone Graft

      Subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio (Augment® Injectable:Autologous Bone Graft).

      ROUTE OF ADMINISTRATION:

      Investigational device is manually implanted inside and around the fusion space to ensure
      Augment® Injectable Bone Graft (beta-TCP/bovine collagen matrix +rhPDGF-BB) or autologous
      bone graft is contained within the joint space

      STUDY DURATION:

      Twenty-four month follow-up post-surgery
