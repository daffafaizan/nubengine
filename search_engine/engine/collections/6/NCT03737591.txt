      cancer in the United States. DNA methylation is a commonly used biomarker for non-invasive
      CRC detection in plasma. The low sensitivity of blood-based tests is due to several
      limitations of detecting ctDNA in early-stage cancer. We developed and validated a
      high-throughput methylation-based blood test highly sensitive for colorectal cancer and
      precancerous lesions. This previously established colorectal tumor-specific plasma ctDNA
      methylation markers (diagnostic model established by next-generation sequencing of 2181 gene
      loci methylation) had a high sensitivity in CRC patients and a high specificity in healthy
      individuals in a large retrospective sample study. This prospective, multicenter, clinical
      study is to further evaluate the sensitivity of plasma ctDNA methylation haplotypes in
      detecting colorectal cancer, adenoma and the specificity in healthy individuals.
