      The etiology of MS is complex and poorly understood. Both genetic and environmental factors
      play a role and recent evidence suggests that gut microbiota is one of the key environmental
      factors. Gut microbiota is increasingly being seen an important environmental risk factor for
      multiple sclerosis, and strategies to correct an imbalance in intestinal flora.The first
      study, "Multiple sclerosis patients have a distinct gut microbiota compared to healthy
      controls," published in Scientific Reports, found that people with relapsing-remitting MS
      have altered fecal microbiota and may have microbial dysbiosis. People with MS had reduced
      levels of a protein called aryl hydrocarbon receptor circulating in their blood.Aryl
      hydrocarbon receptor is involved in many biological processes, including inflammation. The
      researchers found that gut microbiota play a role in turning tryptophan, and amino acid found
      in food, into Aryl hydrocarbon receptor agonists, which act on cells of the nervous system
      called astrocytes and limit inflammation of the central nervous system. Low levels of Aryl
      hydrocarbon receptor in multiple sclerosis patients may explain how microbial dysbiosis could
      be causing the condition.Increased constipation and fecal incontinence and increased gut
      permeability in multiple sclerosis patients, and increased occurrence of inflammatory bowel
      diseases in MS patients and their families suggest an important gut-central nevus system
      connection.Interestingly, gut bacteria can also influence the blood brain barrier integrity.
      These studiesimplicate that gut microbiota may potentially be operational in predisposition
      to or modification of the disease course of multiple sclerosis.
