      several months. Any treatment which can prolong patients' survival without causing severe
      side effects is of course an important addition to our limited arsenal in the fight against
      this disease. A recent article by Marikowsky and colleagues extended significantly our
      knowledge regarding the possible activity of disulfiram (well known in its commercial name
      Antabuse) as an anticancer agent (Marikowsky et al Int J of cancer 97 :34 2002). In this
      article it was demonstrated that disulfiram has potent antitumor activity and that it can act
      as a significant inhbitor of angiogenesis.

      Since disulfiram has been well tolerated by thousands of patients, and there are observations
      that anti angiogenic therapy enhances the effect of chemotherapy (for example bevacizumab in
      combination with chemotherapy in colon carcinoma) we decided to conduct a clinical trial
      assessing the effect of the addition of this drug at moderate doses to chemotherapy which is
      used as one of the standard therapies in lung cancer. In order to obtain information
      regarding the effect of the addition of this drug, only 50% of the patients will be treated
      with the drug and the rest will be treated with placebo.
