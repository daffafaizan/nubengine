      attend 3 ADP sessions and subsequently receive 3 different interventions, 100 mg of
      lacosamide, 200 mg of lacosamide and placebo.

      The ADP sessions is a one day human laboratory session taking place at the SFVA Medical
      Center. This human laboratory session involves the self-administration of alcoholic beverages
      by research participants under highly structured, observed conditions in order to evaluate
      the study intervention (100 mg lacosamide vs. 200 mg lacosadmide vs. placebo) on alcohol
      craving and alcohol consumption.
