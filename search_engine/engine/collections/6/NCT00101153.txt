        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of tipifarnib when administered with cytarabine and
           daunorubicin in older patients with previously untreated acute myeloid leukemia.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of tipifarnib.

      Induction therapy (1 course): Patients receive cytarabine IV continuously on days 1-7,
      daunorubicin IV on days 6-8, and oral tipifarnib twice daily on days 6-15 in the absence of
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving complete remission proceed to consolidation
      therapy.

      Consolidation therapy (1 course): After hematologic recovery, patients begin consolidation
      therapy 35-60 days after the start of induction therapy. Patients receive cytarabine,
      daunorubicin, and tipifarnib as in induction therapy.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of tipifarnib until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. A total of 10 patients are treated at the
      recommended phase II dose.

      Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-28 patients will be accrued for this study within 1.5-22
      months.
