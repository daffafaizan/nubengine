      treatment is to achieve local control of the tumor. Despite advances in radiation therapy,
      there is still a subgroup of patients that cannot be effectively treated with radiation
      because of close proximity of the tumor to the spinal cord. In addition, in cases of
      recurrent tumors, some patients cannot be re-treated because they reached the maximum allowed
      radiation dose. Surgery is the alternative treatment for these patients, but some tumors do
      recur after surgery while some patients have comorbidities that make surgery a high-risk
      procedure.

      Based on our prior experience with selective IA chemotherapy for the treatment of ocular
      retinoblastoma and the high local control rates achieved with selective IA injection of
      chemotherapy in recurrent limb melanoma (limb infusion and limb perfusion) we expect that
      spinal intra-arterial chemotherapy with selective injection of Melphalan in the arteries
      feeding the metastatic disease is feasible and safe and may prove beneficial in achieving
      local control of the spinal tumor, preventing neurological compromise from cord compression.
      This minimally invasive approach can be used in patients in whom radiation therapy and
      surgery are contra-indicated and essentially have no other treatment options.
