      ASA-class I-II, 18 years or more, and must not have indications for a rapid sequence
      induction.

      The patient will be intubated twice, with and without SellickÂ´s maneuver. It is blinded to
      the intubating physician, in which order this pressure is applied.

      The outcomes measures will be time of intubation, oxygen saturation before and after
      intubation and a Cormack Scale graduation of the visibility of the vocal cords. The
      intubation will be failed, if it cannot be performed under 120 seconds, or if the patients
      desaturate to 95% or less.
