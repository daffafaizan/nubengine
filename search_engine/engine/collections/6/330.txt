3682. metabolism of free fatty acids during perinatal life of lambsthere is a rapid rise of free fatty acidsin blood plasma after birth in newbornlambs.  this study confirms this rise,caused by an augmented mobilization of theseacids from the tissues.  norepinephrineeasily mobilizes free fatty acids in adultewes.  in newborn lambs this special effectis lacking, though cardiovascular re-sponses are clearly demonstrable.  blockingthe sympathetic nervous system innewborn lambs inhibits the rapid rise of freefatty acids after birth.  this is com-patible with the concept, that increased activityof these sympathetic nerves afterbirth is an important factor for free fatty acidsmobilization.  during intrauterinelife there is an ample study of carbohydratesand the organism uses them as anenergy source.  hypoglycaemia resulting fromsudden carbohydrate deprivation atbirth, demonstrates with rising free fatty acidsthe change-over to (tissue) fat asmain source of energy.
