      I. To define the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response rate according to the criteria of
      Bubley, et al. (>50% reduction from baseline) in subjects treated with a combination of
      docetaxel and lycopene.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I.To determine the objective response rate (ORR) according to modified RECIST criteria in
      patients with measurable disease, following treatment with docetaxel and lycopene.

      II. To define the time to PSA progression, according to the response criteria of Scher, et
      al., in subjects treated with docetaxel and lycopene.

      III. To determine the safety and tolerability of lycopene in combination with docetaxel.

      IV. To determine the effects of docetaxel + lycopene therapy on the functioning of the
      IGFR-I, selected biomarkers, and docetaxel blood levels in plasma and peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells (correlative studies).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive 75 mg/m2 docetaxel intravenously (IV) over 1 hour q 21 days and lycopene 30
      mg capsules orally (PO) once daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 21 days for at least
      4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
