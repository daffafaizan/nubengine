      outcomes in heart failure. The investigators aimed to characterize new Doppler
      ultrasonography approaches to evaluate the continuum of renal congestion. Pulmonary
      hypertension is the most common precursor to right heart failure and thus represents an ideal
      scenario to study congestion. The second cohort comprises consecutive Cardiology inpatients
      aged â‰¥18 years with a new or pre-existing diagnosis of heart failure who are referred to the
      consultant nephrologist with a history of diuretic-resistant fluid overload and impaired
      renal function. The investigators choose patients with heart failure to broaden the findings
      to the most common clinical entity of right ventricular failure.
