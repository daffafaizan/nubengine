      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of bortezomib, paclitaxel, and carboplatin when
      administered with fractionated radiotherapy in patients with unresectable stage IIIA or IIIB
      non-small cell lung cancer. (Phase I) (closed to accrual as of 09/29/2009) II. Determine the
      1-year survival of patients treated with this regimen. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the tolerability of this regimen in these patients. (Phase II) II. Determine the
      response rate, progression-free survival, and overall survival of patients treated with this
      regimen. (Phase II) III. Correlate p27 expression in tumor tissue with survival, time to
      progression, and response in patients treated with this regimen. (Phase II)

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, phase I (closed to accrual as of 09/29/2009), dose-escalation
      study of bortezomib, paclitaxel, and carboplatin followed by a phase II study.

      PHASE I: (closed to accrual as of 09/29/2009) Patients receive bortezomib IV on days 1, 4, 8,
      and 11. Patients also receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours followed by carboplatin IV over 30
      minutes on day 2. Patients undergo radiotherapy once daily on days 1-5, 8-12, 15-19.
      Treatment repeats every 3 weeks up to 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of bortezomib,
      paclitaxel, and carboplatin until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is
      defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting
      toxicity.

      PHASE II: Patients receive bortezomib, paclitaxel, and carboplatin as in phase I at the MTD.
      Patients also undergo radiotherapy as in phase I. Patients are followed up periodically for
      up to 5 years from the time of registration.
