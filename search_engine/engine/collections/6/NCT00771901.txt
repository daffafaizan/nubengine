    
      A 4-week randomized, controlled trial will be conducted to evaluate the following specific
      aims in obese subjects:

      Determine the effect of treatment with TUDCA or PBA on:

        1. Body fat distribution: a) intrahepatic triglyceride (IHTG) content, b) intramyocellular
           triglyceride (IMTG) content, and c) intra-abdominal fat content, assessed by using
           magnetic resonance spectroscopy and magnetic resonance imaging.

        2. In vivo insulin sensitivity in adipose tissue (suppression of lipolysis), liver
           (suppression of glucose production), and skeletal muscle (stimulation of glucose
           uptake), assessed by using the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp procedure in
           conjunction with stable isotope tracer infusion.

        3. VLDL-triglyceride (TG) and VLDL-apolipoprotein-B100 (apoB-100) secretion rates, assessed
           by stable isotopically labeled tracer infusion methods.

        4. Skeletal muscle intracellular insulin signaling, fatty acid oxidation, and markers of
           inflammation, assessed by evaluating skeletal muscle biopsies ex vivo.

        5. Adipose tissue insulin signaling, ER stress, and inflammation, assessed by evaluating
           adipose tissue biopsies ex vivo.
