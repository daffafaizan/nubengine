      placebo-controlled, parallel group, single dose study in patients with cartilage lesions
      undergoing autologous cartilage implantation (ACI). Participants were treated only on one
      occasion (Day 1) with a single i.a. injection that was performed under arthroscopic
      visualization and followed up for 28 weeks.

      Originally approximately 22 patients were planned to be enrolled in two cohorts (LNA043 20 mg
      and LNA043 40 mg). The study was terminated before any patient was randomized into the LNA043
      40 mg cohort
