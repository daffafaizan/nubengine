      refractory, which are the major cause of death among these patients. Vinorelbine，liposomal
      doxorubicin，mitoxantrone, dexamethasone and thalidomide have been used in the therapy of
      patients who failed with Second-line treatments in our center. This regimen is well tolerated
      but the effect needs to be improved. Chidamide，a histone deacetylase inhibitor has been
      approved for the treatment of refractory T-cell lymphoma in China. The goal is to assess the
      efficacy and safety of chidamide combined with VDDT（vinorelbine，liposomal
      doxorubicin，dexamethasone and thalidomide） in relapse and refractory patients with diffuse
      large B-cell Lymphoma.
