      due to different used dosages and varying different pain models. Theoretical the use of
      NSAIDs is rational, particularly of Coxibs as a part of the neuropathic pain management. But
      in the newest topical review, there is no valid information available about the effectiveness
      of these drugs in human neuropathic pain models or in patients with different underlying
      mechanism, e.g. with or without hyperalgesia.
