      arms (placebo, butyrate). Healthy male participants adhere to a low-fiber diet for the
      duration of the study (11 days). At the baseline study visit, measurements are taken in the
      lab, including biological samples and psychophysiological measurements. Participants then
      consume placebo or butyrate for 1 week and revisit the lab on day 11 for a second measurement
      of the outcomes of interest. Specifically, we investigate the effect of colonic butyrate
      administration on affective processing, including stress sensitivity and fear-related
      processes (e.g. extinction learning). Volunteers also respond to questionnaires in relation
      to mood and GI symptoms, and provide biological samples (saliva, blood, and faecal samples)
      for analysis of cortisol levels, circulating short chain fatty acids and serum BDNF, and
      faecal SCFA, respectively.
