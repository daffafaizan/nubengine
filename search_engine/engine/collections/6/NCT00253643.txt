        -  Determine the cancer preventing effects of fish oil supplementation and green tea
           extract use on markers of alteration in lipid metabolism in prostate tissue samples.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients are
      stratified according to age (under 65 vs 65 and over). Patients are randomized to 1 of 4
      treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral fish oil three times daily and oral green tea extract twice
           daily.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive an oil placebo three times daily and oral green tea extract
           twice daily.

        -  Arm III: Patients receive oral fish oil three times daily and a placebo twice daily.

        -  Arm IV: Patients receive an oil placebo three times daily and another placebo twice
           daily.

      Treatment in one of the above-listed arms continues for up to 20 weeks in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      All patients undergo a prostate biopsy on the last day of study treatment.

      After completion of study treatment, patients receive a follow-up phone call at/around 30
      days later.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 144 patients will be accrued for this study.
