      centers in France and Sydney (Australia) are included in the study, if willing. As soon as
      they weigh more than 4.150kg and if they are still younger than 3.5 months, an Oral Glucose
      Tolerance Test (OGTT) is performed. Glycemia and insulinemia are monitored every 30 minutes
      from intake to 240 minutes. Clinical signs that are presented are noted. If early
      hyperglycemia or late hypoglycemia are biologically or clinically observed, ascarbose
      treatment is initiated.
