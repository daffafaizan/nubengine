    
      Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has been established as an important
      therapeutic option for patients with a variety of inherited metabolic disorders (IMD). The
      potential life-threatening complications of conventional myeloablative HSCT have limited its
      application. Additionally, conventional HSCT is only available to the small minority of
      medically suitable candidates who have histocompatibility leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical
      siblings to donate bone marrow or mobilized peripheral blood stem cells.

      Donor mobilized peripheral blood stem cells or bone marrow will be processed via a novel
      technology to deplete mature immune cells while retaining hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and
      graft facilitating cells (FC).

      A now-standard reduced intensity, nonmyeloablative recipient conditioning regimen will be
      used to promote mixed allogeneic chimerism, thereby significantly reducing morbidity and
      mortality.

      These two enhancements are intended to significantly improve the benefit:risk ratio of HSCT
      for patients with IMDs. If successful, transplantation will become a more feasible option for
      patients without HLA-identical siblings to donate stem cells, and could be offered to
      patients early in disease progression.

      The objective for the study is to establish chimerism following reduced intensity
      conditioning with no grade III/IV graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The primary endpoint we
      will follow is production of the missing enzyme at â‰¥ 10% of the normal level at day 180
      post-transplant as for investigational new drug (IND) 14070. This expanded access protocol
      details the approach to providing a second dose of the product.
