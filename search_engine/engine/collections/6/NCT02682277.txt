      reduction of caloric intake was followed, according to a questionnaire based on the weekly
      number of servings. No modification of physical activity was requested.

      One group had to take the polyglucosamine tablets and the other group placebo tablets for at
      least 12 months. It is known, that polyglucosamine is a fat binder acting in a
      physical-chemical manner, the positive charged fiber is bound to the negative charged dietary
      fat and this complex is unable to pass the gut wall into the body but is naturally
      excreted,hence this energy is not available. Therefore, this medical device should show a
      measurable reduction in body weight.
