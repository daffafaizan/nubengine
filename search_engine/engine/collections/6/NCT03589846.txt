      is not currently utilized in any clinical decision-making processes for OSA patients. All
      patients scheduled for DISE as part of their regular clinical care will be screened for
      enrollment via the previously described inclusion and exclusion criteria. The study is not
      blinded. No diagnostic information collected from muscle stimulation will be used in clinical
      decision-making processes.
