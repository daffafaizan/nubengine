      measured by the mean Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-SF) worse pain score at 12 weeks
      between the two arms. The Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form is a well validated clinical tool
      used frequently to assess severity of pain and its effect on daily functions. BPI-SF also
      monitors the effects of treatment on pain in patients with cancer and other chronic
      illnesses. The instrument gives several ratings of the intensity and severity of pain and the
      degree of pain interference on activity, mood, sleep, relations with others and work. The
      questionnaire uses a 0-10 scale for subject ratings and takes five minutes to complete. We
      consider a reduction of 2 or more points on the BPI-SF worst pain item to correspond with a
      clinically meaningful decrease in pain.

      The secondary endpoints include other efficacy outcomes such as quality of life measures,
      extent of neurological dysfunction, blood levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and adverse
      events.
