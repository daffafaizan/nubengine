      high-risk patients, downstaging rate with conventional fluoropyrimidine-based monotherapy
      with radiation has not been shown. We assume that the downstaging rate of chemoradiation arm
      (control arm) would be 30%, and that addition of CapOx after CRT (experimental arm) may
      increase downstaging rate 30% to 50%. A sample size of 52 patients per group is needed have
      85% power to detect downstaging rate = 50% as compared to 30% with type I error rate of 15%.
      We will perform one interim futility analysis when half of the patients are recruited and
      evaluated for the primary endpoint. O'Brien-Fleming boundary will be considered. Therefore,
      when 26 patients per arm are evaluated, the interim futility analysis will be performed, and
      when the Z score at the interim is less than -0.09192 (one-sided p-value greater than
      0.5366192), the study will be stopped for futility. Considering 5% follow-up loss, a sample
      size of 55 per arm (a total of 110 patients) will be studied.
