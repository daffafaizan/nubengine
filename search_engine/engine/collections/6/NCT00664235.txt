      subjects. The subjects will be enrolled from Duke North floors 8100 or 8300 in a prospective
      controlled trial. All eligible patients who have signed a consent form will be assessed using
      the Long Wave Infrared imaging.

      Subjects eligible for this study who have signed a consent form will be scanned on bilateral
      heels and sacrum. Subjects with ulcers on those areas will also be scanned due to the fact
      that they are at a high risk of developing additional pressure ulcers. The intent is not to
      capture images of the existing ulcer, but to focus on areas that could potentially develop
      into additional pressure ulcers. The subjects who already have an ulcer will only be scanned
      on non ulcerated tissue. The areas of interest must be off-loaded for 3 minutes from any
      pressure in order to acclimate to ambient temperature. The device will be held approximately
      36 inches from the area of interest in order to obtain an image. The subjects will be
      assessed within 24 hours of admission and every 24 hours until discharge or they develop a
      pressure ulcer. The subject's routinely recorded Braden scores (By on the floor nursing
      staff) will also be captured in order to effectively compare the effectiveness of the Imaging
      system. The nurse conducting the imaging will also record a Braden score.

      All subjects will be included in the trial unless they refuse to participate or are
      incapacitated to the degree that imaging becomes unreasonable.
