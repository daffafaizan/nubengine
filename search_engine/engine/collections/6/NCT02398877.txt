      axis (HPA-axis) indicated by an increased response to stress, a diminished negative feedback
      and alterations in expression of glucocorticoid receptors. Patients with a history of
      childhood trauma are more likely to develop metabolic disorders such as diabetes mellitus
      type 2 or metabolic syndrome.

      The investigators will examine participants with and without early life stress and with and
      without major depression. The investigators assume that traumatized study participants (1)
      show an increased endocrine stress reaction to psychosocial stress, (2) display an altered
      sensitivity of GR, and (3) therefore suffer from an adverse cardiovascular risk profile in
      comparison to not-traumatized participants.

      The investigators study will increase current knowledge on possible sequel of early traumatic
      stress. The results will lead to a more comprehensive understanding of stress-related eating
      behaviour and its implications.
