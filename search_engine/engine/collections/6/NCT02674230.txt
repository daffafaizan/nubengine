    
      The objective of this observational study is the follow-up of 2000 adult obesity (BMI â‰¥ 35
      and 24-35 kg/m2) and non-obese subjects with annual follow-up for 10 years. Clinical data,
      biochemistry, and biological samples (serum, DNA, RNA, white blood cells) will be collected
      and stored. Adipose tissues will be collected if participants received liposuction, plastic
      surgery, bariatric surgery, dermatological procedure, intra-abdominal operation, and
      cardiovascular surgery. Questionnaires will be obtained with special nurse including sleep
      quality, chronotypes, and circadian activities. During follow up period, major adverse
      cardiovascular events will be monitored.

      The investigators anticipate that the results generated from the study will provide valuable
      data to a better understanding of the relationships between obesity, circadian rhythm, and
      aging.
