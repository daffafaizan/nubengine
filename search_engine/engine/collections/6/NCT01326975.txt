      for breathing support because of lung immaturity. CPAP can be delivered by the infant
      flow(TM) device which is well studied. Prolonged use of nasal prongs CPAP has been shown to
      cause discomfort and, rarely, nasal injury leading to long term disfigurement. On the other
      hand, High flow nasal cannula (HFNC) ,which is another modality of delivering CPAP, creates
      less pressure on the nose and less disfiguring effect but previous research showed that the
      use of HFNC may be less effective than IF-CPAP in providing breathing support in these
      infants.

      We plan to study 10 stable preterm infants born less than 32 weeks' gestation and 1.5
      kilograms at birth after being stable for at least 48hours on IF-CPAP. babies will be
      randomized to start on IF-CPAP or HFNC for 30 minutes. After 45 minutes of adaptation, baby
      will be switched to the other modality for another 30 minutes. By inserting a specialized
      feeding tube with sensors into the stomach, we can measure the electrical activity of the
      diaphragm (EAdi). By analysing EAdi with each modality of delivering CPAP, we want to
      directly assess how HFNC affects breathing compared to IF-CPAP.
