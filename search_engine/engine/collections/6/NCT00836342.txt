      carotenoids and incidence of malignancies, including Non- Melanoma Skin Cancer (NMSC). An
      easy and inexpensive way to determine which subjects would benefit from supplementation with
      carotenoids or retinoids could be the measurement of skin carotenoid levels.The least
      invasive way to perform it is through Raman spectroscopy which is a technique that uses a
      laser light that can be used to quantify carotenoids on the skin. We will compare the skin
      carotenoid levels of subjects with previous history of SCC or BCC and subjects without
      history of previous NMSC.
