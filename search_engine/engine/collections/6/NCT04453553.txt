    
      Accurate, rapid, near-patient testing systems, such as q16+CoV-2, allow for daily routine
      testing of residents, and of staff and visitors prior to entering the care home.

      Daily CoV-2 PCR testing with high analytical sensitivity (e.g., 2 copies per 8 Âµl sample) may
      detect infected residents and visitors before clinical symptoms are apparent. Earlier
      detection may lead to earlier implementation of the UK standard of care protocol for
      Infection prevention and control measures, thereby preventing the asymptomatic infected
      individuals from introducing and/or transmitting CoV-2 within the care home. This should
      reduce the transmission by:

      Preventing the introduction of the virus into care homes from external visitors e.g., GPs
      (Inward transmission) Preventing the spread of the virus within care homes and preventing
      cluster development (internal transmission) Preventing the outward spread of the virus from
      within care homes by infection of external visitors (Outward transmission)
