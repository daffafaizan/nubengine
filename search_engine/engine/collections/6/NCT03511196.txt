      response and testosterone level to guide the treatment with androgen deprivation therapy
      (ADT) [Leuprolide, Goserelin, and Triptorelin are the most commonly used GnRH agonists for
      ADT] and/or abiraterone plus prednisone. Adaptive therapy is a program of chemotherapy where
      the type and dosage of drug changes in an attempt to kill more of the cancer.

      Abiraterone acetate with prednisone is a standard of care treatment for mCRPC (metastatic
      castration resistant prostate cancer). It works by interrupting the male hormone (androgen)
      making process in the testes, adrenal glands, and tumors. This helps to prevent the growth of
      tumors that need these hormones to grow.
