      Aim 1. To examine the effects of estradiol alone on brain functioning in early
      post-menopausal women during verbal and non-verbal cognitive tasks.

      Hypothesis: It is expected that with estradiol treatment brain activation will be more
      prominent in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortical areas compared to placebo. The magnitude
      of activation in these regions will be positively correlated with task performance in the
      scanner and with the results of neuropsychological tests assessing verbal and non-verbal
      delayed recall.

      Aim 2. To determine the effects of progesterone alone on brain functioning in early
      postmenopausal women during verbal and non-verbal cognitive tasks.

      Hypothesis: It is expected that with progesterone treatment brain activation in the
      hippocampus and prefrontal cortical areas will be decreased compared to both the placebo
      condition (within subjects) and the estradiol condition (between subjects). Interindividual
      variations in the magnitude of activation in these regions will be positively correlated with
      task performance in the scanner and with the results of neuropsychological tests assessing
      verbal and non-verbal delayed recall.

      Aim 3. To determine the individual effects of estradiol and progesterone on brain functioning
      in early postmenopausal women during emotional processing stimuli.

      Hypothesis: During negative stimuli estradiol-treated women compared to placebo group, are
      expected to have increased activity in the amygdala, posterior cingulate, and orbitofrontal
      cortex, while in progesterone-treated women compared to placebo, decreased activity is
      expected in these brain regions.
