      obesity is associated with type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, NAFLD and decreased
      quality of life. In 2016 the lifestyle intervention Your COACH Next Door (YCND) was founded
      in Maastricht, The Netherlands, as a tailored, network approach for children with overweight
      and obesity. YCND is following the example of COACH, the tailored lifestyleintervention for
      childhood obesity of the expertise centre of the MUMC+ hospital.

      YCND is connecting children with overweight and their families with a coach close to home.

      This study goal is to examine the effects of YCND for children and their families, (on their
      health, quality of life), and a process evaluation (process of the lifestyle intervention,
      and satisfaction for children, families and healthcare givers)
