      other starchy foods with a low glycemic response (Low-GI), as compared with a similar
      Mediterranean diet containing very little pasta and based on starchy foods with a high
      glycemic response (Hi-GI) is able to reduce insulin and glucose concentrations during a
      prolonged test study meal.
