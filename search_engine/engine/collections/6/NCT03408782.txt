      surgical patients. They cause morbidity and mortality.

      Surgical Drains are commonly inserted at the end of many surgical procedures. In contrast to
      potential benefits, drains are also thought to potentially serve as a conduit of bacteria
      into the wound and hence may increase the risk of SSI. Patterns of use of drains vary widely
      across surgical disciplines and individual practices. There are no uniform guidelines and
      standards are often rather based on tradition than on evidence. The aim of this large
      prospective study was to examine the association of presence, duration, type, number and
      location of drains with the risk of SSI in a contemporary and multicentric cohort of general,
      orthopedic trauma and vascular surgery procedures.
