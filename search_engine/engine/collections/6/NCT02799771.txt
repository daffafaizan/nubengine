    
      Pre capillary pulmonary hypertension (PH) may be present in patients with diffuse
      interstitial lung disease.

      In this context, PH represents an important factor of morbidity and mortality for these
      patients.

      As in HYPID, the main purpose of HYPID-2 is to determine predictive factors of mortality
      within this cohort of incident patients (i.e patients included within 6 months after PH
      diagnosis).

      In order to reach that aim,the study includes an evaluation based on exams conducted for the
      routine follow-up of incident patients.

      Each incident patient will be followed during 2 years at least.
