      Western world. Catheter-based removal of blood clots (endovascular therapy-EVT) is now the
      standard of care for AIS caused by large vessel occlusions in the brain. The level of blood
      pressure during the procedure appears to influence outcome. However, optimal blood pressure
      management strategy has not been determined. Current blood pressure management strategy
      during EVT typically aims to maintain blood pressure above or within predefined fixed targets
      and is based on observational data and expert consensus rather than on high-quality
      randomized evidence. Should blood pressure during removal of the occlusion be managed
      according to the patient's individual blood pressure level or according to predefined fixed
      blood pressure targets? The primary aim of this pilot trial is to determine whether
      randomization to a procedure strategy targeting a predefined mean arterial blood pressure
      (MABP) of 70-90 mmHg versus an individual strategy targeting Â± 10 % of a MABP reference value
      is feasible. Secondary aims are to test recruitability and to detect challenges or obstacles
      that would call for changes in the study design.
