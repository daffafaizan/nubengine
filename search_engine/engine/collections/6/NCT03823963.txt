      applied in addition to standard pressure ulcer prevention protocol, in a French hospital
      setting, in at-risk patients in a cardiovascular surgery unit with full hospitalisation
      including block operation and ICU.

      Hypothesis: Patients treated with Mepilex® Border dressings will have a lower incidence rate
      of sacral pressure ulcer development than patients receiving standard care.
