      Primary

        -  Evaluate the efficacy of bexarotene at a dose of 375 mg daily for 4 days with tretinoin
           also for the same 3 days with chemotherapy in patients with advanced non-small cell lung
           cancer.

        -  Evaluate the safety and tolerability of this drug combination.

      OUTLINE: Patients will receive oral bexarotene 375 mg once daily and oral tretinoin 50 mg
      twice daily on days 1-3. Patients also receive combination chemotherapy comprising cisplatin
      or carboplatin with docetaxel and capecitabine orally or intravenously on days 1-3. Treatment
      repeats every 14 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients will be followed every 4 weeks.
