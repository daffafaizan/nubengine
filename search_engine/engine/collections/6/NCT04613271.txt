      was carried out to assess whether the subjects met the inclusion and exclusion criteria.
      Randomization was performed to determine the study drug allocation. The research subjects
      were inpatients at selected hospitals and at the time of recruitment, the time was called D1.
      The next day is called D2 and so on Follow-up will be carried out from the first day of
      recruitment, taking medication up to a maximum of 19 days for test drugs and 11 days for SoC
      drugs. Recording of clinical and laboratory manifestations will be carried out from
      recruitment until the patient returns from the hospital.

      All results will be recorded in a case report form, and if a case of clinical and laboratory
      manifestations is found to be severe, it will be written on the adverse case report form and
      reported immediately according to standard GCP procedures. Subjects may also drop out of the
      study due to discontinuation of follow-up or a protocol violation
