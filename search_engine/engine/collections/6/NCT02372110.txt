      and the development of appropriate early interventions are critical. However, due to the
      mutually reinforcing nature of anxiety sensitivity (a key component of anxiety disorders) and
      physiological sensations associated with anxiety, no previous studies have examined these two
      variables separately in response to an acute stressor. The proposed study aims to investigate
      these two variables independently using a paradigm combining hydrocortisone, caffeine, and
      TSST.

      It is hypothesized that when an individual's physiological stress responses (SNS and HPA
      axis) are enhanced, he or she will experience greater subjective stress and a lesser sense of
      mastery in response to an acute stressor (e.g., the TSST). In addition, anxiety sensitivity
      will moderate subjective ratings of stress and mastery, such that individuals high on anxiety
      sensitivity will rate the TSST as more subjectively stressful and their performance as less
      effectual compared to individuals low on anxiety sensitivity, due to greater vigilance of
      interoceptive responses and internal stimuli.
