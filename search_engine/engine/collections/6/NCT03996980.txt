      cause malalignment of the lower extremity.There is a wide variety of treatments for CLBP, and
      it is suggested that excessive pronation of the foot has been linked to CLBP.The use of
      compensating custom-made foot orthoses has not been entirely explored as an effective therapy
      for CLBP.

      Customized foot orthoses alter the position of the foot during weight-bearing. The goal is to
      eliminate compensation of the foot due to structural deformity or misalignment and
      redistribute abnormal plantar pressures.Custom-made foot orthoses may contribute to improving
      chronic low back pain. This question represents an important benefit for patients and for the
      public health system by reducing expensive treatments, such as surgery or long periods of
      rehabilitation
