      Primary

        -  Determine the non-progression rate in patients with recurrent or refractory aggressive
           fibromatosis after 3 months of treatment with imatinib mesylate.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the non-progression rate in patients after being treated with this drug for 12
           months.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the tolerance to this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the response rate in patients treated with this drug

        -  Determine progression free and overall survival of patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the quality of life of patients treated with this drug.

        -  Correlate clinical, biological, and genomic markers with response and long-term stable
           disease in patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate once daily for up to 12 months in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 39 patients will be accrued for this study.
