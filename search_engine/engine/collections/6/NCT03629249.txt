      parallel-group study to determine the ability of fevipiprant (QAW039) plus standard-of-care
      (SoC) compared with placebo plus SoC to reduce the use of systemic corticosteroids (SCS) in
      patients with severe asthma. The study included:

        -  a Screening period of up to 2 weeks to assess eligibility;

        -  a Run-in period of 4 or 10 weeks to evaluate maintenance of asthma control and to
           collect baseline safety data. The Run-in period was 4 weeks for patients coming with
           high-dose ICS/LABA (inhaled corticosteroids/long-acting beta-agonist) and 10 weeks for
           patients switching from mid-dose to high-dose ICS/LABA as per protocol during the run-in
           period;

        -  a Treatment period of 52 weeks. Upon completion of the Run-in period, all patients who
           met eligibility criteria were randomized to 1 of 3 treatment groups (fevipiprant 150 mg
           or 450 mg or placebo once daily) in a ratio 1:1:1. Randomized patients were stratified
           according to their peripheral blood eosinophil count (< 250 cells/μl or ≥ 250 cells/μl);

        -  a Follow-up period of 2 weeks following the last dose of study drug to collect
           additional data for safety variables.

      The main purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of fevipiprant (150 mg and 450
      mg once daily), compared with placebo, as add-on to GINA (Global Initiative for Asthma)
      treatment step 4 or 5 SoC asthma therapy in terms of avoidance of SCS use over 52 weeks in
      patients with inadequately controlled severe asthma and high eosinophil counts (eosinophil
      count at Visit 1 ≥250 cells/ μl) and in the overall patient population regardless of
      eosinophil counts.

      On 16-Dec-2019 the sponsor decided to terminate study CQAW039A2323 earlier than the planned
      study completion. There were no safety findings with fevipiprant that contributed to this
      decision. The planned treatment period of 52 weeks was not completed by any patient; patients
      were treated for a median time of 14 weeks in each group and a maximum of up to 36 weeks.
