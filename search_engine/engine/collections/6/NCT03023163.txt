      screening via telephone and a detailed, in-person screening. Eligible subjects will be
      invited to participate in a 4 hour laboratory visit during which their arterial stiffness,
      blood pressure, heart rate, respiration rate and, blood flow to the brain will be monitored
      at rest and during a comprehensive series of cognitive tests. For Study 1 (cross-sectional),
      40 older (50-75 years) individuals with SCI and 20 age-matched non-SCI controls will be
      recruited. For study 2 (longitudinal), 30 individuals (28-54 years) with SCI and 20
      age-matched non-SCI will be recruited from previous enrollment in the Impact of Age on
      Cardiovascular, Cerebrovascular and Cognitive Health in SCI study to learn the longitudinal
      changes in cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and cognitive health.
