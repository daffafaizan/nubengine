      patient will experience painful sensations in their calves when they walked which slowly
      become excruciating painful at rest. When the condition worsens, the patients will not be
      able to feel any pain from their legs and they will not know if there are any small ulcers or
      cuts on their legs. As a result, a small ulcer which goes unnoticed becomes bigger and can
      sometimes become infected. In the worst situations, infection might lead towards gangrene and
      septicaemia. Severe rest pain and/or ulcerations of ischemic limbs are defined as the state
      of chronic critical limb ischemia and at this point, amputation of the affected limb is
      suggested.

      Conventional treatments include angioplasty/bypass operation to remove blood vessel blockage
      to restore blood supply, the use of prescribed medicines to aid in ulcer recovery and clear
      infection and debridement of damaged/infected tissue. Some procedures have to be performed
      multiple times. Amputation is inevitable in many cases because some blood capillaries cannot
      be corrected and restenosis of vessels is very common. Cell therapy with mononuclear cells
      and mesenchymal stem cells from bone marrow is promising because these stem cells are capable
      of stimulating and regenerating capillaries and blood vessels.
