      treating patients with AQP4-IgG seropositive NMOSD.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety of the tanCART-19/20 cells in treating NMOSD patients. II. Determine
      duration of in vivo survival of tanCART-19/20 cells.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the efficacy of the tanCART-19/20 cells in treating NMOSD patients.

      II. The secondary outcome measures: annual relapse rate (ARR), Expanded Disability Status
      Scale Score(EDDS), Best Corrected Visual Acuity (Log MAR), Spectral-Domain Optical Coherence
      Tomography (SD-OCT), Flash Visual Evoked Potential (FVEP) and Immunological assessments.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive anti-CD19/20-CAR (coupled with CD137 and CD3 zeta signalling
      domains) vector-transduced autologous T cells on days 0 in the absence of unacceptable
      toxicity. The infusion dose is 1E5-2E6 CAR positive T cells/kg, and dose escalation methods
      obey the traditional 3+3 design (three doses groups: 1-2E5, 3-6E5, 1-2E6 CAR-T cells).

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed intensively for 6 months, every 6
      months for 2 years, and annually thereafter for 3 years.
