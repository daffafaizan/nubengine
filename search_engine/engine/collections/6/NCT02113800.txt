      investigator evaluated phosphorylated Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and effectors in a
      series of NEC G3 at the Charit√© Center. Everolimus showed antiproliferative effects in
      bronchial NET.

      In a second approach the data of this study should be the basis to generate another study to
      further explore everolimus as maintenance therapy in NEC G3/ NET G3.
