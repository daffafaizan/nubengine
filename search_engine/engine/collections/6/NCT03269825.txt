      failure - mainly hypoxaemia - has increased over recent years. Similar to the general
      population in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), these patients become deconditioned, severely
      weak (ICU acquired weakness- ICUAW) and require prolonged rehabilitation after disconnection
      from VV-ECMO. However, data regarding the magnitude of muscle wasting and recovery in this
      specific group is lacking.

      Both poor muscle quantity and quality have been found to be a predictor or poor outcome. As
      all patients receiving VV-ECMO at our hospital will get an initial CT scan of their chest,
      abdomen and pelvis, these CT scans will be used to measure muscle quantity and quality of
      different muscle groups of the abdomen at admission and then using any follow-up CT scan
      performed within 10 days. In addition, the relationship between the loss of muscle over the
      course of VV-ECMO and perceived recovery of renal function at ICU discharge will be
      investigated.
