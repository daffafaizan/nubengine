      has the highest morbidity and mortality worldwide among all the malignant tumors. Due to the
      popularization of low-dose CT and other means of examination, more and more patients with
      lung cancer are detected in the early phase of disease. Anatomical segmentectomy is one of
      the standard surgical procedures for these small pulmonary nodules or ground glass opacity
      (GGO), which are clinically highly suspected or puncture confirmed early lung cancer lesions.
      Dissection of the intersegmental plane in segmentectomy is a difficulty that have puzzled
      thoracic surgeons for decades because of the complicated anatomic relationship and
      variations, along with lack of boundary between pulmonary segments. There are two main
      approaches in the dissection of intersegmental plane: stapling devices and energy instrument
      separation. However, only a few retrospective studies focused on the perioperative outcomes
      of these two approaches in segmentectomy, not to mention in robot assisted segmentectomy, and
      there has been no definitive conclusion about which method is better. So the investigators
      want to conduct a prospective study, trying to figure out this problem.

      The investigators set incidence rate of postoperative complications as their primary
      endpoint. According to their calculation, a total of 136 patients will be enrolled (each
      group has 68 patients).
