      need to identify factors that regulate cholesterol efflux to effectively advance the clinical
      development of cholesterol efflux as both a risk prediction marker and as a target of
      therapy. The investigator's long-term goal is to determine whether modulating cholesterol
      efflux prevents or reverses cardiovascular disease. The overall objective of this study is to
      systematically create a family pedigree and biobank repository of blood and DNA from
      participants from the Dallas Heart Study with extreme low or high cholesterol efflux, with
      the specific aims of : 1) determining the heritability of and genomic factors associated with
      cholesterol efflux, and 2) identifying the protein and lipid signature of extreme low and
      high cholesterol efflux in a sex- and ethnicity-specific manner. The investigator's central
      hypothesis is that a combination of genetic variation in lipid transporters as well as
      proteins and lipids will be most strongly correlated with variation in efflux.

      DHS probands and their relatives (parents, siblings, adult children, grandparents,
      aunts/uncles, cousins) with extreme low or high cholesterol efflux will be recruited to
      establish a prospective family pedigree cohort and understand the heritability of extreme
      cholesterol efflux. Investigators will collect the following information from all
      participants: demographics, health history, lifestyle measures, and medications. Blood will
      be collected on-site by venipuncture and plasma, serum, and cells will be stored at -80o
      Celsius. All efflux measurements will be completed in the investigator's laboratory.
