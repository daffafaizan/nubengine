      the standard management, the study group will be given TXA 1 gm (100 mg/ml) slowly
      intravenous infusion during delivery after clamping of the cord (administered over 10 minutes
      at 1 ml/minute).

      The second dose of TXA 1 g Intravenous can be given if:

        -  Bleeding continues after 30 minutes

        -  Bleeding restarts within 24 hours of completing the first dose While the control group
           will not be given TXA and we will compare the results in both groups (amount of blood
           loss during operation to assess efficacy of TXA in prevention of PPH and reduction of
           intra and postoperative blood loss and to assess its safety and benefit in the reduction
           of incidence of hysterectomy or blood transfusion requirements).
