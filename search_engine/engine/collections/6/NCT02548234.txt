      impairment (Barker 1997), and impairment of the arm explains up to 50% of the variance in
      functional limitation after stroke. Brain imaging research using magnetoencephalography found
      that mirror therapy combined with bilateral arm training could potentially aid stroke
      rehabilitation by normalizing an asymmetrical pattern of movement-related beta
      desynchronization in primary motor cortex. However, different neural mechanisms may cause
      different effect of motor control recovery after the two different approaches, which have yet
      to be studied. Study purposeï¼šTo compare the efficacy of mirror therapy and bilateral arm
      training on movement strategies of the affected upper extremity and functional outcome in
      chronic stroke patients. Study method: This was a single-blind, randomized, comparative
      efficacy research. Sixty participants with chronic stroke will be recruited in the
      occupational therapy clinics at four hospitals and randomly assigned to the mirror therapy
      and bilateral arm training groups. The intervention will consist of 1.5 hrs/day, 5 days/wk
      for 4 wks, including 3 days of hospital-based therapy and 5 days of home practice. Primary
      outcomes were muscular properties (grip strength) and sensorimotor measurements. Secondary
      outcomes included measures of daily functions to gain insight about movement capabilities.
      The validity and reliability of all measurements have been proposed. Finally, the
      Mann-Whitney U test and the Fisher exact test will be used to compare the significant
      differences between the two approaches. The effect size of dependent variables will be
      reported also.
