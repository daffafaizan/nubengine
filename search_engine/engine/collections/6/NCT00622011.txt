      Risperidone or Zotepine. Autonomic dysfunction is checked using analysis of heart rate
      variability before any active drug given. The initial starting dose of each drug is
      1mg(risperidone) or 50 mg(zotepine) once a day. The dosage was increased depending on the
      status of delirium during the first 7 days and will be adjusted until patients are maximally
      stabilized or until intolerable adverse events necessitated cessation. Risperidone or
      zotepine will be tapered off in 10 days when patients are considered stable. No concomitant
      psychotropic medications will be used during the study except for lorazepam, which are given
      for severe agitation or insomnia . Patients are assessed by another rater blinded to active
      drug at the time of enrollment, the subsequent 12, 24,and then assessed daily until
      discharge. The study period is estimated to be around 12 months upon the designed number of
      subjects are reached.
