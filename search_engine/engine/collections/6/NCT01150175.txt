      morbidity worldwide. Despite the optimal use of anti-anginal medications and coronary
      revascularization, a large number of patients with CAD suffer from severe symptoms with
      disabling angina and heart failure (HF). Experimental and pilot clinical studies provided
      evidence of the safety and potential efficacy of a strategy of intramyocardial
      transplantation of autologous bone marrow (BM) cells for neovascularisation of chronically
      ischemic myocardium. Nevertheless, the possible potent placebo effect on symptoms observed in
      these pilot studies highlights the need for a randomized, placebo-controlled group to prove
      the clinical efficacy of cell based angiogenic therapy for treatment of severe CAD.
