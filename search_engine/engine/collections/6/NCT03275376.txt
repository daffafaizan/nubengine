      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the second leading cause of cancer death worldwide,
      including the condition in Taiwan, and the management of HCC is an important challenge in
      public health. Target therapy with sorafenib is the standard of treatment for advanced HCC
      (vascular invasion or extrahepatic metastasis), but the patient survival time is still
      unsatisfactory. In recent years, growing evidences, including mechanism analysis, have
      suggested the anitneoplastic effects of statin, and a recent pooled analysis found that
      statin use may be associated with improved survival in patients with metastatic rencal cell
      carcinoma. However, a prospective clinical trial of statin sorafenib combination therapy in
      the treatment of advanced HCC is lacking.

      Aims:

        1. To prove statins improve the overall survival for patients who receive sorafenib therapy
           for advanced HCC by a prospective randomized controlled study.

        2. To prove statin can improve tumor responses and the progression free survival for
           patients who receive sorafenib therapy for advanced HCC by a prospective randomized
           controlled study.

      Methods:

      This randomized placebo-controlled study will prospectively enroll patients who receiving
      sorafenib therapy for advanced HCC in the Taichung Veterans General Hospital, and statin or
      placebo will be statin or placebo will be administered according to randomized allocations.
      Tumor responses, time to tumor progression, and survival time will be followed and recorded
