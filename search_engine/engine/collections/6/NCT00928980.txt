      Disorder consists of maintenance antidepressant medication. Mindfulness-based cognitive
      therapy (MBCT) is a recently developed psychological intervention that appears to be
      promising in terms of preventing relapse or recurrence in patients with recurrent depression.
      It consists of 8 weekly group sessions in which meditation exercises are combined with
      cognitive therapeutic elements such as identifying negative thoughts and monitoring and
      scheduling activities.

      In this study, the (cost)effectiveness of a) MBCT on its own, b) antidepressant medication on
      its own and c) the combination of MBCT and antidepressant medication will be investigated in
      350 patients with recurrent depression who are currently in remission.
