      outcome has been described primarily in case reports. Although recently, larger studies
      describing adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with sleep disordered breathing has begun to
      emerge, these studies often lack polysomnographic data and the true prevalence of sleep
      disordered breathing in pregnancy is not known. We intend to recruit 100 women at the third
      trimester of pregnancy, who are admitted to the high risk pregnancy unit with pre-eclampsia,
      gestational diabetes, or premature labor. An additional group of 50 women at the third
      trimester of an uncomplicated pregnancy will be recruited. All women will fill questionnaires
      regarding the pregnancy and their sleep and will undergo an overnight sleep study. Women will
      then be followed until birth. Pregnancy complication, birth and perinatal course will be
      recorded. Cord blood will be collected from all infants and evaluated for inflammatory
      cytokines, reactive oxygen species and growth factors. Infants will then be followed for 1
      year. Their growth, development and intercurrent illnesses will be recorded.
