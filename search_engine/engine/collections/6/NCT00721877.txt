      I. To determine the effect of resveratrol on human cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme activity in
      healthy adult participants.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the modulation effect on phase II detoxification enzymes. II. To evaluate
      safety in participants treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants receive oral resveratrol once daily for 4 weeks.

      Patients complete a daily diary documenting adverse events and an intake calendar for
      recording the daily intake of any non-routine medications.

      Participants undergo blood sample collection periodically. Lymphocytes are isolated and
      analyzed for baseline GST activity and level. Serum is analyzed to determine bilirubin levels
      to be used as surrogate UGT 1A1 activity. Analyses of CYP probe drugs will be performed using
      high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) assays. A sensitive ELISA assay will be used
      for quantitative analyses. Urine samples are collected periodically and drug and metabolite
      levels will be analyzed.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed for 2 weeks.
