      scan (C-CT) to a low dose computed tomography scan (L-CT) in the assessment of articular
      displacement, and development of a treatment plan for intraarticular distal radius fractures
      in an effort to reduce the radiation exposure to future patients with this injury pattern.
      Reviewers will be tasked with reporting data aimed at investigating 3 primary outcome
      measures: 1) Are L-CT images of sufficient quality to be used for diagnostic purposes, 2) Can
      accurate measurements of step and gap displacement be made on L-CT images, 3) Do proposed
      treatment plans change with the use of L-CT relative to those chosen based on C-CT images We
      hypothesize that reviewers will find L-CT images of sufficient image quality for diagnostic
      purposes, measurements of step and gap displacement will not be significantly different
      between L-CT and C-CT, and no significant differences in treatment options will be chosen
      based on the use of L-CT rather than C-CT for the same fracture. The secondary aim will be to
      evaluate the interobserver and intraobserver reliability of L-CT in evaluating intraarticular
      fractures of the distal radius.
