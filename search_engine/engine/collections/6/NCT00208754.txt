      surviving into adulthood. However, the surgical procedures these children undergo do not cure
      the underlying problem and this these children develop other heart problems later in life.
      Heart failure is the one of the most common heart problems effecting these patients. This
      heart failure can be seen in both lower pumping chambers of the heart, however, sometimes
      only one side of the heart is affected. Since there are several congenital heart defects that
      are now seen in the adult population, an understanding of what causes heart failure in this
      patient population can help physicians develop better treatments for this condition. The goal
      of this study is to review the medical records of 350 adult patients with congenital heart
      disease that has developed heart failure. During this review, we plan to collect information
      regarding the various treatments utilized in these patients and to determine if there are any
      common elements regarding the development of heart failure in adult patients with CHD.
