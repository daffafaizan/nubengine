      11% in men and 16% in women. A recent avenue of research suggests a role for
      religion/spirituality in the prevention of and recovery from depression. It has been
      hypothesized that religion/spirituality acts as a coping resource in distressing life
      situations including illness and loss and may address the struggles of depressed patients of
      feeling separated from their surrounding world, as well as from their inner self. Majority of
      the research conducted to date on this topic has been observational and focused on the
      religious denomination, primarily the Christian and Muslim faiths. However, given the
      distinction between spirituality and religion and since a growing portion of the Canadian
      population identifies themselves as nonreligious but spiritual (10), it is pertinent to
      explore whether there is a role for a nondenominational spiritual intervention as a mental
      health resource. Considering the burden of depression on an individual and social level and
      need for effective and accessible treatment options, evaluation of spirituality based
      approaches is highly relevant. This study aims to assess whether nurturing spiritual coping
      resources in a non-faith based way may play a therapeutic role in recovery from major
      depression in adults.
