      approached for consent to test one of two new methods of EEG recording. Patients will be
      randomized to the new epidermal electronic system (EES) or the a hydrogel EKG electrode. All
      patients will continue to receive the standard of care EEG monitoring.

      EES is slim new temporary tattoo technology that can easily be applied to the skin without
      requiring a technician or scrubbing and preparation as with standard EEG lead. The hydrogel
      EKG are FDA approved leads normally used to detect cardiac rhythm.

      Specific Aims:

        1. To compare the rate of detection of neonatal seizures between a new method of recording
           electrical brain rhythms (EES or EKG) and the current standard of care (EEG, or
           electroencephalography.)

        2. To compare characterization of electrical brain activity between EES or EKG and EEG in
           the neonate.
