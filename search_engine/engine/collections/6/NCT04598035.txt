    
      The broad research goal of this study is to examine the extent to which arterial blood
      pressure (BP) and blood markers related to hypertension and kidney function are reduced in a
      prospective cohort of patients undergoing implantation of an epidural spinal cord stimulator
      (SCS) for the purpose of managing chronic pain in the lower back and/or limbs.

      Specific aims:

        1. Examine the extent to which BP (primary variable), norepinephrine (marker of sympathetic
           nerve activity in the blood), and a vascular ultrasound scan are improved following the
           implant of a SCS device among patients with chronic pain and hypertension.

        2. Examine the extent to which markers of kidney function in the blood [serum creatinine,
           glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and blood urea nitrogen (BUN)] are reduced following
           the implant of a SCS device among patients with chronic pain and hypertension.

        3. Determine the extent to which BP predicts reductions in pain following the implant of a
           SCS device.
