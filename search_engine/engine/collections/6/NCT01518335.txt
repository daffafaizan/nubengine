      sprains.This new treatment is called Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) therapy and involves
      injecting concentrated platelet's from a patient's own blood into the site of injury to aid
      healing. Platelets, aside from their clotting capabilities also serve a role in
      re-vascularization of tissue as well as collagen repair. PRP therapy has been used in sports
      medicine for treatment of chronic injuries but has yet to be proven effective in acute injury
      of a joint. The investigators are comparing treatment and placebo groups based on a
      subjective patient questionnaire and pain score administered on the day of injury and 2-3
      days and 8-10 days follow up.
