      generation via our novel point of care thrombin generation assay as well as calibrated
      automated thrombography will be measured at four time points: (1) before surgery; (2) before
      CPB initiation; (3) post-CPB after reversal of heparin; (4) and after chest closure before
      leaving the operating room. Clinicians will remain blinded to the measures. Recruitment will
      continue until we enroll 50 patients with significant impaired thrombin generation capacity
      (>50% drop from baseline) and 50 patients who receive hemostatic therapies. Patients will be
      followed for 12 hours postoperatively to assess for bleeding outcomes.
