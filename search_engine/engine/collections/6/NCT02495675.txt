      of acute respiratory failure. In hospitalised hypoxemic patients, recent clinical evidence
      showed that HFOT can reduce endotracheal intubation and reduce mortality. Physiologically,
      the HFOT causes a decrease in respiratory rate and minute-ventilation and may be associated
      with a decrease in carbone dioxyde arterial pressure. It is possible that these effects are
      associated with decreased work of breathing, which could explain some of the benefits in
      terms of comfort and efficiency.

      The objective of this research is to evaluate the impact of a wash-out of anatomical dead
      space by high flow nasal cannulas on respiratory parameters and on the work of breathing
      among healthy subjects. The investigators will evaluate the baseline status in room air, and
      then compare it with four different levels of flow. The primary endpoint will be the work of
      breathing.
