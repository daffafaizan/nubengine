      named Endo.Angel, which is used to monitor the velocity of insertion of the endoscope, record
      the time of insertion and withdrawal of the endoscope, and remind endoscopists of the blind
      areas caused by intestinal segment slipping.Criteria for inclusion and exclusion are
      determined prior to endoscopic examination. Candidates who meet all inclusion criteria as
      well as do not meet all exclusion criteria are bring into the study. Participants randomized
      before the examination, they are divided into the exposed group assisted by Endo.Angel or the
      non-exposed group without Endo.Angel. Followup are conducted after the examination.Study will
      be finished when all followup is done,and the examination result collected from participants
      will send to an independent review data analysis group.
