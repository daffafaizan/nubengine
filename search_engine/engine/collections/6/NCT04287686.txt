    
      This is a small pilot study investigating whether there is any efficacy signal that warrants
      a larger Phase 2B trial, or any harm that suggests that such a trial should not be done. It
      is not expected to produce statistically significant results in the major endpoints. The
      investigators will examine all of the biologic, physiological, and clinical data to determine
      whether a Phase 2B trial is warranted.

      Primary efficacy analysis will be carried only on patients receiving at least 4 doses of
      active drug. Safety analysis will be carried out on all patients receiving at least one dose
      of active drug.

      It is planned to enroll more than or equal to 24 subjects with COVID-19. It is expected to
      have at least 12 evaluable patients in each group.

      Experimental group: 0.4 mg/kg rhACE2 IV BID and standard of care Control group: standard of
      care

      Intervention duration: up to 7 days of therapy

      No planned interim analysis.
