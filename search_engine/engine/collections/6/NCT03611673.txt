      retraining protocol. Baseline olfaction will be tested with a currently commercially
      available smell test as well as an essential oil based smell test. The protocol involves
      twice daily retraining where the participant inhales the scent and makes a mental note of
      what they should be smelling. The training period is six months total with a visit at 3
      months to re-assess smell function as well as at six months.
