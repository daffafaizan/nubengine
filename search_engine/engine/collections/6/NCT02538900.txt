      self-paced walking exercise; Group 2: Standard high intensity, ischemic pain-inducing walking
      exercise; Group 3: Non-exercising attention control group. The low and high intensity
      exercise groups will attend center-based exercise sessions once per week for four weeks
      followed by transition to an entirely home-based exercise program for an additional 48 weeks
      (52 weeks total). Coaches will contact participants weekly by telephone after the first four
      weeks of the intervention. The low and high intensity exercise interventions will use
      identical self-regulatory and support strategies. However, the low intensity exercise group
      will be instructed to exercise with minimal to no ischemic leg discomfort and the high
      intensity group will be instructed to exercise to maximal ischemic leg pain. These two
      distinct exercise prescriptions will be reinforced during 48 weeks of home-based exercise,
      using a well-validated behavioral coaching model that can be delivered by telephone once
      weekly. Our primary outcome is change in six-minute walk distance at 52-week follow-up. If
      our hypotheses are correct, millions of people with PAD will benefit from this alternative
      exercise regimen which will be accessible to most of the 8 million people in the U.S. who
      suffer from PAD.
