      associated with aging.

      The computed dynamic posturographic EquiTest® System and Smart BalanceMaster by NeuroCom®
      International, Inc, Clackamas, OR, USA) provide a qualitative and quantitative analysis of
      the balance function through the description of the subject's center of gravity (COG) sway.

      Sensory Organization Test and Sensory Analysis norms are provided for age groups (20-59;
      60-69; 70-79) up to 79yrs, whilst they lack in the international literature for subjects
      80+yrs, nonetheless being necessary in the understanding of balance performance from a
      quantitative point of view.

      Subjects 80+yrs are evaluated with EquiTest® System and Smart BalanceMaster to provide mean
      values and normative data.

      In order to assess the reliability of the instrumental evaluation was repeated (T1) two weeks
      later (±2 days).
