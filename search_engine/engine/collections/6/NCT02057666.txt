      randomised, followed by a Double Blind Treatment Period. Patients initially received
      tasquinimod (or corresponding placebo) at a 0.25 mg/day dose which was then titrated through
      0.5 mg/day (from Day 15) to a maximum of 1 mg/day (from Day 29). If tolerability issues arose
      at 0.5 or 1 mg/day, patients had their dose reduced to 0.25 or 0.5 mg/day, respectively. The
      Double Blind Treatment Period continued until the death of the patient or any criterion for
      withdrawal from study treatment was reached. Any placebo treated patients with radiological
      disease progression confirmed by the central imaging assessment, who remained asymptomatic or
      mildly symptomatic were, at the Investigator's discretion, given the option to continue on
      active treatment (tasquinimod) during an Open-Label Treatment Period, following the same
      titration rule described above until progression under active treatment. All other patients
      stopped study treatment.

      An End-of-Study Treatment/Withdrawal Visit was to be performed within 14 days after the last
      dose of study treatment and patients were then to be followed up every 6 months until 80% of
      the patients had died or 2 years after the last patient was randomised, whichever occurred
      last.

      A PK ancillary study was to be performed in a subgroup of 12 Asian-Chinese patients before
      randomisation; however, due to the early termination of this study, only some samples were
      analysed and no PK analyses were performed.
