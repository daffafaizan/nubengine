      of lapatinib and trastuzumab (plus endocrinetherapy in ER-positive breast cancer) versus
      trastuzumab and chemotherapy in heavily pretreated patient population with HER2-positive MBC
      and to investigate the predictive role of cfDNA for detection of HER2 gene amplification on
      patients' outcome. The presence of circulating free DNA (cfDNA) for detection of HER2 gene
      amplification was associated with worse prognosis and seems to allow early response
      evaluation. However, many aspects of the role of cfDNA detection in patients undergoing
      molecular target agents such as trastuzumab or lapatinib are not well described. With the
      availability of improved and standardized techniques for cfDNA detection, it should now be
      possible to examine several of these important questions within a prospective multicenter
      study and a striking potential of cfDNA for detection of HER2 gene amplification might enable
      a more individual and optimized antimetastatic therapy inpatients with cancer.
