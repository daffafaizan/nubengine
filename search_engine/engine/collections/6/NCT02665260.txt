      Pediatric Dermatology clinic at Montefiore Medical Center. One hundred eligible participants
      were randomly assigned to receive cantharidin 0.7% topical, cantharidin 0.7% topical with
      occlusion, placebo, or placebo with occlusion. Treatments were applied at weeks 0 and 3
      (blinded phase). At week 6, all participants were treated with open-label, topical
      cantharidin 0.7% without occlusion every 3 weeks until all lesions resolved (open-label
      phase).
