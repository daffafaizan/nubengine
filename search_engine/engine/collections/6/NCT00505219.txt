    
      This study is an event-driven, multi-center, prospective, independent observer-blinded,
      controlled, randomized Phase III clinical trial enrolling patients diagnosed with University
      of Pennsylvania (Steinberg) Classification Stage IIB or C osteonecrosis of the femoral head.

        -  The first patient group is the Treatment Group and will receive core decompression and
           treatment with BRCs and demineralized bone matrix bound in autologous plasma, and

        -  The second patient group is the Control Group and will receive core decompression and
           demineralized bone matrix bound in autologous plasma, without any BRCs.

        -  Enrollment: With an anticipated drop-out rate of 10% in up to twenty (20) sites, a total
           of approximately 135 patients will be enrolled and randomized to obtain 120 evaluable
           patients (75 for the TRC treatment group and 45 for the Control treatment group).

        -  Primary endpoint: The percentage of patients progressing to a more severe UPenn disease
           stage (Stage II to III or higher) between 0 and 24 months will be the primary efficacy
           variable to demonstrate TRC therapy is superior to Control therapy.
