      study. Once the Permission/Assent form has been completed, a cuff will be applied to the arm
      and the pressure tonometer will be used on various vessels. Cardiovascular data will be
      recorded. The procedure is non-invasive, will last approximately 10 minutes and will be
      performed during a routine clinic visit. Onset of diabetes and level of diabetic control as
      measured by the most recent Hbg A1c (relative to the study visit) will be obtained from the
      medical record. Microalbumin levels covering the prior 12 months will be collected from the
      medical record of diabetic subjects.
