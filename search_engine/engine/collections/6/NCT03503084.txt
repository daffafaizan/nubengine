      lipid and glucose metabolism are not fully understood. This study investigated the short term
      effect of TCC exercise on lipid and glucose metabolism and endothelial function in TCC
      practitioners. Twenty-one TCC practitioners and nineteen normal controls were included in
      this study. The hemodynamics, serum insulin, indices of insulin resistance/sensitivity, serum
      endothelin-1 (ET-1), blood lipids and aldosterone before and 30 min after a rest or a session
      of classical Yang's TCC exercise were compared.
