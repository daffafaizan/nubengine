      AML or high risk MDS at this time, and with current treatment, tumor reduction can be
      difficult to achieve and is short-lived. We are, therefore, interested in developing new
      drugs that might have a longer-lasting effect against disease.

      Laromustine is a new drug that has been shown to have anti-cancer activity in animal and
      human studies. It interacts with the DNA of a cancer cell and kills the cell. Cytarabine
      (AraC) is a commercially available chemotherapy drug that is active against leukemia and used
      routinely when the disease is first diagnosed. In previous studies, when higher doses of
      laromustine were given, laromustine and AraC achieved more responses than patients treated
      with AraC alone. However, this advantage was offset by the fact that more patients given
      laromustine/AraC died to due side effects. We wish to determine the effectiveness of
      laromustine in combination with infusional AraC in AML and high risk MDS patients who are 60
      or more years of age.
