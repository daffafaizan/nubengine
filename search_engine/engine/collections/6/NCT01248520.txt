      influenza infections impart disproportionate morbidity and mortality among gravidas. The
      influenza vaccine represents a viable, preventive health intervention to mitigate disease
      burden for gravidas and their neonates. Despite the safety and efficacy of influenza
      vaccines, suboptimal maternal vaccination rates (13-24%) persist nationwide. Barriers to
      influenza vaccination during pregnancy include patient concerns about vaccine safety and
      unappreciated risk of influenza infection. Cellular phone text messaging has emerged as an
      innovative technology with advantages of ubiquity, rapid, confidential information
      transmission, and low cost. Text messaging may represent an effective way to educate pregnant
      women about their particular vulnerability to influenza infection and enhance influenza
      vaccine uptake. We propose a randomized, controlled clinical trial to assess whether text
      messaging to an outpatient obstetric population can improve maternal influenza vaccine
      uptake.
