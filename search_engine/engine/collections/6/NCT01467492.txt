    
      This is a single-arm, open-label, multicenter study of treatment-experienced participants
      with Genotype 1 CHC, who self-identified as Black/African American (Group A) or who did not
      self-identify as Black/African American (Group B). Participants did not achieve a sustained
      virologic response 24 weeks after at least 1 prior course of Peg-IFN-alfa-2a/RBV therapy of
      standard duration, and have 1 of the following viral responses:

        -  Prior relapse: Participant had a documented undetectable hepatitis C virus ribonucleic
           acid (HCV RNA) level at the planned end of treatment of at least 42 weeks duration (HCV
           RNA evaluated anytime between 3 weeks before and 6 weeks after the last dose of Peg
           IFN-alfa-2a or RBV).

        -  Prior null response: Participant had a <2-log10 decrease in HCV RNA at 12 weeks, during
           prior Peg IFN-alfa-2a/RBV treatment, but never achieved undetectable HCV RNA while on
           treatment.

        -  Prior partial response: Participant had a >=2-log10 decrease in HCV RNA at 12 weeks,
           during prior Peg IFN-alfa-2a/RBV treatment, but never achieved undetectable HCV RNA
           while on treatment.
