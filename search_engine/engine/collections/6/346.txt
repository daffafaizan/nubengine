3446. effect of nicl2 on an isolated ranvier nodean attempt was made to explain the extreme prolongation of the nodalpotential by 0.1-1.0 mm nicl2 in terms of the ionic theory.  the effects ofnicl2 at room temperature are similar to those of temperature reductiondecreased maximum rate of rise of the action potential, lengthened actionpotential duration, elevated threshold, increased tendency for repetitiveactivity; in addition, the amplitude of the action potential is slightlyincreased.  the long-lasting plateaus of the responses obtained under thecombined influence of nicl2 and temperature reduction are shortened by cathodalpolarization, strong anodal polarization and decrease of (na)0.  the plateaucan be prematurely terminated by short anodal pulses of critical amplitude;short cathodal pulses reduce the duration of the plateau gradually withincreasing pulse strength.  increased (k)0 prolongs plateau duration; thesteep repolarization phase which normally terminates the plateau isreplaced by a long lasting after-depolarization with stepwise potentialdecline.the amplitude of k-depolarization is not influenced by nicl2 or temperaturereduction.  1.0 mm nicl2 changes the relation between maximum rate ofrise and steady-state polarization; the potential change required for 50%sodium inactivation is +8mv in normal ringer's solution and +16mv in thepresence of 1.0 mm nicl2 (22 c.).  1.0 mm nicl2 increases the time constantof delayed rectification as measured in na-poor solutions at 4 c. by a factorof about 2.  the decrease of action potential under cathodal polarization isslightly delayed by nicl2.  it is concluded that prolongation of the nodalaction potential by nicl2 is due to delayed and reduced inactivation of napermeability and delayed increase of k permeability; part of the nicl2-effectcould be explained by assuming competition between ni++ and ca++ for specificsites at the membrane.
