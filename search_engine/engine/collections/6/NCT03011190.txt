      general population. First symptoms detection and early intervention might help prevent its
      aggravation and further BPD diagnosis. Iconic Therapy is an innovative manual-driven
      psychotherapy to specifically and intensively treat BPD symptoms. Preliminary clinical
      results are good. The aim of the present study is to assess the effectiveness of the Iconic
      Therapy in comparison to a support structured therapy in an ecological setting (Spanish
      public specialized mental health care). The study is planned as a randomized controlled
      prospective trial that will randomize 60 young people (15 to 25 years old) with suicidal
      ideation/self-injuring behaviour and borderline personality traits. Participants will be
      randomly assigned to one of the two groups: Iconic Therapy or support structured therapy on a
      1:1 basis. Both the Iconic Therapy and the support therapy programs consist of 10-12 weekly
      sessions delivered by two trained psychologists for about 8-12 outpatients on group format.
      The primary outcome measure is the change of symptoms severity assessed by the Borderline
      Personality Disorder List (BSL-23). Secondary outcomes include suicidal ideation and
      behavior, non-suicidal self-injures maladjustment to the daily life and economic evaluation
      for health care. Assessments will be performed at baseline after the intervention 6 and 12
      months of follow-up. It is hypothesized that those attending the Iconic Therapy group will
      show a permanently reduction of the severity of symptoms as compared with those attending the
      structured support group. Data will be analyzed using generalized estimating equations (GEE)
      models.
