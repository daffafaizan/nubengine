      eye injuries. However, there is no single accepted practice of how to protect the eyes during
      anesthesia, and a variety of different tapes and techniques have been adopted in different
      institutions. In this study, investigators will compare two tapes, TegadermTM and EyeGardÂ® to
      determine if one is less likely to cause eyelid irritation in an effort to improve care for
      future patients.
