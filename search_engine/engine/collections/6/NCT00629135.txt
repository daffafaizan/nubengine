      study. Adult patients with intra-abdominal abscesses matching the criteria to be included
      will be enrolled in the study and randomised into one of the Groups: 1. Moxifloxacin 400 mg,
      administered intravenously once daily in combination with Metronidazole 500 mg, administered
      two times daily intravenously, followed by an oral medication with Moxifloxacin 400 mg once
      daily and Metronidazole 500 mg twice daily. 2. Piperacillin / Tazobactam 4,5 g administered
      intravenously three times daily.

      Primary study endpoints: Clinical success / failure rate at the Test-of-Cure visit.

      Secondary study endpoints: -Bacteriological response at TOC, -Clinical + Bacteriological
      response at End-of-Treatment-visit, - Course of disease on the basis of clinical and
      laboratory parameters, -Time to discharge from hospitals, -Duration of hospitalization
      post-operatively, - safety and tolerability of the study medication, -cost effectiveness of
      treatment regimes.
