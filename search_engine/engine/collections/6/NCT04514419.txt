      trial included screening period (4 weeks) and treatment period (4 treatment cycles, at least
      12 weeks). All eligible subjects were randomly divided into experimental group (hs627
      treatment group) and control group (pertuzumab) treatment group. After 4 treatment cycles,
      the subjects arranged surgical treatment, and then conducted the last visit.
