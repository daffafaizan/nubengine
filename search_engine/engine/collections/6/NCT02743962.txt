      descriptive analysis of their demographics at baseline. Both groups will receive six weeks of
      standard pelvic floor myofascial release by a specialist physiotherapist and one group will
      also use a therapeutic wand twice weekly at home. Outcome measures of bladder urgency, pain,
      health related quality of life and the perceived effect and ease of therapeutic wand use will
      be measured weekly for six weeks of treatment and then six weeks following treatment. A diary
      of therapeutic wand use, release exercises and medication use will also be kept for 3 months.
      Analysis of any significant difference in symptom change between the two groups and of
      subjective ease of wand use will then occur and inform the development of a randomised
      controlled trial.
