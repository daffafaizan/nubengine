      dose propranolol for helping treat fibromyalgia. The investigators plan to compare 20mg twice
      a day dosage of propranolol and 10mg twice a day dosage of propranolol to placebo. The design
      is a 3 arm, double blind randomized control trial. The investigators will also test ECG and
      respiratory assessment as a part of the safety screening and the feasible assessment of
      respiratory sinus arrhythmia.

      Propranolol is not indicated to treat pain. However, the previous studies showed that low
      dose propranolol can re-regulate the adrenergic dysfunction and reduce pain in people with
      chronic musculoskeletal pain. However, the investigators are not aiming to develop a new
      indication of the drug.
