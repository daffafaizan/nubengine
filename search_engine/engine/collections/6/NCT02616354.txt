    
      Compared with Imipenem/Cilastatin 2 hours continuous dosing method and two-step dosing method
      (0.5 hours before enter half dose, after 1.5 hours, the other half of the input dose) of
      blood drug concentration in the body than the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC)
      pathogens percent of dosing interval duration (100% fT > MIC), blood drug concentration in
      the body more than 4 times the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) pathogens percent of
      dosing interval duration (100% fT > 4 MIC), blood drug concentration peak and the ratio of
      the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) pathogens (Cmax/MIC), blood drug concentration
      (Tmax) used in the peak time, used to guide clinical patients with severe infection of
      Imipenem/Cilastatin usage.
