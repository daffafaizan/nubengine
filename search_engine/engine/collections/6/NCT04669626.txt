      proliferation of aerobic and anaerobic micro-organisms on the wound surface, where they
      metabolize healthy tissue which leads to the production of sloughy and even necrotic tissue.
      Wound odour has a big impact on the quality of life of patients. Patients describe living
      with a chronic malodourous wound as devastating particularly in respect to social
      interaction. The key to addressing the negative consequences of malodorous and/or discharging
      wounds is an effective wound managements plan based on accurate and holistic assessment of
      the patient and the wound.

      Currently the standard of care for the management of malodourous wounds are systemic
      antibiotics, absorbent wound dressings with or without activated carbon and, topical
      antimicrobials. The application of topical antimicrobials such as antiseptics against wound
      odour is part of the standard care. One suggested antiseptic in a recent published standard
      is Octenilin速. Octenilin速 wound cleansing solution is on the Swiss market since 2006 and is
      routinely used in outpatient wound care centers. It exhibits good performance in the
      reduction of biofilm's pathogens and has excellent moisturizing properties. While there is
      ample anecdotal evidence about the efficacy of Octenilin速 in reducing wound odour, we propose
      here to document this ability by evaluating the odour of wounds washed with Octenilin速 versus
      standard care (NaCl 0.9% solution).
