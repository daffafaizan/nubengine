      acids in human saliva samples. Data for the validation will include the test results from
      standard nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs (controls) AND matched saliva samples (experimental group)
      of individuals who are either known to be infected or at high risk of being infected.
      Investigators hypothesize that the performance of an assay designed specifically for saliva
      will not perform differently, as defined by a predetermined margin, from the standard assay
      performed on NP and other respiratory samples
