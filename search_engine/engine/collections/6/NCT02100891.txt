    
      Patients will receive a reduced-intensity conditioning regimen for 6 days that consists of
      Fludarabine 150 mg/m2, Cyclophosphamide 29 mg/kg, and 3 Gy total body irradiation (TBI),
      followed by HLA-haploidentical marrow from a family member on Day 0. On Days +3 and +4,
      Cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg will be infused for selective in vivo T cell depletion. Additional
      post-grafting immune suppression will consist of mycophenolate mofetil and either tacrolimus
      or sirolimus.

      Non-mobilized peripheral blood mononuclear cells will be collected from donors on Day +6,
      from which NK cells will be selected and infused into patients on Day +7.

      Patients will be monitored for any transplant-related complications and will undergo disease
      monitoring every three months for the first two years post-transplant. Research studies will
      be conducted to follow the patient's immune status and quality of life post-transplant.
