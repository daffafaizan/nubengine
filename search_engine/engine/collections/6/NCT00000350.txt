      their brain after being injected with a small amount of WIN, a radioactive substance.
      Participants give daily urine samples and fill out health related questionnaires. It is
      important to determine whether the alterations characterized within one week of last drug use
      persist over a longer time period. Based on results of the studies from aims 1 & 2, we will
      decide which of the 2 probes, WIN or FDOPA-PET is the more sensitive index of
      stimulant-dependency-induced changes.
