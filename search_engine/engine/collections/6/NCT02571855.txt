      were well tolerated up to the dose level of 200 mg (inclusive) and yielded results compatible
      with possible sleep facilitating effects of ACT-541468. So the present study aimed to further
      investigate the effects of ACT-541468 after multiple ascending doses in healthy young
      subjects as well as after single ascending doses in elderly subjects (morning
      administrations). The effects of repeated administrations of a selected dose administered in
      the evening in both healthy adults and elderly, will also be investigated.
