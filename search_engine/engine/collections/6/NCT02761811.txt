    
      This is a prospective, multicenter, single blind, randomized and controlled trial, in which
      patients are diagnosed with essential hypertension with at least six months of disease
      history and pharmacotherapy however their blood pressure still cannot be controlled. The
      patients will be informed, consent and get into a screening process. During the screening
      period patients will receive a standardized antihypertensive drug treatment for at least 28
      days and office BP is still ≥ 150mmHg, ≤180mmHg, and meet the inclusion and exclusion
      criteria. These patients will conduct renal artery angiography and be allocated to either
      renal sympathetic nerve denvervation group or renal artery angiography group by a randomizing
      system in a 1:1 ratio (212 patients, 106 paires). Patients with with office BP which is not
      achieved ideal level (<140 mmHg) will titrate doses of classes of antihypertensive drugs
      according to a predefined standardized medication regimen until their office BP <140 mmHg.
      Physicians who perform post-procedure patient management and physicians who perform renal
      denvervation procedures are blinded to each other.

      Patients will be followed at 7 days after the procedure or at discharge from hospital, 1
      month, 2 months, 3 months, 4 months, 5 months, 6 months, 9 months and 12months. Urine samples
      will be collected for drug tests to determine drug compliance of a patient.

      Data collecting/management/statistical analysis and laboratory tests will be performed by
      independent, qualified organizations. Independent DSMB/CEC are formed and responsible for
      assessments of protocol deviations and natures of SAEs.
