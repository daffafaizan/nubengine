      mechanisms responsible for these significant improvements and alteration of the disease
      progression are unexplained. Also unexplained is the apparent lack of carry over of
      functional capacity into free-living activities as measured by activity monitors.

      There are no reported effects on decreasing level of inflammatory cytokines or C-reactive
      protein (CRP) post rehabilitation, however, a training response to reactive oxidative stress
      (ROS) after a moderate intensity pulmonary rehabilitation programme has been reported. As
      oxidative stress is a catalyst to inflammation, a training response to exercise induced ROS
      in patients with COPD may also have a secondary effect of modifying inflammation in the
      stable COPD patient thereby improving patient outcomes.

      No studies to-date have combined free-living activities, biomarkers and standard outcome
      measures in patient's pre and post pulmonary rehabilitation or follow-up patients over a five
      year period.

      Subjects referred to pulmonary rehabilitation who fulfil the GOLD criteria for COPD will be
      recruited on a rolling basis and randomly allocated to one of two groups. Group 1 (Control),
      Group 2 (Intervention).

      It is a multi-centred, randomised controlled trial using the above convenience sample of
      patients referred to pulmonary rehabilitation who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria.
