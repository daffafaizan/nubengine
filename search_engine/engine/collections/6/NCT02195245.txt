      problems as the chemical granulate reacts not only with the CO2 but also the anesthetic
      drugs, producing organ toxic substances. The proposed CO2 absorber provides a solution to the
      problem of organ-toxin production in anesthetic circuits.

      This new absorber can be easily integrated into any anesthesia circuit, and can effectively
      remove CO2 without reacting with anesthetic drugs, thus eliminating organ-toxic by-products.

      It uses advanced membrane technology to separate gas flows within the circuit, separating the
      expensive anesthetic vapors from the CO2 (the main by-product of metabolism). Anesthetic
      vapors thus remain in the closed loop circuit, while CO2 is separated and exhausted to the
      atmosphere, rather than being absorbed through a chemical reaction.
