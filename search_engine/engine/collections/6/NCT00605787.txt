      hypertension has been widely observed and has been named syndrome X, or the metabolic
      syndrome. For many years metformin has been the only drug in clinical use with effects on
      insulin resistance. Recently, agonists of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors
      (PPARs) have been introduced in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. The different PPARs seem to
      be activated by a wide range of lipids and lipid mediators, including fatty acids.
      2-tetradecylthioacetic acid (TTA) is a modified fatty acid with high affinity for the
      PPARgamma receptor. In animal models of obesity-related insulin resistance (obese Zucker rats
      and dietary manipulated Wistar rats), TTA has an insulin sensitizing effect by enhancing the
      insulin mediated uptake of glucose in peripheral tissues. TTA treatment promotes fatty acid
      catabolism in experimental animals and this could casually be linked to the improved glucose
      tolerance.

      The protocol for the present study describes a safety assessment and therapeutic exploratory
      evaluation of TTA in a small subset of male type 2 diabetes patients for 4 weeks. The primary
      safety parameters will include general physical observational parameters, liver function test
      and hematological parameters. To goal is to assess the efficacy of TTA on selected metabolic
      parameters including fasting blood glucose and insulin, fasting plasma lipids, antioxidant
      status, and fibrinolytic parameters, weight, BMI and blood pressure.
