      with previously untreated metastatic or locally advanced soft tissue sarcoma. II. Determine
      the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. III. Determine the time to progression, early
      progression rate, and response duration in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive flavopiridol IV over 1 hour daily on
      days 1-3. Treatment continues every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed at 4 weeks and then every 3 months until disease
      progression or death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-30 patients will be accrued for this study over 12-18
      months.
