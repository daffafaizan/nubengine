      malignant pleural effusion with respect to time to recurrence of the effusion. II. Compare
      these treatments with respect to the necessity for further treatment of recurrent effusions.
      III. Compare these treatments with respect to the extent of postinfusion complications,
      including pain and dyspnea. IV. Compare these treatments with respect to duration of chest
      tube or soft catheter drainage required following pleurodesis. V. Compare these treatments
      with respect to duration of hospitalization for retreatment of malignant pleural effusion
      following recurrence. VI. Compare these treatments with respect to survival. VII. Compare
      these treatments with respect to the impact of the procedure on pain and dyspnea.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized trial. Patients are stratified by type of drainage device and
      participating institution. All patients are randomized to undergo pleurodesis with bleomycin,
      doxycycline, or talc by indwelling pleural catheter. A second procedure is undertaken 72
      hours later if pleural drainage is persistently large. Patients are followed monthly for
      survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 480 patients will be entered over 48 months.
