      healthy women. Prior to watching an established trauma film paradigm that induces short
      lasting intrusions, participants received a single dose of either 10 mg hydrocortisone or
      placebo. The number of consecutive intrusions of the trauma film, the mean vividness of the
      intrusions and the mean degree of distress evoked by the intrusions were assessed during the
      following seven days. Salivary cortisol and alpha-amylase were collected at seven time points
      prior to, and after the trauma film.
