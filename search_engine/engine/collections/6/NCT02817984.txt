    
      This is a 12-week, prospective, Phase I study in healthy volunteers assessing the safety and
      tolerability of acellular adipose tissue (AAT) intended for the repair of soft tissue defects
      in humans. Up to five (5) 2 milliliters (mL) subcutaneous injections of AAT will be
      administered into redundant tissues previously identified and scheduled for surgical removal
      in an elective surgical procedure.

      Participants will be enrolled and assigned chronologically to one of five excision time
      points: Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12 post-injection. Implants will be injected on Day 0. A safety
      visit will occur at 1 week post-injection; follow-up visits will occur at Weeks 2 and 4 (for
      patients who still have implants) post-injection and at time of tissue excision. At the end
      of their assigned study time point, participants will have all AAT implants removed
      simultaneously during their elective surgery. Implants will be assessed using
      histopathological analyses including hematoxylin and eosin staining and flow cytometry. The
      primary outcome of safety will be determined by the incidence and rate of adverse /
      unanticipated events. Secondary outcomes include histopathological assessment of the
      explanted implants and tolerability determined by participant-reported comfort and
      physician-reported ease-of-use with the intervention.
