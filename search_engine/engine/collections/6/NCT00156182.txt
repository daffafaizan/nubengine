      The objective of this study is to determine the long-term safety of asoprisnil 10 mg daily
      for 6 months, after an initial 12 weeks in study M99-144, in women with one or more uterine
      fibroids, confirmed by ultrasound in study M99-144. The safety endpoints for this study will
      be based on ultrasound and endometrial biopsy results, adverse events, and any changes from
      baseline laboratory values and vital signs.
