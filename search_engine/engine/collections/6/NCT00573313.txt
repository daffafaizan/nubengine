      In addition, we enrolled 26 gender matched active alcohol drinkers without liver disease (AD)
      and 28 age and gender matched healthy control subjects (HS). Of the original 40 ALD subjects
      who provided initial enrollment data, 3 declined to proceed with the trial. Therefore, 37 ALD
      patients were randomized to receive SAM at a dose of 400 mg or placebo three times daily for
      24 weeks. However 11 of these dropped out after initial evaluation, leaving 26 ALD patients,
      13 in each arm, who completed the 24 week trial.
