      schizophrenia cognitive improvement, despite this, the impact in improving functionality is
      still limited. Physical exercise increases Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) levels,
      promoting neuronal and cognitive plasticity, which can maximize the impact of CR. The aim of
      this project is to study the efficacy of an intensive program (3 months) that combines CR and
      physical exercise by a randomized controlled trial where 74 patients with chronic
      schizophrenia will be randomized to two groups: 1) CR plus physical exercise; 2) CR plus
      control activity (health promotion). Primary outcome measures will be cognitive performance,
      functional outcome, negative symptoms and BDNF levels. Measures will be blindly assessed at
      baseline, at 3 months follow up and at 15 months follow up. The investigators expect that: i)
      the CR plus physical exercise will be superior to CR plus control activity in improving
      cognition, functional outcome, negative symptoms and in increasing BDNF levels in the short
      and medium term (3 and 15 months); ii) changes in BDNF levels after the CR plus physical
      exercise will be an adequate biomarker of the cognitive improvement obtained with this
      treatment.
