      experiencing dry eyes symptoms were recruited, and randomly assigned to consume 4 g/day of
      either ZSO or soy bean oil (SBO) as placebo for 10 weeks. All participants completed the
      study. Follow-ups of dry eye symptoms and objective signs, inflammatory and oxidative stress
      markers, and blood lipid analysis were performed.
