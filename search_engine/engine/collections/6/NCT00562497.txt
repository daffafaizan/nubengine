      first 4 weeks of the study. Four infusions will be administered during the first two weeks
      (twice weekly), then two infusions administered during the next two weeks (once weekly).
      Subjects assigned to the active treatment group will receive Prochymalâ„¢. Subjects assigned to
      the non active treatment group will receive placebo (excipient, less cells). It is
      recommended that all subjects receive all six infusions. The discontinuation of
      investigational agent is allowed for GVHD worsening with subsequent need for salvage therapy.
      All infusions must be given at least 3 days apart.

      Subjects will be evaluated for efficacy and safety until death, withdrawal or 90 study days
      after randomization, whichever occurs first. Study will be unblinded and data analyzed at Day
      90 post 1st infusion (Day 0)following final subject enrollment. Subjects will be followed for
      safety for 12 months post 1st infusion (Day 0).
