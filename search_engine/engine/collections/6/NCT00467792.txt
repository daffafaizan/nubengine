      pigmentosa during their visit at the Pediatric Dermatology Clinic. Parents and child will be
      interviewed to gain medical and family history, in addition, the doctor will perform a
      physical exam and take a photograph. Children older than 4 years of age will complete the
      "Children Dermatology Life Quality Index." Children less than 4 years of age with an active
      disease will have laboratory tests requiring a sample of blood (1 teaspoon).

      Patients will receive $50 for their first office visit as financial reimbursement for
      participating in the study.
