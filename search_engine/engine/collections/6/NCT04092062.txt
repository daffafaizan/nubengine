    
      The study includes a total of 84 treatment sessions, twice a day, and 4 clinic visits over a
      period of 6 weeks.

      One treatment group (Silk'n powered toothbrush - ToothWave) and 1 control group (an ADA
      approved powered toothbrush (PTB)) will participate in the study.

      For each patient, efficacy assessment data will be collected at baseline, 4 weeks, and at 6
      weeks. The average stain data will be calculated for each group.

      Treatment is defined as a timed, 2 minute brushing of the teeth according to the
      manufacturer's instructions, twice daily (morning and evening). Brushing will be undertaken
      using the Silk'n toothbrush and standard fluoride toothpaste. The control group will use an
      ADA accepted PTB and standard fluoride toothpaste.
