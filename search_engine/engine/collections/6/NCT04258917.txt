      osteoarthritis. Additionally, patients undergoing anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction
      (ACLR) are at increased risk for requiring TKA later in life. After both TKA and ACLR, most
      Canadian patients will use axillary crutches (AC) to mobilize. Despite their benefits, AC
      users experience discomfort or even injury to the upper extremities and non-operated lower
      extremity due to increased and repetitive loading though these structures that crutch-walking
      demands. The addition of such pain or injury to a patient that already has impaired
      ambulatory ability can thus compound disability, increase health care resources utilization,
      and delay return to work.

      While AC are most commonly used in Canada and the United States, the forearm crutch (FC)
      tends to be used for the same indications in Europe and Australia. The impact of FC on upper
      extremity biomechanics has been extensively studied. In contrast, minimal research has been
      conducted on AC-assisted gait. Therefore, there is a critical knowledge gap regarding the
      consequences of AC use on upper extremity movement patterns and patient functional outcomes.

      In this study, the investigators will assess how TKA and ACLR populations ambulate with both
      FC and AC during their postoperative rehabilitation in order to determine how both crutch
      types affect upper extremity movement. Additionally, the influence of weight, sex, and gender
      on injury type and risk will be assessed as these parameters have not been well-described in
      literature. Highlighting such differences may invite Canadian healthcare providers to
      consider which crutch type - axillary or forearm - may be better for patient safety.
