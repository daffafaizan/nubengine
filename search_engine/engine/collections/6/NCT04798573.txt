      functional status or to an improved level of functioning. However, some patients have pain
      after surgery which continues. The purpose of this study is to see if there is a relationship
      between patient's genetic makeup (diseases that are passed on in families) and pain
      experience following cardiac and thoracic surgeries. This study will look for links between
      psychological factors, environmental factors and genetic factors in an attempt to uncover the
      risk for developing chronic post-surgical pain.

      This study hopes to determine differences between traditional pain surveys and a basic
      science approach called "Phenomics" to measure chronic pain response after cardiac and
      thoracic surgery. Phenomics or Phenomes is the study of physical characteristics, outside
      influences and biochemical changes (traits or chemical characteristics) and their response to
      either the environment or genetic changes. Validated pain questionnaires will be administered
      before surgery, and will repeated at 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively to follow up the
      progression of early postoperative pain and the transition to chronicity. In general, the
      psychological and pain questionnaires are designed to measure the following: anxiety,
      thoughts, feelings and reactions toward pain and stressful experiences.

      In addition, the study will follow the development of acute postoperative and chronic pain
      from before surgery up to a year after. The investigators will extract DNA from blood and
      contrast the genetic variations of participants with clinically significant chronic pain, to
      identify variations associated with the development of chronic post-surgical pain. The blood
      sample will be drawn at the time of the surgery.
