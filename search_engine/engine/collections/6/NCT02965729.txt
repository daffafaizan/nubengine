    
      A total of 105 overweight and obese children ages 8 to 17 years participated in a 10-week
      family-based weight management intervention focusing on physical activity, nutrition, and
      behavioral modification. A quasi-experimental design was used to group cohorts into three
      conditions: two cohorts had no pedometer (n=24); two cohorts had pedometer only (n=25); and
      four cohorts had pedometer with step goals (i.e. 500 steps/day weekly increase above
      baseline; n=56). Height and weight were measured at baseline and week 10 and used to
      calculate body mass index (BMI). Analysis of covariance was performed to examine difference
      by condition for change in weight, BMI, and BMI z-score, controlling for age and baseline
      value. Differences in steps/day and psychosocial health were compared between the two
      pedometer conditions.
