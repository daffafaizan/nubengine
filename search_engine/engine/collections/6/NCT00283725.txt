    
      This is a 2-year, multicenter, prospective (look forward using periodic observations
      collected predominantly following patient enrollment), longitudinal (it is a co relational
      research study that involves repeated observations of the same variables over long periods of
      time), and observational study. The objective of this study is to examine the patients with
      mild and moderate AD who are currently being treated with different treatment care methods in
      real-world settings. Doctors will not be provided medication or asked to treat their patients
      with any particular treatment. The effect of the different management strategies on
      cognition, activities of daily living, and behavior of the patients will be evaluated, and
      data on the informal caregiver burden will be assessed. Data on the utilization of health and
      social care services by the patient and the primary informal caregiver, including admission
      of the patient to an assisted living facility or nursing home will be assessed. The doctor's
      assessment of clinical global impression and adverse events will also be documented. Data
      will be collected from the doctors at baseline and at 6, 12, and 24 months, and from the
      caregivers at baseline and 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. The medication dosage and administration
      is based upon the doctors' prescription, individualized for the patient and not dictated by
      the protocol.
