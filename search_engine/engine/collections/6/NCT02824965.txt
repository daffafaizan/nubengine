      (1) Objective:

      To evaluate the safety of intravenous CVA21 in combination with pembrolizumab in patients
      with advanced NSCLC.

      Hypothesis:

      Pembrolizumab in combination with intravenous CVA21 will be well tolerated in patients with
      advanced NSCLC.

      Secondary Objective & Hypothesis

      (1) Objective:

      i. To evaluate the efficacy of intravenous CVA21 in inducing an immune cell rich tumour
      microenvironment in patients with a baseline biopsy demonstrating a tumour with an immune
      cell poor microenvironment.

      ii. To evaluate the efficacy of intravenous CVA21 in combination with pembrolizumab in
      patients with advanced NSCLC using irRECIST.

      iii. To evaluate the safety of intravenous CVA21 in combination with pembrolizumab.

      iv. To identify a safe and potentially effective dose for intravenous CVA21 in combination
      with intravenous pembrolizumab.

      v. To serially evaluate the presence of detectable virus and anti-viral antibodies in
      peripheral blood of the trial participants.

      Hypothesis:

      i. CVA21 will induce immune cell infiltration into tumors of patients that lack an immune
      cell rich micro-environment.
