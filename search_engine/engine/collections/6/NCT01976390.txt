      also be given as standard of care if it is believed to be the best immunosuppression regimen
      for a particular kidney transplant recipient. The rationale for testing Zortress vs. Rapamune
      is to determine which of these drugs is more effective in preventing chronic rejection of the
      transplanted kidney. Because these two drugs are related to each other there is no current
      literature addressing the replacement of Rapamune with Zortress in an immunosuppression
      regimen, therefore the goal of this study is to compare these two immunosuppression drugs.
