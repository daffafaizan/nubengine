      fractures in adults, with 59% of these occurring in the phalanges, 33% in the metacarpals and
      8% in the carpal bones [1]. The single most common fracture site in the hand is the sub
      capital region of the fifth metacarpal bone (boxer's fracture) [2], which usually results
      from a direct blow to the metacarpal head [3]. Most hand fractures are caused by accidental
      falls or other sports-related injuries [4]. Hand fractures are among the most common
      fractures of upper extremity [5, 6]. Hand fractures can be treated conservatively or
      surgically, depending on the severity, location and type of fracture. The main objective of
      both operative and non-operative treatments is to provide fracture stability for early
      mobilization [7]. Surgical fixation is mainly indicated for displaced fractures because casts
      are often not sufficient to maintain reduction [8]. Open reduction with internal fixation
      (ORIF), using pins or plates, has historically been used to stabilize hand fractures which
      have rotational deformity or lateral angulation [9]. Open reduction may result in scarring,
      joint stiffness and tendon adhesion [7]. Closed reduction with internal fixation (CRIF),
      using percutaneous K wire or screws, is now used to treat the majority of unstable closed
      simple hand fractures [10]. It is generally considered percutaneous Kirschner wire (K wire)
      fixation may not provide adequate stabilization to allow for early mobilization [8] .
