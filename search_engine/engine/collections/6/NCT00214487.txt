      appears to increasing in some populations (reaching 90% for some university student
      populations in Asia). There are serious risks to higher levels of myopia, including
      cataracts, glaucoma, retinal detachment and myopic retinal degeneration. Several studies have
      shown mild to moderate control of myopia progressionwith bifocal or multifocal spectacles in
      children with esophoria at near and/or with accommodative deficiencies. Pilot studies by the
      P.I. have suggested that bifocal contact lenses may control myopia progression in children
      with near point eso fixation disparity.

      CONTROL is a controlled, randomized, prospective, double-blind, one year study of the changes
      in myopia in 80-90 subjects from age 8-18 with low to moderate levels of myopia, low levels
      of astigmatism, and eso fixation disparity at near, when fitted with either bifocal soft
      contact lenses or single vision soft contact lenses. The primary outcome measures will be
      cycloplegic refraction and axial length measures.
