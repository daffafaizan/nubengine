    
      Acute renal insufficiency (ARI) represents a frequent and serious complication in patients
      submitted to cardiac surgery, and is associated with increases in time of hospitalization,
      costs, morbidity and mortality. Its incidence varies from 3.5% to 31%. The present study aims
      to evaluate renal function and oxidative stress in patients submitted to revascularization
      surgery with ECC, comparing targeted venous anesthesia controlled with propofol and
      inhalational anesthesia with isoflurane.The study will be conducted at the Botucatu Medical
      School (FMB) and will analyze 60 patients, divided into two randomized groups, submitted to
      revascularization surgery of the myocardium with ECC. The researcher responsible for data
      collection from patients will not have knowledge of the type of anesthesia being delivered to
      the patient.Blood samples will be collected by central venous access for dosing of troponin
      I, troponin T, CKMB, MDA, creatinine, urea, albumin and cystatin C.Renal function will be
      evaluated by serum cystatin C and creatinine and the estimated glomerular filtration rate
      (GFR). GFR will be measured by means of serum cystatin C (Larsson's formula) and by serum
      creatinine through the Cockcroft-Gault formula (CG) and by the MDRD formula (Modification of
      Diet in Renal Disease).Markers of renal tubular function will be dosed in the urine,
      including: alkaline phosphatase, γ - glutamyltransferase(γ-GT), β 2 microglobulin, creatinine
      and urinary cystatin C.
