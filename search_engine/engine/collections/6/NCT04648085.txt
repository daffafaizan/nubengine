      including, dryness, pain, blurred vision, and sensitivity to light or wind. Differences have
      been noted between the symptoms reported and the signs presented on physical examination,
      which suggests the involvement of somatosensory impairment. Ocular neuropathic pain is
      characterized by burning pain, hyperalgesia, photophobia, and sensitivity to wind. There are
      common physiopathological pathways, suggesting that corneal nerve sensitization contributes
      to the development of dry eye symptoms. Furthermore, in vivo confocal microscopy has reported
      a decrease in the density of the subbasal plexus in patients with a neuropathic component and
      dry eye, suggesting that they are not mutually exclusive conditions. Various topical
      treatments, as well as systemic medications are known to manage eye pain and dry eye.
      However, in some cases, individuals have been refractory to them, enhancing the importance of
      research in adjuvant therapies such as TENS.

      This research protocol evaluates the effect of transcutaneous stimulation on corneal subbasal
      plexus density and chronic eye pain in patients with dry eye. A complete dry eye examination
      will be performed, including completion of Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) and Dry Eye
      Questionnaire-5 (DEQ-5). Subbasal nerves density will be measured by confocal microscopy
      before and after receiving treatment with TENS. In addition, monthly monitoring of the
      intensity of ocular pain (with a numerical scale of 0-10) will be maintained. The intensity
      and severity of the clinical variables will be compared before and after receiving the
      treatment with a paired Student's t-test considering an value of p<0.05 as statistically
      significant.
