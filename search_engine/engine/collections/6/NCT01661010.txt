      infertility are varied and include age-related decline in fecundity, other causes of
      ovulatory dysfunction, tubal and pelvic pathology, male causes, idiopathic, and
      multifactorial. The underlying genetic causes of infertility are incompletely understood. The
      purpose of this study is to increase our understanding of the genetic and clinical
      manifestations of infertility related to sex-chromosome variants through detailed physical,
      radiologic, and laboratory studies. We will concentrate on a group of patients (both male and
      female) with known sex-chromosome variationsfully characterized through genetic sequencing
      and karyotyping. Other patients with

      sex chromosome variants will be invited depending on the variant described. Patients
      recruited and consenting to this study will be evaluated at the NIH Clinical Center
