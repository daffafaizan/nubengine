      tract and the pancreas. Since imaging by itself is limited in differential diagnosis of
      tumors, EUS guided fine needle aspiration is seen as a valid complementary method. Since
      fine-needle aspiration (FNA) is mainly based on cytological diagnostics, this method is
      limited also because of lacking supplementary immune- histochemical diagnostics. Here, the
      obtainment of little histologically evaluable tissue samples (punched barrels) would be of
      benefit.

      A new punch needle device called Pro-core needle (Cook)(22 / 19 gauges) offers the
      possibility of increasing numbers of valid extractions of histologically evaluable tissues
      due to a better targeted precision and maneuverability in comparison to other devices of that
      kind (tru-cut needles, e.g.). A little notch at the pinpoint allows the obtainment of little
      tissue samples, that will be kept within the device by aspiration.

      This study compares the obtainment of tissue by Proc-core needle and conventional aspiration
      punction systems.
