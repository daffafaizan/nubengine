      shortens length of hospital stay and overall post-operative narcotic use. Studies have shown
      its utility in single level microdiscectomies and lumbar fusions, but there have been no
      publications regarding lumbar laminectomies and associated outcomes with LB. The
      investigators' hypothesis is that LB will significantly shorten inpatient stays as well as
      overall narcotic usage in single, double or multi-level lumbar laminectomies.
