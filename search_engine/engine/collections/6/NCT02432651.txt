      called xanthohumol (ZAN-tho-HUE-mol), prevents damage to DNA and oxidative stress. The human
      body is constantly exposed to oxidative stress from environmental compounds (e.g. air
      pollution) which may cause damage to DNA. The human body can repair some DNA damage, but too
      much DNA damage is harmful and may lead to cancer. Research done at OSU and around the world
      has shown that xanthohumol can stop or slow processes that lead to cancer.

      Participants will consume a non-alcoholic beverage containing xanthohumol with breakfast,
      lunch and dinner for 3 weeks. Then they will go through a washout period of 3 weeks. And then
      they will consume the same beverage without the xanthohumol compound (placebo) for another 3
      weeks. Participants will be randomly assigned into groups and will vary whether they will
      consume the xanthohumol product during the first or second 3-week period. Xanthohumol doses
      will be 0, 6, 12 or 24 mg/day.

      The study includes donation of blood and urine samples and one-month food frequency
      questionnaires.
