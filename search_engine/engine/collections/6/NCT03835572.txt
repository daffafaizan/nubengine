    
      This is a pilot randomized controlled study that aims to develop CircaHealth: an online
      course on practices, known as circadian hygiene, that promote circadian rhythm alignment and
      minimize circadian rhythm misalignment. The project also will determine the feasibility,
      acceptability, and preliminary effects of CircaHealth in improving circadian rhythm related
      measures in University of Miami Miller School of Medicine medical students.

      The educational videos will be incorporated into a six-module online course which contains
      additional educational and behavior modification tools. Medical students (n = 40) will be
      recruited via email and randomized to receive CircaHealth or materials from the National
      Sleep Foundation and/or the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. Sleep, mood, and circadian
      hygiene knowledge, behaviors, and attitudes will be assessed at baseline and four weeks post
      intervention. Feasibility will be determined by CircaHealth module completion rates, and
      acceptability will be assessed via a self-report survey. Changes in sleep quality measures
      between groups will determine the preliminary efficacy of CircaHealth.
