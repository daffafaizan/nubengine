      physical activity in daily life, to promote health, and to increase cardiorespiratory fitness
      in normal-weight individuals. The positive effect of commuting to work by a normal bike on
      cardiorespiratory fitness has been shown to be an important predictor of cardiovascular
      mortality in previous studies. We thought to improve maximal oxygen uptake by commuting to
      work by e-bike vs. classic bike. Besides cardiorespiratory fitness we assessed arterial
      stiffness as brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity as an independent predictor of cardiovascular
      events and all-cause mortality.
