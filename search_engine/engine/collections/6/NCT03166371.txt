    
      This is a single-center randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, intent-to-treat
      clinical trial to test the impact of oral administration of liposomal glutathione (GSH) in
      initially hospitalized, malnourished, older adults after discharge to the home setting. Study
      subjects will be clinically stable and able to complete serial study endpoint investigations.
      A total of 50 clinically stable subjects will be block-randomized to receive either oral
      liposomal GSH or identical placebo product for 90 days after discharge from Emory University
      Hospital (EUH). Plasma GSH redox status over time will be the primary study endpoint.
      Secondary study endpoints will include other thiol/disulfide indexes of oxidative stress,
      body composition, and measures of physical function, mobility, fatigue, frailty and quality
      of life. All endpoints will be determined at baseline (just prior to hospital discharge) and
      repeated at 30, 60 and 90 days after hospital discharge to the home or assisted living
      environment.
