      has resulted in major publications in the past on individualized (chemo)radiotherapy for
      (NSCLC) [van Baardwijk 2006 and 2010]. As one of the few centers, MAASTRO also aggressively
      re-treats patients with recurrent non-small cell lung cancer. Even after primary radical
      treatment to high doses, re-irradiation is also given in curative intent, thus again using
      high doses of radiation.

      Publications on this topic are rare. Most reports address the results of palliative
      re-irradiation of NSCLC [Ebara 2007, Jackson 1987, Montebello 1993, Tada 2005]. The ones
      available on re-irradiation with curative intent used outdated techniques [Okamoto 2002, Wu
      2003]. Only one recent publication has analyzed the results of 37 NSCLC patients of whom 9
      were re-irradiated with at least 50 Gy using helical tomotherapy [Kruser in press].

      The results of radical re-irradiation applying highly conformal radiation techniques within
      MAASTRO are unknown. This study will provide knowledge on benefit and risks of such a
      therapeutic approach. Furthermore, it may provide enough evidence to initiate a Phase II/III
      clinical trial for re-irradiation of NSCLC patients with curative intent.
