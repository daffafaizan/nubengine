      rest period. This one-week on/one week off schedule will continue for the duration of
      treatment unless significant side effects develop.

      Bevacizumab will be administered intravenously every other week. After eight weeks (two
      cycles), a CT scan will be performed to see how treatment affected tumor growth.

      Bactrim, an antibiotic, and acyclovir, an antiviral medicine, will be given in order to help
      prevent infection.

      Blood tests will be done every other week to evaluate any side effects.

      Once the study has been completed, a physical exam, vital signs, blood tests, and CT scan
      will be performed.

      Patients will remain on the study as long as they continue to receive benefit from the
      treatment and there are no serious side effects.
