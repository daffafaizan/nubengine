      single visit.

      Each subject will put on the VR headset and perform a series of neck movements guided by
      graphic instructions appearing in the VR environment. The session will be recorded with a
      video camera which will subsequently be viewed and evaluated by clinicians. The clinicians
      will identify each movement seen on the video from a predefined list and determine if such a
      movement is recommended as part of a rehabilitation training program.
