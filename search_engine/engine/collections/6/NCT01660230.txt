    
      This is a single-center, sequential-cohort, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single- and
      multiple-ascending dose study. Eligible adult subjects will be assigned sequentially to 1 of
      10 cohorts, at successively higher single doses, followed by successively higher multiple
      doses.

      Single IV Doses: 5 subjects per cohort, aged 18-55, will be randomized in a 4:1 manner to
      receive active drug (6, 30, 90, 180, 360, and TBD µg/kg) or to receive matching placebo
      (Cohorts 1-6).

      Multiple IV Doses: 8 subjects per cohort, aged 18-55, will be randomized in a 3:1 manner to
      receive active drug (90, 180, 360, and TBD µg/kg) or to receive matching placebo every 12
      hours for 5 doses (Cohorts 7-10).

      Single-Dose Cohorts Subjects receiving a single dose will be confined in a Phase 1 unit for
      12 hours prior to dosing, during dosing, and for 24 hours after dosing (Study Day 1-2) for
      observation and PK sampling. Subjects will return on Study Day 4 (~72 hours after infusion)
      and Study Day 15 for additional safety evaluations. A 28-Day follow-up phone call will be
      made to subjects to collect AEs that occur within 28-days of the dose.

      Multiple-Dose Cohorts Subjects receiving multiple doses will be confined in a Phase 1 unit
      for 12 hours prior to dosing through 24 hours following the last dose (Study Day 1-4) for
      observation and PK sampling. Subjects will return on Study Day 6 (~72 hours after last
      infusion) and Study Day 15 for additional safety evaluations. A 28-Day follow-up phone call
      will be made to subjects to collect AEs that occur within 28-days of the last dose.
