      have affected cognition, specifically sugars and vitamin C. Volunteers were healthy, not on
      any medication, without high blood pressure, high cholesterol, high BMI, diabetes or other
      medical conditions. Older adults were aged 61-75 years and younger adults 18-26 years.

      Blood and urine samples will be analysed for flavonoid levels and Brain Derived Neurotrophic
      Factor, a biomarker of memory and learning, flavonoids may lead to increased BDNF production
      through the ERK-CREB-BDNF pathway.

      Flavonoids may also increase nitric oxide production and improve the flexibility of the blood
      vessels hence the measure of vascular reactivity using the Digital Volume Pulse machine. This
      can lead to increased vaso-dilation and blood flow to the brain, therefore an fMRI study was
      carried out the investigate this using arterial spin labeling following acute blueberry
      supplementation compared to a control drink.
