      who experience acute GVHD. Long-term corticosteroids are still standard therapy for chronic
      GVHD. Corticosteroids are associated with high morbidity and non-relapse mortality. In
      addition, corticosteroids are broadly immunosuppressive and can also decrease the GVL effect
      and increase the incidence of relapse. There is a clear need for effective, steroid-sparing
      agents for the management of chronic GVHD. Thus, agents like HDAC inhibitors, with the
      potential of decreasing pro-inflammatory events leading to GVHD without affecting GVL, may
      have a central role in the prevention and treatment of GVHD.

      This study will look at the efficacy of panobinostat (LBH589), an HDAC inhibitor, in the
      treatment of patients with chronic GVHD who have failed corticosteroids. In this group of
      patients, effective steroid-sparing options are limited and are usually associated with
      profound immunosuppression and decreased GVL effect.
