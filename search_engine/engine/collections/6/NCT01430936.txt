      incidence and associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. The management of heart
      failure patients is complex and has become a priority world over. Effective methods to keep
      heart failure patients out of the hospital are essential, both in the interests of the
      patient's health, as well as to reduce the burden on the health care system.

      Heart failure patients should be in a position to provide readings of their weight, blood
      pressure, fluid intake, medications and other important parameters and communicate this data
      to care providers using wireless technology. This data should be made available to medical
      personnel regularly and on a periodic basis. In this manner the health care providers can
      detect and respond to warning signs or alerts before the patient's condition worsens to
      warrant a visit to the doctor or a hospital admission with features of heart failure
      decompensation.
