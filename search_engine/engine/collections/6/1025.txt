studies of the antihemophilic factor (ahf, factor viii) produced in vonwillebrand's disease.it has been confirmed that persons with autosomalahf deficiency (von willebrand'sdisease) produce large quantities ofahf when transfused with ahf-deficientplasma from persons with hemophilia a.this occurs despite the fact that'complementation' does not occur in vitro.  oneprediction from a model suggestingthat the x-locus for ahf is structural whilethe autosomal locus is regulatory isthat the ahf which appears in von willebrand'sdisease after transfusion will bestructurally normal.  the ahf obtained underthese conditions has been tested bymethods and the results fulfil the prediction.this may imply that the model iscorrect.  on the other hand, the prediction mayhave been fulfilled for otherreasons.  perhaps the wrong parameters wereexamined, or the large standarderrors of the tests masked a real difference.further tests are obviously neededbefore one can feel reasonably certain thatmutation of a regulatory gene is thebasis of von willebrand's disease.  an examinationof persons with sex-linked andautosomal ahf deficiency using an antibodyprepared against wild type ahf mightbe very illuminating.  also, transfusion studiesshould be carried out on personshomozygous for von willebrand's disease ifsuch persons can be found.  failureto obtain 'new synthesis' in a homozygote wouldthrow great doubt on a model whichimplies that the reduced ahf levels in vonwillebrand's disease heterozygotes isdue entirely to reduction in an effector substancewhich neutralizes the repressorof an x-chromosome operon directly codingthe ahf molecule.
