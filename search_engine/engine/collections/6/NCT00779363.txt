      thirty (30) obese with type 2 diabetes subjects. The study is designed to demonstrate that
      use of the rechargeable TANTALUS II IPG is safe and that it functions as designed.

      Subjects will undergo an approximately two week baseline screening process. Eligible subjects
      will undergo device implantation. This will be followed by therapy initiation approximately
      one week after implantation. The device will then be activated to automatically deliver
      gastric contractility modulating (GCM) for 12 weeks of therapy. Stimulation will continue in
      for a safety monitoring period of 18 months following the therapy period.
