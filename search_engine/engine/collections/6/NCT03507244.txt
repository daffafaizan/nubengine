      metastases from malignant solid tumors are enrolled into this study. Concomitant regimen
      consisted of intrathecal chemotherapy (via lumbar puncture, pemetrexed 10 mg, plus
      dexamethasone 5 mg, once per week, 5 to 8 times, 4 to 7 weeks in total) and radiotherapy.
      Radiotherapy consisted of fractionated, conformal radiation given at a daily dose of 2 Gy.
      The planning volume consisted of sites of symptomatic disease, bulky disease observed on
      magnetic resonance imaging(MRI), including the whole brain and basis cranii received 40 Gy in
      20 fractions, 4 weeks in total, and/or segment of spinal canal received 40-50 Gy. The RANO
      proposal for response criteria of leptomeningeal metastasis was used to assess the clinical
      response in this study.
