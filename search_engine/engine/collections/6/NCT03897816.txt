      disorders due to maternal psychopathology (with an in-depth evaluation about the role of
      maternal personality disorders), the investigators recruit all the women consecutively
      referred and admitted to the Perinatal Psychiatric Outpatient Department from January, 2011
      to December, 2016, due to the manifestation of psychic suffering during pregnancy.

      During their first appointment, patients are routinely administered the Structured Clinical
      Interview for DSM-IV Axis II Disorders (SCID II), Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), World
      Health Organization Quality of Life Instruments (WHOQOL-BREF), Edinburgh Postnatal Depression
      Scale (EPDS), Beck Depression Interview (BDI) and Beck Anxiety Interview (BAI). The
      Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.) is used to confirm clinical
      diagnosis.

      As a control samples, the investigators recruited pregnant patients belonging to the
      Outpatients Psychiatric Department who did not have psychiatric issues linked to their
      pregnancy or in the relationship with their children and pregnant healthy controls among the
      general population, with no history of mental health issues. Controls were tested as the
      clinical sample.

      All the patients will be asked to complete a caregiver report form, the Child Behavior
      Checklist (CBCL), once their children were at least 18 months old.
