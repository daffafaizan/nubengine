      perioperative setting, it often leads to significant morbidity, including opioid tolerance
      and hyperalgesia. Looking at ways to decrease the need for opioids with the use of adjunct
      medications allows for the long-term goal of decreasing physiologic tolerance in children.
      This is especially relevant in the pediatric congenital heart population.

      Dexmedetomidine is in a class of drugs known as alpha-2 agonists and is known to provide
      analgesia, attenuate opioid tolerance and inhibit the sympathetic stress response. While
      there are numerous published case studies of dexmedetomidine validating its effectiveness and
      safety, the pharmacologic and pharmacodynamic profile has not been established.

      This study will examine the hemodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacogenomics of
      dexmedetomidine in patients with congenital heart disease. The dose-ranging effect of
      dexmedetomidine will also be investigated. The three groups being studied will be: patients
      with bi-directional cavopulmonary anastomosis or a Fontan procedure, patients who have had a
      cardiac transplant, and patients with otherwise normal physiology who are undergoing closure
      of a patent ductus arteriosis or atrial septal defect.

      Comparison: Compare both invasive and noninvasive hemodynamic parameters at baseline
      sevoflurane and during maintenance dosing on dexmedetomidine. The pharmacokinetics of
      dexmedetomidine in the pediatric population following escalating loading doses and continuous
      infusion at timed intervals will be estimated. The efficacy of dexmedetomidine will be
      estimated by the amount of rescue doses of propofol that are given.
