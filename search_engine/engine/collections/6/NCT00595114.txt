      often causing coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath. In uncontrolled COPD and asthma,
      people may experience a rapid worsening of symptoms, which may include fever, difficulty
      breathing, and chest pain. These exacerbations are the most serious expression of asthma and
      COPD and are usually caused by lung infections or air allergens. However, the biological
      basis for susceptibility to airway infection and inflammation is not well understood.
      Increased oxidative stress within the airways has been linked to several airway diseases.
      This increase in oxidative stress may reduce production of key fatty acid anti-inflammatory
      mediators. In turn, this may disrupt the airway's natural immune response mechanisms, making
      the airways more vulnerable to infection or inflammation during COPD and asthma
      exacerbations. This ancillary study will determine whether susceptibility to persistent
      airway infection in asthma and COPD stems from increased oxidative stress that impairs the
      natural formation of protective fatty acid mediators.

      This ancillary study will use data biological samples, including blood and sputum, from
      participants currently enrolled in the Macrolides in Asthma (MIA; NCT00318708) and the
      Antileukotriene Therapy for COPD Exacerbations (KIA; NCT01097694). Biological samples will
      undergo fatty acid mediator analysis and RNA isolation. There will be no study visits for
      this study.
