      damage to the hypothalamus and/or pituitary gland. Also surgery or endovascular treatment of
      a ruptured intracranial aneurysm may affect the hormonal response of the HPA-axis. Some data
      suggest a high incidence of delayed endocrine abnormalities in patients with SAH but only
      little data exists on the acute endocrine abnormalities in this disease.

      We will study the pituitary-adrenal hormone levels in patients with acute aneurysmal SAH and
      patients admitted for elective cranial aneurysm surgery will serve as a control population.
      We will use serum free cortisol calculation and total cortisol measurements as well as
      adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test in assessing the responsiveness of the
      adrenal gland to exogenous ACTH. The hormone levels will be measured repeatedly during the
      first seven days after SAH and once at three months.
