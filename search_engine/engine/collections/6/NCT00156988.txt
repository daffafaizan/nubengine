      toxin' and, when used in combination with silver-sulfadiazine, may enhance its antibacterial
      effect. Since 1984, the combination of cerium and silver sulfadiazine, flammacerium, has been
      used in our centre. Current practice is to treat acute, non-facial, burns with daily cleaning
      and (re-)application of flammacerium for a total of ten days. However, prolonged application
      of cerium is thought to be unnecessary - it is effective in the early stages after injury-
      and prolonged application of silver sulfadiazine has a negative effect on wound healing. The
      objective of the proposed study is therefore, to assess whether the application of
      flammacerium for 2 days is as good as, or even better than, the application of flammacerium
      for 10 days regarding woundhealing in partial thickness burns.
