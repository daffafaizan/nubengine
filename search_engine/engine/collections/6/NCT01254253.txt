      coronary artery lesions, and for the estimation of their hemodynamic relevance.Thus,
      noninvasive assessment of myocardial perfusion defects may be preferred for patients with
      chronic total occlusion (CTO).

      In particular, myocardial perfusion is measured with single photon emission CT
      (SPECT).Multislice coronary CT angiography (CCTA) with dual-source scanners reveals the
      anatomic location of coronary artery disease (CAD). These two techniques assess distinct
      aspects of heart morphology and function parameters of the heart, and should therefore be
      regarded as complementary rather than competing methods.Taking this into consideration,
      decisions regarding whether invasive revascularization therapy is adequate or not and which
      strategy is the best for long-term survival cannot be supported by anatomic information
      alone. Therefore, noninvasive complementary imaging of structure and perfusion, in
      conjunction with three-dimensional (3D) image fusion, has emerged as a technique for reliable
      allocation of perfusion defects to their supplying coronary artery.
