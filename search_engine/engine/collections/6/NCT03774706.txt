      reduce the frequency of cesarean section (CS) -related hemorrhage; however, some studies
      reported that oxytocin use in the setting of CS may result in maternal adverse effects,
      including hypotension and tachycardia., Therefore, investigating other therapeutic agents
      with lower adverse effects and higher efficacy is needed. Recently, a number of studies
      reported a correlation between fibrinogen decrease and cesarean-related hemorrhage.
      Furthermore, extensive tissue injury increases fibrinolysis by shifting the hemostatic
      equilibrium and contributing to bleeding. Therefore, anti-fibrinolytic agents, such as
      tranexamic acid (TA), reduce the risk of death in bleeding trauma patients. On the other
      hand, it has been suggested that TA administration reduces blood loss and the incidence of
      postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) in females after vaginal or elective CS verse effects and higher
      efficacy is needed. Moreover, misoprostol is a prostaglandin E1 analog which has been
      introduced as a uterotonic agent for preventing PPH following CS. A recent study reported
      that oral or sublingual misoprostol is more effective than the placebo in reducing severe
      PPH, following CS
