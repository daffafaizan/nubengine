    
      Primary Outcome Measures:

      Reintubation within 48 hours after extubation (logistic regression will be used to assess the
      risk factors)

      Secondary Outcome Measures:

        -  Use of non-invasive positive pressure ventilation or nasal high flow within 48 hours
           after extubation.

        -  Risk factors for extubation failure, with quantitative variables expressed as means
           (standard deviation) or medians (interquartiles 25%-75%) and compared using the student
           t test or Wilcoxon test as appropriate

        -  Length of ICU and hospital stay, vital status at ICU and hospital discharge, 28-day
           mortality
