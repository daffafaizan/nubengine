        1. Collect, annotate, and store fresh endoscopic specimens of suspicious abnormal tissue
           (premalignant lesions and primary tumors for genetic mutational investigation;

        2. Collect, annotate, and store fresh specimens from metastatic lesions (e.g.: hepatic
           metastatic tumors), under sonographic or other imaging modalities guided biopsy
           procedures;

        3. Collect, process, and store serum, plasma and isolate lymphocytes from blood drawn from
           patients with colorectal tumor;

        4. Establish a database to link materials acquisition, pathologic, and clinical information
           on patients who participate in the protocol;

        5. To utilize the clinical database to perform clinical and pathological correlation with
           the results of current and future scientific studies;

        6. To evaluate genomic and biochemical alterations in colorectal tumors.

        7. To test the effect of small molecule inhibitors on the activation of wild-type and
           mutant genetic alterations and/or other potential molecular targets.

        8. To correlate tumor genotype and signaling abnormalities with clinical response to
           genetic alterations and/or other potential molecular targets inhibitors

        9. Analysis of laboratory findings in relationship to patient demographics and clinical
           course.
