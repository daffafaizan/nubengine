studies of nickel carcinogenesis fractionations of nickel inultracentrifugal supernatants of lung and liver by means of dextran gelchromatography .chromatographic fractionations have been performed on theultracentrifugal supernatants of homogenates of rat lung and liver bythe use of columns of dextran gel (sephadex g-100) . a major proportionof nickel in these tissue supernatants has been demonstrated to befirmly bound to macromolecular constituents . following acute andchronic inhalation of carcinogenic levels of nickel carbonyl, thepredominant increases in the concentrations of nickel have been observedin the macromolecular fractions . these findings are consistent with theprevious demonstration of nickel in purified preparations of ribonucleicacids (rna) from several rat tissues, and with the observation ofincreased concentrations of nickel in high-molecular weight rna fromlung and liver following the inhalation of nickel carbonyl .
