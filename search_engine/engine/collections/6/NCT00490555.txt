      prostate. This knowledge will be used to help in the development of a safe male hormonal
      contraception.

      We will be administering three drugs in this study: Testim (testosterone (T) gel),
      dutasteride (which affects testosterone break down) and Depomedoxyprogesterone (DMPA, a
      progestin). We want to see their effects on levels of hormones in the blood and prostate. In
      addition, we will be examining the effects of these drugs on the expression of genes within
      the prostate. DMPA suppresses LH and FSH, which are hormones made by the pituitary gland,
      thus blocking the signal from the brain that causes the testes to make testosterone.
      Prolonged (> 1 month) low levels of LH and FSH cause decreased sperm production in normal
      men. However, men may experience some side effects from the low levels of testosterone caused
      by DMPA; adding testosterone to DMPA eliminates these side effects while more effectively
      blocking LH and FSH release and sperm production. This combination of drugs is a promising
      male contraceptive regimen. However, the effect of these drugs on the prostate is not known.
      Some studies suggest that testosterone administration may promote prostate growth.
      Dutasteride blocks the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone and is used to treat
      men with enlarged prostates. Dutasteride shrinks the prostate. It is possible that combining
      testosterone and dutasteride may be an effective part of a male hormonal contraceptive
      regime. Therefore, further studies examining the effect of testosterone, DMPA and dutasteride
      on the prostate are needed.
