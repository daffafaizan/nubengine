    
      This is a Phase 1b, open-label, non-randomized multicenter study conducted in 2 parts. Part
      1, will determine the MTD of the combination of ibrutinib, lenalidomide and DA-EPOCH-R in
      subjects with DLBCL.

      Ibrutinib will be administered at a fixed dose of 560 mg and lenalidomide will be
      dose-escalated. DA-EPOCH-R will be given at standard doses.

      For Part 2, the MTD determined in Part 1 will be the dose used for all subjects. If no MTD is
      identified, then subjects in Part 2 will be treated with the maximum administered doses (MAD,
      treatment doses from dose Level 4).

      The primary objective for Part 2 is to determine the ORR of ibrutinib and lenalidomide in
      combination with DA-EPOCH-R in subjects with ABC DLBCL as analyzed by gene expression
      profiling when treated at recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D).
