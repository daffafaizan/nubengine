      with chronic hypertrophic rhinosinusitis. Each tissue sample is divided into 4 parts based on
      the distance from the nostrils and is dehydrated, thinly sliced and mounted on glass slides.
      Then the tissue is analyzed with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Raman
      microspectroscopy (RMS) to detect solid particles and characterize the morphology and
      compositions of the detected particles. A novel method of quantification of distribution of
      the particles has been designed and used to evaluate interindividual differences in
      distribution of the particles. History of employment is obtained from the patients and the
      data are compared with the findings in the tissue samples.

      The data acquired from the group of adult patients are compared with the results obtained
      from a group of control specimen of nasal mucosa harvested from stillborn children. It is
      presumed that no nano particles will be present in the stillborn children specimen since the
      mucosa was not exposed to airborne particles.
