      a triple-lumen central venous catheter (Certofix, B|Braun, Germany) and the femoral artery
      with a thermistor-tipped arterial catheter (5F, PV2015L20, Pulsion Medical Systems, Munich,
      Germany). The arterial blood pressure was recorded from a side port of the catheter.
      Hemodynamic monitoring was carried out using the method of transpulmonary thermodilution
      (PiCCO2 monitor, Pulsion Medical Systems, Germany) by a triplicate 15 mL bolus of cold (< 8
      Â°C) 0.9% saline solution.

      Mechanical ventilation (Puritan Bennett 840 and 980, Medtronic, USA) was performed according
      to the ARDS Network protocol, using pressure-controlled ventilation with tidal volume 6-7
      ml/kg of predicted body weight, with a Ppeak not exceeding 35 cm H2O, positive end-expiratory
      pressure (PEEP) and a fraction of inspiratory oxygen (FiO2) levels adjusted to maintain SpO2
      within a 92-97% range.

      The target fluid balance was achieved by continuous infusion of furosemide with an initial
      dose of 0.07 mcg/kg/hr and a minimal duration of 12 hrs. In case of failure to reach a
      negative fluid balance by means of diuretics, started controlled ultrafiltration using
      continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH, multiFiltrate, Fresenius Medical Care, Germany).
      For fluid replacement, if necessary, investigators administered balanced crystalloid
      solutions (Sterofundin Iso/G5, B|Braun, Germany) with an initial infusion rate of 6-7
      ml/kg/hr.

      Heart rate (HR), MAP, cardiac index (CI), GEDVI, EVLWI, pulmonary vascular permeability index
      (PVPI), central venous pressure (CVP), systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI), pulse
      pressure variation (PPV), and stroke volume variation (SVV) were assessed using
      transpulmonary thermodilution and arterial pulse contour analysis. During the study,
      investigators also assessed blood gases (ABL Flex 800 Radiometer, Denmark) and biochemical
      parameters (Random Access A-25, BioSystems, Spain). All measurements were performed at
      baseline, at 24 and at 48 hrs of the goal-directed de-escalation
