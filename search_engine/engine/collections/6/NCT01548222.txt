      final dose is >0.4U/kg. In carefully CGM monitored/titrated studies in both basal insulin
      alone or in pump-treated T2DM, we have found the basal insulin dose to be <0.3U/kg. This
      suggests that if guided by a single daily fasting glucose, titration may result in an
      excessive basal dose. This study will examine that issue.
