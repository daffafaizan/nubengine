      cause of death by 2030 and in the US over 16 million people have COPD. Smokers are four and a
      half times more likely to develop COPD than non-smokers, with the likelihood of COPD
      increasing progressively with the duration and intensity of smoking. Among those with COPD,
      smoking cessation is the most effective means of slowing the decline of lung function and
      overall disease progression. Patients at all stages of COPD benefit from quitting smoking.
      Over 90% of COPD deaths occur in current smokers, however 47.1% of people with COPD continue
      to smoke. Electronic cigarettes (E-cigarettes) could help people reduce the harm of
      combustible cigarettes (CC) through reductions in number of Cigarettes per Day (CPD) or
      quitting CC completely by addressing both nicotine and behavioral dependence. Although there
      are associated health risks, all available evidence indicates that E-cigarettes are safer
      than CC. Unlike CC, e-cigarettes are not associated with coronary heart disease or myocardial
      infarction. The purpose of this mixed methods study is to identify barriers and facilitators,
      as well as to assess preliminary effectiveness of e-cigarettes as a harm reduction strategy
      among people with COPD.
