      facilitate studies of human Pneumocystis infection and disease, to detect genes associated
      with drug resistance, and to assess strain variation. This study will also contribute
      information about the epidemiology of Pneumocystis by assessing normal volunteers who are
      exposed to Pneumocystis, e.g. health professionals, and looking at strain variation among
      isolates from patients and, if positives are found, from healthy volunteers. This study will
      potentially facilitate development of techniques that can be the basis of definitive studies
      on diagnosis, epidemiology, and transmission of Pneumocystis.
