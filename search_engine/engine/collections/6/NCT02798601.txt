      Additionally, it is considered a public health problem because of the high prevalence of
      motor and cognitive dysfunction in those who survive.

      One of the cornerstones of management is the control of both intracranial pressure and brain
      edema. It is indicated to use osmotic active solutions to modulate the transit of fluids from
      the interstitial to the intracellular space. Not only mannitol but also hypertonic saline
      acts at this point. Currently there is no evidence in favor or against one of them.

      Mannitol has been usually recommended for intracranial pressure control in patients with
      brain trauma. However, others recommend hypertonic saline to achieve a serum sodium level of
      160 milliequivalent/L to modulate brain edema. It is not clear if these therapies have an
      impact on the neurologic prognosis and how frequently adverse effects occur.
