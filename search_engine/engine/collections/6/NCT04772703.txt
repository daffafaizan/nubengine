    
      Data from hospital documentation will be recorded for all patients: demographic data,
      clinical data (Horowitz index, the necessity of pronation position, opening maneuvers,
      connection to ECMO, state of the circulation and other organ functions), laboratory data:
      parameters of inflammatory activity and COVID-19 specific markers (blood count with
      differential leukocyte count, CRP, IL-6, ferritin, procalcitonin, D-dimers).

      In the study, 4 ml of heparinized peripheral blood will be collected for analytical purposes
      beyond standard practice for lymphocyte isolation and monitoring of oxidative DNA damage upon
      admission to the ICU (D1), after 2 days (D3) and on day 7 (D7) of the hospitalization. The
      same blood sample will be used to determine EPA and DHA omega-3 in erythrocyte membranes. At
      the same intervals and frequency, 10 ml of urine will be collected for the determination of
      8-hydroxy-2-deoxyquanosine (8-OHdG), so a total of 30 ml of urine will be collected for
      analytical purposes.

      Details for analytical processing: peripheral blood lymphocyte damage will be assessed using
      the alkaline COMET ASSAY method for DNA breakage and modified COMET ASSAY using specific
      enzymes for the detection of oxidized bases, endonuclease III (ENDO III) for the detection of
      oxidized pyrimidines and formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase (FPG) for the detection of
      oxidized purines. Leukocyte repair capacity will be determined using a modified COMET ASSAY,
      which uses extracts of patient lymphocytes and HeLa cells with defined DNA damage. The extent
      of 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyquanosine (8-OHdG) DNA damage in patients' urine will be determined by
      determining the concentration of 8-OHdG by ELISA.
