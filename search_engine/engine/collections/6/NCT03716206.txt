      in the world. A substantial portion of those surviving from stroke typically experience
      neurological sequelae and stroke-related complications. Post stroke shoulder pain is a
      sensory disturbance is one of a common complication in patients with chronic stroke and may
      adversely affect patients' quality of life. Nowadays, exergame has been explored as an
      adjunct therapy for the management of pain for a number of conditions. This study is to
      investigate the effects of exergame on shoulder pain and motor function of upper extremity in
      individuals with stroke. Method: This is a randomized controlled trail. Sixty subjects with
      poststroke shoulder pain will be recruited and randomized into either the exergame
      (experimental) group or conventional (control) group. The intervention is one hour per day,
      four or five days per week for three weeks. The primary outcomes are Visual Analogue Scale,
      and Brief Pain Inventory - Short Form. The secondary outcomes are Fugl-Meyer Assessment for
      Upper Limb Extremity, Wolf motor function test and Shoulder Pain and Disability Index.
