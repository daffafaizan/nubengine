      I. To establish the safety and feasibility of collecting, analyzing and storing clinically
      annotated panomic and other data from serially monitored subjects with metastatic triple
      negative breast cancer (TNBC) who receive care from up to ten oncology practices across the
      United States.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether molecular changes associated with resistance to treatment can be
      identified.

      II. To understand subject perceptions regarding panomic data and its application to cancer
      treatment.

      III. To apply other technologies to the characterization of subject tumors as they become
      available.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo collection of tissue biopsy, blood, buccal mucosa, saliva, and urine at
      baseline. Additional biopsies may be performed prior to treatment change.

      After completion of biopsy, patients are followed up at 1 day and 7 days. Patients will be
      followed indefinitely or for as long as they agree to be in the study, depending on the
      availability of resources.
