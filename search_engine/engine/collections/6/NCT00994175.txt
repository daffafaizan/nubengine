      standard measures. Pioglitazone hydrochloride (Actos ) is a highly selective and potent
      agonist for the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-Gamma (PPAR Gamma). Studies in
      murine models of allergic asthma have shown that PPAR Gamma agonists down-regulate
      allergen-mediated airway inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness. This protocol is a
      randomized, placebo-controlled, doubleblind, crossover (phase II) pilot study of the efficacy
      of pioglitazone for the treatment of patients with severe, refractory asthma. The primary
      end-point for this study will be quality of life as determined by the Asthma Quality of Life
      Questionnaire (AQLQ) score. Secondary end-points will include indices of airway inflammation,
      airflow obstruction, airway hyperreactivity, and asthma symptoms.
