      up to 20-23 weeks, or the products of pregnancy weighing less than 500 grams (1). Nearly 15%
      of known pregnancies end in miscarriage, especially in the first 12 weeks. Estimates indicate
      that 68000 women die worldwide each year, as a result of unsafe abortions. Abortions are the
      major cause of maternal death, particularly in Latin America and the Caribbean. In cases of
      retained and incomplete abortions, uterine emptying is recommended. In the first trimester of
      pregnancy, either pharmacological or surgical procedure is accepted according to
      international guidelines.

      Pharmacological treatment for uterine evacuation includes the administration of mifepristone
      and misoprostol or misoprostol alone. Nevertheless, surgical methods have been shown a
      greater acceptability and patient satisfaction due to a reduced incidence of adverse effects.
      Currently, Manual Vacuum Aspiration (MVA) is the technique recommended by the Brazilian
      Ministry of Health and the Brazilian Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics.

      MVA should be performed after cervical ripening. This pre-surgical procedure makes the
      procedure safer and more effective. In Brazil, misoprostol is the most suitable drug to be
      used in these cases because of its efficacy, ease of use, low cost, stability at room
      temperature, and availability. Misoprostol is a synthetic prostaglandin E1 analog and can be
      administered by oral, sublingual, buccal, rectal, and vaginal routes.
