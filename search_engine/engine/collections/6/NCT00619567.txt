      management, survival, and quality of life of affected patients and their families. Following
      the advent of Highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) the incidence of HIV-associated
      dementia (HAD) has fallen, but the prevalence of the milder forms of HIV-related cognitive
      disorders has risen. This is important because alterations in cognitive function can have
      significant impact on work and social activities, mood, and perceived quality of life. To
      date, pharmacological management of HIV-associated cognitive disorders - apart from HAART -
      have met with limited success (e.g., Peptide T, Ritalin). Therefore, it appears reasonable to
      ask whether the use of non-pharmacological tools might help alleviate or ameliorate the
      symptoms of the milder forms of cognitive impairment, and thus improve mood and activities of
      daily living. The purpose of this application is to request funds to allow us to complete a
      feasibility/pilot study of the merits of using an internet-based cognitive stimulation
      program (CSP) to improve the cognitive functions and quality of life of individuals with
      HIV/AIDS, and, secondarily, to detect such changes using a computerized assessment tool
      designed for use in a health care practitioner's office (Computer-Based Assessment of Mild
      Cognitive Impairment (CAMCI)).
