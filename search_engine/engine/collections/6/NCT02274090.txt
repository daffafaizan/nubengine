      subjects were categorized into two treatment groups: Scaling and root planing (SRP) plus 1%
      MF and SRP plus placebo. Clinical parameters were recorded at baseline, 3, 6 and 9 months;
      they included plaque index (PI), modified sulcus bleeding index (mSBI), probing depth (PD),
      and clinical attachment level (CAL). Radiologic assessment of intra bony defect (IBD) and
      percentage defect depth reduction (DDR%) was done at baseline, 6 months and 9 months interval
      using computer-aided software. PD, CAL and defect depth reduction was evaluated in initial
      pocket depth of ≥5mm and ≥7mm subgroup within placebo and MF group.

      Mean probing depth reduction and mean clinical attachment level gain was found to greater in
      MF group than placebo group at all visits. Significantly greater mean percentage of defect
      depth reduction was found in MF group than the placebo sites in both ≥5mm and ≥7mm of initial
      periodontal pocket depth. In MF group improvement in clinical parameter were similar in both
      the sites, with slightly better improvement in clinical parameters in initial pocket depth
      ≥7mm with respect to CAL, IBD and DDR% while PD was significantly reduced in initial pocket
      depth of ≥7mm.

      There was greater decrease in mSBI and PD and more CAL gain with significant IBD depth
      reduction at the sites treated with SRP plus locally delivered MF in chronic periodontitis
      subjects with intrabony defects as compared to placebo and effect of MF was similar in
      initial moderate periodontal pockets and deep pocket depths.
