    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of UCN-01 (7-hydroxystaurosporine) and irinotecan
      (irinotecan hydrochloride) in patients with resistant solid tumors. (Part I [closed to
      accrual as of 6/8/2007]) II. Determine the dose-limiting toxicity of this regimen in these
      patients. (Part I [closed to accrual as of 6/8/2007]) III. Determine the types of toxic
      effects of this regimen in these patients. (Part I [closed to accrual as of 6/8/2007]) IV.
      Determine the anti-tumor activity in terms of overall response rate (partial response [PR]
      and complete response [CR]), clinical benefit rate (PR, CR, and stable disease), and time to
      disease progression in patients with estrogen receptor-negative, progesterone
      receptor-negative, and HER-2 not amplified (triple negative) locally recurrent or metastatic
      breast cancer treated with this regimen. (Part II) V. Determine the side effect profile of
      this regimen in patients with triple negative recurrent breast cancer. (Part II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine any anti-tumor activity of this regimen in these patients. (Part I [closed to
      accrual as of 6/8/2007]) II. Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these
      patients. (Part I [closed to accrual as of 6/8/2007]) III. Determine the activity of the
      serum Î±-acid glycoprotein and correlate this level with free UCN-01 concentrations. (Part I
      [closed to accrual as of 6/8/2007]) IV. Determine the in vivo mechanisms of UCN-01 activity
      in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      PART I: Patients receive irinotecan hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes on days
      1, 8, 15, and 22 and 7-hydroxystaurosporine IV over 3 hours on days 2 and 23. Courses repeat
      every 42 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6
      patients receive escalating doses of irinotecan hydrochloride and 7-hydroxystaurosporine
      until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose
      preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Blood
      samples are collected periodically during study treatment.

      PART II: (treatment of triple negative recurrent breast cancer): Patients receive irinotecan
      hydrochloride IV and 7-hydroxystaurosporine IV as in part I at the MTD and undergo blood
      sample collection.
