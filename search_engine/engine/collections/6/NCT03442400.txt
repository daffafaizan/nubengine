      coronary hemodynamics in patients with severe aortic stenosis.

      Several factors confound the interpretation of fractional flow reserve (FFR) in patients with
      severe aortic stenosis (AS) and intermediate severity coronary stenoses, and the widely
      accepted cut-off value of 0.80 may not be applicable to this patient population. Coronary
      flow reserve is known to be attenuated under conditions of left ventricular hypertrophy and
      severe AS, with one study showing improvement in coronary flow reserve after aortic valve
      replacement. Left ventricular hypertrophy produces fixed resistance secondary to external
      compression of the coronary microcirculation. This potentially results in failure to achieve
      maximal hyperemia with adenosine and can lead to false negative FFR results. Neurohormonal
      influences in aortic stenosis can further attenuate vasodilator response and potentially
      result in false negative FFR values. Both of these conditions result in the potential
      deferral of lesions which may have been hemodynamically significant in the absence of severe
      AS. At present, there are no studies which have demonstrated validity of FFR measurement in
      patients with severe AS. Here, the investigators propose a prospective study of iFR/FFR in
      patients with AS and indeterminate coronary lesions undergoing TAVR to understand the
      hemodynamic consequences of AS on iFR/FFR. The investigators hypothesize that iFR/FFR values
      will be consistently and significantly higher pre-TAVR in comparison with post-TAVR for the
      same lesions.
