      biomarkers to predict response. PASS-01 will for the first time explore progression free
      survival differences in the two standard backbone regimens used in the advanced setting.
      Biomarker driven strategies in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) are lacking, perhaps
      accounting for a large number of failed phase II studies. This study will evaluate two
      standard of care chemotherapy regimens, but will also explore high content molecular
      profiling, chemotherapy sensitivity signatures, GATA6 and other putative biomarkers as
      predictors of response to chemotherapy. In addition, the use of patient derived organoid
      models for personalized medicine in PDAC will continue to develop within this study.

      Approximately 150 patients diagnosed with untreated metastatic pancreatic cancer will be
      randomized to either arm.
