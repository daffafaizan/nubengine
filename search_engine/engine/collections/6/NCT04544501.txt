    
      The investigators will conduct a two-arm RCT to evaluate the preliminary effectiveness of a
      culturally-adapted video developed by the team vs. FORCE fact sheet on enhancing genetic
      cancer risk assessment (GCRA; including genetic counseling and option for genetic testing)
      uptake and psychosocial outcomes among Latinas at increased risk for hereditary breast and
      ovarian cancer (HBOC).

      All participants will receive referrals to free telephone genetic counseling in Spanish to
      address cost, pragmatic, and language barriers. The investigators will recruit 28 Latina
      women at-risk of HBOC (14 randomized at each arm) at three sites with sizable Latinx
      populations. The sites include community clinics/health organizations and hospitals with whom
      we have established collaborations [Georgetown University (DC); Virginia Commonwealth
      University (VA)].

      Results will improve efforts to translate genomic guidelines into practice and will reduce
      disparities by evaluating a low cost highly disseminable culturally-targeted video while
      gathering data on effectiveness and implementation.

      Aim 1. Evaluate the impact of video vs. FORCE fact sheet on GCRA and testing uptake and
      psychosocial outcomes.

      Aim 2. Assess implementation potential and needs by evaluating feasibility, acceptability,
      reach, and adoption of the intervention arms (video and FORCE fact sheet) and of the HBOC
      screening process at the community clinics.
