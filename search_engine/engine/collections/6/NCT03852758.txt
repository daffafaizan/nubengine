      Rationale: Exercise is related to lower rates of late effects like fatigue, heart disease and
      second cancers among survivors of childhood cancer. Yet levels of exercise remain low among
      survivors. The context where exercise occurs - indoors or outdoors - may affect motivation to
      exercise and sustained exercise behavior. Yet the effects of exercise context on motivation
      and maintained behavior remain unexamined. This study aims to pilot test an outdoor exercise
      intervention for cancer survivors compared to attention controls receiving an indoor exercise
      intervention.

      Target Population: Adolescent (13 to 17 years) and young adult (18 to 30 years) survivors of
      any cancer or hematopoietic cell transplantation for non-malignant disease.

      Number of Participants :

      16 to 20 participants (8 to 10 adolescents, 8 to 10 young adults).

      Objective:

      Pilot test, for feasibility and acceptability, a novel outdoor exercise intervention to
      motivate and maintain exercise in adolescent and young adult survivors of childhood cancer.
      Using a randomized cross-over design, participants will randomly receive both indoor and
      outdoor exercise sessions.

      Study Design:

      Randomized Cross-over Pilot Trial

      Measures of Interest:

      Primary Outcome - Accelerometer measured moderate to vigorous physical activity.

      Secondary Outcomes - Self-Determination Theory based measures of motivation to exercise from
      validated survey questions. Fatigue, measured with validated survey questions.

      Semi-structured qualitative exit interview will be used to assess acceptability and
      feasibility of the intervention.
