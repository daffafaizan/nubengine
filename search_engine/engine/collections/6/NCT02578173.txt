      The AVERT PLUS is an FDA 510K cleared device which consists of 1) a contrast delivery
      modulator designed to reduce unnecessary contract dye delivery to the patient during
      angiography (coronary or peripheral) and 2) a concomitant contrast monitoring system to
      precisely measure contrast volume delivered to the patient. This will be a first in man
      prospective observational study of the accuracy of this system to quantify contrast volume
      used during clinically indicated angiography in the cardiac catheterization laboratory.
