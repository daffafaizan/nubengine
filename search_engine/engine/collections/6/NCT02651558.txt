      a brachial cuff providing only intermittent blood pressure measurements. In some case, it is
      required to add a continuous invasive monitoring of blood pressure, via the insertion of an
      arterial catheter. Unfortunately, the related morbidity is not negligible. To limit the
      consequences of such a gesture, some developments have been done in the past to allow for
      continuous non-invasive measurements of blood pressure during anesthesia. Unfortunately, most
      of these devices are subject to important limitations and constraints of use.

      A new system has been designed by CSEM consisting of an optical system fixed on patient's
      skin, absolutely non-invasive and easy to use. In order to study the reliability of this
      device, the investigators plan to compare its blood pressure estimates against gold-standard
      arterial catheter measurements during induction of general anesthesia on:

        -  40 patients wearing the optical system at the chest.

        -  and 40 patients wearing the optical system at the fingertip
