    
      Patients with cervical cancer receiving post-operative radiotherapy (RT) for high risk
      features found on pathologic review will be treated with pelvic intensity modulated radiation
      therapy (IMRT). Helical tomotherapy will be used to plan and deliver the radiation treatment.
      Treatment volume will include the upper third of the vagina and para-vaginal tissue and the
      common, external and internal iliac nodal regions. External beam radiation will be delivered
      in 180 cGy daily fractions to a total dose of 5040 cGy. Patients will receive once a day
      treatment five days a week, for approximately 6 weeks. Concurrent chemotherapy and/or
      intracavitary brachytherapy may be included in the treatment plan at the discretion of the
      treating physician, consistent with routine clinical practice.
