    
      Objective: The primary objective of the present study is to evaluate the effect of a high soy
      protein diet on insulin resistance and glycemic control in participants with characteristics
      of the metabolic syndrome. Secondly, the present study will evaluate whether reduced
      low-grade inflammation is a possible mechanism underlying the improvement in insulin
      resistance and glucose homeostasis. Finally, it will be assessed whether soy protein has
      beneficial effects on components of the metabolic syndrome, such as cardio-metabolic risk
      factors, blood lipid profile, blood pressure and endothelial function, fat storage in the
      liver and gene-expression in subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue.

      Study design: Single-blind, cross-over strictly-controlled dietary intervention.
