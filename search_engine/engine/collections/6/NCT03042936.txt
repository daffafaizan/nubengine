      (Knowler WC et al., 2002), which was developed by the Centers for Disease Control and
      Prevention (CDC). We have adapted the curriculum for youth to serve a supplement to the adult
      program. This program lasts 12 months, and the goals are to improve participants' health and
      reduce their risk of developing pre-diabetes or type 2 diabetes. The ISC program includes 16
      weekly (Phase 1), 3 bi-weekly (Phase 2), and 6 monthly (Phase 3) sessions. Sessions include
      60 minutes of physical fitness and 30 minutes of education. The education portion includes
      interactive teaching of a health-related topic (e.g., nutrition, exercise, physiology,
      mindfulness, and stress reduction) using a hand-on learning activity (e.g., cooking, crafts,
      games, and role play). All physical fitness activities incorporate moderate intensity
      exercises (e.g., push-ups, yoga, basketball, tag, and dance).
