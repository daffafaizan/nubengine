      between health services and mothers/families in resource poor communities. To address
      research needs on how to improve effectiveness of CHW training, the investigators tested an
      innovative CHW teaching methodology called "Sharing Histories" hypothesizing that this would
      empower and enable CHW to better teach mothers to improve health knowledge and behaviors that
      contribute to improved child growth.

      Method: The study was a cluster-randomized controlled trial: 22 health facility jurisdictions
      were matched and randomly assigned as experimental or control. Health personnel Tutors and
      female CHW were trained using either the "Sharing Histories" methodology (experimental) or a
      standard but still participatory teaching method (control). Training content, materials, and
      other interventions were held constant between study groups. Impact on maternal knowledge and
      practices, and child growth and morbidity were measured in representative household surveys
      at baseline, midterm, and final evaluation, with 600 mothers interviewed - 300 in each study
      group - at each point in time.
