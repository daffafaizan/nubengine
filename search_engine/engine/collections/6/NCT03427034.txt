      and 2 are cross-sectional studies examining the accuracy of the BladderLight® test in the
      detection of cancer of the urinary bladder in patients attending either Gross Haematuria
      clinic for a potential primary (first time) diagnosis (arm 1) or patients attending
      Cystsoscopic Surveillance clinic as follow up to a previous, treated case of bladder cancer
      (arm 2). Arm 3 is a longitudinal examination of disease state following a negative cystoscopy
      with a positive BladderLight® test - this will examine whether BladderLight® can predict
      progression to overt disease. Arm three will not involve any further requirement for physical
      sampling, but will involve result checking on subsequent cystoscopies
