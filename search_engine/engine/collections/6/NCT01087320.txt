      genome sequencing as appropriate) to discover causative molecular lesions for a set of rare,
      severe phenotypes hypothesized to be caused by either somatic mutations, germline de novo
      heterozygous mutations, germline inherited recessive, or germline inherited dominant
      mutations in currently unknown or uncharacterized genes. The goal of this research is
      threefold: to identify causative sequence variants for disorders whose molecular etiology was
      previously unknown, to apply this insight to both the rare disorders under study and more
      common phenotypes, and to enhance the study of mutation on a genome-wide level.

      We plan to recruit approximately three to six affected individuals along with both parents
      for each phenotype under study. Prospectively recruited trios will be brought to the NIH
      Clinical Center for brief clinical evaluations and molecular evaluation. Each trio will be
      consented to GSMS with the option to learn clinically relevant results, that is, those that
      explain the disorder in question (what we refer to as the primary variant ) as well as other
      clinically relevant findings discovered incidentally as part of the GSMS process (what we
      refer to as secondary variants ). Participants will be offered a return visit to NIH to learn
      these results.

      Sequence data generated at the NIH Intramural Sequencing Center (NISC) will be screened by
      staff in the Biesecker laboratory for sequence variants that conform to the hypothesized
      inheritance pattern. All sequence variants deemed clinically relevant will be validated in a
      CLIA-certified laboratory and the results returned to that participant. This protocol is
      being designed in a way that will provide the long-term potential for pursuing many different
      clinical projects.
