    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the rate of complete remission (CR) after 1 course of induction therapy with
      the timed-sequential combination of alvocidib (flavopiridol), cytarabine (cytosine
      arabinoside [ara-C]), and mitoxantrone hydrochloride (FLAM) vs traditional "7+3" cytarabine
      and daunorubicin hydrochloride (ara-C + Daunorubicin) for adults (age 18 to 70) with newly
      diagnosed, previously untreated, intermediate-risk or poor-risk acute myelogenous leukemia
      (AML).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate and compare the toxicities of FLAM vs 7+3. II. To compare the 2-year
      disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) in response to FLAM vs 7+3.

      III. To detect and compare the presence of minimal-residual disease (MRD) remaining after
      FLAM vs 7+3.

      IV. To determine the expression of ABC transport proteins multidrug resistance 1 (MDR1,
      ABCB1) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP, ABCG2) on AML blasts pretreatment and
      correlate the expressions of one or both proteins with CR and DFS in response to FLAM vs 7+3.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to risk features: age
      (< 50 vs >= 50), secondary AML (pre-existing myelodysplatic syndrome [MDS],
      myeloproliferative diseases [MPD], treatment-related [t]-AML, or severe multi-lineage
      dysplasia) and/or known adverse cytogenetics, and hyperleukocytosis (white blood cells [WBC]
      >= 50,000/mm^3). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive alvocidib intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1-3, cytarabine IV
      over 72 hours on days 6-8, and mitoxantrone hydrochloride IV over 1-2 hours on day 9.
      Patients who achieve complete or partial response to the first course (completion of all
      doses) may receive a second course of treatment or high-dose cytarabine after 21-63 days
      following blood count recovery, and/or undergo allogeneic bone marrow transplant.

      ARM II: Patients receive cytarabine IV continuously on days 1-7 and daunorubicin
      hydrochloride IV on days 1-3. Patients who have residual disease on day 14 may receive
      additional cytarabine for 5 days and daunorubicin hydrochloride for 2 days. Patients may
      undergo blood and bone marrow collection for correlative studies.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years, every
      6 months for 5 years, and then annually thereafter.
