    
      1. Objective to evaluate the tolerance and safety of multiple administration of fenloramide
           tablets in patients with early and mid-term Parkinson's disease: To evaluate the adverse
           events of DLT and MTD, adverse reactions, clinical laboratory tests (blood routine,
           blood biochemistry, coagulation function, urine routine, stool routine), vital signs, 12
           lead ECG and physical examination of fenloramide tablets in patients with early and
           mid-term Parkinson's disease .

        2. Objective to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of fenloramide tablets in patients with
           Parkinson's disease in early and middle stages. The main PK parameters included Tmax,
           SS, Cmax, SS, cavg, SS, Ke, T1 / 2, Cl / F (only fenloramide prototype), VZ / F (only
           fenloramide prototype), auc0-24, SS, aucinf, SS, auc0 last, SS, AUC_ %Extrap, DF, etc.

        3. Objective to explore the efficacy of fenloramide tablets in the treatment of early and
           mid-term Parkinson's disease, and to observe the changes of UPDRS and CGI.
