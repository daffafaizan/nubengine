      NY-ESO-1-specific TCR gene transduced T lymphocytes are transferred to HLA-A*02:01 or
      HLA-A*02:06 positive patients with solid tumors which are 1) unresectable, refractory to
      standard therapy (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, etc), and 2) NY-ESO-1-expressing. The primary
      objective is to evaluate the safety and in vivo kinetics, and the secondary is to evaluate
      clinical effect.
