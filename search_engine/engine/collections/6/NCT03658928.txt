    
      Primary objective

        -  To observe the overall survival of early stage NSCLC with adenocarcinoma histology after
           complete resection that had enrolled in I CAN study.

      Secondary objectives

        -  To observe the updated DFS of early stage NSCLC with adenocarcinoma histology after
           complete resection that had enrolled in I CAN study;

        -  To observe the treatment pattern after tumor recurrence of early stage NSCLC with
           adenocarcinoma histology after complete resection that had enrolled in I CAN study in
           real-world setting;

        -  To explore the risk factors of OS for early stage NSCLC with adenocarcinoma histology
           after complete resection that had enrolled in I CAN study in real-world setting, such as
           EGFR mutation status, gender, smoking history, treatment pattern after recurrence, etc.
