      the shoulder joint. It has a multifactorial origin and represents a wide spectrum of
      pathologies. Its main consequences are pain and loss of function in the glenohumeral joint.
      From a biomechanical point of view, subacromial syndrome causes an increment in the anterior
      and superior translation of the humeral head, which increases compression in the adjacent
      tissues of the subacromial space, aggravating the symptoms of the patients. Conservative
      treatments are the first option for subacromial syndrome management, despite the fact that
      there is limited evidence about its effectiveness, due to the lack of experimental studies.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a passive joint mobilization
      (caudal and dorsal gliding) grade II in the glenohumeral joint, within a multimodal approach
      to reduce pain and improve the range of motion in patients with subacromial syndrome. To this
      end, a randomized clinical trial will be carried out in the Montpellier Clinic in Zaragoza.
      Twenty-two patients will be recruited and randomly assigned to one of the two groups
      (intervention and control). Both groups will receive a standardized treatment consisting of:
      10 sessions of infrared rays, and a program of therapeutic exercises and indications to
      improve their postural hygiene. In addition, the intervention group will receive a passive
      joint mobilization in the glenohumeral joint of 5 minutes. Pain intensity, range of motion
      and functionality of the glenohumeral joint will be measured in the first session before any
      treatment and in the tenth session after the treatment.
