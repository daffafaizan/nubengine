      defect of lymphocyte apoptosis that leads to lymphoproliferation and autoimmunity. Although,
      there are immunosuppressive treatments for many of its complications, there currently is no
      safe and effective therapy for this syndrome itself.

      Valproic acid has been recently used as a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor for inducing
      apoptosis in malignancies and is being incorporated as part of hematology/oncology clinical
      trials. A pilot study will be conducted on the safety and efficacy of the drug valproic acid
      (Depakote [R]) for the treatment of ALPS. Twelve subjects with ALPS, will be treated
      initially for 4 months with twice-daily administration of valproic acid at escalating doses
      adjusted by weight, with close monitoring of toxicity and side effects including laboratory
      parameters related to the drug. The effects of valproic acid treatment on lymph node and/or
      spleen size will be assessed by computerized tomography scan, ultrasound and physical
      examination. If valproic acid is effective in reducing the size of lymph nodes and/or spleen
      size as defined in the study design, subjects may be offered the option to continue further
      therapy with valproic acid for up to 1 year. The effect of treatment on other laboratory
      features specific to ALPS will also be assessed. Evaluating the effects of valproic acid on
      these clinical and laboratory parameters will help to determine if this drug demonstrates
      sufficient activity to warrant study in a larger randomized controlled trial.
