    
      Objectives:

        1. To gain in-depth knowledge and understanding on whether people maintain essentialistic
           beliefs about food (foods as having immutable underlying 'essences' that contribute to
           the food's attributes and properties).

        2. To determine whether these beliefs may be associated with attitudes and expectations of
           foods that vary in their levels of processing.

        3. To explore the perceptions of essentialistic transference: The belief that the essence
           of a food is transferred to a person who consumes the food, which manifests the
           properties of the food in the consumer (E.g., the belief that people who have a diet of
           eating fast-running animals are also fast runners).

      Study Design:

      This study involves 2 parts: Study 1A & Study 1B.

      Study 1A:

      300 participants in Singapore, aged between 21-65 years old will be recruited to do an online
      survey on Qualtrics. Participants would first rate their baseline appetite before proceeding
      to the survey. For this study, the food categories will be: Milk, Rice, Carrot and Chicken.
      There will be a total of 7 different kinds of foods varying in the levels of processing per
      category and the images of these foods will be presented in a randomized order. Participants
      will rate their perceptions of the properties of foods (e.g. nutritiousness, naturalness,
      familiarity, liking, taste, stereotypical trait, and processing) on a scale that ranges from
      "Not at all" to "Very much".

      After rating their perceptions of the properties of foods, participants will complete
      questionnaires measuring: Essentialistic beliefs about food (EFS: 6-point scale from
      "Strongly Disagree" to "Strongly Agree"), perceptions of essentialistic transference (ETS:
      6-point scale with 2 opposite traits as anchors e.g. "Very Irritable" to "Very
      good-natured"), nutrition knowledge (NKS: 6-point scale from "Strongly Disagree" to "Strongly
      Agree"), importance of food naturalness (FNS: 6-point scale from "Strongly Disagree" to
      "Strongly Agree") and consumers' fears towards food technology (FTNS: 7-point scale from
      "Strongly Disagree" to "Strongly Agree").

      Study 1B:

      300 participants in Singapore, aged between 21-65 years old will be recruited to do an online
      survey on Qualtrics. Participants would first rate their baseline appetite before proceeding
      to the survey. For this study, the food categories will be: Fish, Orange, Napa Cabbage,
      Peanut and Beef. There will be a total of 7 different kinds of foods varying in the levels of
      processing per category and 2 foods-in-name (e.g. Vuna and Impossible burger), and the images
      of these foods will be presented in a randomize order. Participants will rate their
      perceptions of the properties of foods (e.g. nutritiousness, naturalness, familiarity,
      liking, taste, stereotypical trait, and processing) on a scale that ranges from "Not at all"
      to "Very much".

      After rating their perceptions of the properties of foods, participants will complete
      questionnaires measuring: Essentialistic beliefs about food (EFS: 6-point scale from
      "Strongly Disagree" to "Strongly Agree"), perceptions of essentialistic transference (ETS:
      6-point scale with 2 opposite traits as anchors e.g. "Very Irritable" to "Very
      good-natured"), nutrition knowledge (NKS: 6-point scale from "Strongly Disagree" to "Strongly
      Agree"), importance of food naturalness (FNS: 6-point scale from "Strongly Disagree" to
      "Strongly Agree") and consumers' fears towards food technology (FTNS: 7-point scale from
      "Strongly Disagree" to "Strongly Agree").
