      illness. However, ICU survivors often experience significant post-ICU morbidities including
      muscle weakness and impairments in physical functioning that can persist for years. We
      hypothesized that early intervention with two of the most basic features of critical care:
      nutrition (feeding high protein) together with mobility (early resistance exercise) may help
      to attenuate muscle loss, thereby reducing the severity of ICU-acquired weakness and its
      associated physical impairments. A 2-arm, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial is
      proposed to investigate the effect of the combined interventions. The intervention will be
      conducted for up to 28 days in the ICU. Outcome measurements will be conducted by a blinded
      assessor at baseline (within 24 hours of randomization), Day 10 post-randomization, before
      hospital discharge and at 6-month post-randomization. Ultrasound and bioelectrical impedance
      analysis will be conducted to measure muscle mass and quality. Manual muscle testing,
      handgrip and knee extension strength will also be measured. Physical function will be
      assessed by a series of test including the six minutes walk test. Telephone interview will be
      conducted to administer quality of life questionnaires at 6 months. These combined simple and
      non-invasive interventions, if proven effective, may potentially revolutionize critical care.
