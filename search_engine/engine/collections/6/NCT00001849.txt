      ectopic production of adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH) that causes cortisol excess. In
      approximately 50 percent of these patients, the source of ACTH cannot be found despite very
      detailed and extensive examination including imaging studies such as computed tomography
      scanning, magnetic resonance imaging, and octreotide scan (octreoscan) using the conventional
      low dose of indium-111 pentetreotide. The sensitivity and specificity of these imaging
      studies depends on anatomic alterations and/or the dose and adequate uptake of
      radiopharmaceutical. In contrast, positron emission tomography (PET) has the ability to
      detect pathologic tissue based on physiologic and biochemical processes within the abnormal
      tissue. This protocol tests whether fluorine-18 dihydroxyphenylalanine (F-DOPA) or use of a
      higher dose of indium-111 pentetreotide (Octreoscan) can be used to localize successfully the
      source of ectopic ACTH production. In addition the study examines whether administration of
      the glucocorticoid antagonist mifepristone can improved the sensitivity of the standard dose
      Octreoscan. Eligible patients participating in this arm of the study will have a second
      standard dose scan. Others will receive a higher dose octreoscan instead.
