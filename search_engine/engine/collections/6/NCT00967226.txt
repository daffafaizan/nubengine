      completed before starting medication if the extent of the hemangioma is not evident on
      clinical examination alone. Infants will be randomized to receive either propranolol or
      steroids for 4-6 months. Hemangioma response will be measured and compared monthly as will
      tolerability of the medications. Additionally, urine specimens will be collected at each
      visit to determine if markers are present that can predict response to therapy.

      Additionally, any hemangiomas that are excised will be examined for genetic markers to aid in
      predicting response to therapy.
