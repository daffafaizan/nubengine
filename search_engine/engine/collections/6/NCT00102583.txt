    
      The objective of this randomized pilot study is to investigate the safety and potential
      efficacy of a CsA implant in participants with lacrimal gland involvement and aqueous tear
      deficiency related to GVHD. Safety will be evaluated in terms of adverse events related to
      the implant. Efficacy will be evaluated by changes in Schirmer tear test (with anesthesia).
      Secondary efficacy evaluation will include changes in corneal and conjunctival staining
      grades, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), the Ocular Surface Diseases Index (OSDI),
      changes in conjunctival GVHD grades, tear break-up time and meibomian gland dysfunction.

      Participants with active systemic GVHD with aqueous tear deficiency associated with lacrimal
      gland dysfunction following allogeneic hematopoietic SCT who are nine years of age or older
      are eligible for inclusion in this pilot study. The study will involve surgical placement of
      the CsA implant into the subconjunctival space adjacent to the lacrimal gland of one eye in
      each participant. Participants older than 12 years of age will be randomized to receive one
      of two implant release rates. However, all participants under age 12 will not be randomized
      and will only be eligible to receive the smaller, lower dose implant. On each anniversary
      study visit a participant will be given the opportunity to retain the implant on an annual
      basis. This will be based upon the determination of clinical success (defined in the Study
      Design section below) combined with a participant's report of symptom improvement. The
      Implant will be removed if the Investigator believes the implant is harmful or if the
      participant requests the implant to be removed.
