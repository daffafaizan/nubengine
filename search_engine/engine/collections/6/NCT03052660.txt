      questionable, regarding the risk-benefit assessment and the lack of evidence for this
      practice. Particularly, in elderly patients (â‰¥65 years), a higher risk for adverse events is
      described.

      Patients will be randomly assigned to one of the following two study groups. Preoperatively,
      group 1 will receive midazolam and group 2 will receive placebo.

      Anaesthesia will be performed according to the clinical routine.

      All possible side effects are described in the SmPC for midazolam. For the placebo-group, we
      do not expect any harm, as in the case of strong preoperative anxiety or agitation,
      additional midazolam application may occur on behalf of the attending anaesthesist at any
      time.

      The sample size was calculated based on detecting a minimum of 5 unit difference in the
      primary outcome variable overall patient satisfaction measured with the EVAN-G. Setting a
      type 1 error of 0.05, a power of 0.8 and assuming the standard deviation of EVAN-G to be 14
      units, 248 patients per group are needed to detect a 5 unit difference.

      Considering a drop-out of 10% and a screening failure of 10%, we decided to include 614
      patients in total.

      The hypothesis of the study is that global patient satisfaction after surgery in elderly
      patients is similar after preoperative placebo application compared to midazolam application.
