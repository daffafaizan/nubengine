      volumetric and diffusion markers of neuronal degeneration to predict disease progression and
      response to (acetyl-)cholinergic treatment with Galantamine (Reminyl®). Furthermore, analysis
      of longitudinal MRI data in respect to cortical and subcortical atrophy and fiber
      degeneration will provide an estimate of the potential of new MRI analysis techniques to
      determine effects of (acetyl-)cholinergic treatment on rates of disease progression. Finally,
      the proposed study will allow determining the potential value of a new MRI technique,
      diffusion tensor imaging, to show the morphological correlate of cortical disconnection in AD
      and to map progression and treatment related effects on subcortical fiber tract integrity in
      AD.

      The major scientific value of this project is the combined description of the effect of
      Galantamine (Reminyl®) on disease progression on the structural level of analysis in AD. The
      data from this project may help to identify predictors of treatment response and to elucidate
      the mechanisms of drug action of Galantamine (Reminyl®) in AD.
