      improvement in HbA1c levels and in lower rates of hypoglycemia compared to glargine U100
      insulin. However, no previous studies have compared the safety and efficacy of the
      long-acting basal insulin degludec in the inpatient management of patients with diabetes. It
      is expected that a large number of patients with diabetes will be started or transitioned to
      this new insulin formulation; so acquiring knowledge on their safety and efficacy is of great
      clinical interest. Accordingly, the proposed study will provide novel and clinically useful
      information on the efficacy (blood glucose control) and safety (hypoglycemia) of degludec in
      the inpatient setting and after hospital discharge in general medicine and surgery patients
      with Type 2 Diabetes (T2D).
