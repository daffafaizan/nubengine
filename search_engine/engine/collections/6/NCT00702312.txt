      kidney patients salt intake. Furthermore, we assessed their educational needs to inform the
      development and implementation of an educational programme to reduce dietary salt intake in
      line with the Department of Health recommendations for a good blood pressure control. The
      educational programme will be tested in a randomized controlled trial. We are interested in
      salt because studies have shown that salt is one of the causes of high blood pressure.
      Scientific studies have also shown that the longer a person has high blood pressure the more
      the damage to the kidneys.
