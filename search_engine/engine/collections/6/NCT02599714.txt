      Part A is a Phase 1 triplet-dose finding investigation in 3-6 patients per cohort to
      determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the triplet.

      Part B is a single arm expansion in approximately 27 patients evaluable for response to
      define the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D).

      Part C was intended to investigate the efficacy of the triplet combination at the RP2D in a
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, stratified, parallel group extension. Part C
      was intended to include ER+, locally advanced and/or metastatic breast cancer patients who
      have progressed following prior non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor (NSAI) endocrine therapy.
      Patients in Part C were to be randomized to receive either the triplet combination (AZD2014 +
      palbociclib + fulvestrant) or the doublet (matching AZD2014 placebo + palbociclib +
      fulvestrant). Patients were to be stratified according to hormone sensitivity, presence of
      visceral metastases, and prior CDK inhibitor treatment. Part C would have been conducted if
      indicated by the emerging data.
