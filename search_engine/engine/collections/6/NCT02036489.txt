    
      Induction therapy is administered. Patients experiencing slow response (> 10 % blasts in the
      15th mo of treatment) were included in the LAL -AR -03 protocol, on the arm of intensified
      induction. Those who do not reach the RC will be excluded from the study and will be treated
      according to the protocol LAL-AR/03 , which will be incorporated receiving blocks
      consolidation. All patients in CR consolidation treatment (1 and 2 ) followed reinducciones
      maintenance (maintenance -1 ) to complete the first year of treatment and maintenance without
      reinducciones (maintenance -2 ) to complete two years from the RC will be administered . If
      after union persistent high levels of ER ( > 0.05 %) and this reappears later during
      maintenance therapy the patient will be excluded from the study and will be treated according
      to the protocol of high risk ( PETHEMA LAL-AR/03 ) . In case of persistent high levels of ER
      patients after consolidation will consolidate blocks PETHEMA LAL-AR/03 protocol followed by
      allogeneic HSCT . If the ER reappears during maintenance treatment the patient will receive
      an allogeneic HSCT , Standby thereof, may be administered one or two blocks consolidation of
      LAL -AR -03 protocol.

      To allow time to better characterize the LLA and thus ensure proper inclusion of patients in
      the study recommends administering a prephase with :

      - Prednisone ( PDN) 60 mg/m2 po or iv through characterization of LAL with a maximum of 7
      days.

      During the week of administration of each cycle of chemotherapy reinduction continuous
      suspended.

      Evaluation after the fourth reinduction . Immunophenotypic study of a new bone marrow will be
      made

        -  If ER is < 0.01 % , subsequent reinducciones are suspended and continues only with
           continuous chemotherapy until week 52 , at which point it switches to maintenance -2.

        -  If ER between 0.05% and 0.01% , the reinducciones 5 was administered to 8

        -  If ER > 0.05 % (tested on two separate occasions 15 days ) the patient will go to
           high-risk protocol ( PETHEMA LAL-AR/2003 ) .

      Treatment Support 2 It consisitirá in continuous administration of chemotherapy (
      mercaptopurine, and methotrexate ) to complete two years in continuous complete remission .

        -  MP 50 mg/m2 per day, p.o

        -  MTX 20 mg/m2 per week , i.m. Throughout the maintenance treatment should seek to retain
           WBC counts between 2.5 and 5x109 / L and platelet counts above 120x109 / L. If these
           lower limits should be reduced is decreased by 20 % doses of MP and MTX. If the numbers
           of leukocytes exceed 5x109 / L will increase by 20 % the dose of MP (50 to 60 mg/m2 )
