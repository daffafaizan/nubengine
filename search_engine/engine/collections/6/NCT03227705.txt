    
      Hypothesis: A standardized recruitment process could allow the inclusion of 0.9% patient (CI
      95%: 0,78-1.04) among women receiving a 18-23 weeks ultrasound scan.

      Recruitment: Participants will be recruited, in a three-step manner, among women appointing
      for the 18-23 weeks ultrasound scan; i) assessment of the cervical length by abdominal
      ultrasound, ii) an endovaginal ultrasound measurement will be performed if the cervical
      length is ≤ 30 mm, iii) enrollment and consent of the patient to the pilot study, under the
      confirmation of the presence of a short cervix (≤ 25 mm) by the endovaginal ultrasound.

      Intervention: Vaginal progesterone (200 mg/day, PROMETRIUM®, Merck Canada Inc.) until 37
      weeks. Perforated cerclage pessaries (Dr. Arabin GmbH & Co. KG) will be placed in specialized
      clinic and will be removed at 37 weeks.

      Size of the sampling and statistical analysis: This multicenter pilot study will be conducted
      in High-Risk Pregnancies Clinics in Quebec and in Ontario.

      Over the 12 months period, the investigators expect to collect data from 26 000 abdominal
      ultrasounds. In accordance with the anticipated recruitment level of 0.9%, the investigators
      planned on enrolling 250 women. Within those women, 125 will be assigned randomly to the
      "progesterone" group and 125 to the "progesterone and pessary" group (1:1 ratio).

      Perspective: This pilot study is designed to identify the challenges and provide strategies
      to deal with them in a larger study. Providing its feasibility, this study will lead to a
      definitive randomized controlled trial (including over 70 centers) to test the effectiveness
      of pessary and progesterone in preventing preterm birth.
