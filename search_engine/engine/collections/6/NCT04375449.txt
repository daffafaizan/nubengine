      with alpha-glucosidase inhibiting properties (Pep2Dia速) has the potential to modulate
      postprandial hyperglycaemia in prediabetic subjects.

      Thereby, incremental areas under the curve (iAUC) of glucose as the primary outcome were
      significantly reduced by a single dosage of 1400 mg Pep2Dia速 compared to placebo the second
      study is to investigate the 180 min postprandial response on blood glucose and insulin levels
      after intake of Pep2Dia速 in two different dosages compared to placebo in the context of a
      meal challenge test, providing 75 g of carbohydrates. Pep2Dia速 will be administered 15 min
      prior to a standardized challenge meal. Furthermore, the 120 min postprandial incretin
      response in terms of Glucagon-like Peptide-1 (GLP-1) will be determined. Changes in insulin
      sensitivity will be determined by the Matsuda-index as appropriate outcome measure.
