      glomerular filtration rate(GFR) from baseline in response to stimuli (e.g., protein load).We
      hypothesized that renal functional reserve may be better in patients with clinical T1 renal
      cell carcinoma(RCC) undergoing laparoscopic partial(LPN) nephrectomy with precise segmental
      renal artery clamping than those with complete renal arterial clamping.
