      attention globally. Infected patients may develop severe and even fatal respiratory diseases
      (e.g., acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute respiratory failure) ending up in
      intensive care. Apart from physical suffering, it is not uncommon for confirmed or suspected
      cases of COVID-19 to suffer from great psychological pressure and other health-related
      problems. The limited knowledge of the COVID-19 and the overwhelming news may lead to anxiety
      and fear in the public. The public at large may also experience boredom, disappointment, and
      irritability under the isolation measures.

      Depression and anxiety are common mental health problems experienced by university students.
      Being in higher education is associated with many stressors and transitional events, and
      students fall within the age range when common mental health problems are at their
      developmental peak. Depression and anxiety can impair students' academic performance and
      social functioning, cause significant burden at university, and potentially affect their
      future career opportunities. The study includes 2 parts. Part A is an online survey study
      with non-probabilistic convenience sampling and part B is focus group interviews.

      This study aims to explore the psychological impact of COVID-19 and coping methods in higher
      education students.
