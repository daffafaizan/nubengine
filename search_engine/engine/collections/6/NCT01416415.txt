      public health impact. The only treatment proven to slow or arrest the progression of the
      disease process is intraocular pressure (IOP) reduction, which relies heavily on patient
      cooperation. Previously, nonadherence to glaucoma medications has ranged from 24% to 59%.
      Barriers to medication compliance in the glaucoma patient population include health literacy,
      poor comprehension of disease, poor comprehension of medication regimen, and improper eye
      drop administration technique. The purpose of this randomized, controlled clinical trial is
      to assess whether an educational intervention will have a positive effect on patients'
      ability to properly administer eye drops. Patients randomized to the experimental group will
      receive the educational intervention, consisting of an instructional video demonstrating how
      to instill eyedrops. Patients randomized to the control group will receive an attention
      placebo, consisting of a video regarding healthy eating tips. Additional measures that will
      be obtained from all patients include a health literacy score, as measured using the REALM
      questionnaire, and a BMQ - specific score (Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire) using the
      BMQ-specific questionnaire. If the education protocol is found to positively affect eye drop
      administration success, as demonstrated by a statistically significant difference between the
      experimental and control groups, suggestions will be proposed for the implementation of
      educational programs similar to ours to improve glaucoma patient outcomes.
