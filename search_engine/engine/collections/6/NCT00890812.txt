      myocardial infarction. However, checking factor XI levels is not currently indicated to
      assess individual thromboembolic risk. Factor XI is an important protease that links the
      extrinsic arm of the coagulation cascade with the intrinsic arm through dual activation by
      both factor XII and thrombin. Since thrombin is a downstream product of factor XI, a feedback
      loop is created that amplifies thrombin production and ultimately results formation of a
      stable fibrin clot. Sufficient thrombin generation via this pathway also contributes to
      activation of the Thrombin-Activatable Fibrinolysis Inhibitor (TAFI). Activated TAFI
      downregulates fibrinolysis and has been implicated as part of the association between
      elevated factor XI levels and venous thromboembolic disease. One study found that functional
      TAFI levels of > 120% increased the risk of ischemic stroke approximately 6-fold, however,
      the association between Factor XI and ischemic stroke has yet to be firmly established. We
      recently performed a preliminary retrospective analysis of 78 patients with stroke or
      transient ischemic attack (TIA) and found that patients with factor XI activity levels above
      the 95th percentile of an age and sex matched reference population had a relative risk of 5.3
      for stroke or TIA. Factor XI measurements may be able to help identify thromboembolic
      disease, aiding in the determination of stroke etiology.
