    
      This study was a multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group,
      confirmatory study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ASP015K (100 and 150 mg/day)
      administered in combination with MTX in participants with RA who had an inadequate response
      to MTX.

      Participants orally received ASP015K 100 mg, ASP015K 150 mg or placebo once daily (QD) in
      combination with MTX after breakfast for 52 weeks.

      At Week 12, inadequate responders in the placebo group, as determined by a < 20% improvement
      from baseline (i.e., treatment initiation day) in tender or painful joint count (TJC) and
      swollen joint count (SJC), were switched to either ASP015K 100 mg or ASP015K 150 mg, and the
      dosage was maintained until the end of treatment (EOT). In addition, participants who
      received placebo at Week 28 were switched to either ASP015K 100 mg or ASP015K 150 mg, and the
      dosage was maintained until the EOT.

      The ASP015K dose that was started for placebo group participants at Week 12 or Week 28 was
      randomly chosen at baseline. The dose was switched under the blinded condition.

      Participants who completed this study were eligible for participation in the open-label
      extension study (015K-CL-RAJ2). Participants made a follow-up visit after the week 52 visit
      if they did not enroll into the extension study on the day of the week 52 visit.
