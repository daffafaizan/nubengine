      resistance of chemotherapy and tumor local of metastatic recurrence.

      The primary endpoint of this study is Disease Free Survival and the secondary endpoint is
      5-year Overall Survival.

      5ml peripheral blood will be sorted and counted through flow cytometry at the point of before
      primary treatment(surgery for colon cancers, neoadjuvant therapy for rectal cancers) , before
      the first chemotherapy postoperatively and 1 month after last chemotherapy.

      Patients will be followed up with 3 monthly assessments in the first two years and 6 monthly
      assessments in the rest three years. Stratification factors include age , BMI , gender ,
      tumor location , rectal or colon cancer stage,the chemotherapy (FOLFOX, XELOX, DeGramont or
      Capecitabine ),laparoscopic or laprotomy, anastomosis, concomitant medications and
      complications.
