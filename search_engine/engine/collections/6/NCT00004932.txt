        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxicity of imatinib mesylate in
           patients with recurrent Philadelphia chromosome-positive leukemia.

        -  Characterize the pharmacokinetic behavior of this drug in this patient population.

        -  Determine preliminarily the antileukemic activity of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate (STI571) once daily for 28 days. Treatment continues
      in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of STI571 until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 3
      or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 6 months for 4 years and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 32 patients will be accrued for this study within 3.5 years.
