      restorative material in adhesive dentistry. Today, there are only two available products in
      the market for clinical use: Vertise Flow and Fusio Liquid Dentin. Self-adhering flowable
      composite was introduced to address the time-consuming procedure used with traditional
      materials Their resin matrix contains acidic functional adhesive monomers mediating bonding
      with dental hard tissues and, therefore, separate etching and additional bonding are not
      required. SAFCs have been mainly advertised for the restoration of small Class I, Class III
      and V cavities, for cavity lining, and for use as a pit and fissure sealant.

      Self-adhering flowable composite combines the merits of both adhesive and restorative
      material technologies in one product, bringing novel horizons to restorative techniques, as
      it is a direct composite resin restorative material that has an adhesive resin together with
      a flowable composite resin. It is based on the bonding technology that uses glycerophosphate
      dimethacrylate(GPDM)to etch enamel and dentin, and hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) to
      enhance wetting and penetration by resin into dentin. This resin bonds chemically between the
      phosphate groups of a GPDM monomer and the hydroxyapatite of tooth structure and, also,
      micromechanically between the polymerized monomers of the self-adhering flowable composite
      resin and the collagen fibers and smear layer of dentin.
