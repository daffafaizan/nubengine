      infusions. While the hourly rate for low-dose ketamine infusions used for adjunctive
      analgesia appears to be well-established both in the medical literature and our institutional
      protocols, there is no information available for this specific population of patients (adult
      acute burn injury) to know whether the infusions should be utilized for discrete periods of
      time or should be given continuously. Findings from this study will help provide preliminary
      data on the optimal dosing strategy of this medication for adjunctive analgesia in this
      population.
