      However, the stimulation in those studies used electrodes in dorsolateral frontal areas (F3,
      F4 versus contralateral mastoids), consistent with the assumption that human SOs emanate from
      frontal neocortex. In the present study, we hypothesized that transcranial electrical
      stimulation (TES) could be applied to frontopolar and inferior frontal head sites in order to
      synchronize the limbic sources of SOs specifically and thereby enhance the duration of N3
      sleep. Furthermore, based on our computational modeling with this more optimal targeting of
      the limbic sites, we hypothesized that we could use lower TES current levels (0.5 mA versus 1
      or 2 mA in previous studies) that would be unlikely to disrupt sleep and that may still be
      successful in synchronizing SOs to enhance the adaptive neurophysiology of deep sleep.
