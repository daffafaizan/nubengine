        -  Stage 1: 23 patients. If â‰¥4 patients had clinical benefit, an additional 32 patients
           were to be enrolled. Up to 3 additional patients with platelet-derived growth factor
           receptor, alpha polypeptide (PDGFRA) mutation were to be enrolled, regardless of the
           total study enrollment.

        -  Stage 2: 55 patients. Progressing to this stage was dependent on Stage 1 results.

      Analyzed:

        -  Stage 1: 27 patients were enrolled and analyzed. The study was not expanded to Stage 2
           due to insufficient efficacy.
