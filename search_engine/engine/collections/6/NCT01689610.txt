    
      The main focus of this non-interventional study is set on answering the following questions:

        -  Can the results observed in controlled clinical trials regarding efficacy and safety be
           reproduced in the routine clinical setting?

        -  Are the side-effects of nab-paclitaxel therapy observed in this study comparable to the
           previously described safety-profile in terms of frequency and intensity?

        -  What are the main reasons for modification or termination of the nab-paclitaxel therapy?

        -  How does nab-paclitaxel therapy influence the patients' quality of life?

        -  What are the criteria for selecting nab-paclitaxel as therapy for metastatic breast
           cancer?
