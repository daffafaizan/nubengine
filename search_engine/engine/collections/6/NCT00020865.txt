      patients with fever and neutropenia. II. Compare the percentage of patients whose fever
      defervesces and who have no signs or symptoms of infection with and without therapeutic
      modification. III. Compare the percentage of survival of patients treated with these 2
      regimens with no therapeutic modifications. IV. Compare the overall survival of patients
      treated with these 2 regimens regardless of therapeutic modifications. V. Compare the time to
      resolution of fever in patients treated with these regimens. VI. Compare the microbiologic
      response by pathogen and site of infection in patients treated with these regimens. VII.
      Compare the percentage of patients whose fever defervesces only after resolution of
      neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count at least 500/mm3) with no therapeutic modification.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to type of malignancy (solid tumor, including lymphoma vs leukemia), prior
      prophylactic antibiotics (yes vs no), and participating center. Patients are randomized to
      one of two treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive levofloxacin IV over 90 minutes once daily
      for 14-28 days. Arm II: Patients receive cefepime IV over 30 minutes every 8 hours for 14-28
      days. Patients may receive additional antifungal, antibacterial, or antiviral therapy if
      condition has deteriorated, no response is seen in 72 hours, or and infection is suspected or
      documented. Patients are followed at 1-3 and 7-12 days and then at 3-4 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 260-400 patients (130-200 per treatment arm) will be accrued
      for this study.
