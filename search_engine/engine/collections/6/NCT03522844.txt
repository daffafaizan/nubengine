      disseminated, and people with anxiety are interested in mindfulness. A benefit of mindfulness
      interventions is that they can be provided outside of a mental health setting, which may make
      them more acceptable to patients. Although mindfulness meditation is gaining popularity,
      there is no information how this treatment strategy compares with standard treatment, such as
      with medication. Patients need more information about the comparison of treatments to be able
      to make informed decisions about their health care. We propose the first randomized,
      controlled study to assess the comparative effectiveness of Mindfulness-Based Stress
      Reduction (MBSR) compared to escitalopram, a standard medication for patients with anxiety
      disorders such as generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and
      agoraphobia.

      Patients will be randomized into two 8-week treatments: (1) MBSR and (2) escitalopram. To
      enroll the necessary sample, we will utilize three study sites in different geographic
      locations that each have strong clinical and research infrastructures: Georgetown University
      Medical Center, Massachusetts General Hospital and New York University Langone Medical
      Center. Thus, we will take advantage of three productive teams with previous successful
      collaborations and experience in mind-body treatment studies.
