      procedures are also increasing. Frequent complications after surgery are nutritional
      deficiencies (e.g. vitamins, minerals, protein) which require mandatory long-term follow-up.
      So far adequate follow-up programs are only provided in specialized bariatric centers like in
      the outpatient clinic for obesity at the General Hospital of Vienna. These programs are
      focusing on prevention and premature identification of deficiencies.

      Rising numbers of bariatric-surgical procedures pose a challenge for bariatric centres
      because of the accumulating numbers of bariatric patients requesting follow-up at least once
      a year.

      To provide full coverage an appropriate possibility would be to transfer follow up to
      non-specialised facilities including general practitioners and family doctors using a so
      called "pass" providing practical treatment recommendations (necessary follow-up
      appointments, laboratory blood tests, questions regarding nutrition and lifestyle behavior).

      To our best knowledge such a structured post-bariatric care management program in primary
      care does not exist by now. The aim of this study is therefore the evaluation of such a pass.
