      Existing methods of treatment includes identification and elimination of factors contributing
      to the delirium in addition to pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatment interventions
      (Trzepacz et al., 1999). Antipsychotics can play an important role in the management of the
      symptoms of delirium.
