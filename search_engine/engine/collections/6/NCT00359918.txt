    
      Patients with STEMI with symptoms < 3 hours are randomized in the region of Leipzig to either
      prehospital full-dose fibrinolysis (+ASA, Clopidogrel and heparin) with subsequent
      facilitated percutaneous coronary intervention or to primary percutaneous coronary
      intervention (after ASA + heparin + clopidogrel).

      Patients undergo cardiac magnetic resonance for assessment of infarct size early at day 1-4
      after randomization.
