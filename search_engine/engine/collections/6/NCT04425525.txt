      method in coronary artery disease. Although the median sternotomy has advantages in terms of
      ease of application, cost and long-term survival, muskuloskeletal complications can be
      encountered in the postoperative period.

      In the studies conducted, it was found that patients had difficulties in functional
      activities including mobilization and daily life activities after median sternotomy. Also
      restrictions or loss of motion can be observed in the joint range of motion of the shoulder
      joint and thoracic region.

      The FDQ-s scale consists of 10 functional tasks developed by Sturgess et al. These tasks are
      activities such as coughing, sneezing, deep breathing, movements involving the upper
      extremity, turning in bed, sitting upright in the chair, and ambulation. When applying FDQ-s,
      patients will mark how hard they are in each task on the 100 mm straight line. The first
      point on the left means "no difficulty" and the last point on the right means "maximum
      difficulty". The score will be determined by measuring from the starting point to the place
      marked by the patient. The total score is at most 100 points and at least 0 points. The high
      score indicates that the patient's difficulty level is high.

      Although there are many functional difficulties faced by patients in the postoperative
      period, there is no outcome measurement in our language that evaluates the level of these
      difficulties globally and objectively.

      Our research will be done due to the elimination of this deficiency in the literature.
