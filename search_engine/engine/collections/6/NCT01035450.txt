      Everolimus-eluting stent is a new coronary drug-eluting stent, which is going to be approved
      in the first quarter of 2010 by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare. It has
      recently been reported that everolimus-eluting stent had lower rate of target-lesion
      revascularization and stent thrombosis at 1 year as compared with paclitaxel-eluting stent.
      However, trial results comparing everolimus-eluting stent with sirolimus-eluting stent are
      largely unknown. The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether the newly-approved
      everolimus-eluting stent is not inferior to the sirolimus-eluting stent in terms of the rate
      of target-lesion revascularization at 1-year and death or myocardial infarction at 3-year
      after stent implantation in the real world clinical practice. The design of this study is
      all-comer design enrolling patients scheduled for percutaneous coronary intervention using
      drug-eluting stents without any exclusion criteria.
