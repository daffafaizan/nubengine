    
      To perform a randomized, controlled, study on patients that undergo PPV for vitreous
      hemorrhage secondary to PDRP. Half of the patients will receive an intravitreal Ozurdex
      implant immediately after surgery. The primary outcome measure is the proportion of patients
      that, due to rebleeding within 12 months, have a second PPV. Secondary outcome measures
      include the number of episodes of vitreous hemorrhage that occur within 12 months after
      surgery but clear spontaneously.
