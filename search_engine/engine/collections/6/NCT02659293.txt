        -  To compare progression free survival between Kyprolis (Carfilzomib), Revlimid
           (lenalidomide), Dexamethasone (KRd) arm and lenalidomide arm

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To determine the rate of minimal residual negative disease (MRD) at 6 and 12 months
           after randomization

        -  To compare the efficacy (rate of partial response, very good partial response, complete
           response, and stringent complete response) of KRd vs. Lenalidomide alone after
           randomization
