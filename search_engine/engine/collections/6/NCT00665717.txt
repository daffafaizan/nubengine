      pravastatin are expected to be co-administered frequently in HIV-infected patients.Since both
      agents share the same metabolic pathway, there is a potential for a pharmacokinetic drug-drug
      interaction.

      Because co-administration will be indicated in many HIV-infected patients, it is essential to
      investigate this potential interaction.
