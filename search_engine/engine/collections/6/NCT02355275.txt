      extensively studied, but study of the strategies for preventing the progression of acute LBP
      episodes into chronic back pain is still lacking. Therefore, determining the most effective
      secondary prevention strategy for the prevention of recurrences of LBP is essential for the
      reduction of long term disability. The purpose of this study is to determine the
      effectiveness of a Thera-Band based home exercise program (HEP) on LBP and disability 4 weeks
      post treatment discharge. A convenience sample of 22 new patients, 18-65 years of age, with
      current, chronic LBP will be recruited for this study at the discharge visit from care.
      Exclusionary criteria will include, current pregnancy and the presence of any red flags such
      as tumor or cancer, vertebral fracture, or infection. Upon agreeing to the study, patients
      will sign an informed consent, complete a demographics questionnaire, and complete specific
      outcome measure assessments. The outcome measures will include Numeric Pain Rating Scale
      (NPRS) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). Additionally, subjects will be asked to complete
      a secondary prevention program questionnaire. Following the initial paperwork, all patients
      will be provided with a Thera-BandÂ® Loop and Band and handout describing the HEP to be
      performed 3 times a week for 4 weeks. At the conclusion of 4 weeks, a follow-up phone call or
      email, based on patient preference, will be conducted. The follow-up will include pain,
      disability, compliance, satisfaction of program of the home program.
