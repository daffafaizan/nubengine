    
      Study AG270-PS-001 is a pre-screening study to identify subjects with advanced solid tumors
      or lymphoma in which the MTAP protein has been lost. Subjects whose tumor tissue has lost the
      MTAP protein may be considered for future enrollment into a Phase 1 clinical study of an
      experimental drug, AG-270, that is designed to inhibit the growth of tumors lacking this
      protein.

      Identification of the loss of MTAP will rely solely on the evaluation of archival tumor
      tissue samples by IHC. This study is therefore non-interventional
