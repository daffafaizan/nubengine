      enrolled in 3 groups: Group 1 will consist of 8 subjects with mild hepatic impairment; Group
      2 will consist of 8 subjects with moderate hepatic impairment; Group 3 will consist of up to
      16 healthy subjects matched by gender, age, smoking status, and body mass index, to Groups 1
      and/or 2. For each group, there will be a 21-day screening period, a baseline period, a
      single-dose treatment period with an on-site observation period of 36 hours, and a study
      completion evaluation conducted after the last PK blood sample is drawn. Each subject will
      receive a single 20-mg dose of tasimelteon, after which safety assessments will be performed.
