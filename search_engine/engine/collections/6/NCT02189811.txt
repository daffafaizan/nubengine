      in the next five years. It includes gradual withdrawal of the widely used oral poliomyelitis
      vaccine (OPV) containing live poliovirus, and will eventually lead to complete eradication
      and containment of all wild, vaccine-related (VDPV) and Sabin polioviruses. The withdrawal of
      the type 2 components of trivalent OPV (tOPV) is the key component in the elimination of
      cVDPVs. This entails strengthening of the immunization system by introducing at least one
      dose of affordable IPV into the routine immunization schedule globally and then replacing the
      trivalent OPV with bivalent OPV in all OPV-using countries - setting the stage for eventually
      ending bOPV use in 2019-2020. Most of the developing countries have an OPV schedule however
      many developed and European countries follow the IPV only schedule. The current
      recommendations for polio eradication and endgame is IPV vaccine to be administered together
      with third OPV dose, which in most countries occurs at 14 weeks of age.

      This study will assess the protection to type 2 poliovirus achieved after completion of the
      recommended schedule with bOPV and IPV; it will compare immunogenicity of bOPV + IPV schedule
      with tOPV only schedule; and will quantify the cross-reactivity of bOPV on inducing type 2
      immunological reaction. In addition, it will also provide first data on the proposed outbreak
      response to type 2 (either with mOPV 2 or with a combination of mOPV 2 and IPV 2).

      This study will provide data to National Immunization Authorities in order to make strategic
      decisions about their polio vaccination schedules in anticipation of the global tOPV to bOPV
      switch and will provide data on the proposed responses to type 2 poliovirus outbreaks.
