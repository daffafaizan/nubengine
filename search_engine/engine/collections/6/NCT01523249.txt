      point for the epidural needle placement in obstetric patients. Recently, two-dimensional
      ultrasound (2D US) scanning before the epidural needle insertion proved to improve an
      accurate determination of inter-vertebral levels and spine midline. 2D US is also useful in
      determining the depth to the epidural space and needle insertion angle. A three-dimensional
      ultrasound (3D US) technique is a new advancement in the ultrasound technology. 3D US allows
      for a real-time, visual guidance of the epidural needle insertion. This study will assess
      weather 3D US, compared to palpation, can accurately identify the skin needle insertion site
      for the epidural needle placement.
