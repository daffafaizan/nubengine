    
      The patients were divided randomly in to 2 GROUPS:

        -  control group: 153 patients received Oxytocin 10 IU I.V shot administered at the time of
           delivery of the anterior shoulder of the baby according to the WHO recommendation for
           both groups in prevention of postpartum haemorrhage,followed by active management of the
           third stage of labor by administration of oxytocin 5 IU units IM (WHO GDG
           recommendations,2012) and waiting for signs of placental separation then controlled cord
           traction (CCT)to the umbilical cord while applying simultaneous counter-pressure to the
           uterus, through the abdomen(Brandt Andrews maneuver)

        -  study group:156 patients received Oxytocin 10 IU I.V shot at the time of delivery of the
           of the anterior shoulder of the baby according to the WHO recommendation .Then oxytocin
           is stopped and cervical traction (Amr maneuver )is applied.

      In the maneuver,sustained traction downward and posteriorly was applied to anterior and
      posterior lips of the cervix using ovum forceps for approximately 90 seconds. The traction
      should be adequate to allow the cervix to reach the vaginal introitus. Meanwhile (CCT ) is
      avoided and watchful waiting for signs of placental separartion till 90 seconds end. Massage
      is not employed but the fundus is frequently palpaple to insure it doesnot become atonic and
      filled with blood from placenta separation. In cases whom placental separation did not occur
      within the 90 seconds, we removed the ovum forceps and waited for 30 min for the placental
      separation .
