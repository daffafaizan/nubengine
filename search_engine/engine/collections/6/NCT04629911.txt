      prolongs the safe apnea time, compared with conventional oxygenation.

      In laryngeal microsurgery, HFNO therapy make possible to perform tubeless anesthesia,
      providing perfect exposure of structure of the vocal cords.

      HFNO have a risk for low level of positive pressure can make gastric distension, but gastric
      reflux or aspiration were not occurred during rapid sequence induction for emergency
      operation.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of HFNO on gastric insufflation in
      paralyzed anesthetized patients undergoing laryngologic surgery.
