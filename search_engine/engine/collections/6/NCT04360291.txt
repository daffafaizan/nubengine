      retinitis pigmentosa in the perception of figurative works of art. Peripheral vision is
      crucial for detecting objects and directing attention to the relevant areas of the
      environment, while central vision, of high spatial resolution, is especially essential for
      identifying the nature of objects. The integration of perceived information in peripheral
      vision and central vision makes it possible to quickly and effortlessly develop a spatial
      representation of the environment, to activate categorical knowledge on the observed scene
      and to relate the various objects perceived. However, with the progressive constriction of
      the visual field, the visual exploration of the subject RP can not be carried out with the
      strategies used by the healthy subjects, in which the targets of the saccades are in
      particular determined according to the information perceived in peripheral vision.

      Through the recording of eye movements, the investigators compare the differences in visual
      explorations of people with retinitis pigmentosa and healthy people with or without a
      simulated deficit.
