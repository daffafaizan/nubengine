      I. Temporal assessment of treatment impact on bone marrow. II. Relative assessment of bone
      marrow status between total marrow and lymphoid irradiation (TMLI) and conventional TBI.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Correlation of dual energy computed tomography (DECT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
      imaging with biological samples for cellularity/adiposity.

      II. Feasibility of fluorothymidine F-18 (FLT) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging
      biomarker as a predictor of treatment response.

      III. Correlation of FLT PET imaging with biological correlate for leukemia. IV. Characterize
      relative distribution of leukemia in bone marrow (BM) environment.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts.

      COHORT I (TLMI+FLT/TMLI): Patients may undergo optional fluorothymidine F-18 PET scan over 2
      hours at baseline, on days 30 and 100, at 1 year, and at time of relapse. Patients undergo
      DECT and water-fat MRI scan over 30 minutes at baseline, on days 30 and 100, at year 1, and
      at time of relapse. Patients also undergo collection of bone marrow and blood samples at
      baseline, on days 30 and 100, and at 1 year. Patients undergo fluorothymidine F-18 PET, DECT,
      and water-fat MRI as in TMLI+FLT.

      COHORT II (TBI): Patients undergo collection of bone marrow at baseline, day 30, time of
      relapse, and at 1 year.
