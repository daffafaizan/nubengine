    
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a relatively common condition and is estimated to affect 2
      to 4% of middle-aged adults

      The study medication BF2.649 tested here is a novel, highly potent, selective, orally active
      inverse agonist at the histamine H3 receptor, therefore strengthens histaminergic
      transmission in the brain and increases wakefulness EDS is characterized by daytime
      somnolence and sudden sleep episodes. This problem has several consequences, e.g., an
      impairment of quality of life, an interference with activities of daily living and other
      handicaps in the management of social and family affairs.

      The primary endpoint of this study will be measured by the change in the well-validated
      Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS). The ESS is a simple self-administered 8-item questionnaire.
      The outcome is to get an impression about the level of the daytime sleepiness in several
      real-life situations.

      In this study, each patient will be treated during 2 weeks, and randomly assigned to one the
      5 arms (BF2.649 at one of the 4 possible dosages or placebo).

      The patient will then attend a end-of-treatment visit, in order to assess the particularly
      the ESS score.
