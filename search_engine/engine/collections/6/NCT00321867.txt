      with rectoceles include a protruding vaginal mass, persistent pelvic pressure, and sexual
      dysfunction. Surgical repair is the most common treatment with success rates ranging from
      65%-85% at 1-2 years. In an attempt to improve surgical outcomes, clinicians are using graft
      materials to augment weakened tissues in rectocele repairs: however, there is little data to
      support or refute these practices. The purpose of this study is to estimate the effect of
      graft augmentation on objective and subjective outcomes.

      Comparison: Rectocele repair without graft, compared to rectocele repair with the SurgiSIS
      (TM) graft.
