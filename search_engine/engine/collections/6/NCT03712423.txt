      delineate viable tumour lesions. On day 1, patients will receive a low dose of
      [89Zr]-Df-CriPec® docetaxel (corresponding to approximately 0.1-1 mg docetaxel) followed by
      maximally 3 [89Zr] PET scans (timing of PET scan can be adapted depending on results
      obtained, within timeframe of 2 h - 9 days after administration) to evaluate biodistribution
      and tumour uptake. Two weeks later, the patients will receive unlabelled CriPec® docetaxel up
      to the Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D) given every 3 weeks (Q3W) that will be determined in
      the phase I NAPOLY trial (CT-CL01), immediately followed by a second low dose of
      [89Zr]-Df-CriPec® docetaxel and maximally 3 [89Zr]PET scans (timing of PET scan can be
      adapted depending on results obtained, within timeframe of 2 hrs - 9 days after
      administration) to evaluate biodistribution and tumour uptake with therapeutic dosage.
