      therapy to reduce patient stress. The organization "Paws of Love" estimates that it has
      180,000 volunteers who have qualified therapy dogs and who are generally willing to volunteer
      their time in emergency care. The benefits may include improved perception of wellness, less
      opioid use, and decreased use of physical and chemical restraints. As a further
      extrapolation, this secondary effect may extend to improved patient-doctor communication and
      patient experience. This will in turn improve patient safety in the Emergency Department,
      decreasing the number of adverse events, and decreasing the risk of medical malpractice by
      improving the patient-provider relationship. (6, 7)
