      submitted to conventional upper GI endoscopy and colonoscopy, followed by small bowel capsule
      endoscopy if diagnosis remains elusive. Recently, however, the possibility of performing
      pan-intestinal endoscopy using a video capsule that evaluates both the small bowel and the
      colon in a single non-invasive examination, opens new perspectives for the management of
      those conditions, particularly when the initial upper GI endoscopy has been non-diagnostic.
      The authors hypothesize that performing early pan-intestinal capsule endoscopy strategy may
      allow, in a safe and well tolerated manner, to identify which patients would benefit of
      further interventions, such as colonoscopy or invasive enteroscopy, guided by findings
      pre-identified at capsule examination. The study aims to evaluate whether pan-intestinal
      capsule endoscopy is superior to the current standard strategy of conventional colonoscopy
      after non-diagnostic upper endoscopy in patients with IDA or overt GI bleeding, regarding
      diagnostic yield, safety and tolerability.
