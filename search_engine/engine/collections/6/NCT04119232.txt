      hypertension, are at elevated risk of developing hypertension, diabetes, heart failure, and
      premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Current guidelines recommend intensive
      lifestyle modification for women with a history of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy in
      order to reduce the risk of developing cardiometabolic risk factors or overt CV disease.
      However, limited research exists to guide how to implement lifestyle modification for this
      population. The postpartum period poses unique challenges to adopting a healthy lifestyle.
      Remote interventions using mobile technology may be particularly effective. Social incentives
      designed using insights from behavioral economics have been demonstrated to motivate health
      behavior change, such as increasing physical activity. The objective of this study is to use
      a randomized clinical trial to test the effectiveness of a 12-week team-based, mobile health
      interventions using wearable devices and social incentives to increase physical activity in
      the postpartum period.
