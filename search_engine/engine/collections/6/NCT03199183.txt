    
      Objective: The study aims to investigate the demographic, clinical and prognostic features
      and to draw the diagnostic and therapeutic algorithm of Takayasu arteritis in China.

      Study Type: A national, multicenter, observational, ambispective cohort study.

      Study Design: The cardinal contents of this registry study are as follows:

        1. Select representative clinical centers through typical sampling methods and train the
           local investigators in basic knowledge of Takayasu arteritis. Introduce the Electronic
           Data Capture System and train in completing case report forms.

        2. Collect demographic, clinical, imaging, laboratory, diagnostic and therapeutic
           information of Takayasu arteritis patients hospitalized from Jan 1st 2002 to now. Build
           a baseline database of Takayasu arteritis patients.

        3. Recruit new diagnosed Takayasu arteritis patients in future 2 years from 2017 or till
           reaching a total of 1067 registered patients.

        4. Gather the 3-month, 6-month, 1-year follow up information including general, clinical,
           therapeutic, prognostic data of all recruits and build up the follow-up database.

        5. Establish bio-bank for serum/plasma, urine, stool, tissues or cells.

      Data management, quality control and statistic analysis: Electronic Data Capture System has
      been built and the investigators will manage and analyze data in align with key indicators.
      The investigators have invited professional statistic analysts to assist analyzing data and a
      third party to supervise data quality.

      Ethics: The Ethics Committee of Fuwai Hospital approved this study and following ethical
      supports from participating centers are required. Informed consents before patient enrollment
      are required.
