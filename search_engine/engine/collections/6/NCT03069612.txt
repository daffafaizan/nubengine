      design. Patients with psychosis will be randomized (1:1) to receive either active or sham
      stimulation that will be administered three times per week for 4 weeks (28 days) for a total
      of 12 treatments. Urine will be collected three times per week prior to the rTMS treatment.
      Cognition including the N-Back task and MATRICS cognitive battery will be administered on Day
      0, Day 28, and Day 42 to determine the effect of rTMS on cognition compared to sham
      stimulation.
