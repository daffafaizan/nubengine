    
      Primary Aims

        -  To identify the underlying aetiologies of macular haemorrhages in myopic eyes

        -  To study the functional and morphological outcome of these eyes with macular
           haemorrhages 6 months later Secondary Aims

        -  To study the subgroup of eyes with myopic choroidal neovascularisation (CNV), in
           particular the risk factors for CNV in myopes

        -  To study the subgroup of eyes with macular haemorrhages in the absence of CNV

      Plan of investigation:

        1. Patient with myopia (>-6.00DS) presents with loss of central vision

        2. Examination reveals a macular haemorrhage

        3. Investigations

             -  Refraction

             -  Axial length*

             -  Fundus fluorescein angiography

             -  Indocyanine green angiography*

        4. Determine if a myopic CNV is present or absent

        5. Management of patient: Treatment vs No treatment

             -  Treatment being

                  1. Conventional laser

                  2. PDT

        6. Review at 6 months

             -  BCVA

             -  Clinical appearance (fundal photo)

             -  FFA

        7. Review at 12 months

             -  BCVA

             -  Clinical appearance
