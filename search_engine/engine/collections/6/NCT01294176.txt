      oral and intravenous formulations and has been used in the past to treat nerve damage like
      that seen in diabetes and some other metabolic disorders. It is available as a dietary
      supplement in the United States.

      Patients with a diagnosis of acute optic neuritis who are enrolled in the study will undergo
      medical and nervous system examinations, and blood draws. The study doctor will take a
      medical history and perform physical examinations. Research assistants at the MS Center, who
      are trained in blood draws, will perform the blood draws. Patients will also undergo Optical
      coherence tomography (OCT) examination at Casey Eye Institute, and receive two MRIs at Oregon
      Health and Science University (OHSU). Because it is a placebo-controlled trial, subjects will
      have a 50:50 chance of receiving either placebo (inactive) or study drug. If enrolled in the
      study, patients will take two gel capsules of the study drug or placebo at the same time
      every day for six weeks.
