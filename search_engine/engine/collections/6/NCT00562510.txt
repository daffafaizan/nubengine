      experience a discordant response characterized by HIV-1 RNA plasma levels below the limit of
      detection and low CD4 T-cell recovery (immunologic discordant responders). At present,
      recommendations for the clinical management of patients with discordant responses to
      antiretroviral therapy are largely based on observational, uncontrolled data.

      The effect on CD4 count of adding raltegravir in already undetectable patients has not yet
      been evaluated.

      The primary purpose of this study is to assess the ability of the HIV-1 integrase inhibitor,
      raltegravir, added to a stable HAART, to increase CD4 count in patients with undetectable
      plasma viral load and low CD4 recovery.
