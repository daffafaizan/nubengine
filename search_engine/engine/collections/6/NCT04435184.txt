      coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The clinical course of COVID-19 is variable, and some
      patients develop severe pneumonia, multi-organ failure, and shock.

      Severe COVID-19 is characterized by a hyper-inflammatory and hyper-thrombotic state. We
      propose that this state is caused by viral injury of the vascular endothelium, leading to
      endothelial release of von Willebrand Factor (VWF) and P-selectin, which in turn drive
      thrombosis and vascular inflammation.

      Crizanlizumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets P-selectin. Crizanlizumab can decrease
      inflammation by binding to P-selectin, blocking leucocyte and platelet adherence to the
      vessel wall.

      We now plan to test the safety and efficacy of crizanlizumab in decreasing biomarkers of
      inflammation and thrombosis in a placebo-controlled, double-blind randomized clinical trial
