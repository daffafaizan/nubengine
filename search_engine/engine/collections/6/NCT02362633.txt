      variety of clinical conditions. In addition, recent neuroimaging studies suggest that
      modifying the activity of brain circuits involved in eating behavior could provide
      therapeutic benefits in obesity.

      The investigators aim to assess whether long-term modulation of the dorsolateral prefrontal
      cortex (DLFPC) using tDCS, modifies behavioral response and brain activity while watching
      visually presented food cues and taste cues in obese subjects.

      Subjects will be randomly divided into sham and real tDCS arms. Subjects will receive sham or
      real tDCS ten times. Subjects will be investigated before and after sham or real tDCS
      interventions. Subjects will perform functional MRI experiments with visual and taste food
      cues. Questionnaire with behavior measures, body compositions, blood tests will be performed.
