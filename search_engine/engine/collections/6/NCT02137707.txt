      remains to be defined. We propose that a long term study of patients where inflammatory
      activity of the disease is expected to be controlled on treatment, will identify patients
      into cohorts of those whose disease is deemed to be stable with those patients whose disease
      has been deemed to progress. Once the two groups have been identified, it will then be
      possible to assess whether there are differences in biologic markers between the two groups.
      These markers would then have the potential to be used to monitor disease progression or be
      predictors for patient response to drug treatment.
