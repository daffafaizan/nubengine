      intervention and referral for treatment among older adults in the emergency department (ED)
      with alcohol misuse. The pilot data would then be used to design a larger study. The
      intervention for this trial will consist of a Brief Negotiation Interview (BNI) with a
      stratified referral for further treatment, compared with usual care. The BNI is a
      standardized, well-described intervention that has been implemented in a broad range of
      clinical settings but has not been specifically tested in older adults in the ED. Following
      the BNI, we will provide a referral for further care for the patient that is stratified by
      severity of alcohol misuse. Patients with hazardous or harmful alcohol use will follow-up
      with a primary care physician; patients with alcohol abuse or dependence will follow-up with
      an outpatient alcohol and substance abuse program; those at risk for complicated withdrawal
      will be recommended for inpatient treatment. In all cases we will contact the referral
      physician to help transition the patient's care, and ensure the patient receives a consistent
      message regarding their alcohol use across the different care settings.
