      in an oral health program, including oral hygiene instruction, caries diagnosis and
      treatment, and evaluation and treatment of periodontal conditions during the second
      trimester. Those who refuse to receive periodontal treatment during pregnancy will constitute
      the 'no intervention' control group (NIG), while those who agree in receiving dental and
      periodontal treatment during the second trimester of gestation will constitute the
      'intervention' group (IG).

      Patients are going to be evaluated by a single calibrated periodontist blinded in relation to
      periodontal treatment, which will be performed by another periodontist. Treatment consists of
      scaling and root planning, professional prophylaxis and oral hygiene instruction. Obstetrical
      data, birth weight and gestation duration will be recorded after examination and recording by
      the responsible obstetrician and nursery staff.
