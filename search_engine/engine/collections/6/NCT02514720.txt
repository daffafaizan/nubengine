      total elimination of nicotine in both FMs and SMs) and then approximately >5 hours later may
      have a second PET scan after smoking their preferred cigarette (approximately 1 hour before).
      It is possible that these two scans may also occur on separate days. All subjects will
      provide a urine sample for (1) drug toxicology, (2) pregnancy test (in females) and (3) Total
      Nicotine Equivalents (TNE: a measure of total consumption unaltered by rate of nicotine
      metabolism). There will one blood draw taken before and one after each PET scan (about 20mls
      in total) to measure nicotine and COT levels (to assess abstinence) as well as kinetics of
      nicotine delivery. Participants will be given questionnaires prior to, or during, and/or
      after one or both of the PET scans to determine differences between abstinence and smoking on
      subjective measures..
