      and/or identify the RP2D of the combination treatment of ribociclib+ everolimus + exemestane
      when dosed continuously in adult men and postmenopausal women with HR+ HER2-negative advanced
      breast cancer resistant to the non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors, fulvestrant or tamoxifen.

      The purpose of the phase II portion of this trial will be to evaluate the anti-tumor activity
      of exemestane, everolimus and ribociclib triplet following progression on a CDK 4/6
      inhibitor. This part of the study will be conducted using a Simon's optimal two-stage design.
