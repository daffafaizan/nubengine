    
      This is a non-randomized, open label, single-center, single-arm, phase Ib study to evaluate
      the safety and the preliminary efficacy of short cycles of sunitinib alternated with
      regorafenib in participants with metastatic and/or unresectable gastrointestinal stromal
      tumor GISTs with prior failure of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). The study consists of two
      cohorts: a dose-escalation, dose-finding cohort, and dose-expansion cohort. Between 6 to 15
      patients are expected to be included in the escalation cohort. A total of 20 eligible and
      evaluable patients will be included in the expansion cohort to further assess toxicity and
      evaluate preliminary efficacy.

      Each treatment cycle lasts 28 days (4 weeks), during which time you will be taking the study
      drug, sunitinib, for the first 3 days of the week, followed by the study drug, regorafenib,
      for the last 4 days of the week. The study drugs will be taken continuously for 4 weeks each
      cycle, unless the study team instructs you otherwise. Each participant will receive a study
      diary. The diary will also include special instructions for taking the study drugs.
