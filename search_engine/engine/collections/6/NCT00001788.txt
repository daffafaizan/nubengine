    
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate patients with primary immunodeficiency disorders to
      identify patients with mutations of the genes for the following proteins: Jak3, STAT1, STAT4,
      interleukin-7, interleukin-7 receptor, interleukin-12 receptor subunits, and others. Patients
      will undergo screening history, physical examination, and clinical laboratory evaluation at
      referring institutions and tissue samples, or cell lines will be sent to the NIH. We will
      establish cell lines if necessary, prepare DNA and RNA for molecular genetic analysis and
      study cytokine signal transduction in patient cell lines.
