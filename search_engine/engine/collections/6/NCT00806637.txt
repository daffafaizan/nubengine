      treat sleep-disordered breathing patients who have retropalatal obstruction. Intraoperative
      bleeding is a significant problem which requires hemostasis and causes prolonged operative
      time. Several different techniques are used to perform this operation, including cold knife,
      monopolar cautery, coblation, and radiofrequency. Efficacy in hemostasis and tissue trauma
      from different operative techniques may result in different operative time and different
      degrees of morbidity including intraoperative blood loss, postoperative pain, postoperative
      hemorrhage, and velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI). The vessel sealing system has been widely
      used in head and neck surgery because of its effectiveness and safety. It was also found
      quite effective and safe in tonsillectomy procedures, providing excellent hemostasis and
      minimal tissue trauma.
