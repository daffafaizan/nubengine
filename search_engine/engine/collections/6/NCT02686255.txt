      congenital heart defects. Over the years, there has been great improvement in morbidity and
      mortality post cardiac surgery due to better technical skill and post operative treatment.
      Most of those surgeries require cardio-pulmonary bypass machine, which requires the use of
      blood products, and many of those children also require blood product as part of the post
      operative care, especially those children with cyanotic heart defects. Many toddlers and
      children are released home with relatively low hemoglobin levels, and with no careful follow
      up, at an age at which anemia is a risk factor for developmental delay and decreased
      cognitive function. Iron deficiency is common in Israel among children aged 6-24 months. At
      this age, breast milk and its substitute do not provide enough iron, and parents are not
      adherent enough to iron supplements as recommended by the ministry of health. Due to these
      facts, there is high importance, especially in children suffering from heart defects, for
      close follow up on their hemoglobin levels. In adults, a study following hemoglobin levels
      post cardiac surgery during hospitalization only, showed that most (79%) starting showing
      improvement during their hospitalization. Another study in patients over the age of 50 post
      coronary artery bypass graft, showed no difference between a group receiving iron supplements
      and another not receiving any, after 2 months. Similar studies were never done with children.
