    
      18F-AlF-NOTA-neurotensin is a radioligand targeting the neurotensinreceptor, which is widely
      expressed on the cell surface of PCa. The radioligand can be used for the diagnosis and stage
      of the PCa. A total of 5 volunteers and 60 PCa patients will be subjected to a
      18F-AlF-NOTA-neurotensin PET/CT scan. The uptake of 18F-AlF-NOTA-neurotensin in organs and
      tumor lesions will be quantified as Standardized Uptake Values (SUVmax/SUVmean).
