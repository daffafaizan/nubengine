    
      NP10679 is a pH dependent inhibitor of the GluN2B subtype of the NMDA receptor. Compounds of
      this drug class are hypothesized to be beneficial in a number of central nervous system
      disorders, including brain ischemia associated with subarachnoid hemorrhage, severe pain,
      major depression and substance abuse disorders. This study uses a double blind, adaptive
      design approach to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of a single dose of
      NP10679 when delivered intravenously in up to six escalating dose levels in comparison to
      placebo.
