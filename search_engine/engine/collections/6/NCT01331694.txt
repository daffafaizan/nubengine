      250/50mcg dose only, IP, and TIO) includes patients aged 40 years and older with at least 9
      months of continuous enrollment (6 months pre-index and at least three months post-index)
      with a primary or secondary diagnosis of COPD [International Classification of Disease, 9th
      revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes 491.xx, 492.xx or 496.xx]. Patients are
      observed such that everyone provides minimum 6 months of pre index baseline data and minimum
      3 months post index (risk analysis) and minimum 12 months post index for cost analysis.
      Patients must receive either a 30-day supply of FSC or IP or TIO as the initial IMT
      medication, indicating "intent to treat." Patients may not also have a prescription filled
      for the other IMT medication within 60 days of the index date, or for the combination therapy
      budesonide/ formoterol (BFC), an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) or a long acting beta agonist
      (LABA). Six months of observation (continuous enrollment) prior to the index date is assessed
      to confirm that the patient meets the inclusion and exclusion criteria as well as to identify
      baseline characteristics and covariates. Cost analysis was done using a 12 months fixed
      follow up period. Outcome measures are assessed during the post-index period

      Elderly cohort 65+: Identical methods and design were used for subanalyses in patients aged
      65 years and over except comparison was FSC vs. TIO only.

      75+ cohort: Identical methods and design were used for subanalyses in patients aged 75 years
      and over except comparison was FSC vs. TIO only.
