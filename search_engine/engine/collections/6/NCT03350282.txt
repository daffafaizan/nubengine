      in human nutrition and biomedicine. Impaired bioenergetics accompanies many different
      conditions, including cardiometabolic diseases, neurodegenerative disorders or high-intensity
      exercise, with various dietary interventions developed to restore cellular energy. Creatine
      is recognized as a beneficial and safe energy-boosting agent in both athletic and clinical
      environments. However, its effectiveness in specific conditions seems to be fairly restrained
      due to its limits in transportability and performance. Guanidinoacetic acid (GAA), a
      metabolic precursor of creatine, appears as a novel energy-enhancing supplement, with GAA
      being superior to creatine in facilitating creatine concentrations in the human brain and
      skeletal muscle. This perhaps happens due to GAA interaction with cellular transporters
      previously dismissed as untargetable carriers by other similar therapeutics. On the other
      hand, GAA loading remains under scrutiny due to its hyperhomocysteinemia-inducing potential,
      and possible neurotoxic effects. Co-administration of creatine and GAA has been recently
      proposed as a better strategy comparing to administration of each compound per se. Besides
      providing a competitive advantage for enhanced levels of tissue creatine, GAA-creatine
      mixture might also diminish side effects related to isolated GAA administration. However, no
      human studies so far evaluated the effects of this mixture. In the present study, the
      investigators compared the impact of 4-week co-administration of GAA and creatine vs.
      creatine administration alone on serum biomarkers, exercise performance and tissue
      bioenergetics in healthy young men.
