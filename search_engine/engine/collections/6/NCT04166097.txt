      women have one or more risk factors for heart disease and one in three women will die of
      heart disease. However, most women are unaware of these statistics. As a result, women are
      less likely than men to recognize the symptoms of a heart attack and are more likely than men
      to delay in seeking help. The best ways to educate women about heart disease and change their
      behavior to prevent heart disease are unknown.

      More than 80% of heart disease is preventable but requires both knowledge of risk factors and
      adherence to lifestyle changes. This program is designed to address these challenges in
      women, where this is a particular unmet need.

      Some prior community and workplace-based studies have demonstrated short term improvements in
      modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular disease. A community based primary prevention
      program among disadvantaged women decreased the rate of metabolic syndrome, anxiety,
      depression and stress.

      The economic burden of heart disease on employers is significant although workplace employee
      wellness programs have not been shown to decrease employer costs. The impact of employee
      wellness programs on clinical outcome measures have been inconsistent.

      This program is designed to educate female employees about their heart disease risk factors
      and provide tactical support to improve their heart health. Once validated, the program can
      be rolled out to other employees and to the community.
