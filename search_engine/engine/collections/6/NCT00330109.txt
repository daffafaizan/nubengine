      high level of mortality. The standard treatment is to kill or remove the cancer cells. Of
      course, this can only work if the surgeon or radiologist can find these cells. Unfortunately,
      there are inevitably so-called "occult" cancer cells, which are not found even by today's
      sophisticated imaging techniques.

      This proposal proposes a technology to predict the locations of these occult cells, by
      learning the growth patterns exhibited by gliomas in previous patients. We will also develop
      software tools that help both practitioners and researchers find gliomas similar to a current
      one, and that can autonomously find the tumor region within a brain image, which can save
      radiologists time, and perhaps help during surgery.
