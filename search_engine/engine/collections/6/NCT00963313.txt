    
      A recent review from GRAPPA group evaluates therapies for PsA including peripheral and axPsA.
      Analysing particularly the results with present biologic therapies it has been proven that
      outcome data at 24 weeks show excellent results in the treatment of peripheral forms of PsA
      with either of the three biologics disposable in the market, that is to say infliximab,
      etanercept and adalimumab.

      However when it comes to analyse data on PsA patients with axPsA there are not results at
      all. The design of clinical trials did not evaluate axial outcomes and therefore there is not
      a possibility of knowing whether these therapies are useful in axPsA.

      This is an open label multicenter study designed to evaluate the effectivity of adalimumab 40
      mg every 2 weeks during 24 weeks in patients with active axial PsA despite receiving
      Methotrexate, Sulfasalazine, Leflunomide or Cyclosporine, plus NSAIDs and no more than 10 mg
      of corticosteroids.
