      traditional therapy. Several factors contribute to the poor prognosis of older individuals,
      including the increased incidence of the multidrug resistance efflux pump, comorbidities and
      unfavorable cytogenetics. The recently reported AML-13 and ALFA trials suggest that less
      intense consolidation in this population is at least equivalent to more intense, induction
      style efforts.

      Clofarabine is a next generation nucleoside analogue that was designed to optimize the
      favorable attributes of fludarabine and cladribine, while minimizing toxicity. The
      intravenous formulation has shown considerable activity in older patients with AML who have
      been considered either unfit for or unlikely to benefit from conventional therapy.
      Additionally, clofarabine has an oral formulation that patients may find more acceptable for
      consolidation therapy rather than multiple courses of intravenous medications, administered
      over several days.

      This study is designed as a traditional 3x3 phase I trial with the intention of defining the
      maximum tolerated dose of oral clofarabine consolidation for older patients with AML in
      remission.
