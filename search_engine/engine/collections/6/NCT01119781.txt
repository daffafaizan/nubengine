      effect of renal impairment on BIIB017 PK/PD. The study will be conducted at approximately 3
      sites in the US and will enroll approximately 35 participants: 6 healthy volunteers (normal
      renal function), 9 with mild renal impairment, 6 with moderate renal impairment, 8 with
      severe renal impairment, and 6 participants with end stage renal disease who require
      hemodialysis 2 to 3 times a week.
