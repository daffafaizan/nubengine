        -  Compare the efficacy of fludarabine with or without darbepoetin alfa in geriatric
           patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and relevant comorbidities.

        -  Determine the effect of these regimens in reducing anemia, lowering the requirements of
           transfusion, and reducing the duration and frequency of hospitalization in these
           patients.

        -  Determine the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Determine event-free, progression-free, and overall survival of patients treated with
           these regimens.

        -  Evaluate the medical-economical aspects of these regimens in these patients

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to hemoglobin value
      (< 12 g/dL [stratum 1] vs > 12 g/dL [stratum 2]). Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment
      strata.

        -  Stratum 1: Patients receive fludarabine IV on days 1, 3, and 5. Treatment repeats every
           28 days for up to 6 courses. Patients also receive darbepoetin alfa subcutaneously once
           weekly for up to 6 weeks.

        -  Stratum 2: Patients receive fludarabine as in stratum 1. Quality of life is evaluated
           periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 348 patients will be accrued for this study.
