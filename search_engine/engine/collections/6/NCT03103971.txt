    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate preliminary safety of autologous human anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor
      (CAR)-4-1BB-CD3zeta-EGFRt-expressing CD4+/CD8+ T-lymphocytes (huJCAR014) in adult patients
      with CD19+ relapsed or refractory (R/R) aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and
      acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of huJCAR014 in CD19+ R/R aggressive
      B-cell NHL and ALL.

      II. To assess the antitumor activity of huJCAR014 in CD19+ R/R aggressive NHL and ALL.

      III. To estimate the progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients
      with CD19+ R/R aggressive NHL and ALL treated with huJCAR014.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the cellular and humoral immune responses to huJCAR014. II. To assess the
      pharmacodynamic effects of huJCAR014. III. To assess the effect of huJCAR014 product
      attributes on safety, PK, and antitumor activity.

      IV. To assess the effect of tumor and tumor microenvironment on huJCAR014 PK and biomarkers.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of huJCAR014.

      Patients undergo leukapheresis. Beginning 1-2 weeks after leukapheresis, patients undergo
      lymphodepleting chemotherapy comprising either cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) daily for
      1 day and fludarabine IV daily for 3 days or cyclophosphamide and fludarabine IV daily for 3
      days. Within 36-96 hours after completion of lymphodepleting chemotherapy, patients receive
      huJCAR014 IV over 20-30 minutes on day 0.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 30 days for the first 3
      months, every 3 months for up to 12 months, and then yearly for 15 years.
