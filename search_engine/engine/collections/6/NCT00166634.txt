      duration of effect of investigational drugs. These methods are needed for pediatric studies.
      Before such methods can be developed, preliminary information must be collected to
      demonstrate that the device can be used for antihypertensive studies in children (i.e, to
      determine the dropout rate following the first ABP study, to determine the frequency of white
      coat hypertension in a selected population, to compare casual (office) blood pressures
      commonly used to diagnose hypertension in children with those obtained by ABPM, and to assess
      the placebo effect in children with borderline and mild hypertension).

      All participants will be asked to complete 24 hour ABPM on two occasions within one week.
      During the ABPM parents and children will be asked to keep a diary recording the times that
      the child slept. A crossover design will be used, where subjects are initially randomized to
      either drug or placebo and then will be crossed over to the other intervention at a set time
      during the study.
