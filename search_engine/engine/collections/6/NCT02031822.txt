      safety of these two techniques in patients with refractory headache syndromes. Following REB
      approval, 40 patients with moderate or severe refractory headaches (intensity score>4/10)
      will be randomized to the "proximal" or "distal" groups with a 1:1 allocation. Each patient
      receives an injection of 2ml of 0.5% bupivacaine with 40mg of methylprednisolone. The null
      hypothesis is that there is no difference in intensity scores for headache at one month after
      the interventions. Outcomes related to efficacy (numbness immediately after the injection,
      reduction in episodes of severe headache, sleep quality), performance (time taken for and
      discomfort during procedure), and safety (incidence of hematoma, intravascular injection) are
      measured after one month.
