      (NAFLD) is commonly diagnosed in daily clinical practice. Weight reduction has been the only
      strategy established thus far to reduce hepatic lipid levels. Thus, dietary restriction and
      exercise focusing on weight reduction is recommended as the cornerstone for managing NAFLD.
      Recent reports have indicated that increased exercise greatly reduces hepatic fat
      accumulation and inflammation and the related oxidative stress levels outweigh those achieved
      by dietary restriction alone. Clear guidelines for such a "lifestyle physical activity" for
      NAFLD management are currently lacking. The type of physical activity such as, aerobic or
      resistant exercise required to reduce liver fat content remains unclear.The purpose of this
      study is to determine whether aerobic exercise should provide improvement of hepatic fat
      content and inflammation as well as metabolic profiles and anthropometric parameters better
      than resistant exercise.
