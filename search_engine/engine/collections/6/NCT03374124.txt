      functional endoscopic sinus surgery more than 1 years were called back for evaluation. A
      diagnosis cut off value of eosinophil count was determined by the surgery prognosis. Then
      different factors were compared between participants with eosinophilic CRS and those with
      non-eosinophilic CRS to establish the appropriated diagnosis approach for eosinophilic CRS.
