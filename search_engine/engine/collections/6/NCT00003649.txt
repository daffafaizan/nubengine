        -  Evaluate the safety of multiple endobronchial treatments with adenovirus p53
           bronchoalveolar lavage of a single lobe of the lung in patients with bronchoalveolar
           cell lung carcinoma.

        -  Evaluate expression of the p53 gene and induction of apoptosis in tumor and normal
           tissues exposed to the virus in these patients.

        -  Evaluate whether transbronchial administration of adenovirus p53 results in improved
           local tumor control in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study.

      Patients undergo biopsy and receive adenovirus p53 by bronchoalveolar lavage on days 1 and
      15. Patients repeat biopsy on days 3 and 28. If there is evidence of clinical benefit or
      response without significant toxicity, patients may receive a maximum of 3 courses. Treatment
      beyond 3 courses must be approved by protocol investigator.

      Cohorts of 3 patients are treated at escalating dose levels of adenovirus p53. Patients in
      each cohort are followed for dose limiting toxicity (DLT) for 2 weeks after completion of one
      course before dose escalation proceeds in subsequent cohorts. If 1 of 3 patients at a dose
      level experiences dose limiting toxicity (DLT), then 2 additional patients are entered at the
      same dose level. If more than 1 of 5 patients experience DLT, the previous dose is the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD). An additional 10 patients are treated at the MTD.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for the first 2 years, every 6 months for the next 3
      years, and annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: There will be 15 patients accrued into this study over 1 year.
