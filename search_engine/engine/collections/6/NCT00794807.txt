    
      Twenty statistically matched patients (15 males, 5 females, aged between 28 and 70 years,
      median 50 years) with moderate to severe psoriasis (PASI: 7-36) were included in this study.
      They were treated with 15 mg alefacept i.m. weekly. Peripheral blood was taken prior to first
      alefacept application and then weekly until week five and thereafter every second week, until
      the end of treatment at week 13. At the same time points severity of disease and thereby
      possible reduction of symptoms was evaluated applying the PASI. Investigators analysing the
      samples were blinded to the outcome of the study. The protocol concerning human subjects was
      approved by the ethics commission of the Charit√© University Medicine Berlin Campus Mitte,
      Germany .
