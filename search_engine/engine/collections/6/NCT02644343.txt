      audiologist via telehealth. Audiologists will use an internet meeting platform to remotely
      log into the subject's computer and control the programming software. Remote programming
      sessions will be completed both with and without the assistance of a trained facilitator, and
      speech understanding will be tested in between mapping sessions.
