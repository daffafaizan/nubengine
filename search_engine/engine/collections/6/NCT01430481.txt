      powders, pills, and other medicinal forms not generally associated with food) for OA are
      commonly used, and it is therefore important that health care providers are aware of the
      evidence supporting the claims. One proposed nutraceutical which has shown promising results
      in OA patients, is the hip powder of Rosa canina.

      The findings from a previous meta-analysis of rosehip powder from Rosa canina for symptomatic
      treatment of OA was a small but potentially relevant reduction of pain and a statistically
      significant reduction in use of analgesics.

      The present study is undertaken to compare two different products, one of which is tested in
      two different doses, in a non-inferiority design.
