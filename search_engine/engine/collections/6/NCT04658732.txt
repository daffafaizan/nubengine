      surgery. Both insufficient sedation and deep sedation may lead to sudden movements by
      patients, which may potentially result in harmful complications during eye surgery. Several
      drugs such as propofol, opioids, and dexmedetomidine have been used for sedation during this
      procedure [1]. However, each of these drugs has its own limitations, leading to impairment of
      patient's cooperation during surgery. Therefore, the potential clinical advantages of
      newly-marketed therapeutic drugs should be thoroughly evaluated. [2] Benzodiazepines are
      amongst the most popular preoperative medication to produce anxiolysis, amnesia, and sedation
      for the patients coming for surgery [3]. Benzodiazepines are reported to be paradoxically
      associated with the increased episodes of arousal during sleep, restlessness, and hangover
      effects [4]. Alprazolam, a benzodiazepine class of antipsychotic drugs, is more
      anxioselective than the other premedicants of this group like midazolam, lorazepam, or
      diazepam [5]. It has also been reported to show arousal episodes and may cause psychomotor
      impairment which is a disadvantage to be used in elderly in general and in day case in
      particular [4,6].

      Gabapentin is well-tolerated drug that is associated with anxiolytic and antinociceptive
      properties [2]. It is reported that gabapentin has anxiolytic [7] and antinociceptive effects
      [8,9]. In another study, it is claimed that this drug does not depress respiration with no
      effect on gastric mucosa, platelets, and renal function [9]. Moreover, gabapentin seems to be
      an anxiolytic without amnesic effects which is an important advantage for elderly patients.
      Leung and colleagues reported that delirium is significantly less in patients receiving
      gabapentin before spine surgery[10].

      Dexmedetomidine, a highly selective α2 agonist, has been widely used as a sedative in a
      variety of clinical settings owing to its analgesic properties, minimal respiratory
      depression and easy arousability [11,12].Hypotension and bradycardia, the most frequent side
      effects of dexmedetomidine [12], occur in a dose-related manner [13,14]. To avoid these side
      effects, a dose adjustment is required. For procedural sedation, a loading dose of 0.25μg/kg
      over 10 min followed by maintenance dose of 0.25μg/kg/h provides an adequate level of
      sedation, stable hemodynamics and better surgeon satisfaction [15].

      In this study, we planned to compare the sedative effects of oral gabapentin, alprazolam and
      intravenous of dexmedetomidine on various parameters including anxiety, sedation and
      orientation. In our literature review, we could not find any study comparing the effect of
      gabapentin and alprazolam on anxiety, pain, sedation scores, satisfaction of surgeon, and
      hemodynamic parameters in posterior segment eye surgery under peribulbar block.
