      efficacy of ponatinib over a range of 3 starting doses.

      The study will enroll 276 participants in 3 cohorts and each cohort will have 92
      participants. All the participants will be randomized to receive once-daily oral
      administration of 1 of 3 starting doses of ponatinib:

        -  Cohort A: 45 mg ponatinib tablet

        -  Cohort B: 30 mg ponatinib tablet

        -  Cohort C: 15 mg ponatinib tablet

      The study is designed to consist of 2 periods: 24-cycle Main treatment period and optional
      treatment continuation period. Participants will be treated with their randomized dose of
      study drug in the Main Treatment Period until the occurrence of at least one of the
      following: absence of CHR by 3 months, absence of MCyR at 12 months, absence of <=1%
      BCR-ABL1IS at 12 months, loss of <=1% BCR-ABL1IS development of intolerance, or completion of
      all 24 cycles of treatment (whichever occurs first). Following completion of the 24-month
      main treatment period or following early withdrawal, participants may enter into an optional
      treatment continuation period.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States, United Kingdom, Republic of
      Korea, Spain, France, Taiwan, Australia, Canada, Italy, Chile, Japan, Germany, Argentina,
      Poland, Czech Republic, Denmark, Hong Kong, Portugal, Russia, Singapore, Switzerland, and
      Sweden. The overall time to participate in this study is approximately 60 months.
      Participants will make a final visit to the clinic approximately 30 days after the last dose
      of study treatment.
