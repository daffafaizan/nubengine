      efficacy of the PGT121 monoclonal antibody for HIV prevention and therapy. PGT121 mAb is a
      recombinant human IgG1 monoclonal antibody that targets a V3 glycan-dependent epitope region
      of the HIV envelope protein. PGT121 mAb was chosen for this study because it is potent,
      neutralizes a wide array of HIV viruses, and can prevent and treat simian-human
      immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) in rhesus monkeys.
