      tacrolimus or cyclosporine) has been shown to improve graft survival in renal, cardiac and
      liver transplantation patients. However, its use has been associated with significant side
      effects, including gastrointestinal complications, causing dose reductions, interruption or
      termination of the therapy. An alternate formulation: enteric coated mycophenolate sodium
      (EC-MPS) was designed to alleviate the severity of upper gastrointestinal side effects.
      Several trials detailed in the protocol suggest a benefit in GI related health following
      conversion from MMF to EC-MPS, however we believe that robust data are lacking.
