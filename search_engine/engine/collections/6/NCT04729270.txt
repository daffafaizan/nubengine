      Current Stimulation (ten sessions) or transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation (TENS) (ten
      sessions) during two weeks. . Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), Neck Disability Index ( NDI),
      range of motion and (CROM), Questionnaire SF-12 and PPTs in sub-occipital and upper trapezius
      muscles were measured at baseline, at the end of treatment and at 1 month follow-up. T-tests
      and a repeated-measures multivariate analysis of variance (RM-MANOVA) were used for VAS, CROM
      and PPTs, respectively.
