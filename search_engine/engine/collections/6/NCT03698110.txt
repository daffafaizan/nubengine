      competence and healthy practices in families with children aged 2 to 5 years old, addressing
      parental self-efficacy an skills. This research followed the first three stages of the
      Medical Research Council framework for complex interventions: the theoretical, modeling and
      exploratory trial phases. A randomized control trial with parents of children better 2 to 5
      years old was conducted. The program consisted of two hour long four sessions. Parents were
      grouped in small groups (7-8 participants) and guided by a facilitator whose role was to
      provide a participative and trusting atmosphere to share opinions and experience in healthy
      lifestyles and parenting. Data collection was performed at three time points
      (pre-intervention, post-intervention and follow-up) to asses the preliminary efficacy,
      acceptability and feasibility of the program.
