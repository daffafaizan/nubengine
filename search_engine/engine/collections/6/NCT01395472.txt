      demonstrated in animal studies and in those with healthy humans or with individuals with some
      type of pathology. Nevertheless, there are few studies investigating the effects of acute
      physical exercise on cognitive functions of people with traumatic brain injury, even though
      they frequently have impairments in several cognitive domains due to their brain damage.

      The effect of two intensities of physical exercise (moderate and exhaustive) in attention,
      processing speed, memory, executive control and decision making will be investigated in
      patients with TBI. For that matter, their performance will be compared to non-brain injured
      subjects submitted to the same protocol and to TBI patients submitted to a stretching
      session.

      Each subject will be submitted to a neuropsychological evaluation before and after the
      physical exercise in order to determine if there is an improvement in cognitive performance
      post-exercise.
