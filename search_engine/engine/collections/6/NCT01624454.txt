      principles of colonoscopy lavage. Large volume PEG solutions are considered safe, but
      cumbersome and inpalatable, while osmotic solutions are generally more acceptable, however,
      the risk of electrolyte disturbances or renal decompensation may increase.

      The study will focus on patient experience and compliance, as well as cleansing quality,
      endoscopic findings and other technical parameters of the colonoscopy procedure that may be
      adversely affected by poor bowel cleansing. Three centers will participate, ensuring a
      diverse patient population. 800 patients are planned for recruitment, but an interim
      assessment of statistics of the primary aim parameter (bowel cleansing) will be performed to
      adjust the number.
