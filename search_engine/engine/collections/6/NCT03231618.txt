      obesity and major complications such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and other
      major metabolic diseases ,which have become the major cause of disease death and continued to
      endanger the public health. In order to curb the incidence of obesity and its complications,
      more effective strategies are required to "prevent the move forward." With the arrival of
      "precise nutrition" era, precise weight management strategy for different sub-groups has
      become a hotspot of international research in this field.

      Healthy diet and lifestyle are worldwide recognized as the most important and effective ways
      of preventing chronic metabolic diseases such as obesity. Recently, different combinations of
      macronutrients including "low-fat + high carbon", "low carbon + high fat", and "high protein
      + low fat" draw much more attention instead of restriction on the total energy intake in the
      study of diet weight reduction strategy. However, it is noteworthy that most studies are
      focused on groups and conducted on the Western population. Studies of different dietary
      structure, genetic background and metabolic phenotypes of energy metabolism are still scarce,
      and data of Chinese population are lacking in this field.

      This study intends to provide 40 male volunteers aged 20-45 (20 normal weight, 20 overweight
      / obesity, no other serious illness or metabolic abnormalities) with three diets with
      different levels of macronutrients (low-fat + high-carbon foods, low-carbon + high-fat foods,
      and high-protein + low-fat foods) to 1) clarify the relationship between the ratio of
      macronutrients in diets and the energy metabolism efficiency; 2) investigate the effect of
      major genetic and non-genetic factors (age, obesity, adipose distribution and thyroid
      hormone) and metabolomics profiles on individual energy metabolism; 3) explore novel
      metabolic regulation networks. Ultimately, this study will provide basic data for discovering
      the energy metabolism efficiency of different dietary intervention and major genetic and
      non-genetic determinants, metabolic profile characteristics and regulatory pathways.
