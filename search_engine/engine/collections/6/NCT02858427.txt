      of suicide attempt will be included whereas in the second group, depressed patients without a
      history of suicide attempt will be included.

      For each group, the cognitive inhibition will be assessed trough an eye tracker task
      (antisaccade).

      Both groups will also be compared on their neuropsychological characteristics and the quality
      of social interactions of participants.
