      cervical cancer who have an indication for radiotherapy. Those who accept to participate will
      receive the standard treatment with established chemo-radiation and will be randomized in two
      arms, the experimental will receive 500mg of the commercial presentation (curcugreen) c / 6h
      VO x 16 weeks and the control arm will receive placebo. The operative hypotheses are: the
      addition of curcumin to the treatment improves the cumulative probability of 3-year overall
      survival by 20% and improves the treatment response rate. The statistical analysis will
      include a Cox proportional hazards model and the results of the groups will be compared with
      the Student's T-test or ANOVA. This research hopes to collect tissue samples for future
      research that allows the identification of predictive biomarkers and disease prognoses.
