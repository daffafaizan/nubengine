      Biophysiology of Menstrually-Related Mood and Behavioral Disorders. Its original purposes
      were as follows: 1) to evaluate the efficacy of the gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH)
      agonist depot leuprolide acetate (Lupron) in the treatment of menstrually-related mood
      disorders (MRMD) by determining whether mood and behavioral symptoms are eliminated when the
      cyclic secretion of both gonadotropic hormones and gonadal steroids is suppressed, and 2) to
      determine the possible relevance of gonadal steroids to affective state by sequentially
      replacing estradiol and progesterone during continued GnRH suppression in those patients
      whose premenstrual symptoms remit following administration of the GnRH agonist. We observed
      that GnRH agonist induced ovarian suppression was an effective treatment compared to placebo
      in women with MRMD. Additionally, women with MRMD but not asymptomatic controls
      (participating in companion protocol 92-M-0174) experienced a recurrence of mood and
      behavioral symptoms when either estradiol or progesterone (but not placebo) was added back.
      These data suggest that women with MRMD have a differential sensitivity to the mood
      destabilizing effects of gonadal steroids.

      Having established that women with MRMD show a differential behavioral response to estrogen
      and progesterone, we now hope to identify the underlying mechanisms and physiologic
      concomitants of the differential behavioral sensitivity by performing studies (described in
      companion protocols) under the three hormonal conditions created by this protocol, and
      comparing results obtained with those seen in normal controls (Protocol #92-M-0174). Planned
      studies include the following: cognitive testing, brain imaging (3D PET, FMRI, MRS) and
      genetic studies including induced pluripotent cells.
