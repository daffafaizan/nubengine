      anesthetic resistance. By November 2018, 933 EDS patients (total 1059 respondents) completed
      the survey, 99.2% of which had previously received local anesthetics. Among these patients,
      88% reported that they have "had a problem with local anesthetic injection not working
      adequately or properly," while only 54% of respondents without EDS reported a similar
      problem. These data suggests that local anesthetic resistance might be more prevalent in
      patients with EDS than in the general population. If these findings are true, then this might
      have significant implications for the appropriate management of these patients during minor
      surgery and dental procedures.

      This study aims to assess the frequency and related issues around local anesthetic resistance
      in EDS patients, including whether the problem is a lack of analgesia or a timing effect
      (short duration of action or delayed onset of action), and whether the problem relates only
      to some local anesthetics or whether there is a problem with the whole class of local
      anesthetics.
