      neoadjuvant ADT (MRI #2), and after radiotherapy (MRI #3). Treatment response will be
      assessed primarily by absence of biochemical recurrence (PSA â‰¥2 ng/mL greater than nadir)
      within 3 years of completing radiotherapy. Change in RSI cellularity index from MRI #1 to MRI
      #2 will be evaluated for prediction of participants who will experience biochemical
      recurrence within 3 years, using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. We
      hypothesize that RSI cellularity index will be an early biomarker for treatment effectiveness
      in prostate cancer treated with ADT and radiotherapy.
