    
      This is a prospective double blind randomized controlled trial. The patients will be assigned
      to one of 4 groups (gr): (1) SEVO group, guided by a target end tidal concentration 1 - 2 MAC
      and modified according to the haemodynamics (BP, HR) of the patients using a bolus inhalation
      (4 MAC), (2) SEVO-BIS group, using SEVO to a target BIS of 40 - 50, (3) PROPO-REMI and (4)
      PROPO-REMI-BIS groups accordingly. In groups 1 and 2, anaesthesia will be induced with IV
      PROPO (2 mg/kg TW [TW = ideal body weight, IBW + 0.4 * difference to the excess weight]),
      REMI (1 μg/kg IBW) and succinylcholine (1mg/kg IBW). In groups 3, 4 anaesthesia will be
      induced with a continuous IV PROPO infusion (21mg/kg TW/h for 5 min, 12 mg/kg TW/h for 10 min
      and then 6 mg/kg TW/h), followed by an IV bolus of REMI and succinylcholine as above. Every
      rise of BP or HR > 15% of baseline will be followed by a bolus SEVO inhalation in grs 1 and 2
      or REMI bolus IV (1 μg/kg IBW) and increase in the continuous infusion rate of REMI from 0.1
      to 1.0 μg/kg/min in groups 3 and 4. An epidural catheter will be placed prior to induction
      for postoperative analgesia only. Intraoperative BP and HR, anaesthetic consumption, recovery
      scores (Aldrete, Chung, White) and anaesthesia cost will be evaluated.
