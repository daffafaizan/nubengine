    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of lenalidomide given in the post-transplant
      setting for a 12 month maintenance period.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To obtain preliminary estimates of the 1-year response rate, event-free and overall
      survival using this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of lenalidomide followed by a phase II
      study.

      PRE-CONDITIONING (patients with cluster of differentiation [CD]20+ non-Hodgkin lymphoma):
      Patients receive rituximab intravenously (IV) per standard of care.

      PREPARATIVE REGIMEN: Patients receive carmustine IV on day -6, etoposide IV twice daily (BID)
      and cytarabine IV BID on days -5 through -2, and melphalan IV on day -1.

      AUTOLOGOUS HEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELL TRANSPLANTATION: Patients undergo stem cell infusion on
      day 0.

      MAINTENANCE THERAPY: Beginning approximately 100 days post-transplant, patients receive
      lenalidomide orally (PO) on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 12 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
