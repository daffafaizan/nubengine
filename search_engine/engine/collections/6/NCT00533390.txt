      versus efavirenz 800mg QID in patients with tuberculosis (treated with regimens including
      rifampicin) and AIDS diagnosis. The total duration of the study is 6 months for each patient.
      All eligible patient will be treated with a fist line regimen for tuberculosis according to
      Brazilian guidelines: rifampicin (600mg QID); isoniazid (400mg QID) e pyrazinamide (2g QID)
      during 6 months for a weight of 45 kg or more and adapted doses for persons with less than 45
      kg. For patients with previous history of TB therapy etambutol 1.200mg QID will be added to
      the regimen.

      Both groups will receive nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI)and a non
      nucleoside transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) to treat HIV. The ITRN of first choice will be
      zidovudine and lamivudine association. Patients presenting contra indication for the use of
      those drugs will receive others NRTI. The NNRTI is efavirenz (800 or 600mg).

      Antiretrovirals will be initiated 30 days after stable TB therapy. In case of adverse events
      during TB therapy that lead to treatment interruption, the study drugs will be delayed until
      the 30th day after triple therapy for TB. During HIV therapy NRTI can be changed in case of
      intolerance
