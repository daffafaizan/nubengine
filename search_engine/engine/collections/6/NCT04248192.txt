      expanded HIV-specific T-cell therapy (DD HST-NEETs) in HIV-infected alloBMT recipients on
      ART. Eligible donors will undergo a blood draw of up to 300mL to allow production of
      allogeneic DD HST-NEETs. Participants who meet specified inclusion criteria including
      neutrophil recovery post-transplant and for whom donor products have passed release testing
      will receive DD HST-NEETs at a dose of 2x107/m2 within 30 days of screening visit.
