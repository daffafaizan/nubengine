        -  Assess the toxicity and tolerability of neoadjuvant Leuvectin in patients with stage II
           or III prostate cancer.

        -  Evaluate the efficacy of this regimen in preventing or delaying manifestations of
           disease progression as demonstrated by biochemical failure or clinical recurrence in
           this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive Leuvectin intraprostatically over 10-30 seconds under ultrasound guidance on
      day 0 followed by a second injection between days 4 and 7. Between days 8 and 14, patients
      undergo retropubic prostatectomy.

      All patients are followed at 2 months. Patients with a PSA no greater than 0.2 ng/mL are
      followed at 4 months and 6 months, every 3 months for 12 months, and then every 6 months for
      3.5 years in the absence of disease progression or biochemical failure.

      ACTUAL ACCRUAL: 13 patients were accrued for this study.
