      anti-rheumatic drugs. In patients responding insufficiently to Methotrexate, and/or other
      disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARD) strategies, with or without glucocorticoids,
      biological DMARD (TNF inhibitors, abatacept or tocilizumab, and, under certain circumstances,
      rituximab) should be commenced with Methotrexate. Among DMARD available in 2015, abatacept
      has demonstrated the ability to reduce synovitis, biomarkers of inflammation, and bone
      destruction. Monitoring rheumatoid arthritis patients after starting abatacept by US exams
      observed a strong reduction of power Doppler ultra-sonography at 3 months in two third of
      patients.

      Given the demonstration of correlation between joint inflammation and structural progression
      at each joint level as well as the opportunity for bone remodeling with resolution of joint
      inflammation, researchers expect to observe an improvement in bone micro-architecture
      parameters specifically in rheumatoid arthritis patients without remaining joint inflammation
      3 months following abatacept initiation.
