      with eye-drop solution with citicoline ( OMk2 ophthalmic solution).

      All patients was randomized in two groups (10:10), one receiving topical administration of
      OMk2 ophthalmic solution for 36 months and one group receiving only the excipients of OMk2
      (placebo).

      Omk2 ophthalmic solution and the placebo will be used for 36 months three times/day.

      They will undergo a complete ocular examination at baseline and at 6-, 12-, 18-, 24-, 30- and
      36- months after treatment.
