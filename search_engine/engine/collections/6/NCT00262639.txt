    
      Approximately 60 alcohol dependent individuals who are drinking heavily up until 72 hours, or
      less, prior to study participation will be randomized to receive either flumazenil
      (intravenously)on two successive days and gabapentin (orally)for 39 days or their matching
      placebos. They also will receive hydroxyzine and vitamins. Individuals will be evaluated for
      alcohol withdrawal, their response to acoustic startle, cognitive ability, craving, mood,
      sleep and drinking during the first week. They will then be seen weekly for about 6 weeks
      during which they take gabapentin or placebo and are provided with Combined Behavioral
      Intervention Therapy (counseling) once a week, or more, as required. Over this period they
      will be evaluated weekly for alcohol consumption, craving, sleep, mood, and biological
      markers of alcohol consumption ( percent carbohydrate deficient transferrin and
      gamma-glutamyl transferase). Blood will be obtained on week 3 and 6 for general health
      (liver, blood count etc.) screening. After the end of treatment, subjects will be followed-up
      at 4 weeks and again at 8 weeks after treatment to evaluate alcohol consumption, craving,
      sleep, mood.

      Subjects will undergo a functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) procedure sometime during
      the second or third week of study medication to assess cue induced regional brain activation
      to investigate the effect of medication on brain response to alcohol visual cues.
