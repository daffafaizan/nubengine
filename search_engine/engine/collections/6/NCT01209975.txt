      dorzolamide drops. It is not clear whether this improvement was a direct effect of the
      medication or secondary effect of the decrease in IOP. We would like to see the change of
      vascular reactivity before and after SLT, which will decrease the intraocular pressure
      without pharmacologic effect.
