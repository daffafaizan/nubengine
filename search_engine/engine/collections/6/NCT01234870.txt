      about one-third of all deaths in subjects over age 35.

      With the development of newer Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) techniques, such as faster
      pulse sequences and parallel imaging, cardiac MRI has become a routine tool for the
      evaluation and detection of myocardial ischemic disease. First pass myocardial perfusion
      (FPMP) using MRI is increasingly being used to assess ischemic heart disease. MRI offers the
      advantages of spatial resolution sufficient to differentiate between subendocardial and
      subepicardial perfusion; shorter examination time and also lack of ionizing radiation. Left
      ventricle cine gradient echo imaging can be used to assess regional ventricular function.
      Left ventricular myocardial viability can also be easily assessed at the same time in order
      to determine the amount of viable left ventricular myocardium and the percentage of
      irreversibly scarred myocardium by delayed enhanced images. Viability imaging is usually
      added to the perfusion protocol to increase specificity by allowing detection of fixed
      perfusion defects, which represent scar. The ultimate cardiac MRI protocol would be to
      combine both of these imaging strategies with a reliable and accurate coronary Magnetic
      Resonance Angiography(MRA) technique, such that obstructive coronary artery disease could be
      evaluated comprehensively at the same time. If all of these techniques can be combined
      together in a single study, it may be feasible to finally achieve a "one stop shop" for
      cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging.
