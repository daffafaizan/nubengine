        -  To examine the findings of the pilot study, that vitamin D supplementation in
           combination with vitamin D receptor (VDR) polymorphisms protects from late relapse
           (after 3 years) in patients who have had melanoma.

        -  To investigate the effects of vitamin D supplement dosage in reducing the risk of late
           relapse.

        -  To examine if vitamin D supplementation in combination with particular VDR polymorphisms
           protects from early relapse (before 3 years).

        -  To examine if serum levels of vitamin D correlate with risk of relapse in groups of
           patients with different VDR polymorphisms.

        -  To examine the effect of vitamin supplementation and VDR status on time to relapse and
           survival in these patients.

        -  To examine other factors that may affect risk of relapse by assembling a tissue (genomic
           DNA and serum) resource.

        -  To investigate the effect of exposure to incidental drugs, such as statins, on risk of
           relapse in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to disease relapse in the past 5 years (yes vs
      no).

      Patients are asked to complete a food frequency questionnaire focusing on vitamin D and the
      following area: supplementation of diet with vitamins/fish oil and duration of use; sun
      exposure and sunscreen-use per decade prior to and after diagnosis. Patients are also asked
      to provide a blood sample for serum and DNA analysis. Consenting patients are also tagged
      with the Office of National Statistics to allow passive follow up.

      Stored tissue from the patient's primary melanoma may be used to corroborate research
      findings using immunohistochemistry or studies of gene expression, polymorphism, or mutation.
