      and depression in parents. There is some growing evidence that families of ID children are
      able to meet the challenges. The purpose of the present study is to adapt LTP in my own way
      plus to test its acceptability and determine if it improves mothers knowledge about their
      child development and reduce their level of distress.

      The study has two phases: quantitative phase and qualitative phase. Quantitative phase: A
      single blind randomised controlled trial in school settings in Karachi Pakistan.

      Objectives:

        1. Help mothers cope better with their depression.

        2. Teach mothers play activities that will stimulate their children's development and
           improve mother-child interaction.

      Qualitative Phase: This will help to determine acceptability of the intervention and identify
      perceived mechanisms of change and any barriers and facilitators to LTP in my own Plus
      intervention. In-depth digitally recorded interviews and focus groups will be conducted with
      the parents and teachers to understand their beliefs, views, and feelings about caring for ID
      children.
