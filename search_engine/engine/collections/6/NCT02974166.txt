      Research Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders (RDC/ TMD) questionnaire, Axis I
      and II, portuguese version. The RDC/ TMD is compound by a 31 items questionnaire and a ten
      items clinical exam. All these items are related to patients symptoms and signs; to
      mandibular functional impairment; and social-demographics, social-economics, psychological e
      psychosocial data. The first part as Axis I tend to clinical assess and classify the TMD and
      the second, as Axis II propose a chronic pain score that could quantify the psychosocial
      impairment and present a subjects profile.

      Others assessment instruments utilized on the research were the VAS consists in a 10 cm
      horizontal line with "no pain" on the left side and "worst pain" on right side, then the
      subjects were instructed to vertical risk the level of pain. The digital caliper with a 0,03
      mm precision was used to measure the maximal mouth opening (MMO) as the maximal inter-incisal
      vertical distance of the incisors. The subjects were seated at 90Â° with neutral head position
      and solicited to open their mouths the maximum they can unassisted and without pain, maximum
      unassisted opening and maximum assisted opening. Also, a portable digital pressure algometer
      for measuring sensitivity to pressure before it became painful. The masseters and temporalis
      muscles trigger point location were used as reference to guarantee the reproducibility of the
      proceeding as well as to assess the always the same site. The statistical analysis was
      performed using the means comparisons for the parametric tests through Student T test and for
      the non-parametrical data, Wilcoxon. Also, it was made the descriptive statistical with
      frequencies analysis.
