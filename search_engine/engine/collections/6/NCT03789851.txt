      recent studies have demonstrated that shrinking tumors need less surgical treatment
      indicating that patients with pCR could potentially be spared of surgery in the future.
      However, up to now, prediction of pCR after NACT is only moderately accurate. This
      prospective, monocenter diagnostic trial aims to explore if minimal invasive biopsies (MIB)
      might overcome this diagnostic challenge.

      From June 1st, 2017 to June 15th, 2019 the investigators performed ultrasound-guided
      multipoint core needle biopsy (CNB) on 50 breast cancer patients after NAC and directly after
      surgery. To analyse CNB pathologically results were categorized as follows: residual vital
      tumor cells (invasive, in situ, both, lymphangiosis carcinomatosous) present, (significant
      parts of) the tumor bed present, neither vital tumor cells nor (significant parts of) the
      tumor bed (indicating a non representative VAB). The results were compared to those of the
      pathological examination of surgical specimen.
