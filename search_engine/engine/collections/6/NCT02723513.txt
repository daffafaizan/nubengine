    
      This is a pilot, cross-sectional exploratory study to evaluate the relationship between
      imaging and other biomarkers in fifty patients born pre-term (with or without
      bronchopulmonary dysplasia [BPD]) and age-matched healthy controls. The term-born adults will
      serve as the controls.

      All subjects will visit the Clinical Imaging Research Laboratories at Robarts Research
      Institute or the University of Montreal University Health Centre Sainte-Justine in a single
      visit and undergo: vital signs, pulmonary function testing (more specifically: spirometry,
      body plethysmography, airwave oscillation, and lung clearance index), questionnaires, proton
      and 129Xe MRI. Preterm patients will also have a low-dose chest computed tomography (CT), and
      have blood and urine samples taken for biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative stress.

      MRI of the lungs will be performed using non-contrast enhanced methods (ultra-short echo time
      [UTE] MRI) and using an inhaled contrast agent: Hyperpolarized Xenon-129. Participants will
      inhale the hyperpolarized gas and perform a breathhold for up to 16 seconds. Four different
      types of images will be acquired in the coronal plain during each visit: 1) 1H thoracic
      cavity, 2) 129Xe static ventilation, 3) 129Xe diffusion weighted imaging, and, 4)
      multi-volume UTE MRI. Respiration and oxygen saturation will be monitored throughout the
      imaging session.
