      of the pancreas treated with R115777. II. Determine the time to treatment failure and
      confirmed response in this patient population treated with this regimen. III. Evaluate the
      frequency and severity of toxicities associated with this treatment regimen in these
      patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral R115777 twice daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed
      every 6 months for 2 years and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 21-50 patients will be accrued for this study.
