      if Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy can achieve a downstaging rate of >= 30% at 3
      months.SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:I. To determine in patients with stage B and C Hepatocellular
      Carcinoma, if Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy can achieve a downstaging rate of >= 30% at 3
      and 6 months.II. To determine the rate of Grade 3 or 4 adverse events associated with SBRT
      for liver tumors. III. To determine the rate of local progression after SBRT. (Based onRECIST
      criteria)IV. To determine the number of patients who achieve liver
      transplantation.OUTLINE:Patients undergo 3 fractions of stereotactic body radiation therapy
      delivered within 14 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for 2 years.
