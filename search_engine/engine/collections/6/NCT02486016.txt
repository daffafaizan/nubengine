      and whether the heat applied will result in more fentanyl being absorbed through the skin
      than without applying heat. This is important given that little is known about how the
      release of fentanyl is affected by heat, particularly for generic products. This study will
      use fentanyl TDSs (brand name and generic TDSs) that have been approved by the Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) and are already prescribed to customers in the United States, and will
      not include any placebos.
