      I. To compare the overall hospital length of stay (LOS) in patients undergoing craniotomy
      with light sedation vs. general anesthesia.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare resource utilization between the two groups. II. To assess the frequency of
      post-operative delirium. III. To measure patient perceptions. IV. To track patient
      complications during hospital stay - nausea/vomiting, pain, hematology/lab stability,
      hemodynamic stability.

      V. To track re-admission and extended hospital stay rates. VI. To compare cost of both
      approaches.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive light sedation (awake) and undergo craniotomy.

      ARM II: Patients receive intubated general anesthesia and undergo craniotomy.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 1month and 1 year.
