      to one year post-diagnosis. A total of 11 fasting blood draws will be taken, the first near
      the time of diabetes diagnosis, then 2 weeks later, monthly for the next 6 months, and every
      other month until 12 months. Each blood sample will be evaluated by the MSP assay, as well as
      for measurement of fasting plasma glucose, HbA1c, c-peptide, and autoantibodies. The study
      will also need 25 healthy volunteers to help us match some DNA markers needed for this data.
      Healthy volunteers will be se=matched healthy individuals who have one blood sample drawn.
