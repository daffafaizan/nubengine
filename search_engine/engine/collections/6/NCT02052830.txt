      Program to the "business-as-usual" school curriculum. The Wise Guys multi-session curriculum
      is delivered in different formats that range in length from 5 to 12 weeks and topics covered
      include communication and masculinity, dating violence, abstinence and contraception, and
      sexually transmitted infections. Study participants are 7th grade boys attending a
      participating school in either the Davenport Iowa or North Scott Community school districts.
      This study is being conducted as part of the national Personal Responsibility Education
      Program evaluation funded by Administration for Children and Families within the U.S.
      Department of Health and Human Services.
