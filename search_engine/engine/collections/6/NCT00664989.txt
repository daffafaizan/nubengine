      patient self-assessed outcomes (Western Ontario Osteoarthritis of Shoulder Score- WOOS)
      following humeral resurfacing are superior to those following a conventional, modular,
      stemmed, humeral prosthesis. The first phase of this study will be a one year pilot
      recruitment period. This is necessary in order to determine both a center by center, and
      national recruitment rate, and to determine a sample size necessary for a sufficiently
      powered full randomized trial. If a full randomized trial is not considered feasible
      following Phase 1, then a prospective cohort study will be completed.
