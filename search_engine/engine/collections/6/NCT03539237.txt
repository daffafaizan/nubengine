      activity by video in the context of a tablet PC (personal computer)-based survey can achieve
      a higher degree of concordance between self-reported and accelerometer-measured physical
      activity compared to an assessment without video demonstration. The recruitment of the study
      participants in the age range between 40 and 75 years takes place in a shopping center in the
      city Greifswald in Germany.

      Informed consent consists of: (i) activity recording over 7 days using an accelerometer, (ii)
      completion of standardized questionnaires, (iii) participation in a standardized measurement
      of weight and height as well as waist and hip circumference.

      Participants are asked to wear an accelerometer during the day for a period of 7 days.
      Subsequently, a questionnaire about the frequency, duration and intensity of physical
      activity in the last 7 days will be answered in the DZHK (Deutsches Zentrum f√ºr
      Herz-Kreislauf-Forschung)- examination center. Prior to the physical activity assessment the
      study participants are randomly assigned to the study conditions "Video" or "No Video" (ratio
      1:1). Optionally, participants may receive feedback on their physical activity measured by
      accelerometer upon completion of the study.
