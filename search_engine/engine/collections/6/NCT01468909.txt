    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the progression-free survival hazard ratio of the combination of weekly
      paclitaxel and pazopanib (pazopanib hydrochloride) compared to weekly paclitaxel and placebo
      in patients with persistent or recurrent ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal
      cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the frequency and severity of adverse events as assessed by Common
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE).

      II. To estimate and compare the proportion of patients responding to therapy by Response
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), cancer antigen 125 (CA125) response, the
      overall survival (OS), and the duration of response in each arm.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore the association between plasma cytokines and angiogenic markers and
      progression-free and overall survival.

      II. To explore the association between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and
      progression-free and overall survival.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15 and
      placebo orally (PO) daily on days 1-28.

      ARM II: Patients receive paclitaxel as in Arm I and pazopanib hydrochloride PO daily on days
      1-28.

      In both arms, courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.
