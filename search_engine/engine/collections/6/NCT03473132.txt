    
      Prospective evaluation of the levels of the vitamin K dependent coagulation factors 2,7,9,10,
      and proteins C and S, in patients on warfarin treated with four factor prothrombin complex
      concentrate (4F-PCC). Participants on vitamin K antagonists (VKA) such as warfarin have
      suppressed levels that are brought to the normal range with treatment with 4F-PCC to reverse
      the warfarin effect. The investigators will assess the duration of effect of 4F-PCC on these
      factor levels in participants with left ventricular assist devices (VAD) requiring temporary
      reversal of warfarin for invasive procedures that have a risk of bleeding. The investigators
      will also assess the time to return to therapeutic INR..
