      surrounding media that is remaining after human clinical IVF cycles, to have a non-invasive
      way of obtaining markers of embryo chromosome numeration. Media recovered from the clinical
      IVF laboratory is typically discarded during an IVF cycle. Genomic technologies will be used
      to analyze the otherwise discarded media drop for chromosome counting.
