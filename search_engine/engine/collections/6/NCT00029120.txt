      memory disorders as a result of age or neurodegeneration. In particular, memory is the most
      important earliest clinical symptom of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although the hippocampus may
      not be a biological determinant of all memories, there is a growing body of evidence
      suggesting that dysfunction of the hippocampus plays an important role in the most common
      forms of memory disorders. This proposal will allow for the application of an array of newly
      developed magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy methods to the study of hippocampal
      function in these patients. Most importantly, for the first time, structure, perfusion and
      neurochemical composition of the hippocampus in living individuals can be evaluated at high
      resolution without known risk. The study of longitudinal changes in hippocampal function
      should allow us to understand the contributions that various genotypes, e.g., ApoE4, and
      abnormalities in cerebrospinal fluid, e.g., A-beta42 and tau, play in the development of
      abnormal hippocampal structure and function.
