      themselves. BD in youth is associated with increased risk for suicidality, psychosis,
      substance abuse and compromised psychosocial functioning. In addition, offspring of parents
      with BD have an increased vulnerability for developing other psychopathology (e.g. major
      depression). At present, research examining early intervention and treatment for this high
      risk population is limited. However, a recent study in symptomatic youth at risk for BD
      indicated that participation in a family focused therapy (FFT) intervention led to positive
      treatment outcomes. The present study aims to examine the effects of FFT in BD offspring in
      comparison to a brief educational treatment. Specifically, this study will examine whether
      FFT can have protective effects on individuals' mood symptoms and functioning by targeting
      the family environment. We will expand upon previous research by also measuring biological
      markers of stress (i.e., cortisol levels) and changes in family functioning over time. With
      this knowledge, the results of this study may help to shed light on the importance of early
      intervention and improve preventative treatment options for youth at high-risk for bipolar
      disorder.
