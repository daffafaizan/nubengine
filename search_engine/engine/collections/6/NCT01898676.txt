    
      Study consists of a screening visit, four treatment periods and a final follow-up visit. Each
      treatment period consists of a four night in-house stay followed by two outpatient visits.
      Each treatment period will be separated by a washout period. During each treatment period,
      safety evaluations will include vital signs, physical exams, safety laboratory tests, weight
      measurement, electrocardiograms, adverse event collection and concomitant medication
      recording. Pharmacokinetic blood samples will be collected during each treatment period.
      Seizure activity will be recorded in a seizure diary during the study. A standardized
      high-fat, high-calorie meal will be served prior to each dose during each treatment period.
