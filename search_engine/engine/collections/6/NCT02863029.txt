    
      Hypothesis:

      The investigators will test the hypothesis that the gut microbiome drives many of the effects
      that a pro-obesity high-fat diet has on intestinal stem cell (ISC) biology, which includes 1)
      an increase in ISC numbers and proliferation, 2) a reduced dependency on niche cells for
      intestinal organoid initiation, or 3) the acquisition of organoid-initiation by non-stem cell
      population in the intestinal epithelium.

      Specific Aims:

        1. To determine whether differences in the gut microbiome in obese human subjects
           correlates with enhanced intestinal stem cell numbers and function.

        2. To validate whether obesity-driven changes in the gut microbiome of human recapitulate
           the effects of obesity on intestinal stem cell function in germ-free mice.
