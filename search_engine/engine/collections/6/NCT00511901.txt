      rapid correction of anemia in patients who enter a rehabilitation setting after surgery or
      from hospitalization for acute medical problems leads to shorter rehabilitation stays and
      improved functional status.

      Patients aged 60 and older who have hemoglobin levels of less than 10.5 g/dL will be
      randomized to receive 8 weekly doses of either erythropoietin alfa or placebo. Functional
      status will be measured at baseline and then at 3, 8 and 12 weeks.

      The following specific aims will be tested in this study:

        -  Determine the prevalence of anemia in patients admitted to a subacute rehabilitation
           facility with potential for recovery.

        -  Determine the baseline functional status of patients admitted to a subacute
           rehabilitation facility with potential for recovery using the Functional Independence
           Measure (FIM), an assessment tool used in acute rehabilitation settings.

        -  Determine if administration of epoetin alfa will result in higher hemoglobin
           concentrations in patients receiving the drug than in patients given placebo at 3, 8 and
           12 weeks after entry into the study.

        -  Perform a study that establishes the feasibility of a trial to test whether epoetin alfa
           produces improvements in the FIM, grip strength, the time it takes for patients to reach
           rehabilitation goals, activity monitor, fatigue, mood, functional recovery and reduces
           length of rehabilitation stay.
