      food intake for three days (using the Automated Self-Administer 24-hour Dietary Recall
      [ASA24] system), neural indices of inhibitory control (as assessed by the N2 event-related
      potential component during a food and genetic go/no-go task), appetitive drive toward food
      (as measured by the Power of Food Scale) and basic demographic information will be assessed.
      Based off their gender and baseline levels of inhibitory control (indicated by the N2),
      participants will be assigned to a four week food-specific inhibitory control training or a
      generic inhibitory control training. Trainings are administered on a mobile device via an app
      and participants select four our of five business days to complete the trainings on.
      Immediately after the four weeks, participants will come in for a follow-up session where
      their weight, food intake, N2, and appetitive drive to food will be assessed again. Finally,
      participants will have a 12-week waiting period where they do not complete the trainings.
      After the 12 weeks, they will come in for a final lab visit where their weight, food intake,
      N2, and appetitive drive to food will be assessed one last time.
