      The Danish national board of Health has awarded funds for two studies that will test methods
      that can be used for effective and early detection of heavy drinkers. The study will be
      carried out in 12 Danish municipalities in 2008. The study is part of the 'Diet, Smoking,
      Alcohol and Exercise' nationwide health study of the Danish population. It takes place in 13
      municipalities in 2007 and 2008.

      The purpose of the study is to determine whether a web-based ultra-brief intervention,
      consisting of personalized normative feedback or standardized self-help material, is
      effective in lowering self reported alcohol use in heavy drinkers.

      Design:

      The experiment is designed as a randomized controlled trial, where heavy drinkers will be
      allocated to either:

      A) an intervention group receiving web-based personalized normative feedback (PFI) B) an
      intervention group receiving web-based self-help material (SHM) C) a control group receiving
      nothing.

      After 6 and 12 months there will be follow-up and the participants will receive a
      questionnaire with questions about their alcohol consumption (internetbased and paper).
