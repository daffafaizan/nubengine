      when used in high doses. Different people respond differently to cholesterol lowering doses
      of niacin, some people have a side effect termed flushing (similar to a hot flash) while
      others do not and some people have more pronounced effects on cholesterol. Endotoxin or
      lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a small part of bacteria (that is no longer living) that can
      cause many of the effects similar to bacterial infections in humans. However, it can be
      administered in very small amounts to produce a mild inflammatory response much the same as a
      'flu-like" illness. Within 1 Â½ -3 hours after giving LPS by vein, a response consisting of
      fever, chills, headache, nausea and vomiting and generalized aches and pains will occur which
      lasts up to 6-8 hours. In addition to the flu like symptoms, the inflammation causes changes
      in cholesterol, triglycerides and glucose clearance. Different people respond differently to
      endotoxin and inflammation. We are performing this study to see if there are genetic factors
      that predict how people will respond to niacin and to endotoxin and its inflammatory
      response.
