      in patients at least 18 years of age, who have peripheral atherosclerotic lesions involving
      the superficial femoral and/or popliteal arteries. These patients have no current therapeutic
      alternatives beyond the procedure used to open, or revascularize, their superficial femoral
      and/or popliteal arteries. Metal stents have the potential to fracture when implanted in this
      artery segment due to continual flexion and bending of the knee. It is desirable to improve
      the patency of this artery after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) and/or
      atherectomy-based revascularization.
