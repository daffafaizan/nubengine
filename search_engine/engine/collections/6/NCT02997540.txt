      rotation and ultrasound probe position on the breast on the position of breast lesions
      relative to the breast nipple and body orientation planes, required for positional
      annotations, in female subjects at one study visit. Measurements will be manually and
      automatically recorded by two ultrasound operators with each image and will be compared among
      these conditions to detect effects of probe position and probe orientation and patient's body
      position relative to the exam table. The manual and automated measurements will be compared
      to determine the differences between the data obtained using the two different methods.
