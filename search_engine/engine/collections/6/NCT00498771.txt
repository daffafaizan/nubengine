      The study is designed for breast cancer patients who have developed Lymphedema following
      cancer treatment. Potential study participants should have explored conventional treatments
      such as decongestive therapy and lymph drainage massage before joining the study.

      There are two groups that the participants may choose from until enrollment for the group has
      reached its capacity.The active arm of the study will attend 12 one-hour aquatic exercise
      classes and classes will be held in an indoor heated pool. There is no cost to the
      participants.Both the active arm and the control group (not attending aquatic exercise
      classes) will have 3 measurement assessments that will compare the circumference and
      volumetric measurement of arms, as well as height, weight and body mass index (BMI).

      Both group will fill out a program questionnaire. Quality of life survey taken at baseline,
      week 6, month 6 and 12 will be compared. A follow up questionnaire will be completed at 6 and
      12 month intervals, and annually for five years.
