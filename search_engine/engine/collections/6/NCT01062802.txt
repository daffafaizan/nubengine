      participate within the study. In this double blind randomized control trial patients will be
      recruited through vascular surgical outpatient clinics. After inclusion, informed consent and
      evaluation of base line characteristics patients will be given a prescription for study
      medication. This prescription was exchanged by the patient for medication at the hospital
      pharmacy. Randomization will be carried out by pharmacy with computer generated sequence with
      a sub group size of 4. This will ascertain the order of prescribed drug/ placebo. Pharmacy
      then dispensed the drug/ placebo in this order. Drug used will be Atorvastatin 80 mg, white,
      elliptical, film coated tablets debossed '80' on one side and 'PD 158' on the other side. The
      placebo is similar in shape and colour. Drug/ placebo will be given for 4 weeks
      pre-operatively. Full thickness infrarenal aortic samples will obtained at time of operation
      and the exact sample site will be recorded. Samples will be washed with 0.9% saline to remove
      blood and clots, snap-frozen and stored at -80C for subsequent MMP 2, 8 and 9 and TIMP 1 and
      2 analyses.
