      majority of Western and Asian countries. A strong association of suicide and depression often
      indicates the necessity of a high-risk approach for suicide prevention. Improvements in
      identification and treatment can lead to better depression outcomes and suicide prevention.
      The investigators hypothesize that a 4-year community-based intervention, consisting of
      universal depression screening and subsequent care support in the target areas and health
      education programs, would result in reduced suicide rates among the middle-aged adult
      population in areas with a high suicide rate.
