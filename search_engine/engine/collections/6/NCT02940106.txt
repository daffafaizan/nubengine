      Vitrification can be performed using either open devices (where the oocytes are in direct
      contact with the liquid nitrogen) or closed systems (where the oocytes are never in contact
      with liquid nitrogen). Previous studies have associated the use of open devices to higher
      oocyte survival rates and better embryo development. However, any beneficial effect on
      clinical pregnancy rates is yet to be proven. Hence, the objective of this study is to
      compare the clinical pregnancy rates of open and closed oocyte vitrification devices.
