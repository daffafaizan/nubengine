      low- or intermediate-grade B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. II. Determine the safety of this
      drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive denileukin diftitox IV over 30-60
      minutes on days 1-5. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients may receive up to 2 additional courses after achieving
      complete response. Patients are followed every 3 months until they have progressed or for 2
      years from date of termination.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 58 patients (29 with low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and
      29 with intermediate-grade NHL) will be accrued for this study within 12 months. The study
      may be stopped after accrual of 20 patients (10 with low-grade NHL and 10 with
      intermediate-grade NHL) if observed response rate is less than 1 in 10 for each stratum.
