      Primary

        -  Determine the 1-year overall survival rate in patients with previously treated locally
           advanced adenocarcinoma of the esophagus or gastroesophageal junction treated with
           gefitinib as maintenance therapy.

      Secondary

        -  Determine disease-free survival and time to disease recurrence in patients treated with
           this drug.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the quality of life of patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral gefitinib once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease recurrence or unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, 4 weeks, every 12 weeks during study treatment, and
      then at the end of study treatment.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for up to 5 years.
