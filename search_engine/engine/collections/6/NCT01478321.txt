    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the overall survival (OS) for patients with recurrent high grade malignant
      gliomas treated with concurrent radiation, temozolomide, and bevacizumab followed by adjuvant
      temozolomide and bevacizumab.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the impact of this regimen on neurologic symptoms via Functional Assessment of
      Cancer Therapy-Brain (FACT-Br) and FACT-Fatigue scales and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
      (ECOG) performance status.

      II. Determine the safety profile of this regimen. III. Determine the progression free
      survival (PFS) at 6 and 12 months (all patients) as well as at 3 months (bevacizumab-exposed
      patients only).

      OUTLINE:

      CONCURRENT THERAPY: Patients undergo hypofractionated radiation therapy 5 days a week
      beginning on day 0. Patients also receive temozolomide orally (PO) once daily (QD) and
      bevacizumab intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes once every 2 weeks beginning on days -3 to
      0. Treatment continues for 5 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      ADJUVANT THERAPY: Beginning 2 weeks after completion of radiation therapy, patients receive
      temozolomide PO QD for 6 weeks and bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes once every 2 weeks.
      Courses repeat every 8 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2-3 months.
