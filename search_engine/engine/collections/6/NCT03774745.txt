      gestation) performed without primary surgical intervention and resulting from the use of
      abortion-inducing medications. The use of medications to cause abortion has been around for
      almost 70 years but the modern era of medical abortion treatment evolved with the development
      of mifepristone, a progesterone-receptor blocker with an affinity for the receptor greater
      than progesterone itself.

      Medical abortion with mifepristone and misoprostol is highly effective; however, the risk of
      continuing pregnancy is still present, especially as gestation advances. While most women opt
      for further treatment in these scenarios, such as surgical aspiration, there are some who
      decide to continue the pregnancy. Thus, even following treatment, some women do change their
      mind.

      No well-done study has evaluated whether such treatment works. Poorly controlled case series
      are not evidence and systematic reviews of continuing pregnancy rates after
      mifepristone/prostaglandin analogue treatment failure do not reflect real life outcomes. This
      study is also a first step to understanding if large studies evaluating mifepristone
      antagonization with high-dose progesterone are indicated and if placebo-controlled randomized
      trials can be successfully completed when evaluating this question.
