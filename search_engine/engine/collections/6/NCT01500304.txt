      of minimally invasive inguinal lymph node dissection for patients with melanoma. Licensed
      surgeons who have undergone special training, including a course at the Mayo Clinic Rochester
      in minimally invasive lymph node dissection (MILND) will perform the new procedure at their
      home institutions. The study will characterize the learning curve of MILND in the clinical
      setting, and evaluate the safety of the new operative technique.

      The hypotheses for this study are: 1) minimally invasive groin dissection is a safe
      procedure. 2) a structured educational training program is a feasible and effective method to
      train practicing surgeons in this novel procedure and 3) pre-course generic laparoscopic
      technical skills correlate with minimally invasive superficial groin dissection performance
      in a clinical setting, including operative oncologic standards and safety metrics.
