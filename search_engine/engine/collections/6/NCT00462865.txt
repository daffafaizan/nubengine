      (NAC) has become accepted as standard treatment. Advantages of NAC include shrinking the
      primary tumor, often rendering an unresectable cancer resectable, and the theoretically
      concurrent treatment of occult metastatic disease prior to definitive local therapy (surgery
      +/- radiation therapy). NAC can reduce the extent of surgery required for the management of
      local breast cancer from mastectomy to lump- or segmentectomy, without compromising major
      outcome measures, such as overall and disease free survival. At this time, the current
      standard of care for women felt to be candidates for NAC is an anthracycline + taxane
      regimen. The intent is to induce a pCR which as noted above is a strong indicator of
      survival. Yet, in both large NSABP studies, the proportion of women achieving this is less
      than 20% with these regimens raising a major challenge in clinical practice: what is the
      appropriate treatment for women with persistent disease after NAC? Given that gemcitabine and
      capecitabine are non-cross-resistant to anthracyclines and taxanes and use a different
      mechanism of action, have an acceptable toxicity profile, and in the absence of standard
      options for therapy we are interested in utilizing these agents coupled with bevacizumab as
      adjuvant treatment in women with residual breast cancer following primary chemotherapy.
