    
      This Phase 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled proof of concept study will
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of mavrilimumab co-administered with a 26-week
      corticosteroid taper in subjects with GCA. The study will consist of a screening period (up
      to 6 weeks), a 26-week double-blind placebo-controlled period during which subjects will
      receive blinded mavrilimumab or placebo co-administered with a 26-week corticosteroid taper,
      and a 12-week washout safety follow-up period during which subjects will discontinue and wash
      off blinded mavrilimumab or placebo.
