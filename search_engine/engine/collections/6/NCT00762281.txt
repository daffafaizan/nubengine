      In the hyperopia procedure, a steepening occurs on the corneal surface, rather than the
      flattening procedure (myopic treatment). The surgeon will produce a standard keratomileusis
      flap using a microkeratome, exposing the corneal stroma. Recontouring under the flap is then
      accomplished by the removal of tissue from the stroma with the laser. This recontouring
      results in an altering of effective lens power of the central cornea, measured in diopters
      (D). The MEL 80 Excimer Laser System will be evaluated for its ability to create accurate and
      stable hyperopic refractive correction results.
