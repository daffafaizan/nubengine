      radiotherapy and bevacizumab maintenance therapy for oligometastatic lung adenocarcinoma with
      negative driver genes.

      The patients receive SBRT radiotherapy for the primary (if any) and metastatic lesions or
      divided radiotherapy with or without concurrent chemotherapy.Bevacizumab maintenance therapy
      starts 1-2 months later after the chemotherapy.The recommended dose for intravenous infusion
      is 15mg/kg body weight, and the drug is given every 3 weeks until disease progression or
      intolerable toxicity occurs. Toxicities will be graded according to National Cancer Institute
      Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v. 4.0.
