      cancer patients and their family caregivers over the period when goals of care may shift,
      i.e. beginning shortly after diagnosis. This randomized clinical trial is being conducted in
      two urban tertiary cancer clinics that reach patients and families in low income and diverse
      underserved populations: the Louis Stokes Cleveland VAMC and MetroHealth Medical Center.
      Recruitment and randomization are based on patient's diagnosis and age. The patient had to
      have been diagnosed with a stage IV cancer within a year of enrollment and they must fall
      into one of two age groups: middle-aged (ages 40-60); or older (61 and older). Patients are
      stratified by age group and then randomized to usual care or CCS intervention. Family
      care-givers are randomized along with the patient. Trained clinical nurse specialists with
      advanced training in mental health serve as CCS practitioners. They are available to patients
      and family caregivers on a 24/7 basis to assist with coping and communication challenges as
      they may arise. The primary goal of this project is to examine main effects of the
      intervention and patient age group interaction effects of the CCS intervention on
      perspectives and well-being of family caregivers during advanced cancer care and in
      bereavement.
