      treatment, especially when it comes to gingival recession. However, there is a lack of
      evidence in the literature explaining the most appropriate type of treatment for multiple
      recessions in aesthetic areas. For unitary gingival recessions, the subepithelial connective
      tissue graft (SCTG) is considered gold standard because it presents greater predictability
      for root coverage. However, it is associated with postoperative morbidity, limited amount of
      donor tissue and longer surgical time. Thus, the search for a tissue substitute for SCTG is
      increasing. Currently, one of the possible autogenous soft tissue substitutes found in the
      market is the MucograftÂ® xenogen matrix (MG). The results with the use of MG are very
      promising, both for root coverage as well as for gain of keratinized mucosa. The present
      study will consist of a double-blind parallel randomized clinical trial with the objective of
      comparing SCTG (control group) and MG (test group) in the treatment of Miller's class I and
      II gingival recessions, multiple in aesthetic areas (central incisors, Lateral, upper
      canine). All measurements will be evaluated initially and in the periods of 3, 6 and 12
      months after the surgical procedure.
