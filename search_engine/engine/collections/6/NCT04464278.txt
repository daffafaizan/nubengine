      associated with an increased risk of mortality.

      There are a large number of studies associating weight loss and mortality but the
      relationships between changes in body composition (ratio between fat mass and lean mass) and
      mortality are often contradictory and poorly understood in elderly subject. The aim at this
      study is to request at this question.
