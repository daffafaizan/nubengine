      significant problems after unrelated and haploidentical hematopoietic stem sell
      transplantation (HSCT) in patients with primary immunodeficiency diseases (PID). In this
      study the hypothesis is that the transplantation of TCR alfa beta depleted peripheral blood
      stem cells (PBSC) would offers advantages over the use of positively selected CD34+ stem
      cells in haploidentical HSCT and non-manipulated graft in unrelated HSCT.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficiency of the selective infusion
      of TCR alfa beta T cell depleted graft in pediatric patients with PID receiving HSCT from
      haploidentical and unrelated donors.
