      and a new subtype of coronavirus has been identified as the causative agent of this
      condition. On February 11, 2000 the disease has been characterized as COVID-19 and on March
      11 the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a state of worldwide pandemic. On January 25,
      2021 there are 98,794,942 cases and 2,124,193 documented deaths (global case-fatality ratio
      of 2.15%).

      To date, no early treatment has been identified as effective in combating this disease which
      has been identified as with high morbidity and mortality. Epidemiological data suggest that
      despite development of vaccines we will have hundreds od thousands of cases in the next two
      years.

      Thus, we propose the repositioning of three drugs which experimentally have shown
      anti-inflammatory activity against SARS-CoV2 and some clinical evidence derived from
      observational studies on reducing complications if used early on the disease, before
      inflammatory cascade is fully activated.
