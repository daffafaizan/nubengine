      States (LaRue et al, 1985). While the near certainty of such bereavement is predictable in
      one spouse or the other, the exact impact and duration of bereavement is much less
      predictable (Stroebe et al, 1995). It has been reported that the loss of a spouse is rated as
      the major life stressor among survivors of varying ages and diverse cultural backgrounds
      (Holmes and Rahe, 1967). As one copes with the loss of a loved one, expected reactions
      include sadness, tearfulness, and even depression (DeLeon, 1994; Pasternak, 1996). Other
      complications can include work-related difficulties, sleep disturbances, irrational
      behaviors, and immunologic dysfunction (Zisook, 1994; Prigerson, et al, 1995). All of these
      symptoms are common; yet, the underlying biology and relationship with the time course of
      bereavement are still poorly understood. The purpose of this study will be to prospectively
      follow a cohort of elderly bereaved spouses and controls from multiple clinical and
      biological perspectives over thirteen months after the loss of a spouse.
