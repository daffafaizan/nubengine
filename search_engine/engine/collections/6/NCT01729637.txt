      need of new approaches to respiratory mechanics monitoring to prevent lung stress in atypical
      physiological settings.

      Airway pressure/time curve (Paw-t) shape analysis at constant flow ventilation (Stress Index,
      SI) is thought to be predictor of lung stress; so the SI coefficient may therefore identify
      and quantify mechanical stress during ventilation. (1) In experimental studies, the threshold
      values for SI that best discriminated lungs with signs of Ventilator Induced Lung Injury
      ranged between 0.9 and 1.1. (2) During EVLP, the isolated lungs are free from the effect of
      chest wall impairment and represent the effective response of lung parenchyma to ventilatory
      setting.

      Use of SI monitoring in isolated and perfuse lung reconditioning, may be an useful tool to
      prevent hyperinflation and opening-closing conditions by titrating optimal protective
      ventilation As previously reported by our group, in the first trial of lung reconditioning,
      signs of mechanical stress were detected with Paw-t curve. (3) Therefore we implemented EVLP
      procedure with continuous stress index analysis to detect and quantify the occurrence of
      hyperinflation or opening closing condition.
