    
      This is a Phase I, randomized, controlled, double-blinded, dose-escalation study to examine
      tolerability, dose, and immune response of an HIV DNA plasmid vaccine. The hypothesis is that
      this vaccine will be safe for human administration and elicit immune responses to HIV. The
      primary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability in humans of VRC-HIVDNA009-00-VP
      and secondary objectives are to evaluate the immunogenicity of the vaccine and social impact
      of participating in an HIV-1 vaccine trial.
