    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess feasibility and tolerability of OSMI based hematopoietic stem cell transplant
      (HSCT) as defined by transplant-related mortality (TRM) at day 30 as well as rate of grade
      II/III organ toxicity (defined by Bearman Regimen-Related Toxicities Scale) attributable to
      conditioning occurring within 30 days.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Day 100 transplant-related mortality (TRM). II. Donor chimerism assessment at day 100 (to
      assess failure of engraftment rate).

      III. Incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) by day 100. IV. Incidence of
      chronic GVHD at one year. V. Cumulative incidence of grade II organ toxicity through day 100.
      VI. Rate and kinetics of hematopoietic recovery. VII. Incidence of graft failure (primary and
      secondary). VIII. Rate of infectious complications. IX. Cumulative incidence of relapse,
      overall survival, and progression-free survival at 1 year.

      OUTLINE:

      CONDITIONING REGIMEN: Patients undergo organ-sparing marrow irradiation twice daily (BID) on
      days -6 to -4 and receive cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) over 1-2 hours every 24 hours
      on days -3 to -2. Patients with an unrelated donor also receive anti-thymocyte globulin every
      24 hours on days -4 to -2.

      GVHD PROPHYLAXIS: Patients receive tacrolimus IV or orally (PO) beginning on day -1 and
      continuing for at least 6 months and methotrexate IV on days 1, 3, 6, and 11.

      TRANSPLANT: Patients undergo allogeneic peripheral blood progenitor cell or bone marrow
      transplant on day 0.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up weekly for 12 weeks, at day
      100, and then at 6 and 12 months.
