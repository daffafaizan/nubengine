    
      HARP is a multi-center, observational study which enrolls men and women with MI who are
      referred for cardiac catheterization. Eligible participants with MINOCA (defined as no
      stenosis of >50% in any major epicardial vessel) will undergo optical coherence tomography
      (OCT) at the time of diagnostic angiography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR).

      Participants will also have the option to enroll in the HARP-Platelet Sub-Study.
