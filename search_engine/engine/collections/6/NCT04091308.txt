      of functional independence and improvement in the quality of life.

      The aim of the study is to investigate the effect of an individually tailored physical
      exercise training program combined with increased protein intake in order to improve measures
      on all three ICF levels (International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and
      Health). By conducting the study in a real-life clinical setting, research is translated into
      practice involving health professionals and the target group in the development of new
      knowledge on how to enhance the outcome of rehabilitation, thereby increasing the overall
      capacity of the elderly citizen, and decreasing the expenditure of health-services.
