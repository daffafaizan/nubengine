      disseminated; however, randomized studies are needed to determine its effectiveness. The
      purpose of the study is to test the feasibility and efficacy of specialty mental health
      probation (SMHP) for probationers with mental illness in North Carolina. 320 adult
      probationers with severe mental illness in will be randomly assigned to receive specialty
      mental health probation (experimental condition) or standard probation (control condition).
      Probationers assigned to the experimental condition will be supervised by specialty mental
      health probation officers, who will have reduced caseloads and advanced training in mental
      health and other topics. Probationers assigned to the control condition will receive standard
      probation. Criminal justice and mental health outcomes will be examined.
