      intravenously administered human insulin, suggest that normalization of hyperglycemia can
      reduce morbidity as well as mortality in these patients. Insulin-based regimens require
      frequent blood glucose measurements and adjustments of infusion rate to achieve
      normoglycemia.

      In addition, hypoglycaemia is a frequent and important side effect. Glucagon-Like-Peptide 1
      (GLP-1) is an insulinotropic, glucagonostatic gastrointestinal hormone that lowers glucose in
      a glycemia-dependent manner and therefore does not cause hypoglycemia.

      The aim of our study was to compare for the first time efficacy and safety of intravenously
      administered GLP-1 with an established intravenous insulin regimen in hyperglycaemic type 2
      diabetic patients.
