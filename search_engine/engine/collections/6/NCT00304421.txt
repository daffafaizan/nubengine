      phase. Nocturnal acid reflux is presumably more damaging because of loss of salivary
      neutralization. The present study is designed to measure effects of rabeprazole and
      pantoprazole on post-prandial and nocturnal gastric acid secretion and intragastric pH in H.
      pylori-negative volunteers with gastroesophageal reflux disease. These measurement will be
      used to compare the degree of inhibition of gastric acid secretion between the two drugs.
