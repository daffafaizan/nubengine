      surgery have greatly improved the survival rate, most types of chemotherapy have been
      reported to have varying degrees of cardiotoxicity. We have focused on the field of
      chemotherapy-related cardiomyopathy. Using the unified magnetic resonance sequences and
      parameters, effect of chemotherapeutic drugs on the myocardium are studies. Our team's
      previous pilot study has found that chemotherapy-related cardiomyopathy (CMP) may be
      predicted within one week after chemotherapy initiation. The specific intervention timing,
      and the sensitivity and specificity of the early screening indicators are to be explored. At
      the same time, in patients with human epidermalgrowth factor receptor-2-positive breast
      cancer, our team observed the change of blood pressure, exercise tolerance and myocardial
      structure, function and tissue characteristics in patients who used tyrosine kinase
      inhibitors (pyrotinib and apatinib). This is a supplement to the existing drug knowledge. We
      are planning to further explore whether it is related to the patient's pre-existing
      cardiovascular diseases, drug type, dose or dosing. There are no published data addressing
      the above two research areas. The overall goal is to explore the commonness and specificity
      of myocardial changes after chemotherapy in breast cancer patients and to predict the
      development of CMP through multimodality imaging and clinical indices. We aim to propose the
      CMP time window in respective chemotherapy among more subjects.
