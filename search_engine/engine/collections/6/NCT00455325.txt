      consists of abnormal serum lipids, glucose intolerance, elevated blood pressure, and central
      obesity in the setting of insulin resistance. The syndrome substantially increases the risk
      of developing diabetes and vascular disease, but there is no clear unifying approach to treat
      this disorder. In animals, activation of the protein ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)
      using the antimalarial drug chloroquine improves features of metabolic syndrome and decreases
      atherosclerosis, a build-up of fatty plaque within arteries. The purpose of this study is to
      evaluate the effectiveness of short-term treatment with low doses of chloroquine as a way of
      managing metabolic syndrome.

      Participants in this study will initially receive placebo for 3 weeks, followed by increasing
      doses of chloroquine in 3-week intervals. There will be a period of no active treatment for 5
      to 7 weeks between each arm. At the end of each 3-week period, participants will be admitted
      to the research center and will undergo insulin sensitivity testing with the hyperinsulinemic
      euglycemic clamp procedure. In addition, blood will be collected and blood pressure will be
      measured.
