    
      Randomization Phase: Participants will receive blinded study drug (lenvatinib/placebo) in 2:1
      ratio until documentation of disease progression (confirmed by independent imaging review),
      development of unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent. After having completed the
      primary analysis, subjects treated with lenvatinib who have not experienced disease
      progression may request to continue open label lenvatinib at the same dose, according to the
      clinical judgment of the investigator. Participants who discontinue treatment for any reason
      other than disease progression will be followed in the Randomization Phase until disease
      progression or start of another anticancer treatment; these participants then enter the
      Extension Phase for survival follow-up. Extension Phase: Participants in the placebo arm who
      have disease progression confirmed by IIR could request to enter the OOL Lenvatinib Treatment
      Period and receive lenvatinib treatment. Participants will receive lenvatinib treatment until
      disease progression (investigator's assessment), development of intolerable toxicity, or
      withdrawal of consent. Participants who had disease progression during the Randomization
      Phase and did not enter the OOL Lenvatinib Treatment Period and all participants who
      discontinued lenvatinib treatment in the OOL Lenvatinib Treatment Period will enter the
      follow-up period. Participants will be followed for survival, and all anticancer treatments
      will be recorded until the time of death.
