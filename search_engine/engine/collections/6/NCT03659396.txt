      and activities. The elderly suffering from balance impairment by aging have high rate to
      increase fall-related injuries, restricted activities, declined physical functions, and
      decrease quality of life. Tai Chi (TC) has been demonstrated as an innovative way to promote
      balance function, which is a suitable exercise for older people because of its slow movement,
      changeable base of supports, multi-directions weight shifting and less impact on lower
      extremities. Recent systematic reviews have shown that TC exercises have significant benefits
      in improving balance control, but most of them are only connected with healthy elderlies.
      Actually, the long standing time and training duration, challenged recollection by its
      sequence forms, and complex coordination for upper and lower extremities of TC usually make
      it difficult to practice for some elderlies with poor physical functions. Therefore, the
      method of individualized TC exercise program, integrated with biomechanical analyses, is
      developed in this research. It can afford an easier and more applicable training for elderly
      to improve the balance abilities.

      Purposes:To evaluate the effects of individualized Tai Chi training on balance control in
      elderly.

      Methods: This research is a quasi-experimental design and prospective study. Participants
      were recruited and assigned into individualized TC, entire TC group and home-based education
      group
