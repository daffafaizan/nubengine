           in the operating room, and mechanical ventilation is applied to the patients after
           endotracheal intubation.

        2. Within five minutes of the start of mechanical ventilation, the degree of baseline lung
           atelectasis is measured in anterior, lateral, and posterior regions of the upper and
           lower lungs of both lungs using transthoracic lung ultrasonography, ie, a total of 12
           regions. Atelectasis is confirmed by the presence or absence of B-line and juxtapleural
           consolidation, grading to 0-3 according to severity. That is, the lung atelectasis score
           can be scored from 0 to 72 points.

        3. After ultrasound examination, PEEP is applied in 3 cm H2O.

        4. The cardiac index is measured using a transesophageal doppler for 5 minutes before
           (PEEP=3) and after each application of PEEP (3, 6, 9 cm H2O) according to a randomized,
           defined group of patients.

        5. The applied PEEP is maintained until the end of the operation.

        6. After the end of the operation, the score of the lung atelectasis is measured by the
           same method.

        7. Patients who had atelectasis on ultrasonography are recruited three times for 3-5
           seconds under 30 cmH2O pressure under the guideline of lung ultrasonography. The
           anesthesia is terminated by a conventional method and the patient is awakened. The
           patient is monitored at the recovery room and transferred to the general ward.
