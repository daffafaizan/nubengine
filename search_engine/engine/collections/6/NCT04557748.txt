      but related, projects. The Urinary Urgency Phenotyping Protocol is the overarching effort,
      and will comprise five integrated projects. Project A, the Observational Cohort, will be a
      large-scale accrual of male and female participants with urinary urgency and age-matched
      controls without any LUTS. Standardized clinical data, comprising information typically
      gathered at the patient clinic encounter, self-report symptom, urologic and non-urologic
      data, and biosamples will be collected. Using this group of participants, subsets will be
      identified for more focused and in-depth studies of urinary urgency and urgency incontinence.
      This more focused effort will be conducted as Project B: the Central Sensitization Study;
      Project C: the Physical Activity and Sleep Study; Project D: the Organ-Based Study; and
      Project E: the Qualitative Assessment of Patients with Urinary Urgency Study.
