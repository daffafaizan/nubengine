      care units who may benefit from palliative care consults. These patients will be presented
      weekly to a palliative care specialist in a custom user interface. The palliative care
      specialist will reach out to primary care teams if she determines that the patient would
      benefit from palliative care. If the primary care provider agrees, he/she would write a
      palliative care consult order for the patient. The goal is to reduce the time to palliative
      care for these patients, who may not have been identified as quickly without the algorithm.
