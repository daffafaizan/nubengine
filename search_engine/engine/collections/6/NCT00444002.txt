      without steatosis. This is associated with 1) increased liver lipid peroxides and cytokines
      (TNF-alpha, TGF-beta); 2) altered unsaturated fat status (intake, tissue storage as measured
      in red blood cells); 3) reduced antioxidant status.

      Objectives: To assess oxidative stress and nutritional status in patients with Hepatitis C
      and steatosis on liver biopsy and to compare the results to the same parameters measured in
      patients with Hepatitis C and no steatosis.

      Measurements:

      Primary outcome: Liver lipid peroxides (LPO)

      Secondary outcomes:

      Liver: TNF-alpha; liver pathology and immunohistochemistry for adducts of malondialdehyde
      (MDA), a product of lipid peroxidation (LP), alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA), a marker
      of hepatic stellate cell activation; and transforming growth factor (TGF-beta), a
      profibrogenic cytokine involved in fibrogenesis, liver fatty acid composition (substrate for
      lipid peroxidation).

      Oxidative stress and nutrition: Plasma lipid peroxides, plasma antioxidant vitamins,
      antioxidant status and power, and red blood cell fatty acid composition, 7 day food record,
      anthropometry.

      Other measurements:

      Insulin resistance parameters such as blood glucose, insulin, c-peptide, hemoglobin A1c
      (HbA1c) Blood lipid profile, liver enzymes (as part of standard medical assessment) Subject
      demographics and medical history will also be recorded.
