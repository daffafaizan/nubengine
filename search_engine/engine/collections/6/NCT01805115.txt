      hysteroscopy can be oral, vaginal, or sublingual. However, it is still unclear which route is
      more effective and less harmful for cervical dilation prior to operative hysteroscopy in
      premenopausal women. Furthermore, there have been no studies comparing among oral,
      sublingual, and vaginal misoprostol, no medication (control) in these women. The objective of
      this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of oral, sublingual, vaginal, and no
      misoprostol prior to operative hysteroscopy in premenopausal women.
