      aesthetically. Traumatic deformities of the head and neck region resulting from burn
      injuries, gun shot wounds, or ablative tumor surgeries may involve the defect of the skin,
      subcutaneous tissue, muscle or the combination of all these elements. In most cases, the
      ideal reconstruction is very difficult to achieve. Sometimes, a major part of face along with
      the ear or the nose may be involved. The extensive scalp loss due to burn or avulsion injury
      is another deforming and psychologically debilitating condition presenting as a major
      reconstructive challenge. An ideal reconstructive procedure should replace the missing
      tissues and restore the motor and sensory function. Traditional reconstructive procedures of
      facial deformities involve skin grafting, local flap applications, tissue expansion, and
      prefabrication as well as free tissue transfers. The primary goal during facial
      reconstruction is restoration of the function and aesthetic appearance. To obtain
      satisfactory results, missing parts should be replaced only by tissues of the same color and
      texture. The purpose of this study is to apply human facial allograft transplant to the
      subjects with severe facial deformities or disfigurements in order to provide adequate
      coverage, aesthetic appearance and functional outcome.
