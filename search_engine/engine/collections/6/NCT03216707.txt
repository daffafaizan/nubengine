      currently the two main methods of non-invasive brain stimulation under investigation.
      Stimulation of the primary motor cortex has been reported to relieve neuropathic,
      musculoskeletal, visceral pain as well as headaches and migraine. Other parameters of
      stimulation have shown encouraging results. For example, stimulation of the secondary
      somatosensory cortex was also reported to relieve chronic visceral pain. However, there are
      numerous unanswered questions regarding these techniques.

      This research project is an attempt to answer some of these questions:

        1. Which pain conditions can be alleviated by non-invasive brain stimulation?

        2. What are the best parameters for stimulation-

             1. method: transcranial direct current stimulation or repetitive transcranial magnetic
                stimulation transcranial or Alternating Current Stimulation

             2. High-Definition transcranial direct current stimulation or conventional
                transcranial direct current stimulation?

             3. which area to stimulate? Primary motor cortex, insula?

        3. Will other forms of treatment such as pharmacotherapy, peripheral nerve stimulation or
           multi-disciplinary pain management enhance the effectiveness of non-invasive brain
           stimulation
