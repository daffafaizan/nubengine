    
      To date, the treatment options are limited for recurrent and tight cephalic arch stenosis in
      patients with brachiocephalic fistulas - Angioplasty, with or without the placement of a
      stent, surgical bypass using the internal jugular vein or a cephalic/brachial venous
      anastomosis, or the creation of a new fistula may be a reasonable option. Angioplasty may be
      associated with technical failure and rupture of the arch vein in reported incidences of 24%
      and 6%, respectively. Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty (PTA) is associated with very low
      primary patency rates of 42% and 23% at 6 and 12 months, whilst bare stents are equally poor,
      with reported patency of 39% and 0% at those same time-point. The use of a biomimetic stent
      (SUPERAÂ®) in the cephalic arch has not been studied to date, but may not only offer
      protection from rupture of the arch vein but may also create a material barrier to prevent
      the development of Neo-Intimal Hyperplasia (NIH). With the additional use of drug elution,
      this may impede NIH effect even more.
