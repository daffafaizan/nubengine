    
      The purpose of this investigation is to test the efficacy of a remote intervention to assist
      Soldiers in meeting standards for body fat and fitness. The intervention will include:

        1. An Internet/Smartphone program for weight management and weight gain prevention
           developed during previous DoD research.

        2. Integrated remote monitoring technology/devices, e.g. smart scales, activity tracking
           devices.

        3. Individualized weight management and exercise recommendations based on data collected
           from web/mobile app/devices to be delivered via web/mobile app/Smartphone; participants
           will not travel to a clinical facility for the intervention.

      The objectives are:

        1. to further develop the H.E.A.L.T.H. intervention by merging components of the
           H.E.A.L.T.H. program, remote monitoring technology components, e.g. activity tracking
           devices, smart scales, and direct/individualized weight management and exercise feedback
           into a single and comprehensive intervention that targets weight and fat loss, improved
           fitness, improved sleep, and personal well-being for Soldiers and their family members.

        2. Compare body weight, body fat, and activity changes associated with participation in the
           H.E.A.L.T.H Intensive intervention for six months and a six-month website only
           phase/follow-up phase, in comparison to participation in a wait-list control group; and

        3. Evaluate blood biomarkers associated with changes in body weight. Evaluate changes in
           gut bacteria associated with body weight.
