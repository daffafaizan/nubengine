    
      This is a, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of RHB-105 in adult subjects
      complaining of epigastric discomfort that have been screened and found to be positive for H.
      pylori infection via 13C Urea Breath Test (UBT) and either fecal antigen test or CLO test.

      Eligible subjects will be randomized in a ratio of 1:2 between placebo arm (n=30) and the
      active arm (RHB-105) (n=60). Subjects will receive study drug for 14 consecutive days.
      Eradication of H. pylori infection will be determined based on 13C UBT conducted between 28
      to 56 days after completion of study drug therapy.

      Subjects will be unblinded upon 13C UBT analysis. This will provide timely active therapy to
      all subjects enrolled in this study. Subjects in the placebo arm will be entitled to receive
      standard-of-care as prescribed by the treating physician following un-blinding.

      Eradication failures (13C UBT-positive) in the active study drug arm will undergo upper
      endoscopy with sampling for culture and sensitivity testing (to rifabutin, amoxicillin,
      clarithromycin, and metronidazole). Culture and sensitivity directed therapy as prescribed by
      the treating physician will be offered to these subjects.
