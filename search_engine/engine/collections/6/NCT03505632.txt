      volume and reopens lung atelectasis during anesthesia and reproduces better oxygenation for
      surgical obese patients .Alveolar recruitment maneuver with PEEP could decreases atelectasis
      and improved oxygenation in obese surgical patients .This concept indicate that the
      maintenance of low PEEP after multiple alveolar recruitment maneuver during anesthesia may
      improve its benefits without complications. Patients will randomly divided by computerized
      randomization sequence method into two groups (30 patients in each study group):

      Both groups receive volume controlled ventilation, tidal volume was 6-8 ml/kg for predicted
      body weight. The PBW calculated according to a formula: 50 + 0.91 × {height (cm)-152.4} for
      men and 45.5 + 0.91 × {height (cm) - 152.4} for women. The respiratory rate was adjusted to
      keep the EtCO2= 35-40 mmHg. The inspiratory to expiratory ratio (I:E ratio) was 1:2 and the
      FiO2 was 0.40.

      Low PEEP+RM group: Patients receive PEEP of 5cmH2O. Recruitment maneuver ( RM) will be done
      by increasing the PEEP in stepwise manner. First PEEP was increased to 10 cmH2O (3
      breaths),then to 15 cm H2O (3 breaths).Finally, PEEP was raised to 20 cmH2O (10 breaths).Then
      decreased for 15cmH2O for (3 breaths),10cmH2O for(3 breaths), and finally returned back to
      original PEEP 5 cmH2O.The total procedure took 2 min. Recruitment will be carried out at the
      following times: post intubation(T1) , after peritoneal insuflation(T2) ,after desuflation
      (T3) and before extubation(T4) . The peak airway pressure should not exceed 40cmH2O.

      High PEEP group: Patients receive throughout ventilation 15 cm H2O PEEP with maintaining the
      peak airway pressure below 40 cm H2O.

      Monitoring :after intubation(T1), post-insufflation(T2), after disinflation (T3) and before
      extubation(T4) for the fillowoing.1--Minute volume ,respiratory rate and tidal volume

      Rescue strategies:

      A) Intraoperative hypoxemia (SpO2≤92%): In both groups ,rescue primarily will be performed by
      an increase in FiO2 by 0.1 till reaching oxygen (100% ) .If failed and hypoxia persist a
      recruitment maneuver will be carried out with stepwise incremental PEEP irrespective of the
      group allocation.

      The time of the event of hypoxia and its management will be recorded.

      B) Intraoperative hypotension (systolic blood pressure <90 mmHg):

        1. Abort any recruitment maneuver in low PEEP+ RM group.

        2. Gradual decrease PEEP by 5 cmH2O in stepwise manner in higher PEEP group.

        3. Give 500 ml bolus colloid and correct fluid status with blood transfusion if indicated.

        4. Noradrenalin infusion as last resort
