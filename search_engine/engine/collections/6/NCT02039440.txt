    
      Japanese Encephalitis (JE) is a potentially devastating mosquito-borne viral disease. The JE
      virus (JEV), a Flavivirus, is endemic to many regions in Asia, and while JE is primarily a
      pediatric disease in the endemic regions, travelers from non-endemic regions to Asia are
      usually na√Øve to the virus and may be at risk for contracting JE at any age.

      The present study aims to investigate antibody titers at approximately 6 years after the
      third dose of JE vaccine (JE-VC), in a cohort of participants from an earlier booster dose
      trial, to strengthen the statistical model of the duration of protection after the booster.
