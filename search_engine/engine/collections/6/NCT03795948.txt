      quality of treatment, the role of the patient's perception of his/her medical care becomes
      essential. Patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) are among the most adequate instruments
      for assessing the patient's perspective on symptom load, functional status, and quality of
      life. After stroke, patients not only suffer from objectively scaled and measurable symptoms
      and impairments but also experience dramatic changes in everyday routine and quality of life.

      In this project, a standardized outcome measurement, including PROMs, for stroke patients is
      used.

      This stoke standard set was developed by the International Consortium for Health Outcomes
      Measurement (ICHOM; www.ICHOM.org); an international, interdisciplinary and
      inter-professional expert group with the contribution of patient representatives, aiming to
      create a comprehensive tool for measuring the most important outcomes and risk factors
      applicable to a broad variety of diseases.

      Main objective of this study is the analysis of quality of life 90 and 360 days after stroke
      and its association with stroke specific risk factors and complications, also measured within
      the scope of the ICHOM tool.

      Furthermore, the process and success of the implementation of the ICHOM stroke standard set
      within the stroke unit of the University Medical Centre Hamburg- Eppendorf (UKE) will be
      studied and evaluated.
