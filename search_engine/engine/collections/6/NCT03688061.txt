      the development of liver cancer, liver failure and liver cirrhosis. Although drug treatments
      are available these are expensive and prolonged. Furthermore patients often only present to
      health care professionals at late stages when liver disease has already progressed.
      Therefore, vaccination remains the optimal method of preventing infection. To date this has
      proved extremely difficult due to the enormous variation in HCV strains around the world.

      Researchers at the University of Oxford in collaboration with industry, have developed novel
      candidate vaccines against HCV ('NSmut'). These vaccines have been inserted into the carrier
      viruses Chimpanzee Adenovirus (ChAd) and modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), both of which
      have excellent safety records. These vaccines have been given to hundreds of healthy
      volunteers and are now being tested for effectiveness.

      In this study we are hoping to increase the immune response against the HCV virus. We will do
      this by inserting a gene in the vaccine (class-II invariant gene). In animal studies, this
      approach has been shown to be safe and to significantly to enhance the immune response
      against HCV.

      During this study 15 healthy adults and 10 volunteers who were previously treated for HCV
      infection, aged 18-65 years, will receive either two intramuscular injections over a period
      of two months. All participants will be followed up for a further 6 months (12 visits in
      total) and will be asked to give a blood sample at each clinic visit.

      The aims of the study are to assess the safety of the vaccine and to see if the vaccine can
      induce a strong immune response against the hepatitis C Virus.
