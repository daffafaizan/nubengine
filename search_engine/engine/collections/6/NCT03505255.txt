      (POI) continues to be one of the most common and expected aspects of abdominal surgery. It
      prolongs hospital stays, increases medical costs and frustrates patients and surgeons.

      Many authors suggest that POI is a mandatory phase of the recovery period for any
      intra-abdominal procedure, and only an ileus lasting greater than 5 days is abnormal - to be
      termed a prolonged POI.

      Under this definition, fully 40% of patients undergoing laparotomy experience prolonged
      postoperative ileus.

      In 2006, different types of postoperative ileus (primary, secondary, recurrent, prolonged)
      were defined through consensus, and prolonged postoperative ileus was defined as absence of
      bowel function after the third postoperative day for laparoscopic surgery and after the fifth
      postoperative day for open abdominal surgery.

      What constitutes prolonged postoperative ileus is debated, with many different definitions
      reported; consequently reported incidences range from 3% to 32%. Neostigmine is a
      cholinesterase-inhibitor, which augments the concentration of acetylcholine (ACh) at the
      neuromuscular junction, thereby increasing contractions in the normal gut.
