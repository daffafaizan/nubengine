aspects of circadian periodic changes inphosphorus metabolism in micekinetic studies on the p32 content ofmouse brain phosphorus fractions followingthe intraperitoneal injection of p32-labeledorthophosphate were performed duringtwo selected segments of the 24-hour time scale.the results of these studies suggestthat the circadian periodicity in relativespecific activity of brain phospholipidsis probably a consequence of a variation in the extentof p32 incorporation into braininorganic phosphate and is not indicativeof a periodicity in the rate of intermediaryphospholipid metabolism.  data on the postinjectiontime course of the specific activitiesof plasma inorganic phosphate, liver inorganic phosphate,and liver phospholipidsuggest a similar explanation forthe circadian periodic changes in relativespecific activity of liver phospholipids.a circadian rhythm of inorganic phosphateconcentration in mouse plasma is demonstrated.consideration of a mathematicalmodel suggests that the observed within-dayvariation in p32 distribution and thecircadian periodicity of phospholipid relativespecific activity in liver and brainare a consequence of this periodicity inplasma phosphate content.  a significantwithin-day variation in total phosphoruscontent of liver was observed.  the disturbanceof mice incident to p32 injectionhas a marked effect on the plasma contentof inorganic phosphate and corticosterone.
