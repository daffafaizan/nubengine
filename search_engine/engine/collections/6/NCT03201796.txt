    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, levofloxacin controlled, parallel group, multicentre,
      international, prospective study. The patients will be enrolled in the study and will be
      randomized to prulifloxacin or levofloxacin. Patient enrolment will be competitive.

      The present study is planned to verify the microbiological and the clinical efficacy of a
      28-day treatment period with prulifloxacin 600 mg in comparison with 28-day treatment period
      with levofloxacin 500 mg, both administered once daily, in patients with CBP. Safety and
      tolerability of a 28-day treatment period with prulifloxacin 600 mg will be also evaluated in
      comparison to levofloxacin 500 mg.

      Levofloxacin 500 mg tablets has been selected as treatment comparator because it represents
      the drug of choice authorised for the treatment of CBP. Consequently, the dosage regimen to
      be administered to the patients is consistent with that reported in the relevant SPC.
