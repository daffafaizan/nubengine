      scheduled for electively lower limb surgery undergoing combined spinal epidural anesthesia
      were randomly divided three group. In each group,a bolus of dexmedetomidine was administered
      intravenously 15 min after spinal anesthesia. The initial dose in group 1, group 2 and group
      3 was started from 0.9 µg/kg,1.0 µg/kg and 1.1 µg/kg, respectively. HR、MAP、SpO2、the
      Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation（OAA/S）scale and the corresponding Narcotrend
      index were recorded at 5-minute intervals until 30 minutes after administration. The
      relationship between OAA/S scale and Narcotrend index was analyzed by a Spearman analysis.
      The cutoff values of Narcotrend index for OAA/S≤2 were obtained by analysis of receiver
      operating characteristic curves(ROC).
