      NHL entities. No potentially curative therapy has been established yet as even more intensive
      therapies including high-dose chemotherapy plus autologous SCT show only moderate improvement
      of the prognosis of MCL. Allogenic SCT seems to have an immunological mechanism of action in
      NHL, which is commonly known as Graft-versus-Lymphoma effect. This trialÂ´s purpose is to
      improve the overall survival in patients younger than 55 years with primary MCL by
      sequentially combining autologous SCT and allogenic SCT after the application of 6 courses of
      immunochemotherapy and high-dose chemotherapy.
