      Tolerance Test) with an oral U-C13 glycerol tracer will be paired with nuclear magnetic
      resonance spectroscopy (NMR) isotopomer analysis of serum samples to describe flux through
      the hepatic pentose phosphate pathway, TCA cycle and FAS pathways in girls with PCOS
      receiving lifestyle only, metformin or oral contraceptive treatment, and obese girls with
      regular menses receiving lifestyle therapy. Hepatic steatosis will be measured with MRI.

      Please note that 3 study groups: PCOS on metformin, PCOS on oral contraceptive treatment, and
      obese girls with regular menses were not funded in the study, so no participants were
      enrolled in these 3 arms of the study.
