      lung fibrosis which results in impaired gas exchange. It is common for people with EIA to be
      prescribed ambulatory oxygen, in order to normalize oxyhaemoglobin saturation, improve oxygen
      delivery to the tissues and relieve breathlessness during daily activities.

      Ambulatory oxygen is traditionally delivered via a refillable portable oxygen cylinder
      containing compressed gaseous oxygen. More recently, portable oxygen concentrators (POCs)
      have emerged as a solution to the problem of finite cylinder life and to improve portability.
      Because a concentrator is constantly extracting oxygen from air, oxygen supply can continue
      as long as the battery is charged. This is typically around eight hours, but POCs can be
      recharged from an AC or DC power source. Portable oxygen concentrators usually weigh around
      3.5kg, which is significantly lighter than oxygen cylinders, and are much easier to maneuver.
      However, there are some theoretical disadvantages to POCs. Like all concentrators, they do
      not deliver 100% oxygen. Concentrations typically range from 85-95%, depending on the flow
      rate. Differences in pulse timing and peak pulse flow between POCs may affect the fraction of
      inspired oxygen (FiO2) that is delivered. However, the clinical implications of these
      differences have not been documented.

      The aim of this study is to compare the effects of ambulatory oxygen delivered during
      exercise using the EverGo POC to ambulatory oxygen delivered with a standard portable
      cylinder in individuals with ILD. We hypothesise that oxyhaemoglobin saturation during
      exercise will be significantly higher when using a portable cylinder, but this difference
      will not be clinically important.
