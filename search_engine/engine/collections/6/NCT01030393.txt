    
      Background :

      Human chorionic gonadotrophin ( hCG) was found to secreted immediately after fertilization by
      the embryo. It plays an important role in implantation and in attracting regulatory T cells
      to the endometrium.

      Rational :

      Intrauterine injection of hCG before embryo transfer in IVF/ICSI may increase endometrial
      regulatory T cells ( Treg ) and improve the implantation and pregnancy rates.

      Aim of the work :

      To study the effect of intrauterine injection of hCG before embryo transfer on the
      implantation and pregnancy rates after IVF/ICSI.

      Subjects :

      Infertile patients undergoing ICSI.

      Inclusion criteria :

        -  Female age less than 40 years

        -  Male factor infertility

        -  Normal female hormonal profile and uterine cavity

      Exclusion criteria :

        -  Previous ICSI failure

        -  Azoospermia

        -  Endometriosis

      Study group: Intrauterine injection of 100 iu of hCG (group 1)or 200 iu of hCG ( group 2)
      will be done during the dummy embryo transfer which is done 10-15 minutes before the actual
      embryo transfer.

      Control group: The embryo transfer will be done without prior intrauterine injection of hCG

      Main outcome measures :

      Implantation and pregnancy rates

      Secondary outcome measures :

      miscarriage and delivery rates
