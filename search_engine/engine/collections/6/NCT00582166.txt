      receiving this regimen, along with the rate of complete response at 6 months, toxicities
      associated with this regimen, and laboratory correlates. Subjects will receive the
      Ibritumomab Tiuxetan (Zevalin) therapeutic regimen; then rituximab consolidation and
      maintenance therapy every 3 months until disease progression.
