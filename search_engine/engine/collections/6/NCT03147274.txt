    
      The objective of this 12-month pilot randomized controlled trial is to evaluate the impact of
      a 3-session group educational curriculum, compared to standard care, on self-care adherence
      and transition readiness in adolescents with type 1 diabetes in the Boston Children's
      Hospital (BCH) Diabetes Program. Adolescents (15-18 years) with T1D will be randomized to
      receive a 3-session group curriculum ("SMART T1D" - Self-Management, Adherence and Readiness
      for Transition in T1D) in addition to usual care (intervention group) or to receive usual
      care with individual diabetes visits (control group) and electronic newsletters to match for
      attention.
