      plication with a single gastro-ileal anastomosis in the same manner of single anastomosis
      sleeve ileal bypass on weight loss and postoperative complications. The objective of this
      combined procedure is to reduce the high intraluminal pressure that results after
      laparoscopic greater curvature plication owing to reduced intraluminal space which can lead
      to suture line leakage, vomiting, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Another objective is
      to add a malabsorptive element to the restrictive effect of laparoscopic greater curvature
      plication and to induce early satiety in patients by distention of the distal bowel with
      nutrients immediately after meals, similar to the way that single anastomosis sleeve ileal
      bypass works.
