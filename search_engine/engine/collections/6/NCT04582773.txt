    
      A prospective observational study in inpatient care within community-based management of
      acute malnutrition(CMAM) program run by the nongovernmental organization called Alliance for
      International Medical Action (ALIMA) within the University of Maiduguri Teaching Hospital,
      Maiduguri, Nigeria

      The objectives of the study are to validate the BedsidePEWS scores as a measure of severity
      of illness in children who are treated as inpatients for severe acute malnutrition and to
      compare the BedsidePEWS scores with other risk factors associated for mortality and relapse
      of children with severe acute malnutrition. The design is a prospective observational study
      of 1000 children admitted as inpatients in a CMAM program in Maidaguri Teaching Hospital in
      Maidaguri, Nigeria. Data collection (estimated duration 4-5 months) involves vital signs, and
      risk factor assessment every 12 hours for duration of hospitalization. Blood test for
      hemoglobin and malaria will be done once upon admission. Outcomes will be measured every 12
      hours and include mortality and/or escalation and de-escalation of care. Logistic regression
      with significance testing will be used to compare BedsidePEWS scores and risk factors between
      patients and among individual patients within the outcome categories. Exploratory sensitivity
      analyses will repeat the main logistic regression analyses to evaluate the performance of
      partial BedsidePEWS score in patients with missing data of 1-3 of the 7 components, by
      randomly removing 1-3 data elements from the score calculation from patients, and by removing
      systolic blood pressure from scoring.
