      clinical acceptance of this technique, the investigators will need to study and then
      demonstrate applicability to all patients regardless of race or gender. This will require the
      recruitment of a control population of patients who have been demonstrated at surgery to be
      easy to intubate. Such patients are in relative abundance. The experimental group will
      consist of patients who are found at surgery to be difficult to intubate. In addition, a
      prospective cohort will be recruited without prior knowledge of ease or difficulty of
      intubation, and subsequent ground truth determined at surgery. Patients are defined as easy
      to intubate if their anesthetic record described a single attempt with a Macintosh 3 blade
      resulting in a grade 1 laryngoscopic view (full exposure of the vocal cords). Difficult
      intubation was defined by at least one of: more than one attempt by an operator with at least
      one year of anesthesia experience, grade 3 or 4 laryngoscopic view on a 4 point scale, 5 need
      for a second operator, or non-elective use of an alternative airway device such as a bougie,
      fiberoptic bronchoscope or intubating laryngeal mask airway.

      The primary purpose of the study is to develop algorithms capable of discriminating patients
      who are likely to be difficult to intubate from those who are likely to be easy to intubate
      based on facial appearance. The primary analysis is the demonstration of statistical
      significance in the ability of the derived algorithms to determine successfully whether a
      subject was easy or difficult to intubate. A secondary analysis is the demonstration of a
      statistical difference in performance between the derived algorithms versus conventional
      airway assessment tests.
