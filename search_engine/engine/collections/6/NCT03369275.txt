      intensive care unit (ICU). It is characterized by cardiovascular collapse, failure of organs
      and is common with severe repercussions including a mortality of 20-40%. Survivors suffer
      long-term impairment in function and reduced quality of life (QOL). Despite decades of
      research examining different immune therapies, none has proven successful and supportive care
      remains the mainstay of therapy, at a cost of approximately 4-billion dollars in Canada
      annually. MSCs represent a potentially novel treatment for sepsis because in animal models,
      MSCs have been shown to modulate the immune system, increase pathogen clearance, restore
      organ function, and reduce death.

      The Phase II multi-centre Cellular Immunotherapy for Septic Shock RCT (CISS2) will continue
      to evaluate safety, assess if there are signals for clinical efficacy and determine
      mechanisms of action and biological effects of MSCs in septic shock. To answer these aims,
      CISS2 will randomize 114 patients who are admitted to the ICU with septic shock to 300
      million cryopreserved, allogeneic, bone marrow derived MSCs or placebo across 10 Canadian
      centres over approximately 2 years.
