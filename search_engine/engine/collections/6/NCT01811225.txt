      levels of exogenous progesterone with a consistent dose of exogenous estrogen. Participants
      will complete data collection procedures including providing saliva (cortisol to measure
      stress), urine (cotinine and 3-Hydroxycotinine to measure nicotine exposure), and blood
      (progesterone, allopregnanolone, and estradiol) samples, as well as ecological momentary
      assessments (EMA) daily for seven-days. Participants will also complete a 3-hour smoking
      topography lab session after overnight abstinence and a 4.5-hour nicotine nasal spray lab
      session after a 14-hour abstinence. These sessions will contain a nicotine challenge via
      smoking a cigarette or nasal spray with timed-series physiological, subjective, and
      behavioral responses.
