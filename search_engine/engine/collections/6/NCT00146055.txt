      with allogeneic bone marrow or stem cell transplantation from an unrelated donor is a current
      treatment approach. Chemotherapeutic drugs and radiation are given in higher doses to
      increase their effectiveness. High-dose chemotherapy and radiation therapy generally affect
      cells that are dividing. They are used to treat cancer because cancer cells divide more often
      than most other cells. High-dose treatment severely damages the patient's bone marrow so that
      the patient no longer is able to produce needed blood cells. Peripheral stem cell
      transplantation allows stem cells that were damaged by treatment to be replaced with healthy
      stem cells that can produce the blood cells the patient needs. Patients experience a number
      of complications after transplantation. Some are temporary and relatively minor; yet others
      can be life threatening. Many doctors consider high-dose chemotherapy, by itself or with
      radiation, and bone marrow or stem cell transplantation as the best available treatment
      option for diseases under specific circumstances. However, this study will explore whether a
      less-intensive preparative therapy before the peripheral stem cell transplantation will prove
      to be safer, have less side effects, and be an effective treatment for certain diseases.
