      intravenously administered MEDI-545 compared with placebo, over a dose escalation range of
      0.3-30 mg/kg, in adult patients who have SLE and who are receiving 20 mg/day or less of
      prednisone orally or an equivalent dose of another oral corticosteroid.

      The secondary objective of this study is to describe the pharmacokinetics and potential
      immunogenicity of MEDI-545.
