      normotension, as well as increased risk of progression to sustained hypertension. The
      recommended treatment for prehypertension is lifestyle modification, including weight loss,
      adoption of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, reduction of dietary
      sodium, physical activity, and moderation of alcohol intake. The proposed pilot study will
      test the effect of a 4 session telephone-based lifestyle intervention on blood pressure
      change in 125 prehypertensive participants. The intervention includes education and
      behavioral counseling strategies that have been shown to be effective in promoting behavior
      change and reducing blood pressure among hypertensives.

      Following baseline assessment, participants will be randomized to the intervention or usual
      care, and will complete follow-up assessments at 6 weeks and 3 months post-randomization. The
      primary aim of the study is to examine the effect of the intervention on blood pressure at 3
      months. Secondary aims include examining intervention effects on lifestyle behavior changes
      at 6 weeks and 3 months. This study will provide pilot and feasibility data for a future
      application to study effects of the intervention on risk factor modification, blood pressure
      reduction, and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. If successful, this brief,
      cost-effective intervention could easily be incorporated into routine care, and could have a
      significant impact on the management of prehypertension.
