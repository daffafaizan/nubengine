      years with persistent or uncontrolled asthma from 26 Bronx schools. Schools will be randomly
      assigned to either (1) the Asthma-PASS intervention or an asthma management (AM) comparison
      group. Both groups will participate in an existing classroom-based daily activity program.
      Enrollment will occur over 4 consecutive school years with 6-8 schools joining the study each
      year. The investigators will assess the effectiveness of Asthma-PASS in reducing asthma
      morbidity, and improving PA as well as additional clinical and functional outcomes. The
      investigators will also identify potential mediators and moderators of the intervention
      effect. They will evaluate the process of intervention implementation by applying the RE-AIM
      framework.
