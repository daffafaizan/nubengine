    
      Community-based, stratified (by location) randomized clinical trial (RCT) to determine the
      relative efficacy of topically applied fluoride varnish (FV) applications alone vs FV with
      fluoride-releasing glass ionomer (GI) sealants on occlusal surfaces of primary molars in
      reducing the caries incidence and increment in 3-6 year old children. A parallel groups
      design RCT stratified by study site (one dental and one non-dental location) will be
      conducted among 596 initially 2.5- to 3-year-old children. Those eligible will be randomized
      to one of 2 groups (FV or GIS+FV) and followed for 36 months. The RCT will take place at two
      sites serving primarily underserved, minority and low-income populations in Southern
      California: 1) the dental facility of the San Ysidro Health Center (SYHC) located near the
      U.S.-Mexican Border serves mainly Latino immigrants, and 2) the Comprehensive Health Center -
      Ocean View (CHC-OV), in a non-dental setting in close proximity to its dental clinic, which
      serves Latinos and African Americans. Both sites are part of a consortium of community
      clinics (SYHC Inc) and are located 15 miles apart from each other.

      Annual study dental examinations will be performed by trained, calibrated, study dentists to
      determine caries (precavitated and cavitated) incidence and increment. Children identified as
      needing dental care will be referred for appropriate treatment.
