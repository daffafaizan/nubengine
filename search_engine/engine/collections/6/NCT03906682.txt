      poses risk for emotional, behavioral, and academic problems. This study will evaluate the
      impact of RAP Club, a trauma-informed school-based prevention program intended to promote
      positive emotional and academic development for eighth graders. Participants will be randomly
      assigned within schools to receive RAP Club or Healthy Topics, a health education active
      control condition.

      The study will achieve the following specific aims:

        1. Test whether students randomized to RAP Club have improved academic, social-emotional,
           and behavioral outcomes as compared to those randomized to Healthy Topics (e.g.,
           student-reported mood and stress; teacher-rated academic performance; academic record
           data).

        2. Explore potential moderators (e.g., baseline trauma exposure, emotional regulation) and
           mediators (e.g., changes in self-regulation and emotional symptoms) of RAP Club's
           effects.

        3. Evaluate factors related to program implementation, including cost of delivering RAP
           Club versus Healthy Topics and perceptions of key stakeholders (teachers, group
           facilitators, students) regarding intervention acceptability and sustainability.
