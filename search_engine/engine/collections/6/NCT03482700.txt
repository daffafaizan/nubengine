      compared to general practitioners for patients with COPD in East Birmingham. It will be run
      from the Heart of England NHS Foundation Trust, which will provide the specialist input and
      oversight, and up to 40 practices across the Eastern Birmingham Health Organisation with
      approximately 2200 patients with COPD confirmed by their current medical practitioner. Each
      practice will be randomised to either the intervention or control group. The intervention
      group will have their usual annual COPD review performed by a specialist respiratory doctor
      at baseline and 12 months. The patients will receive care using our local COPD guidance which
      has been accepted by all local commissioning groups and secondary care organisations.
      Treatment will be at the discretion of the clinician and is not specified in the trial
      protocol. The investigators anticipate that the treatment recommendations in the intervention
      arm may include referral to pulmonary rehabilitation and reduction in the use of inhaled
      corticosteroids, which are prescribed at high rates in our locality. The control group will
      be seen by the usual staff at their practice. These patients will not be seen by the trial
      team and their data will be extracted remotely using electronic systems.

      The primary outcome will be to compare the rates of provision of guideline-based care in
      intervention and control practices. Secondary outcomes will include: referral to secondary
      care, unscheduled healthcare consultations (ED attendance, hospital admissions), COPD
      exacerbations, healthcare costs, medications prescribed, biochemical markers of disease,
      radiological investigations, lung function tests measured when clinically indicated, and
      death within 12 month follow-up period.
