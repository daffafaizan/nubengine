    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of portal vein stenting in patients with portal vein
      (PV) stenosis and gastrointestinal malignancies, including quality of life measurements.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Stent patency and duration of clinical success related to the intervention. II. Compare
      the efficacy of portal vein stenting on liver volumes, nutritional status, and laboratory
      values relative to patients with portal vein stenosis/thrombosis who do not undergo portal
      vein stenting.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts.

      COHORT A: Patients complete a quality of life (QoL) questionnaire at 2-4 weeks and then 6-8
      weeks after portal vein stenting procedure. Patients' medical records are also reviewed.

      COHORT B: Patients' medical records are reviewed retrospectively.
