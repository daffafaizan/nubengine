      Opioid pain medications are a mainstay of postoperative pain management. However, these have
      several adverse effects.

      Multimodal pain regimens to minimize opioid use have become central to enhanced recovery
      after surgery (ERAS) protocols. The transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block is one
      intervention that contributes to this regimen. Traditionally, TAP blocks are performed with
      local anesthetics such as bupivacaine. More recently, these have also been performed with
      liposomal bupivacaine, whose duration of action is much greater than regular bupivacaine (96
      hours versus 8-9 hours, respectively).

      In this study, postoperative opioid usage will be compared between patients receiving regular
      bupivacaine and liposomal bupivacaine.
