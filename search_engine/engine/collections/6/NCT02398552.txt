    
      Sunitinib given at 50 mg/day on schedule 4/2 (4 weeks on treatment, 2 weeks off) is the
      standard care for first-line treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma, but the schedule
      was reported with a high rate of dose reduction and dose discontinuation because of the
      safety profile. Sunitinib 50mg/day on schedule 2/1 (2 weeks on treatment, 1 weeks off) was
      reported to be associated with significantly decrease toxicities in patients who initially
      experienced grade 3 or greater toxicity on the schedule 4/2 and could extend treatment
      duration considerably. Through this research, we would like to explore whether the schedule
      2/1 of sunitinib 50 mg/day as first line therapy could provide the same efficacy as standard
      schedule 4/2 in terms of progression-free survival, objective response, and overall survival,
      while reducing drug-related toxicity in metastatic renal cell carcinoma patients.
