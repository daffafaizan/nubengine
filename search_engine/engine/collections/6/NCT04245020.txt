    
      This is a non-blinded, single centre open randomised control trial of the outpatient follow
      up method following surgical admission to Connolly Hospital Blanchardstown.

      All eligible patients will be randomised into three arms, text message, telephone or
      in-person follow up. The follow up will be carried out at 6-8 weeks following discharge. The
      rate of complications, the non-response rate and the level of satisfaction will be compared
      between the three groups.

      Willingness to use a telemedicine app in the future in place of an in-person follow up will
      also be measured by patient satisfaction questionnaire.
