      Autopsy studies suggest the amount and location of fibrillar amyloid deposition does not
      relate strongly to the degree and type of clinical impairment, compared to tau pathology and
      neuronal loss. A substantial percentage of individuals known to be cognitively intact prior
      to death demonstrate significant amyloid pathology at autopsy. PIB-PET studies of older
      normal individuals have also demonstrated significant amyloid deposition in substantial
      percentages.

      This study will test the hypothesis that amyloid is associated with synaptic dysfunction and
      neuronal damage. While some individuals are able to compensate for amyloid-related toxicity
      for an extended time period, sensitive imaging and neuropsychological markers will reveal
      that normal subjects with evidence of high amyloid burden do demonstrate evidence of
      abnormality consistent with prodromal AD.

      The study will use a combination of functional, structural, and cognitive measures to detect
      early effects of amyloid deposition, and will utilize PIB retention in order to characterize
      the relationship of amyloid to neuropsychological and imaging markers of prodromal AD. The
      relationship of PIB retention to genetic, plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers
      will be explored. These preliminary data will be used to determine whether asymptomatic older
      individuals with high amyloid burden will subsequently manifest cognitive impairment and
      eventually progress to clinical AD. When completed, this project will either provide evidence
      that the presence of amyloid deposition is a useful biomarker for incipient AD or raise the
      possibility that amyloid deposition examined in isolation is insufficient to predict early
      symptoms and progression of AD.
