    
      Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic systemic inflammatory disease that is associated with
      significant morbidity and mortality. The disease is characterized by inflammation of synovial
      joints that can result in pain, swelling and joint damage with secondary deformity and
      progressive disability and impairment of patient's health related quality of life. It is
      estimated that about 1% of the population worldwide has RA.

      Treatment for RA includes use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs),
      cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) selective inhibitors, corticosteroids and DMARDs. The effectiveness
      and toxicities associated with use of DMARDs differs based on the individual agent; DMARDs
      are often partially effective. For those in whom DMARDs have not fully treated RA, TNF
      inhibitors are often prescribed.

      TNFα plays an important role in RA. Activities ascribed to TNFα in RA include recruitment and
      activation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs), cellular proliferation, increased
      prostaglandin and matrix-degrading protease activity, and bone and cartilage resorption.

      CIMZIA (certolizumab pegol) in combination with methotrexate (MTX) is indicated for:

      • reducing signs and symptoms, inducing major clinical response, and reducing the progression
      of joint damage as assessed by X-ray, in adult patients with moderately to severely active
      rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
