      The current phase II clinical study investigates the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic
      and pharmacodynamic profiles of the drug candidate in patients who have suffered lobar
      hemorrhages. The initial phase of the study is also aimed at determining the optimal dosing
      regimens for subsequent drug candidate efficacy trials. The trial is also evaluating the
      appearance of new cerebral hemorrhages on gradient-echo MRI scans, the amyloid ß (Aß) protein
      levels in the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid and the neurological and cognitive functions.
