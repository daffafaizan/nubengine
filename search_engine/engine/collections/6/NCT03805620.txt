      greater than either physical or cognitive training alone. Nevertheless, this synergistic
      effect has been demonstrated mainly in cognitively intact older adults. Studies examining the
      effects of combined physical-cognitive training in older adults with MCI are scarce and show
      mixed results. Moreover, few studies have determined the effects of the combined training on
      peripheral brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and mitochondrial function. Thus, the
      present study aims to investigate the effects of combined physical-cognitive training on
      cognitive function as well as peripheral BDNF level and mitochondrial function of individuals
      with MCI. The present study will provide insight into the interplay among the training
      program, peripheral BDNF concentration, mitochondrial function, and cognitive function.
      Importantly, the findings will have clinical implication regarding the training program that
      is feasible and effective in improving cognitive function of older adults with MCI which
      ultimately will have great impact on public health as this population is at high risk of
      progression to AD.
