      sling provides backstop for excessive "swing motion" of distal urethra and helps with
      urethral compression along its luminal axis.

      Aim 1: Investigate the effect of mid-urethral sling on the urethral shape at rest and maximum
      Valsalva, in other words dynamic urethral shape.

      Aim 2: Compare the effect of mid-urethral sling on urethral dynamic shape in women with
      successful surgical outcome (absence of stress urinary incontinence at 3 and 12 months after
      the surgery) and women with surgical failure (presence of stress urinary incontinence at 3
      and 12 months after the surgery).
