      ethnicity, geographic location, ancestry, and nationality, in science and medicine is a topic
      of heated debate. The discussion is significant not only for defining rigorous scientific
      study designs, but for influencing how scientists and the broader society conceptualize,
      discuss, and react to human difference. Misuse of population descriptors in genetic and
      genomic research has the potential to perpetuate misinformation, stigmatize certain groups
      and simplify the complex relationships between individual identity, genetics, and health.
      With such potential harms in mind, National Institutes of Health guidelines to use the Office
      of Management and Budget categories of race and ethnicity to monitor inclusion in clinical
      trials and evaluate potential differences in the safety and efficacy of interventions have
      been questioned. As increasing attention is given to the implications of human genetic
      variation on disease and health, actively engaging with scientists may help to identify a
      lexicon for discussing human genetic variation that is scientifically sound and socially and
      politically meaningful. We aim to conduct a pilot qualitative study of genetic researchers,
      exploring their use of population descriptors in human genetic research, including an
      experiment in which they have the opportunity to describe and group their study populations
      in a new way. We use qualitative methods to capture researchers' opinions and practices as
      they think critically about the use of population labels in their studies. Understanding
      individual scientists opinions about the strengths and weaknesses of different
      classifications in various contexts will provide important data to help define and facilitate
      appropriate use of population descriptors in human genetic research.
