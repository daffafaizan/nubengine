      cancer. Pneumothorax (PTX) is the most frequent complication of CT-guided percutaneous lung
      biopsy, with a reported incidence of 9 to 40% and a cumulative average incidence of about
      20%. Most of these are managed conservatively and about 7 to 21% will require placement of a
      chest tube. Several techniques have been used in the past to prevent the development of PTX
      by sealing the needle tract with various materials (autologous blood, saline, hydrogel,
      collagen plugs), but literature has shown them to be unreliable, clumsy or costly.

      The use of Gelfoam slurry for embolizing the needle tract following biopsy has been
      identified in a retrospective study as a possible intervention to reduce the occurrence of
      pneumothorax and/or chest tube placement. Gelfoam (Pfizer, New York, NY, USA) is a gelatin
      sponge made from bovine corium, which can absorb fluids 40 times its weight and can enlarge
      by 200% in size. This property allows the material to effectively plug the biopsy track by
      volumetric expansion, which prevents passage of air from the lung into the pleural cavity and
      creation of a pneumothorax. Gelfoam is cheap, is readily available both as a sponge and
      powder and can be easily made into a slurry by mixing with saline. The slurry is semisolid in
      consistency and can be easily injected through the biopsy cannula into the needle track.

      In the experimental group, as the biopsy cannula is withdrawn, Gelfoam will be injected
      carefully, lacing the needle track. In both groups, immediate post-procedure CT scans and
      subsequent follow up X-rays 1 and 2 hours post-procedure will be used to monitor for
      pneumothorax.
