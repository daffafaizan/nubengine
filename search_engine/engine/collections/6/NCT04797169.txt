    
      A total of 600 subjects will be enrolled in a randomized-controlled trial comparing the Noom
      app (Noom Health) to a digital control (Noom Digital Health) with 6 months of intervention
      and 6 months active maintenance in both groups. Measures will include demographics,
      psychosocial measures, height/weight, waist circumference, weight loss history/practices,
      health care practices/utilization, and quality of life.

      Participants will complete informed consent and interviews via a HIPAA-compliant
      videoconference (Zoom) and other questionnaires via a REDCap interface. All participants will
      complete screening/baseline procedures to determine eligibility and initial information.
      Subsequently, they will be randomized to one of the groups for a 6-month intervention and 6-
      month maintenance period (12 months total).

      In Noom Health, participants will be encouraged to use the app multiple times per day to log
      eating episodes, physical activity and weight. Coaches will also interact with participants
      directly through the app. In Noom Digital Health, participants will use a simplified version
      to log eating episodes and weight. Both conditions will receive the same weight loss advice
      content.

      During the intervention, participants will complete monthly satisfaction surveys.
      Additionally, follow-up measures will be conducted at 7 time points (Screening/Baseline, 1
      month, 4 months, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months, and 30 months).
