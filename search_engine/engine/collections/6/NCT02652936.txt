      healthy male subjects. Part 1 will consist of Groups 1 to 6, each comprising 8 subjects
      (total of 48 subjects). There will be an option to enrol 2 additional groups (8 subjects in
      each of Groups 7 and 8) to assess alternative dose levels. Subjects will be randomised to
      receive active or placebo in the fasted state.

      Part 2 is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised, multiple ascending dose design in
      up to 45 healthy male subjects. Part 2 will consist of Groups 9 to 11, each comprising 9
      subjects (total of 27 subjects). There will be an option to enrol 2 additional groups (9
      subjects in each of Groups 12 and 13) to assess alternative multiple dose levels. Part 2 will
      not commence before completion of Groups 1 to 3 in Part 1. Subjects will be randomised to
      receive active or placebo in the fasted state. The planned dosing regimen is once per day
      however, this may be modified to twice per day depending on emerging pharmacokinetic data
      from Part 1.
