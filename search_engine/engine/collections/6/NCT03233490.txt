      some classes were randomized to various additional interventions; web-course, visits of elite
      athletes, practical test, reflection and AED training. All CPR education was performed in
      accordance with the ERC guidelines of 2010. Training was given to the entire class together.
      The classes consisted of 14-29 students. All participants in all intervention groups used an
      individual training manikin, MiniAnne, during the training. The schools were allowed to keep
      the training manikins after the end of study. Ten teachers were previous CPR instructors and
      another 19 teachers received a five hours education to become CPR instructor. All teachers
      obtained individual oral and written instructions about each class randomized intervention
      method and written bullet points about how the course would be implemented, to ensure that
      they were up to date with present guidelines and training. The teachers acted as
      facilitators; they introduced the lesson, gave advice on the fly, answered questions and
      completed the course.
