      immunogenicity of SA-LAIV is non-inferior to that of HCWA-LAIV, as well as evaluating the
      feasibility of utilizing group administration for SA-LAIV. Subjects will be enrolled into one
      of two major treatment arms: HCWA-LAIV (Estimated N = 550) and SA-LAIV (Estimated N = 550).
      Enrollment into each major treatment arm will be stratified by study site. Enrollment in the
      HCWA-LAIV and SA-LAIV treatment arms may occur concurrently at each site. Subjects enrolling
      in the study will be randomized to HCWA or SA, and within the SA arm to either individual
      self-administration, or group administration. Specifically, following self-administration of
      LAIV to 190 individual subjects, 180 subjects will be vaccinated in 36 groups of 5 and 180
      subjects will be vaccinated in 18 groups of 10. All vaccinations in the SA-LAIV arm will be
      given under the direction and supervision of a research staff member who is trained to
      administer LAIV vaccines. Following immunization all subjects will return for one visit at
      approximately 28 (Â± 7) days for follow-up.
