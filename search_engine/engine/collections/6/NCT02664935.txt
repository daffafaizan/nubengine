      positive for at least one of the actionable targets included in the trial. Patients who are
      positive for just one putative biomarker will receive the experimental targeted drug specific
      for that putative biomarker. Putative biomarkers within each drug cohort have been chosen
      such that in the majority of cases it is not expected that patients will be positive for two
      or more putative biomarkers within the same drug. In the rare situation that patients are
      positive for two or more putative biomarkers relevant across different drugs, treatment will
      be allocated in accordance with the following strategy:

        -  All amplifications and rearrangements will be treated with targeted agent appropriate to
           them irrespective of concomitant mutations. This will yield crucial predictive biomarker
           information.

        -  For concomitant mutations decisions will be made by the Chief Investigator on a
           case-by-case basis and based on close consideration of pathway preference and likely
           dominance of one signal pathway over another together with any pre-clinical efficacy
           studies that address the activity of the drugs in the presence of concomitant mutations.
           A trumping strategy has been devised for this purpose.
