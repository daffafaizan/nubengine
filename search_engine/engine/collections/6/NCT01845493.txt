      phase II enzymes in nasal epithelial cells of allergic asthmatics. Subjects will receive both
      a SFN-rich broccosprout homogenate preparation and an alfalfa sprout homogenate (placebo) in
      a crossover fashion. mRNA levels of NRF2 and NRF2-dependent phase II enzymes will be compared
      between the active and placebo periods.
