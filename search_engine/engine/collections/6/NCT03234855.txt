      a recommendation stating that:

      "Surgeons should measure and document the size of the hernia defect they are repairing. The
      total area encompassing all the defects should be measured, and surgeons should be familiar
      with internal and external measurement techniques for all hernia locations, as well as how to
      avoid common measurement errors."

      An incorrect mesh size can have detrimental consequences to the effectiveness of the mesh.
      According to the SAGES recommendation:

      "Overestimating the defect size will result in the choice of a larger prosthetic size, which
      may be more difficult to handle and may have more laxity, allowing it to bulge into the
      defect more than if it was placed taut. The difficulty in prosthetic handling may also lead
      to errors in fixation, and the prosthetic can more easily sway between fixation points, due
      to the larger dimensions."

      While a smaller mesh size can also be problematic:

      "Underestimating the defect size may lead to choosing a prosthetic that is too small, thus
      increasing the risk of hernia recurrence." In order to aid surgeons in more accurately
      measuring hernia defects, Boehringer Labs LLC has developed a laparoscopic surgical measuring
      device. This study aims to obtain feedback from surgeons on the usefulness and design of the
      device.
