      at 1-month interval until eradication of esophageal varices. Patients start propranolol
      (start with 30 mg daily) at 6th day after control of acute bleeding till eradication of
      esophageal varices, aiming at decreasing pulse rate to 25% or to 55 bpm while systolic
      pressure is above 85 mmHg. Patients randomized to propranolol group continue propranolol
      after eradication of esophageal varices. Patients randomized to banding ligation group
      discontinue propranolol after eradication of esophageal varices. Patients are followed to
      evaluate the incidence of rebleeding, adverse effects and survival.
