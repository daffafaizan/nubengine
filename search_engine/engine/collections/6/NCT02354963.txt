    
      Controlled, randomized, assessor-blind clinical trial.

      Thirty-six patients of La Fe University Hospital (Valencia), previously confirmed as poor
      responders according to the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE)
      criteria, will be randomized to two treatment arms:

        -  Arm 1 (control): no intervention.

        -  Arm 2 (intervention): ovarian cortex extraction by unilateral laparoscopic biopsy and
           ovarian tissue fragmentation in aliquots of 1 mm2. These fragments will be grafted under
           the ovarian cortex and meso-ovarium ipsilateraly.

      Subsequently the number of antral follicles in both intervention groups will be compared and
      also will be the number of antral follicles in the native ovary and the grafted one in each
      of the patients.

      Patients will receive a standard IVF treatment for poor responders according to the protocols
      of the assisted reproduction unit of La Fe University Hospital.

      The final aim is to assess the pregnancy rate in both groups, as well as parameters related
      to the reproduction technique when required.
