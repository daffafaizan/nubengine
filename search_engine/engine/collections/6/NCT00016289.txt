      I. Determine the response rate and progression-free interval in patients with peritoneal
      carcinomatosis associated with ovarian epithelial cancer or primary peritoneal carcinoma
      treated with intraperitoneal interleukin-12.

      II. Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxicity and reversibility of toxicity of this
      regimen in these patients.

      III. Determine peritoneal cavity tumor cell responses, in terms of negative cytology,
      conversion of aneuploidy to diploidy, and apoptosis as evidence of therapeutic effect, in
      patients treated with this regimen.

      IV. Assess quality of life in patients treated with this regimen. V. Determine the
      pharmacology and pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.

      VI. Determine whether this regimen facilitates adaptive or innate immunity in vivo or serum
      antibody responses to tumor-associated antigens in these patients.

      VII. Determine whether this regimen decreases expression of vascular endothelial growth
      factor, fibroblast growth factor 2, and interleukin-8 as surrogate markers of angiogenesis
      and whether a decrease in marker expression is associated with clinical activity of this drug
      in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive interleukin-12 intraperitoneally once weekly. Treatment repeats every 4
      weeks for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients
      with stable or responding disease receive 2 additional courses. Quality of life is assessed
      at baseline; prior to weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16 of treatment; when patients are informed of
      their disease response; and then 2 weeks later. Patients are followed every 2 months for 1
      year and then every 3 months for 1 year.
