    
      Capecitabine is a common anti cancer drug. One of the most common side effects is a syndrome
      called hand and foot syndrome which comprises of hands and feet redness, swelling, dryness
      and painful sores. Quite often the drug dose is reduced to suboptimal level due to this side
      effect. There is no way to prevent or an effective way to treat this side effect. Our aim is
      to investigate whether wearing socks which contain copper fibers may prevent or alleviate the
      patient symptoms.

      The patients will use socks containing copper-oxide impregnated fibers which are sold in the
      Pharma stores without physician's prescription.(EPA numbers 8454-2, 8454-3 from April 30
      2009).

      Drug Toxicity and skin reaction will be documented.
