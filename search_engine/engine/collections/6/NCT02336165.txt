    
      Eligible subjects are enrolled in parallel into one of the following 5 cohorts as described
      below. In each cohort, the first study drug administration for the first subject and the
      second subject are separated by at least 1 week.

        -  Cohort A: Subjects with newly diagnosed unmethylated O^6-methylguanine-deoxyribonucleic
           acid methyltransferase (MGMT) GBM receive durvalumab (10 mg/kg every 2 weeks [Q2W]) +
           standard radiotherapy. The first 6 subjects are evaluated for dose-limiting toxicity
           (DLT) for 10 weeks to determine whether the durvalumab dose should be lowered to 3 or 1
           mg/kg.

        -  Cohort B: Bevacizumab-naïve subjects with recurrent GBM receive durvalumab (10 mg/kg
           Q2W) as monotherapy.

        -  Cohort B2: Bevacizumab-naïve subjects with recurrent GBM receive durvalumab (10 mg/kg
           Q2W) + bevacizumab (10 mg/kg Q2W).

        -  Cohort B3: Bevacizumab-naïve subjects with recurrent GBM receive durvalumab (10 mg/kg
           Q2W) + bevacizumab (3 mg/kg Q2W).

        -  Cohort C: Bevacizumab-refractory subjects with recurrent GBM receive durvalumab (10
           mg/kg Q2W) + continued bevacizumab (10 mg/kg Q2W). The first 6 subjects are evaluated
           for DLTs for 6 weeks to determine whether the durvalumab dose should be lowered to 3 or
           1 mg/kg.

      The Core Study lasts for up to 12 months; optional extension treatment may be offered to
      subjects who complete 51 weeks of treatment on the Core Study with stable disease or better
      and upon agreement between the subject, Investigator, and Sponsor.

      Subjects are followed on study for 90 days after the last drug administration and off study
      every 6 months for 3 years from the date of the first dose of study treatment.

      The primary study endpoints have been met, although some subjects remain in treatment and/or
      follow-up and data collection is ongoing.
