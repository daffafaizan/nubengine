      investigators aimed to investigate the causes of sigmoid volvulus developing in patients
      under 60 years of age. Patients diagnosed with sigmoid volvulus between 2009 and 2018 were
      retrospectively screened. The patients were divided into two as under 60 years old and above.
      The co-morbidity, mortality, morbidity, complications, age and gender data of the patients
      were analyzed. In the sigmoid volvulus <60 age groups, the male/female ratio is close to each
      other. If sigmoid volvulus develops in <60 age groups, it is more likely to be another
      underlying organic pathology.
