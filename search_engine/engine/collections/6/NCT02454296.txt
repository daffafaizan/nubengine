      is commonly done prior to pregnancy termination to make the procedure safer. This study seeks
      to assess whether paracervical blocks are effective at reducing pain associated with
      placement of laminaria. Secondarily, this study will evaluate if paracervical blocks are
      effective at reducing overall procedural pain and increasing overall patient satisfaction for
      the intracervical laminaria placement procedure.
