      (BPS)/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CPPS). We will enroll individuals and families with
      IC/BPS/CPPS to fully describe the symptoms of IC/PBS/CPPS in adults and children. We will
      attempt to determine if the symptoms of IC/PBS/CPPS match or indicate changes in specific
      genes or a pathway of connected genes. We will use several genetic tests; linkage analysis,
      whole exome sequencing and candidate gene studies to try to identify the cause of
      IC/BPS/CPPS. We hope this will lead us to better more effective treatments for affected
      individuals. We are looking for families with IC/BPS/CPPS symptoms to give a DNA sample (from
      blood/saliva), urine samples, bladder tissue from clinical biopsy and answer several
      questionnaires. Travel to Boston NOT necessary.
