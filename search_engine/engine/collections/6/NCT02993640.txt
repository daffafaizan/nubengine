      according to routine practice in our hospital. A radial arterial catheter and a central
      venous catheter will be inserted, as well as a femoral arterial catheter for Picco
      monitoring. After the dissection phase, catheters will be inserted in the portal and hepatic
      veins by the surgeon. Base line data (HR, CVP, MAP, CO from thermodilution, portal and
      hepatic venous pressure, blood gases from radial artery, vena cava superior, hepatic vein and
      portal vein) will be obtained twice, with 10 minutes of steady state in between. An infusion
      of vasopressin 4,8 U/h will then be started and continued for 20 minutes. Data will be
      collected again, and an infusion of nitroglycerine (to a target of MAP 60 mmHg) will be
      added. After 5 minutes of steady MAP 55-65, the last set of data is collected. 12 Patients
      will be recruited, and the total data collection is estimated to be completed and assessed
      after six to nine months.
