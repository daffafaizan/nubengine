    
      This project will closely describe (prospective registry) the present situation
      (anti-thrombotic medication, prevalence of bleeding and ischemic complication) in a large
      consecutive cohort of non-selected cardiac patients, who are undergoing non-cardiac surgery.

      Patients have to meet all three inclusion criteria: (1) Any kind of non-cardiac surgery
      (acute or elective) performed under general or neuraxial anaesthesia in four surgical
      departments - General surgery, Orthopedics-Trauma, Urology and Neurosurgery. (2) History of
      cardiac disease with risk of arterial, intracardiac or vein thrombosis or embolism. (3)
      Signed Informed consent. All operated patients who meet the inclusion criteria will get
      enrolled, i.e. all consecutive cardiacs, who signed Informed consent.

      Baseline clinical indicators, chronic and perioperative medication, ECG, laboratory tests and
      all complications (especially ischemic and bleeding) will be registered.

      Participants will be followed for the duration of hospital stay, an expected average of 10
      days.
