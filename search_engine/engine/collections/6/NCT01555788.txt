      delivery as a potential breakthrough method for delivering insulin within the artificial
      pancreas system.

      The intent is to exploit the rapid action achieved by IP insulin to compensate for meals and
      for management of the basal insulin needs. Patients will come for two closed-loop admissions
      of 24 hours. The first closed-loop will be performed using subcutaneous route, whereas the
      second one will be performed using the intra-peritoneale route.
