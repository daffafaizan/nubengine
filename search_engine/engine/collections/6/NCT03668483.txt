      rehabilitation program at the Pulmonary Rehabilitation Unit will be included in the study. A
      6-min walk test, peripheral and respiratory muscle strength measurements, and a dyspnea
      rating scale Mmrc will be applied to the lung transplantation candidates who are trained in
      3-month hospital-based preoperative exercise training in the Pulmonary Rehabilitation unit.
      The tests will be carried out at the beginning and end of rehabilitation. At each testing
      session, the tests will be performed by the same physiotherapist. The correlations of the
      test data with each other will be analyzed.
