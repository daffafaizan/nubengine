      required in 30 to 50% of women presenting with USI. Several surgical techniques are currently
      available.

      At the present time, the placement of suburethral slings is one of the most efficient
      techniques. Furthermore, the placement of a suburethral sling is known to be associated with
      a low rate of complications.

      Currently, two approaches are available for the placement of a suburethral sling: retropubic
      approach (TVT) and trans-obturator approach (TVT-O). The efficacy of these two approaches
      seem equivalents. However, the morbidity related to these two techniques is probably
      different. In retrospective studies, the retropubic approach is associated with a higher rate
      of bladder perforation. On the other hand, the trans-obturator approach is supposed to be
      associated with a higher rate of post-operative pain.

      Thus, the purpose of this study is to compare efficacy and morbidity following the placement
      of two types of suburethral slings in women presenting with stress urinary incontinence: TVT
      and TVT-O.
