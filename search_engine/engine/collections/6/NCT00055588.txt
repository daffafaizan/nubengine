      resistances (complex training) elicits significant improvement in locomotor performance
      compared to training consisting of constant pedal resistance (simple training). Behavior
      gains associated with complex training correlate with down-regulation in the excitability of
      the alpha-motoneurone pools controlling muscles involved in the training task, as measured by
      changes in the soleus H-reflex, raising the hypothesis of a cause-effect link between
      performance improvements and modulation of spinal cord function. The purpose of this protocol
      is to determine if down-regulation in the excitability of the alpha-motoneuron pool is
      required for the improvement in locomotor performance. To address this issue, we hypothesize
      that up-regulation of alpha-motoneuron excitability will cancel improvements in locomotor
      performance elicited by complex training more than in subjects undergoing a period of simple
      training. The results of this study would provide novel information on the spinal substrates
      underlying learning of a locomotor task in intact humans and could be relevant to the design
      of rehabilitative strategies in patients with locomotor disorders.
