      brain activity using static magnetic fields. The investigator's will be examining the effects
      of static magnetic field of the spectral power of EEG data with healthy human participants.

      This is a within-subjects design, where each participant will receive sham and active
      stimulation on the left and right frontal cortex. EEG data will be collected during each
      stimulation.
