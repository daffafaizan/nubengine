      brain-related injuries related to trauma. Clinically, moderate-to-severe brain injury results
      in early coagulopathy, with a tendency toward unanticipated bleeding, followed by delayed
      hypercoagulation, with a tendency toward unanticipated clot formation. Optimal platelet
      count, activation and function are necessary for normal coagulation. Investigators have
      recently developed a novel approach to measure platelet activity. This approach specifically
      measures platelet energy output or bioenergetics from blood samples. Preclinical (animal)
      studies show that platelet bioenergetic profiles are different after TBI and that they change
      over time. This temporal profile may be used as a biomarker that can inform diagnosis and
      prognosis of TBI.
