      have been hospitalized with a serious bacterial infection they have two options: (1)
      discontinue the intravenous antibiotics and discharge the child to receive a prolonged course
      of oral antibiotics at home; or (2) insert a central venous catheter (usually a peripherally
      inserted central catheter (PICC)), train the parents in care of the PICC and administration
      of intravenous antibiotics, and discharge the child to receive a prolonged course of
      intravenous antibiotics via the central venous catheter at home. These two options have major
      implications for the overall experience of the child and their caregiver, but there is a
      paucity of evidence on their comparative effectiveness to help clinicians, patients, and
      their caregivers make an informed choice.

      Objectives: In this proposal the investigators outline a series of projects to compare oral
      antibiotics vs. intravenous antibiotics delivered via a central venous catheter in children
      who require prolonged (at least 1 week) home antibiotic therapy after hospitalization for
      three different serious bacterial infections: perforated appendicitis, complicated pneumonia,
      and osteomyelitis.

      Methods: To compare the clinical effectiveness of these two treatment options, the
      investigators will conduct three separate retrospective comparative effectiveness studies for
      each of these diseases using detailed electronic data on diagnoses, procedures, laboratory
      tests, and orders for drugs and devices supplemented by limited chart review from 43 free
      standing children's hospitals that are members of the Children's Hospital Association (CHA)
      (study years 2009-2011, total sample size will exceed 15,000 children). The primary outcome
      will be rehospitalization for treatment failure. The investigators will use conventional and
      propensity-score based methods, including matching, to estimate and compare the effect of the
      two treatment options on patient outcomes. These comparisons will have the goal of asking
      about the effect of therapy as if the patients had been randomized to one of the two
      treatment options.
