      treatmet with antiretrovirals. To date, there are few effective treatments, and all are
      symptomatic treatments for pain. Management typically involves the intiation and adjustment
      of pain-modifying therapies, and the adjustment or discontinuation of potentially neurotoxic
      antiretrovirals, thereby limiting the choice of HAART regimens.

      In precinical animal models,prosaptide has been shown to be efficacious in the treatment of
      neuropathic pain caused by a variety of different mechanisms.

      Hypothesis: Prosaptide will improve neuropathic pain in HIV-associated sensory
      neuroathies,and will be safe and well tolerated in subjects.

      Comparisons: 4, 8, or 16 mg prosaptide vs. placebo
