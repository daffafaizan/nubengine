    
      New drugs for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with action on specific molecular
      target (e.g. anti-TNF) have improved the prognosis of patients with an inadequate response to
      conventional therapy such as methotrexate (MTX).

      However, approximately 50% of patients treated with first-line anti-TNF discontinue treatment
      after two years due to ineffectiveness or adverse events. The second line treatment involves
      the use of another anti-TNF drug or switching to a different molecular target (anti-IL6,
      -CD20 or CTLA-4-Ig) in combination with MTX.
