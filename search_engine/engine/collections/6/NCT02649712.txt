      by cholangiocarcinoma, gallbladder carcinoma, liver cancer, or other metastatic carcinoma.
      Most patients with malignant hilar biliary obstruction are unresectable at diagnosis. Biliary
      stenting has been widely used in palliative treatment of malignant hilar biliary obstruction.

      Hilar biliary obstruction usually involves the bifurcation of the biliary tract. Some
      researchers recommended unilateral stenting for malignant hilar biliary obstruction because
      drainage of 25% of entire liver can achieve the clinical success of biliary drainage.
      However, some researchers recommended bilateral stenting for malignant hilar biliary
      obstruction because some researches demonstrated that bilateral stenting can achieve a longer
      stent patency.In addition, there was no significant difference in post stenting survival
      between patients who were treated by unilateral or bilateral stenting. Therefore, it remains
      under debate whether unilateral or bilateral stenting is better in the treatment of malignant
      hilar biliary obstruction.

      The purpose of this study is to compare the clinical effectiveness and long-term outcomes
      between patients with malignant hilar biliary obstruction who are treated by unilateral or
      bilateral stenting.
