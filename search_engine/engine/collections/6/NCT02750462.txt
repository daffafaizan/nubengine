      Group 1: Immediate angiography Patients randomized to group 1 will be transported to the
      catheterization laboratory as soon as possible after hospital admission for evaluation of
      coronary anatomy.

      Group 2: Delayed/selective angiography Upon hospital admission, patients assigned to group 2
      will first be transported to the ICU for further evaluation and stratification of OHCA
      etiology. Further triage will depend on the results of clinical examination and objective
      testing and will be left to the individual physician according to clinical judgment.
      Depending on clinical circumstances, further management may comprise medical therapy,
      laboratory testing, imaging such as echocardiography and/or computed tomography, hemodynamic
      or neurological monitoring, the initiation of therapeutic hypothermia or other measures of
      intensive care. If a high likelihood of an acute coronary trigger for OHCA persists (i.e.
      inconclusive results from clinical evaluation with ongoing suspicion of an acute coronary
      event, etc.), the treating physician may proceed to coronary angiography after a delay of 24h
      after the onset of cardiac arrest.

      Vital status will be assessed at 30 days, 6 and 12 months after randomization by direct
      questioning if the patient is still hospitalized or structured telephone interview. Clinical
      events will be verified by original source data. At 6 and 12 months, quality of life will be
      assessed by the the Euroqol 5D questionnaire.
