      clinical outcome of stroke and at the same time provided evidence of the role of complement
      fragments in the pathogenesis of ischemia-induced brain damage. Scavenging of these active
      fragments by IVIG is the likely mechanism of beneficial effect. In one of these studies CSL's
      own Privigen preparation was used. Considering that it exhibited in-vitro scavenging
      abilities more pronounced than several other IVIG preparations, and that its in-vivo
      scavenging capacity was also proven in a relevant animal model, a need to test this
      preparation in stroke patients is warranted. In addition, activation of complement and the
      level of activated fragments in humans seem to correlate with the severity of the disease,
      making them an ideal therapeutic target.
