      access, a diagnostic angiogram will be performed. After pre-arthrectomy Intravascular
      ultrasound (IVUS) of the affected arterial segment, patient will undergo treatment of the
      lesion with arthrectomy, followed by post-arthrectomy IVUS analysis. Following arthrectomy,
      the affected vessel will be treated by supplementary Ranger Drug Eluting Balloon (DEB).
      During post-procedure, patients will be started on dual antiplatelets for 3 months followed
      by Aspirin for life unless contraindicated. Clinical follow-up, duplex ultrasound (to assess
      for re-stenosis) and Ankle Brachial Pressure Index (ABPI) will be performed at 1-month,
      6-month and 12-month post intervention. Assessment of the symptoms, pulse, and clinical
      patency will be performed at each visit.
