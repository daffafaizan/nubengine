      spread, NPC is sensitive to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. However, the treatment of this
      cancer can lead to later complications, including other cancers, and if NPC relapses or
      spreads to other organs, the treatment options are limited. This grant proposes to evaluate
      the safety and tolerability of a novel treatment for patients with NPC that has either
      relapsed or spread to distant organs.

      Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) is known to play a role in the development of NPC in individuals,
      especially those with a compromised immune system. Studies have shown that NPC tumor cells
      express proteins that are related to EBV. Some of these proteins can trigger a response from
      the immune system, specifically the activation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), a type of
      immune cell that might exert anti-tumor effects. In this project, we will take blood from NPC
      patients, generate CTLs targeted against EBV, and re-infuse these back into patients in an
      attempt to achieve anti-tumor activity. Patients will also receive an antibody called CD45
      Mab prior to CTL infusion in order to allow for better expansion of the infused CTLs in the
      patients.
