      Since most renal cell carcinomas (RCC's) that are now detected by imaging as small renal
      masses, grow slowly and remain asymptomatic for years, we hypothesize that:

        -  Small RCC's that are destined to metastasize do so early or after they reach a larger
           size

        -  Delayed surgical treatment of asymptomatic, incidentally detected, small RCC's WILL NOT
           have a significant impact on overall survival

        -  The majority of small RCC's MAY NOT need to be treated.

        -  RCC's that are destined to progress can be identified by abnormal perfusion patterns on
           imaging and by their cellular and genomic characteristics on needle biopsy.
