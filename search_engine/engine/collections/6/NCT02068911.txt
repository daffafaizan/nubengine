      regularly measure blood gases and in particular carbon dioxide (CO2). The reference technique
      is arterial puncture. In recent years, a non-invasive techniques measuring CO2 by
      transcutaneous sensor (PTCO2) was introduced among the tools regularly used for follow-up
      monitoring of home ventilated patients.

      Another technique for monitoring CO2, originally developed for anesthesia, is based on the
      measurement of exhaled CO2 (ETCO2). This technique requires relatively simple equipment, and
      represents a potential alternative for monitoring home-ventilated patients.

      Recently, sensors for ETCO2 were coupled to devices for home ventilation. To the best of our
      knowledge, the role of ETCO2 in monitoring long-term ventilated patients has not been
      investigated to date.

      The purpose of the study is to analyze the correlation between the two non-invasive methods
      for measuring CO2: PTCO2 and ETCO2, in a group of home-ventilated patients with neuromuscular
      disease.

      The patients will be recruited during a routine follow-up hospitalization for their
      home-ventilation, and the ETCO2 will be measured during one night, in addition to the
      routinely measured PTCO2.
