      estrogen-dependent and estrogen-driven disease and so hormonal manipulation and suppression
      of estrogen production form the basis of the majority of medical treatment. The primary
      objective of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and
      pharmacodynamics of SHR7280 tablets in premenopausal subjects with endometriosis. In
      addition, this study will provide information on efficacy of SHR7280 tablets in premenopausal
      subjects with endometriosis.
