    
      This is a study to determine the feasibility of using Whole Body MRI (WBMRI) to detect
      Atypical Plexiform Neurofibromas (ANF) among Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) patients who are
      at highest risk for developing these tumors. In order to do this, the investigators will
      prospectively obtain WBMRI scans on patients with high plexiform tumor burden (which
      investigators will define as >=1 plexiform neurofibroma (PN) that is >3cm in diameter on MRI)
      at the same time as their regularly scheduled MRI to allow for radiographic comparison of the
      identified PNs. In this study, the investigators will plan to establish a method that
      effectively characterizes PNs in terms of their volume, radiographic appearance on WBMRI and
      association with clinical characteristics.

      As an exploratory aim, the investigators plan to collect blood samples from each patient at
      the same time as the MRI to determine the feasibility of isolating cfDNA (circulating free
      DNA) from plasma of patients with high plexiform tumor burden.
