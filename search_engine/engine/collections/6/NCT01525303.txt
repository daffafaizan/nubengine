      though research in this area has been somewhat limited. It is warranted to consider the
      effectiveness of aerobic exercise as part of a larger headache management intervention. Early
      research in this area suggests that including an exercise component in conjunction with other
      effective forms of headache management, such as progressive muscle relaxation, biofeedback,
      and stress management, is associated with improvement in number of days with a headache,
      headache pain intensity and mood. None of these studies have specifically analyzed the
      effectiveness of the aerobic exercise component, though Lemestra et al. (2002) noted that
      participants who continued with their exercise regimen had better overall outcomes three
      months after the intervention ended.

      Given the high rates of obesity and the fact that many people do not meet the minimum daily
      requirement for exercise, it is worthwhile to investigate the additive effect of exercise to
      behavioral headache interventions.
