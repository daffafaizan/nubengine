      non-cirrhotic liver disease or cirrhotic patients. Seronegative patients willing to
      participate will sign a written informed consent and will receive four doses of 20 µg Fendrix
      ® at 0,1, 2 and 6 months. Antibodies against HBV superficial antigen (anti-HBs) will be
      determined at 2 months +/- 10 days, six months and one year after having received the fourth
      dose of the vaccine (to see kinetics). An enzymatic immunoassay (AUSAB; Laboratorios Abbott,
      Abbott Park, IL, USA) will be used. The study will differentiate between responders and
      non-responders to the vaccine: adequate immunity to HBV will be defined as anti-HBs higher
      than > 10mUI/mL (standard definition of seroconversion) and> 100mUI/mL.. Adverse events will
      be assessed throughout the treatment period.

      Vaccination technique: Patients will receive the adjuvanted monovalent and commercial
      adsorbent Fendrix suspension for injection GlaxoSmithKline vaccine in the following protocol:
      Standard protocol: Intra- muscular Dose: 0.5 ml (20 µg of Hepatitis B Surface Antigen + 50 µg
      of - 3-O-desacyl-4'- monophosphoryl lipid A) at baseline and 1, 2 and 6 months.
