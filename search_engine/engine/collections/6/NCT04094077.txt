    
      AGuIX® (Activation and Guidance of Irradiation by X-ray, NH TherAguix) are Gadolinium
      chelated polysiloxane based nanoparticles with Magnetic Resonance contrast properties, able
      to accumulate in the tumor through the enhanced permeability and retention effect and
      sufficiently small (sub-5 nm diameter) to allow for renal clearance.

      AGuIX® nanomedicine can be used as:

        -  Positive contrast agent for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). It displays higher
           efficacy than commercial contrast agents and so it can be used to delineate precisely
           the tumors.

        -  A booster of Radiotherapy during the radiotherapy protocol, after the localization of
           the tumor.

      This is permitted by the high radiosensitizing potential of AGuIX® that allows a local
      increase of efficacy of X-ray damages. French and international groups have demonstrated the
      radiosensitizer effect of AGuIX® to improve the efficacy of radiotherapy.

      Thanks to a difference in porosity between the vascular networks, AGuIX® penetrates and
      resides in tumor tissues, but not in healthy tissues.
