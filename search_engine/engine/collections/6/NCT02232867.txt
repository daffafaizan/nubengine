      to walk, thus decreasing quality of life in a significant way. Traditionally, body weight
      supported treadmill training has been used for walking rehabilitation; however, this therapy
      requires specialized technicians, equipment, and facilities. Arm and leg cycle ergometers, a
      device commonly found in a gym, could provide an inexpensive and readily accessible means for
      walking rehabilitation.
