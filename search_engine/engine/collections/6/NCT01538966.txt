      of three treatment arms. The study will begin when the combination of octreotide LAR or
      lanreotide and pegvisomant is first administered. Study visits will occur every 4 weeks from
      the start of the study. However, for subjects who cannot make every study visit due to
      distance, the study team will facilitate monthly blood draws at their local Quest laboratory
      facility.

      After the 24 weeks of combination therapy, subjects with a controlled IGF-1 will then start
      Pegvisomant monotherapy at the same dose and schedule that they attained normalization in
      combination therapy. IGF-1 levels, liver function test, and blood glucose will be performed
      monthly. An MRI will be performed at the conclusion of the study.
