      associated with a variety of diseases. Preterm infants are susceptible osteopenia of
      prematurity (OP). Vitamin D deficiency may contribute to OP. The American Academy of
      Pediatrics (AAP) recommends a daily intake of 400 IU in order to achieve a serum
      concentration of 20 ng/ml of vitamin D. This recommendation presumes exposure to sunlight,
      the best source of vitamin D. Whether this level of intake or target serum concentration are
      achieved in early preterm infants is unknown. We hypothesize that because early preterm
      infants are sequestered in the Newborn Intensive Care Units for an extended period of time,
      they will be deficient in vitamin D and that the current nutritional intake may not be
      adequate in meeting the AAP recommendation. We assessed the concentration of serum
      25-hydroxyvitamin-D in parturient mothers and in their newborns if they were less than 32
      week gestation. We monitored vitamin D intake during hospitalization in the Newborn Intensive
      Care Unit and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin-D at discharge.
