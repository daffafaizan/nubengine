      the United States. HF is the primary diagnosis for hospital discharge in ~1 million and a
      secondary diagnosis in ~2 million hospitalizations annually in the US. In fact, inpatient
      admissions account for more than half of HF healthcare expenditure. However, data from
      several registries over the last three decades has failed to see use of these evidence- based
      therapies at levels noted in clinical trials, despite aggressive guideline recommendations
      and promotion by thought leaders in the field. It remains unclear as to why many patients
      with HF reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) are not on evidence-based therapies especially post
      hospital discharge and why the percentages are consistent across national registries over
      time. Whether the gap between clinical trial use and real-world practice is due to a lack of
      knowledge or providers making individualized decisions about their patients is unclear. A
      simple way to test this hypothesis is to examine whether electronic health record (EHR) based
      "best practice advisories" (BPAs) can increase use of evidence based therapies. If found to
      be effective, these low cost interventions can be rapidly applied across large healthcare
      systems.

      The goal of this trial is to determine the effectiveness of a BPA alert system that informs
      providers about evidence-based medical therapy for the treatment of HFrEF versus usual care
      (no alert) in the inpatient setting.
