      position in relation to the nerve and therefore may increase the likelihood of a successful
      nerve block. Defining the minimal stimulating current accepted also may help to avoid direct
      contact between nerve and needle or accidental endoneural injection and subsequent nerve
      lesion.

      In recent years there have been many reports where several nerves, parts thereof or plexuses
      have been anesthetised using a multiple injection approach. That is, nerves in close
      proximity of each other have been subsequently blocked after using a nerve stimulator to
      locate them.

      It is not clear though, whether a nerve may already be partially anesthetised in this
      situation and whether that would impair the correct use of a peripheral nerve stimulator.

      The aim of this study is to examine the excitability of a peripheral nerve after injecting a
      small amount of local anesthetic agent or saline solution into the proximity of the nerve.
