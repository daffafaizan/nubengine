    
      The purpose of this study is to identify the prevalence of visual dysfunction among Persons
      with Parkinson's Disease, compared to other neurological conditions and controls without
      neurological conditions.

      Data will be collected anonymously via RedCap. Patients seen at the Fixel Institute that have
      consented to be contacted regarding research opportunities will be recruited via blast email
      and advertisement in our Institute's monthly newsletter, the Movement Messenger. The email
      and newsletter will contain a link for participation in surveys within RedCap so the surveys
      can be completed anonymously at home. Participation will be completely voluntary and
      responses will be recorded anonymously. Data will include responses to the following:
      screening questions, the VIPDQ (Visual Impairment in PD Questionnaire), and the R-SRAFVP
      (Revised-Self-Report Assessment of Functional Visual Performance).

      The investigators will calculate the prevalence of visual impairment (from the VIPDQ) and
      dysfunction in performance of daily activities (from the R-SRAFVP) for PwP and compare this
      to the prevalence occurring in other neurological populations as well as the population
      without any neurological conditions. Other data are collected so the investigators can then
      evaluate potential confounds or covariates. To ensure statistical methods are accurate, a
      statistician will be consulted.
