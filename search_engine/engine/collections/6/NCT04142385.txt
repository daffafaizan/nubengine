      I. To determine the one-year incidence of HIV among high-risk MSM in India.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To test the feasibility and acceptability of recruiting a sample of 150 high-risk
      HIV-uninfected MSM using respondent-driven sampling (RDS) and following them every six months
      for one year.

      II. To produce preliminary descriptive data on the prevalence and incidence of human
      papillomavirus (HPV) infection and HPV-associated disease and sexually transmitted infections
      (STIs) other than HPV in HIV-seronegative MSM in India.

      III. To produce preliminary descriptive data on sexual risk behaviors with men and women, as
      well as data on other potential confounders.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants receive a questionnaire, undergo a targeted physical and anal clinical exam,
      undergo blood collection and urethral swab for STIs, and a penile skin cell and anal swab for
      cytology and HPV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) at months 0, 6, and 12. Participants also
      undergo high-resolution anoscopy (HRA) and penile clinical exam at month 12.
