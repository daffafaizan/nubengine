      non-pluripotent cells, such as adult fibroblasts. Transfection is typically achieved through
      viral vectors, such as retroviruses. Transfected genes include the master transcriptional
      regulators Oct-3/4 (Pouf51) and Sox2, although to enhance the efficiency of induction some
      other genes e.g. Klf4, c-Myc. In this study after separation the fibroblasts from patient's
      skin biopsy, the cells are transfected with 4 Yamanaka factors (human Oct4, Sox2, Klf4,
      c-Myc) after 3-4 weeks, transfected cells are isolated through morphological selection.
