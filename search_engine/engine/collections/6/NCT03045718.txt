      dementia, and will be selected from consenting participants from an existing community
      cognitive screening program.

      This is an intervention study where 100 subjects will be randomized into an active
      horticultural therapy group, or a waitlist control group. Baseline demographic data will be
      collected at the start of the study. Assessments will be done at the start, at 3 months and
      at 6 months, which will include neuropsychological tests of cognitive functioning,
      psychological tests for depression and anxiety, assessment of psychosocial well-being, and
      tests of functional status.

      The Horticultural Therapy intervention will be delivered by trained facilitators at the
      Therapeutic Garden at Hort Park, and consists of 1 hour sessions weekly for 9 months. The
      Horticultural Therapy program is designed to stimulate the senses through interaction with
      the tasks and the environment, promote social interaction and also to promote a sense of
      self-worth through completion of projects. It encompasses a range of activities including
      general gardening and also project-based craft activities.

      The control group will be placed on a waiting list and only be contacted for assessments.
      They will receive intervention after the active treatment group at a later date.
