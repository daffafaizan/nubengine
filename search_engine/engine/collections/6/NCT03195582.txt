      the implants will be asked to participate in this clinical trial (40) Patients from
      Department of periodontology, Rambam Health campus, Haifa in Israel will be recruited to
      Randomized clinical trial; patients will be divided randomly in to 2 groups:

        1. Control: following uncovering of the implant a 4 mm height healing abutment will be
           screwed to the implant (the standard treatment modality) without using Chlorohexidine
           gel or any other gel.

        2. Test group: following implant exposure this group will receive Chlorohexidine 1% gel
