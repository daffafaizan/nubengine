      24 hours will be taken to assess the ertapenem blood concentrations over time. Spent
      dialysate and urine samples (if any) will also be measured for ertapenem content to determine
      how much drug is removed by CVVHD and kidneys. A pharmacokinetic evaluation will be made to
      determine what is the most appropriate dose for this drug in patients receiving CVVHD to
      achieve pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic goals.
