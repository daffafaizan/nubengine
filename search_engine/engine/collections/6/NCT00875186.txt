      weight loss following bariatric operations for morbid obesity, such as Roux-en-Y gastric
      bypass (RYGBP) can result in a concurrent decrease in lean body mass. However the long-time
      results (weight reduction, elimination co-morbidities) are depending on the post operative
      treatment. Aerobic physical exercising (APE) is well accepted in conservative treatment of
      obesity as well as of diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM). The aim of this study was to assess the
      efficiency of APE on weight loss, body composition and co-morbidities in patients after
      laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric bypass (RYGBP).
