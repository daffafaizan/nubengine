      ketorolac 10 mg after oral single-dose administration of the individual components, either
      separately or simultaneously, in healthy volunteers under fasting conditions, to demonstrate
      the absence of a pharmacokinetic interaction.

      The secondary objective of the study was to evaluate the safety of both drugs when
      administered separately and simultaneously based on adverse events reported after treatment.

      Participants were admitted to the study site for approximately 42 hours (12 hours before and
      30 hours after dosing) for each of the 3 treatment periods. A final examination was performed
      2 days after completion of the last treatment period.
