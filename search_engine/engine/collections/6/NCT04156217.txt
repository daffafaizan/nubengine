    
      EBV infection is a common virus infection of HSCT, and which is highly related with the
      failure of transplantation and survival time of transplant patients. To evaluate the safety
      and efficacy of allogenic EBV-TCR-T cell therapy in subjects with EBV infection, patients
      with EBV emias or EBV positive PTLD will be enrolled, and donor derived
      EBV-TCR-T(HLA-A*1101\0201\2402) cells will be intravenously infused with a escalated dose of
      0.1-1Ã—106 EBV-TCR-T cells. The EBV DNA copies and EBV-TCR-T cell proliferation will be
      monitored in the scheduled time (day 0, day 4, day 7, day 10, day 14, day 28).
