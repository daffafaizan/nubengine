      in the study. All participants will undergo a medical examination. The participants will fill
      out an electronic headache diary for one month. This will give a picture of the current
      headache pattern and establish a baseline. The participants will then be randomized into two
      groups: saline injections or needle sticks without injection. They will not be aware of which
      group they belong to. The treatment will be repeated on two occasions three months apart. The
      headache diary will continue during the treatment period and up to three months after the
      second treatment. The effect will be analyzed by comparing baseline data from the headache
      diary to data after treatment. The primary outcome of the study is the number of days with
      headache, during a 28-day period.
