      infection leads to critical condition in 5% of the cases due to hypoxemic respiratory failure
      with the background of viral pneumonia. 90% of these patients require invasive mechanical
      ventilation on critical care units. Both alevolar recruitment and the subsequent optimal
      positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) adjustment has a pivotal role in the eliminitaion of
      atelectasis developed by inflammation in the lung parenchyma.

      The gold standard of the follow up of recruitment manoeuvre is the chest computed tomography
      (CT) examination. However, reduction of intrahospital transport and the exposure with
      healthcare workers are recommended because of the extremely virulent pathogen spreading
      easily by droplet infection. In this case bedside investigations have an utmost importance in
      the management of hygiene regulations.

      Electric impedance tomography (EIT) is a non-invasive, radiation free functional imaging
      technique easily applicable at the bedside. With the help of EIT, intrathoracic impedance
      changes, resulting from air and blood volume variations, can be determined by
      circumferentially attached surface electrodes around the thorax, applying small alternating
      currents and measuring differences in surface potentials. The calculated difference in
      potential is utilised to reconstruct impedance images what is employed to assess ventilation
      and perfusion distribution. Several local and global variances can be estimated just like the
      ratio fo atelectatic/overdistended alveoli, the ratio of aeration in the anterior/posterior
      regions, the inhomogeneity of aeration or regional compliance.
