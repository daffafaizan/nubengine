      preoperative hypertension (SBP > 160 mmHg) as measured via an indwelling arterial line.

      The study drug (clevidipine or placebo) may be administered to treat hypertension until one
      hour has elapsed, or until induction of anesthesia, whichever occurs first.

      The primary endpoint of bailout described (as defined per protocol) as bailout for lack of
      efficacy, bailout for safety reason or bailout due to treatment failure will be determined
      during the 30-minute period from study drug initiation.
