      One orthopedic surgeon will perform 30 primary TKAs using X-Ray PSI Knee guides, generated
      from X-ray. Patients who have been appropriately indicated as candidates for TKA and who meet
      the specified inclusion and exclusion criteria, will be informed about ZimmerÂ® X-Ray PSI Knee
      technology and offered entry into the study. Informed consent, in accordance with current
      ethical board regulatory requirements and best practice, will be obtained from all patients.
