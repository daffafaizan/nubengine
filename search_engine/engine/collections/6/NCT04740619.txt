      publications in the literature reporting specimen removal from the natural hole in patients
      with a diagnosis of sigmoid volvulus. Here, the investigators aimed to present the literature
      that transanal specimen removal is a technically feasible method after laparoscopic surgery
      in patients with sigmoid volvulus. The documents of patients who were operated on for sigmoid
      volvulus between 2018 and 2019 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients who had been used
      transanal for specimen extraction by elective laparoscopic sigmoid colon resection were
      included in the study. Patients' gender, age, comorbidity, operation time, operative
      difficulties, complications, length of stay, and mortality findings were analyzed.
      Laparoscopic sigmoid resection and transanal specimen removal were performed in eight
      patients. Specimen extraction surgery from the natural hole is increasingly preferred. the
      investigators think that natural hole surgery can be performed more easily and reliably in
      sigmoid volvulus due to the large diameter of the colon.
