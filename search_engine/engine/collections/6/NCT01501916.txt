      can be used to reduce atherosclerotic risk factors such as hypertension, inflammation and
      hyperlipidemia. The research question is whether Vitamin D3 can lower blood pressure in
      mildly hypertensive subjects who are naive to antihypertensive medication, whether Vitamin D
      reduces the level of systemic inflammation and whether Vitamin D3 has an effect on blood
      lipids.

      major outcomes:

      - decrease of systolic blood pressure in the treatment group in comparison with the placebo
      group
