    
      This is a cross-sectional study performed annually over 3 years to procure blood samples by
      fingerstick from healthy individuals living in the Phnom Penh area to evaluate seroprevalence
      to SARS-CoV-2. A mobile unit will move between various markets, schools, hospitals, clinics,
      parks, and other public places with local authority permissions. Participants with a positive
      result on the screening SARS-CoV-2 ELISA will be contacted via telephone (since there is not
      reliable mail in Cambodia) and invited to undergo an additional blood draw via venipuncture
      during a home visit by the mobile team within 180 days of the initial sample collection. This
      visit may also be conducted by CCDC/CNM/MOH study staff at a local clinic. Up to 10 of their
      adult household contacts will be invited to enroll and screen at this time via fingerstick
      for SARS-CoV-2 ELISA as part of an enriched sampling scheme to boost the probability of
      identifying SARSCoV- 2 immune individuals; those with positive results will be invited to
      undergo follow-up venipuncture as described above. Venipuncture samples will be used to study
      the immune responses of Cambodians to the novel coronavirus.
