      cystic fibrosis-related diabetes. Cystic fibrosis-related diabetes is characterized initially
      by post-prandial hyperglycemia, with normal fasting sugars. As the disease progresses,
      fasting hyperglycemia develops. As sitagliptin augments post-prandial insulin release, while
      avoiding fasting hypoglycemia, it may be an alternative therapy for cystic fibrosis-related
      diabetes in individuals who do not yet require basal insulin therapy.
