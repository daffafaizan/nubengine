experimental studies on cerebrospinalfluid flowa mixed suspension of kaolin and lyco-podium was injected into the cisterna magnaof dogs.  blockade of csf space was producedsuccessfully in 63 of 75 dogs; in 48 of the 63,ventricular dilatation of more than interme-diate degree was observed.in these hydrocephalic dogs experimentalshunting was performed either between thelateral ventricle and the lumbar cistern or be-tween the unilateral lateral ventricle and thecontralateral cerebral subarachnoid space.  uni-directional, steady csf flow averaged 0.15 ml. perhour in the cases of the former shunting,and the flow averaged 0.25 ml. per hour in thecases of the latter shunting.csf flow rate from the ventricle toward thecerebral subarachnoid space was larger whenintraventricular pressure was higher.  this in-crease in flow rate parallel to increasing pres-sure probably results from an increase in csfabsorption.  there seems to be an upper limitof the flow rate as the pressure is raised.transient reflux of csf flow was induced byjugular or abdominal compression.following intravenous administration of hy-pertonic solutions, csf flow rate decreasedparallel to the fall of csf pressure and re-gained the original value as the pressure wasrecovered.  when the pressure fell as low as50 mm. of water the flow almost stopped.
