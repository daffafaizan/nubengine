      [fluorescence imaging and Indocyanine Green (ICG) dye verses standard laparoscopic
      colorimetric analysis using Isosulfan Blue (ISB) dye] for sensitivity and specificity of
      detecting metastatic disease in pelvic lymph nodes of women with endometrial cancer
      undergoing robotic-assisted laparoscopic hysterectomy and lymphadenectomy. The following
      three specific aims would be addressed in this research proposal:

      Specific Aim 1: To determine the ability of mapping bilaterally pelvic SLN in women with
      endometrial cancer undergoing robotic-assisted laparoscopic staging comparing two different
      methods (i.e., comparing the combination of colorimetric analysis-ISB dye + fluorescence
      imaging-ICG dye vs. colorimetric analysis-ISB dye alone).

      Specific Aim 2: To estimate the negative predictive value (NPV) of pelvic SLN in endometrial
      cancer with respect to predicting nodal metastasis.

      Specific Aim 3: To evaluate the ability of sentinel lymph nodes to increase the detection of
      metastatic disease through ultra-sectioning and immuno-histochemical (IHC) staining by
      comparing IHC results and standard hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) results.
