      ethics committee, and investigator found that the levels and mutations of circulating exosome
      RNA from patients with or without lung metastasis have significant differences. Then
      investigators wish to register this study to do a further research, in order to reveal the
      roles of circulating exosome RNA in metastases of osteosarcoma.
