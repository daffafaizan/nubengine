      sequentially in a single imaging session on one device is clinically superior to side-by-side
      evaluation of separately performed imaging tests. They hypothesize that more accurate
      localization of increased radiotracer activity on NM procedures will improve the diagnostic
      accuracy for detection of infection and will subsequently have a significant impact on
      patient management.

      The purpose of the present study is to assess the clinical value of this new technology of
      fused imaging in patients undergoing diagnostic nuclear medicine evaluation for suspicion of
      an infection process.
