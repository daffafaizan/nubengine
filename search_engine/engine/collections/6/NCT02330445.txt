      modifying agents such as methotrexate and leflunomide, all of these agents provoke adverse
      events. The newer more active biological agents have a distinct safety profile that includes
      an increased risk of serious infections. They have an annual treatment expense in the tens of
      thousands of dollars a year. PRTX-100 may be able to modify the disease course of rheumatoid
      arthritis with an improved safety profile compared to available agents and a dosing regimen
      comparable to the therapies currently available. This study is done to describe the adverse
      event profile of 6 Î¼g/kg of PRTX-100 administered IV for longer periods of treatment that
      might be required for RA therapy. Secondary objectives include: evaluation of the clinical
      response of subjects with previous administration of PRTX-100; evaluation of anti-PRTX
      antibody presence and effect on activity; evaluation of "Power Doppler" ultrasound in the
      assessment of joint inflammation; and evaluation of biomarkers.

      Assay development is an intrinsic part of drug and biological development. The current assay
      for anti-PRTX-100 antibodies depends on a very limited supply of serum available from
      individuals in early trials. It will be necessary to obtain adequate antisera to provide
      immunological reagents for this assay. It is not known whether the character of anti-PRTX-100
      antibodies from volunteers is similar to those produced by patients with immunological
      disorders on cytotoxic therapy. Antisera will be developed in normal volunteers. The
      anti-PRTX-100 antibody assay will need to be standardized with a new anti-PRTX-100 antibody
      source compared to the present human reagent.
