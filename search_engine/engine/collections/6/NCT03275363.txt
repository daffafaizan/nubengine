    
      The HKU Neurocognitive Disorder (NCD) Cohort is a hospital-based, prospective, observational
      study of older HK Chinese adults with cognitive impairment, with a special focus on studying
      patients with subjective cognitive decline and mild cognitive impairment, and in particular
      the biomarkers that predict cognitive and functional decline.

      Comprehensive profiling of each subject is performed through a multi-domain assessment
      protocol including detailed demographics, lifestyle factors, neuropsychological battery,
      mood, MRI, genetics, blood biomarkers, and other patient-centred parameters including level
      of disability, quality of life and societal engagement. Ongoing annual follow up captures the
      essential clinical events and changes in neurocognitive function (conversion to MCI or
      dementia), mood, level of disability and quality of life; as well as repeat blood tests.

      The HKU NCD Cohort is the first-ever Asian dementia cohort to be formally included into the
      Dementia Platforms UK, achieving an international collaborative status with other UK-based
      cohorts. The study neuropsychological battery is aligned with the NACC UDS3 battery.
