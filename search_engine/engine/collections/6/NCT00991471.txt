      department wait-times a government priority. The crisis of overcrowding and access block has
      become an international epidemic, affecting developing countries in Europe, North America,
      and Australasia. The MOHLTC has targeted 23 Ontario hospitals' prolonged wait times.
      Sunnybrook Health Sciences Center has been selected. Therefore, this is a quality improvement
      study of patient wait-times and care.

      During a 20-week period, the MDRN STAT will be present on randomly chosen weekdays
      (8:00-16:00) for 50 shifts. Wait-times, such as time from triage time to: physician
      assessment, stretcher occupation, treatment orders (drugs), investigation orders (laboratory,
      diagnostic imaging), investigation acquisition (diagnostic imaging), consultation, bed
      request, discharge from ED (i.e. length of stay (LOS)) time, will be analyzed. In addition,
      the left-without-being-seen rate (LWBS) and rate of return will be analyzed. These results
      will be compared to the Ontario wait-time strategy P4R targets, as well as the Canadian
      Triage Acuity Scale (CTAS guidelines). Economic analysis of this intervention will be done.
      The hospital will independently perform patient satisfaction surveys. Health care worker
      satisfaction survey data will be analyzed.
