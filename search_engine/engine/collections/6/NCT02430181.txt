      the hepatitis D virus (HDV), a small RNA virus that requires farnesylation of its major
      structural protein (HDV antigen) for replication. Twenty-one subjects with chronic delta
      hepatitis will be randomized to receive one of seven different doses of lonafarnib. Dosing
      will occur over 4-12 weeks, depending on treatment arm, and during that time, evidence of
      antiviral response will be assessed by frequent measurements of HDV-RNA. The primary
      therapeutic endpoint will be an improvement in quantitative serum HDV RNA levels after
      treatment with lonafarnib therapy. The primary safety endpoint will be the ability to
      tolerate the drug at the prescribed dose for the treatment duration. Several secondary
      endpoints will be measured, including side effects, ALT levels, and symptoms. Therapy will be
      stopped for intolerance to lonafarnib. This study is designed as a phase 2a study assessing
      the safety, tolerance and antiviral activity of seven dose combinations of lonafarnib with
      and without ritonavir boosting.
