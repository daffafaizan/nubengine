      network. The function can be evaluated using instrumental, such as fibreoptic endoscopic
      evaluation of swallowing (FEES), videofluoroscopy, or well structured scales. There are many
      questionnaire and scales for assessment of swallow but very few have been validated. The
      study will assess the construct validity and reliability of the Turkish version of Pharyngeal
      Residue Severity Rating Scale as known as Yale Pharyngeal Residue Severity Rating Scale.
