      alertness training program (INHANCE) to improve cognition in healthy older adults, as
      evidenced by standard measures of cognition, and positive improvements in the neuromodulatory
      cholinergic system as measured via positron-emission tomography (PET).

      The investigators will employ a double-blind, parallel-arm, placebo-controlled, randomized
      clinical trial design comprised of a treatment group using INHANCE, a computerized program
      that trains speed of processing and attention, compared to an active control group using
      computer games in 90 healthy older adults.

      Approximately 108 participants will be consented to ensure the successful completion of 90
      participants (post 20% attrition). Participants will then complete the Screening (V0)
      assessments to determine eligibility. Following inclusion, participants will complete the
      Baseline (V1) assessments, PET imaging and structural MRI scan; participants will then be
      randomized into either the INHANCE training or Computer Games, and will engage in
      approximately 35 hours of program use for the 10-week intervention period. Approximately
      halfway through the intervention period (~5 weeks), participants will complete Interim (V2)
      assessments to be compared to the Post-Intervention assessments. Following the 10-week
      intervention, participants will complete a Post-Intervention (V3) assessment and PET imaging
      to evaluate changes in cognitive function. Participants will then stop using their assigned
      program for 3 months and return for a Follow-up (V4) end-of-study assessment to evaluate the
      endurance of changes in cognitive function in the absence of further program use.

      The protocol will be conducted in accordance with the protocol submitted to and approved by
      the National Institute on Health (NIH), and subject to Institutional Review Board review and
      approval prior to implementation.
