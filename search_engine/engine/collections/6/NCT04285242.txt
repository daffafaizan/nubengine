    
      A single-centre, non-randomised, observational study. This study will investigate the
      systemic metabolic and immunological changes that occur in cachexia. The aim is to better
      understand the mechanism(s) underlying weight loss in people with non-haematological cancer.
      This will help to facilitate future research to generate treatments to reverse weight loss
      and improve outcomes.
