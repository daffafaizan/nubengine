      prolonged procedures, particularly over 2 hours, as some clinicians consider it unsuitable
      for positive pressure ventilation (needed to counter the alleged progressive respiratory
      fatigue with time) and/or unsuitable for airway protection (needed to counter the alleged
      progressive increase in aspiration risk with time). The LMA ProSealTM is a laryngeal mask
      device with a modified cuff to facilitate ventilation and a drain tube to provide airway
      protection. In principle, the LMA ProSealTM should be more suitable than the LMA ClassicTM
      for prolonged procedures; however, there are only four reports and one case series.
