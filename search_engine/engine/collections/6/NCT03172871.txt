    
      Screening Phase: The screening phase will begin when informed consent is signed and be a
      maximum of 13 days. The investigators will assess the subjects who meet all eligibility
      criteria and collect the characteristic information of the subjects, such as demographic,
      medical history, etc. If subjects have been exposed to aripiprazole in the past (ie,
      tolerability has been established), then subjects will enter a washout period for 3～7 days
      from prior antipsychotic medications and other prohibited concomitant medications. If the
      investigator may reasonably verify that subject has been off antipsychotics for at least 3～7
      days and has a history of tolerating aripiprazole, then the subject may have a screening
      phase of < 7 days as long as the subject has had at least a 3～7-day washout phase from other
      antipsychotic medications. Subjects are required to be hospitalized during the entire
      screening phase.

      12-week Acute Treatment Phase: At baseline, eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1
      ratio to either aripiprazole IM depot or aripiprazole tablet. For 14 days beginning with the
      first injection, subjects randomized aripiprazole IM depot will receive concomitant oral
      aripiprazole and subjects randomized to aripiprazole tablet will receive 12 weeks concomitant
      injection placebo.

      Safety Follow-up Phase: All subjects will be followed-up for safety via telephone contact
      14(±2) days after the last trial visit.
