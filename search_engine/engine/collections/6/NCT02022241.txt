      Medicine, Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Nanfang Hospital, affiliated with Southern
      Medical University for in vitro fertilization and/or intracytoplasmic sperm injection . Women
      at high risk of OHSS who received IVF and/or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI)
      treatment with a flexible GnRH antagonist protocol were recruited to participate in this
      study.

      All patients underwent standard ovarian stimulation protocol with gonadotropins, standard
      individualized adjustment of medication dose, and standard egg retrieval procedure. Patients
      were triggered with a single bolus of 0.2 mg triptorelin at night and had second injection of
      0.2 mg triptorelin 12 hours later when the criteria for administration of the ovulation
      trigger were met.
