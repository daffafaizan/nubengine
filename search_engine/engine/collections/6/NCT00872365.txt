        1. There is correlation between the metabolic factors, related to non-transmissible chronic
           diseases, of the mother and those of the newborn one.

        2. Supplementation with either micronutrients or physical exercise influence beneficially
           as much in the endothelial function, oxidative stress, the levels in adipokines of the
           mother and the newborn one like in the placental mitochondrial function.

        3. The simultaneous intervention with micronutrients or physical exercise produces an
           additional beneficial effect in the metabolic state of the mother and the newborn one.

        4. The metabolic alterations when being born are not exclusive of newborn with
           anthropometric measures located either in the inferior or superior percentiles.
