      volunteers, patients highly suspected to have acute GVHD (aGVHD) and requiring systemic
      therapy, and patients at high risk for developing GVHD.

      A total of 5 healthy volunteers will undergo [18F]F-AraG PET scans and blood sampling to
      better understand [18F]F-AraG biodistribution and stability in the body.

      A total of 10 highly suspected acute GVHD patients will be scanned following biopsy taken to
      confirm aGVHD. The staging and grading of the disease using the Glucksberg grade and
      International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry Severity Index (IBMTR) at time of enrollment
      will be noted. Biopsy tissues of consented patients will be analyzed further for T cell
      involvement.

      A total of 15 high-risk patients (recipients of myeloablative or reduced intensity allogeneic
      transplants using either bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cells from HLA-matched or
      HLA-mismatched related or unrelated donors-protocols 9142, 9022, 9924) will be recruited. All
      those that consent will undergo a PET-CT scan with [18F]FAraG on day 4 +/- 2 days post
      transplant. Additionally, these patients will be scanned again between day 14-21 post
      transplant. Follow up on these patients will note those that go on to develop aGVHD and the
      clinical end point will be correlated to the scans to verify the predictive potential of the
      radiotracer.
