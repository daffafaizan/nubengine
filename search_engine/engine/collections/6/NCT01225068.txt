      low back pain. A sample of 40 individuals with chronic low back pain will be enrolled in a
      double-blind, randomized, parallel group study comparing twice daily administration of
      milnacipran with placebo (total 100 mg bid-or equivalent placebo dosing). The study will last
      6 weeks with subjects being evaluated at the start of the study, at the end of a one-week
      drug-free period, and at 1, 2 and 6 weeks of treatment. Additionally, subjects will evaluated
      after treatment has ended. Both standard endpoint outcome measures as well as validated daily
      self-report measures of pain and activity/disability will be utilized.
