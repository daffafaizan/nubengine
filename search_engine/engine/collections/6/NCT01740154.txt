      I. To determine the mechanisms associated with sunitinib related fatigue by recording EMG
      signals during a submaximal elbow contraction, twitch force and TMS prior to and at the end
      of 4 weeks of sunitinib in metastatic RCC patients.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive sunitinib malate orally (PO) daily for 4 weeks. Patients undergo
      neuromuscular testing at baseline and on day 28 and complete fatigue assessment at baseline
      and on days 14 and 28.
