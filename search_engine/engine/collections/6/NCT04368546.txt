      (RTKIs) are increasingly used in oncology in several metastatic tumor types. These agents are
      featured by toxicities including hypertension. According to a new insight, sodium in response
      to a high dietary sodium intake, is accumulated in a hyperosmolar way in the interstitial
      compartment. In response to this high sodium concentration cells of the mononuclear
      phagocytic system (MPS) are activated resulting in an increased production of VEGF-C,
      activation of VEGF type 3 receptors and formation of a lymphatic capillary network, involved
      in clearance of interstitial sodium. Blockade of stimulation of VEGF-C receptors or depletion
      of MPS cells in rodents has been associated with salt-sensitive hypertension.

      Sunitinib is an orally-active, multitarget RTKI mainly used for the treatment of patients
      with metastatic renal cancer and imatinib-resistant gastrointestinal stromal tumors.
      Sunitinib blocks all three VEGF receptors subtypes, including VEGF-receptor type 3.

      The investigators hypothesize that treatment of patients with sunitinib is associated with
      tissue sodium accumulation and this accumulation contributes to the rise in blood pressure.
      Tissue sodium is measured by using a newly developed 23Na magnetic resonance-imaging (MRI)
      technique which allows a non-invasive and contrast agent-free sodium content measurement in
      the muscle and skin of the lower leg.
