      of its potent and rapid action starting as fast as 5 minutes after subcutaneous or
      intramuscular injection. Current instructions for the treatment of severe hypoglycaemia call
      for the immediate injection of 1 mg of glucagon subcutaneously or intramuscularly. Large dose
      of glucagon such as 1 mg subcutaneous is usually associated with undesirable side-effects
      such as nausea, vomiting, bloating and headache. Moreover, glucagon emergency kits are
      relatively expensive (around $100 per kit), thus increasing the financial burden of diabetes
      on patients and the health care system.

      The primary objective of this research project is to the study the pharmacological effects of
      different doses of glucagon injected subcutaneously to correct hypoglycaemia during
      controlled conditions mimicking a hypoglycaemic event in adults with type 1 diabetes. More
      specifically, we will be looking at the effects of subcutaneous glucagon injected at 0.1 or
      0.2 mg and 1.0 mg to normalized plasma glucose during a hypoglycaemic hyperinsulinemic clamp
      in subjects with type 1 diabetes.
