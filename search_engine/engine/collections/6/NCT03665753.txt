      Emergency Department (ED). Because of the Ketorolac significant analgesic potency, it is
      usually used for moderate-to-severe pain. However, ketorolac has several side effects, of
      which gastrointestinal hemorrhage is most concerning. "Analgesic ceiling" is defined as the
      dose beyond which no additional analgesia can be achieved and on the other hand, more side
      effects might be encountered. Several studies suggested 10 mg as analgesic ceiling. Despite
      this, many recommendations are still advocating several folds higher doses (e.g. 30, 60 mg).
