      receive Avastin by IV on day 1 of each 21-day cycle. If a patient has no grade 3 or 4
      toxicities after the 1st cycle, then the patient may continue the same doses of Tarceva and
      Avastin for another cycle. If the patient has response or stable disease after 6 weeks (2
      cycles), the patient may continue on the same doses of Tarceva and Avastin. A patient may
      receive treatment on this study for up to one year, unless his or her disease progresses or
      side effects become too severe.

      The starting dose is 100 mg daily of Tarceva and 7.5 mg/kg every 21 days of Avastin.
