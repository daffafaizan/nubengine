      permits obtaining reproducible proton and hyperpolarized helium (HHE) lung images. 3-Helium
      is obtained from a vendor and hyperpolarized using an optical spin transfer device (FDA
      Investigational New Drug (IND) 122,670) and administered through a valved inhalation device
      while in the MRI scanner. Images are obtained during an ~15 second inspiratory breath hold.
      Proton MRI images are similarly obtained during a breath hold with room air using an
      ultrashort echo time sequence. From these MRI images, lung volumes, alveolar sizes, and
      estimated alveolar numbers are derived. Subjects are reimaged at 1 year to evaluate changes
      in these parameters during normal lung growth (controls) or after PSF (AIS subjects).
