      Primary

        -  Determine the absorbed radiation doses of CNS lesions after administration of indium In
           111 ibritumomab tiuxetan (for imaging) in patients with recurrent primary CNS lymphoma.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the safety of a therapeutic dose of yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan in these
           patients.

      Tertiary

        -  Determine the radiographic response in patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive rituximab IV on day 1. Within 4 hours after rituximab
      administration, patients receive indium In 111 ibritumomab tiuxetan IV over 10 minutes.
      Patients then undergo whole body imaging. Patients whose dosimetry indicates that their CNS
      lesion would receive a sufficient radioimmunotherapy dose receive a therapeutic dose of
      yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan IV over 20-30 minutes on day 7.

      Patients are followed monthly for 3 months, every 3 months for 2 years, and then every 6
      months for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10 patients will be accrued for this study.
