      previously untreated patients with metastatic clear cell renal cancer. This study follows a
      Simon 2 stage design

      Patients will take pazopanib for 14 weeks followed by a nephrectomy. The drug will continue
      after nephrectomy until disease progression is documented. Patients will come off study once
      disease progression occurs, where they will then be followed for survival. Subsequent
      treatment at the discretion of the treating physician will be documented.

      After surgery, all patients will be radiologically evaluated 8 weekly until progression.
      Standard radical nephrectomy with lymph node dissection will be performed on those patients
      who are deemed operable. The surgery can be laparoscopic or open. Those not deemed suitable
      for nephrectomy after 14 weeks of treatment will be offered a repeat biopsy.
