      first phase 40 patients. The study will be performed in 3 European hospitals. Patients will
      be randomized to either the RF ablation strategy or to the medication arm.

      Hypothesis:

      As first line therapy, catheter ablation improves the long-term success, health-economic
      outcomes and is equally safe compared to the best anti-arrhythmic medication treatment in a
      selected group of patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.

      Primary endpoint:

        -  long-term success, defined as patients free from any atrial fibrillation during 24
           months after initial study treatment as determined by 7-days Holter and transtelephonic
           monitoring and by 12-lead ECG recordings.

      Secondary endpoints:

        -  AF burden: frequency and duration of episodes

        -  health-economic costs over 24 months

        -  serious adverse events

        -  Quality of Life scores, using SF-36 questionnaire
