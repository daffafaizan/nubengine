      studies showed a correlation between decreased frequency of alpha peaks and perceived pain.
      Furthermore, a correlation was found between high pain sensitivity and slower alpha
      oscillations during prolonged pain during 1 hour.

      To date, the effects of prolonged experimental pain during 24 hours on brain oscillations has
      not been explored. Moreover, it is unknown whether non invasive brain stimulation (NIBS)
      through transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can revert these pain-related feature.

      It is hypothesized that prolonged pain during 24 hours will reduce the frequency of alpha
      peaks and tDCS of the resting state motor network will revert it to baseline values.

      Furthermore, it is thought that decreased frequency of alpha peaks will be correlated with
      perceived pain intensity on Day 1 (before receiving the first tDCS session).
