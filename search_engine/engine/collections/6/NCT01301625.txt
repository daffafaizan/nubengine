    
      The MitraClip System ANZ Clinical Trial is a prospective, observational, single arm,
      multicenter trial to evaluate the MitraClip device for the treatment of mitral regurgitation
      (MR). Patients will be enrolled at up to 15 investigational sites throughout Australia and
      New Zealand. Up to 150 patients will be enrolled. Patients will be considered enrolled when
      local or general anesthesia is administered for the MitraClip procedure. Patients will be
      followed at discharge, 30 days, 6 months, 12 months and 24 months.

      Investigational sites will recruit consecutive patients who meet trial enrollment criteria.
      Until enrollment in the MitraClip System ANZ Clinical Trial is closed, all patients who
      undergo a procedure for placement of a MitraClip device at an investigational site should be
      enrolled in the MitraClip System ANZ Clinical Trial.
