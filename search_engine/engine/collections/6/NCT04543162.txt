      known. These are, for example, GFAP (Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein), UCH-L1 (Ubiquitine
      Carboxy Terminal Hydrolase L1), NSE (Neurone Specific Enolase), Tau, SBDP (Spectrin Breakdown
      Products) or NFL (Neurofilament) protein. To date, the too limited number of studies doesn't
      enable the use of these biomarkers routinely. Therefore we will study the interest of these
      biomarkers in the management of adult patients' mTBI. We wish to set a collection of
      biological samples drawn from 1500 patients consulting for mTBI (with a medium risk of
      intracranial complications) at the Emergency Department of Clermont-Ferrand University
      Hospital, and requiring an assay of the S100B protein.

      The study will take place over a period of 36 months at Clermont-Ferrand University Hospital.
      Patients cared for mTBI when they come to the Emergency Department will be recruited
      according to the inclusion criteria. In case of no opposition, when having their blood drawn,
      one more tube will be drawn per patient. Then, the obtained serum will be frozen at -80 Â° C
      for the next assays of the cerebral biomarkers such as: GFAP, UCH-L1, NSE, Tau, SBDP, NFL,
      etc. A later 2-weeks' telephone call after the head trauma will be made by a member of the
      staff of the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics.
