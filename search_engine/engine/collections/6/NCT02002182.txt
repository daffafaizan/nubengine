    
      This is an investigator-initiated prospective clinical study of patients with stage I-IV
      squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx (OPSCC) who are to undergo ablative transoral
      robotic surgery (TORS).

      There is a vaccination group and a control group in this study.

      Subjects in the control group will not receive the vaccination and will only be followed
      after TORS surgery for additional research blood tests to measure how their immune system is
      working.

      Subjects in the vaccination group will receive two vaccinations prior to surgery. The first
      dose will be about 33 days before surgery, and the second will be about 14 days before
      surgery.

      Participation in this study will also include allowing the research team to take several
      blood samples from the subject at various times before, during, and after treatment for
      his/her cancer.

      Vaccination subjects will be monitored closely after treatment and includes 6 months of oral
      antibiotics.
