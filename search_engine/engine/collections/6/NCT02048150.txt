    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the preferred imaging dose (if any), based on image quality
      and correlation with pathological findings, of intravenously administered MDX1201-A488 in a
      dose-escalating study (doses of 5 and 15 mg) in patients with moderate to high-risk prostate
      cancer prior to undergoing robotic assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP), subject to
      predetermined safety stopping rules.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Correlate intra-operative optical imaging (IOOI) findings with
      pre-operative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings and clinical staging.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive anti-PSMA monoclonal antibody
      MDX1201-A488 intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 and undergo IOOI during RALP on day
      5.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4-7 weeks, 3 months, 6
      months, 9 months, and 1 year.
