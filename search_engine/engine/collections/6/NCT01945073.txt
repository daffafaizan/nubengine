    
      In this inquiry, we wish to apply an educational intervention to determine if there are any
      improvements in disease knowledge as a result among adolescents attending the Sickle Cell
      Unit (SCU) in Jamaica. We also wish to examine if knowledge, and any changes in knowledge,
      will each have any association with Quality of Life (QOL) and their perceptions of their
      illness (IP).

      Our specific hypotheses are:

        1. Important predictors of knowledge among adolescents with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) are
           gender, age, education of the adolescent as well as of the parents, socioeconomic
           status, frequency of attendance at SCU, rural/urban residence, and disease severity.

        2. The intervention involving training using an educational booklet specific to 'teens
           living with SCD' will improve knowledge among the adolescents

        3. Adding 'individual Counselling' to the intervention will increase the benefits

        4. Improvements in knowledge will translate to improvements in QOL and positive IPs.
