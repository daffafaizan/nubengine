    
      The devices under investigation, NAVIGO 4LV models Pilot, 2D , and ARC are the new
      quadripolar coronary venous leads with polyurethane lead body, intended to be used with
      defibrillators with ventricular resynchronization therapy.

      The new lead design with the presence of 4 electrodes that allows several combinations in
      programming pacing vectors, is intended to benefit both the patients by improving response to
      therapy, overcoming high pacing threshold and avoiding phrenic nerve stimulation, and the
      investigators by reducing the number of re-interventions needed.

      This clinical investigation is a pre-market release study intended to analyze safety and
      electrical performance of NAVIGO 4LV leads pre-shaped (S-shaped & U-shaped) and Straight
      leads models. The primary endpoint data will be used to support the achievement of the CE
      mark of NAVIGO 4LV leads.

      The primary endpoints will be evaluated at 1 month post-implantation; secondary endpoints
      will be evaluated up to 2 years post-implantation. The duration of patient inclusion will be
      approximately 10 months for pre-shaped NAVIGO family (S-shaped &U-shaped) and approximately
      21 months for straight ones.

      The post implant follows-up visits will take place at Hospital discharge, weeks 10, 6 months
      and every 6 months until 2 years.
