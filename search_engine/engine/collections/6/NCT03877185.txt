    
      A randomized prospective study focusing on infertile women undergoing ovarian stimulation for
      IVF, using Elonva (corifollitropin alfa) as part of two different stimulation protocols.

      Women assigned to Protocol A receive a bolus late luteal dose of Degarelix, a new long acting
      GnRH antagonist, a sole Elonva injection in the evening of day 3 of the cycle, followed by
      the administration of a single dose of triggering agent (GnRH agonist or hCG a, according to
      the individual response).

      Women assigned to Protocol B are administered a single dose of Elonva (corifollitropin alfa)
      on day 2 of the cycle, followed by daily GnRH antagonist doses, fixed on day 7 of the cycle.
      Ovulation triggering is the same as in group A, with either GnRH agonist or hCG a,
      accordingly.

      Live Birth Rates are estimated for both groups of patients. The number of the formed
      blastocysts in each group is measured, as well.
