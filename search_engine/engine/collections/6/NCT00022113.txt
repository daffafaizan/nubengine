      I. Determine the toxic effects and maximum tolerated dose of EMD 121974 in patients with
      advanced solid tumors.

      II. Determine the biologic activity of this drug in these patients. III. Determine the
      pharmacokinetic profile and plasma biological effects of this drug and identify any
      relationship with its biologic activity or observed toxicity in these patients.

      IV. Determine, preliminarily, the antitumor efficacy of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive EMD 121974 IV over 1 hour twice weekly. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-10 patients receive escalating doses of EMD 121974 until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.
