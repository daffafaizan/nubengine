      hypertonia, atherosclerosis, neuropathy, diabetic retinopathy, and further more.

      Increased vascular rigidity, which is based on the increased stiffness of vessels caused by
      vascular damage leads to an increase of pulse wave velocity. This assumption is based on the
      Moens-Korteweg-equation which is calculated using the modus of arterial vessel elasticity,
      arterial vessel wall thickness, the arterial radius and blood viscosity.
