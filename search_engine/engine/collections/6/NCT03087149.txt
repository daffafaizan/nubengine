      rickets or decreased bone mass mineral density. Recently multiple studies have been published
      on vit D adjust biological functions. Dosage, safety and effectiveness of vitD
      supplementation in preterm infants still remains a controversial topic. We hypothesize that
      monitored supplementation of vit D is more effective and safer than standard therapy 500IU in
      preterm infants. The study will be carried out in 138 preterm infants, born at 24-32 week of
      gestational age (GA) at the Princess Anne's Hospital in Warsaw, Poland. We will determine if
      monitored supplementation of vit D decreases the incidence of vit D deficiency and/or
      overdosing at 40 week (GA). For secondary objective we shall assess if monitored therapy
      reduces the incidence of vit D deficiency and/or overdosing at 35, 52 week (GA), prevalence
      of osteopenia, low bone mass, nephrocalcinosis and nephrolithiasis.
