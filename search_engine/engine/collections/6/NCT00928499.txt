      nerve root (typically S3), and an implantable pulse generator (IPG) that the lead wire is
      attached to. The IPG provides the electrical impulse and has several parameters that are
      amenable to adjustment including rate, strength and length of stimulation. Additionally, the
      stimulation can be programmed to be continuous or cyclic. If the therapy is equally
      efficacious at both settings, the cyclic setting has the advantage of resulting in a longer
      battery life. This would prolong the time interval between IPG replacements which would
      reduce the number of times a patient is exposed to a surgical procedure and may have a
      substantial impact on reducing cost to the healthcare system.

      Participants will be randomized into one of two groups: either cyclic stimulation or
      continuous stimulation after IPG placement and will continue with this setting for four
      weeks. Subjects will return to the office 4 weeks post-op. They will complete a 3-day
      consecutive voiding diary just prior to their study visit. The subject will then undergo
      reprogramming to change the stimulation to the alternate pattern (from cyclic to continuous
      or vice versa as appropriate) keeping all other parameters the same. Subjects will be asked
      to return to the office 4 weeks after being switched to the alternate setting. She will
      complete a 3-day consecutive voiding diary just prior to the visit. The subject will also be
      asked their preference of mode of stimulation and the reason for their choice. After this
      visit, the participant will be switched to the mode of stimulation that is most efficacious
      for her.
