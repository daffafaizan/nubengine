      I. Histologic assessment of cancer kill in the post high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU)
      needle biopsy and excised treated lobe 2-4 weeks after treatment with HIFU.

      II. Radiologic assessment of areas suspicious for residual cancer in the treated lobe on
      multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) and/or contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS)
      2-4 weeks post-HIFU (immediately prior to radical prostatectomy).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assessment of differences in tumor microenvironment, specifically upregulation of the
      immune system, before and after HIFU treatment on both the treated and untreated lobes.

      II. Assessment of HIFU parameters needed to achieve dose-escalation, in the event that such
      escalation is needed per our study design.

      OUTLINE:

      HIFU PHASE: Participants undergo mpMRI and CEUS pre-HIFU treatment and then CEUS post-HIFU
      treatment. Participants then undergo HIFU treatment over 2-2.5 hours.

      PROSTATECTOMY PHASE: Within 2-4 weeks post-HIFU treatment, participants undergo mpMRI 1-2
      days prior to radical prostatectomy. On the day of surgery, participants undergo CEUS prior
      to radical prostatectomy.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 3 months.
