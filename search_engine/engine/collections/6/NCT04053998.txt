    
      Pancreatoduodenectomy (PD) with portal vein resection (PVR) is performed for the achievement
      of complete resection (R0) in patients with locally advanced pancreatic head lesions. Despite
      most commonly performed in high-volume pancreatic surgery centers by experienced surgeons,
      best achievable outcomes, such as morbidity and mortality, following such complex procedure
      remain unknown.

      The aim is to conduct a retrospective multicenter cohort study to define benchmark values for
      best achievable outcomes following duodenopancreatectomy (DP) with portal vein resection
      (PVR).

      Data collection and study design are based on to the well established standardized reporting
      for benchmarking (Sánchez-Velázquez et. al. Ann Surg, February 2019 ).

      This multicenter cohort study will include all consecutive pancreaticoduodenectomies with
      portal vein resections from at least 20 high volume centers performing over 50 pancreatic
      operations per year or 150 cases within 3 years from at least 3 continents over a period of
      10 years (2009-2019). Every center included in the study must have a prospective database
      from which data can be collected as well as previous publications critically reporting on
      their outcome.
