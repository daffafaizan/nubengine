      contributes to IBS, and that increasing the mass of beneficial species may reduce the numbers
      of pathogenic bacteria and help alleviate symptoms.

      Methods: In this double-blind trial 360 adult patients with moderate-to-severe symptomatic
      diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D) were randomized to treatment with the multi-strain probiotic
      (Bio-KultÂ®; 14 different bacterial strains; 8 billion colony-forming units per day) or
      placebo for 16 weeks. The change in severity and frequency of abdominal pain was the primary
      outcome measure.
