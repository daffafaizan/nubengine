      in patients with Alzheimer Disease (AD) using a conceptual framework that combines current
      vestibular physical therapy (VPT) practice guidelines with the latest motor learning theories
      for cognitively-impaired patients. The modified VPT protocol for AD patients was developed by
      experts in VPT and motor learning in AD and will be tested. This pilot study will provide
      much-needed data about whether VPT can be adapted for patients with AD, and whether VPT shows
      promise in improving or stabilizing balance, spatial cognition, and gait function in patients
      with AD.
