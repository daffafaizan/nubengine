      study in patients with a diagnosis of chronic inflammatory demyelinating
      polyradiculoneuropathy and treated with IVIg, corticosteroids, or both therapies prior to
      study entry. Patients meeting the eligibility criteria were randomly assigned in a ratio of
      1:1 to receive oral fingolimod (0.5 mg/day) or matching placebo.

      The study consisted of 3 periods: a Screening Period, a Double-blind Treatment Period and a
      Follow-up Period after discontinuation of study drug treatment. Patients who complete the
      study will have an option to enter an extension.
