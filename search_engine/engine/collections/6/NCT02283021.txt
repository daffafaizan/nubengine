      gated calcium subunits, found normally in neurons. Furthermore sequence analysis of these
      subunits has shown that modifications have occurred.

      The aim of the study in NSCLC patients is to sequence and clone the calcium channel subunits
      expressed in their tumor. Expression and Sequence will be compared between the normal and
      cancerous lung tissue for each patient.
