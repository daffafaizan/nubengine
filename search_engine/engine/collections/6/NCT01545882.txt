    
      This is a phase II study of a GnRH antagonist drug, Degarelix, for use in hormone resistant
      prostate cancer patients who have had biochemical PSA progression despite the use of total
      androgen blockade therapy. Patients will receive at least six monthly injections of Degarelix
      unless the patient shows radiographic or symptomatic disease progression, intolerable
      toxicity or decides to withdraw from the study. Patients will be evaluated for measures of
      efficacy, toxicity and disease progression during treatment and afterwards until
      radiologically confirmed metastatic disease progression or until the patient is removed from
      the study.

      Overall objective:

      The efficacy of Degarelix as a treatment for HRPC will be evaluated
