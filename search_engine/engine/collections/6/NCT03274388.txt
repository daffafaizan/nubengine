      leading to a loss of appetite, as well as to metabolic and hormonal changes. Consequences
      hereof are a decreased food uptake, a deteriorated nutrient utilization and a loss of
      muscles, with or without fat loss leading to cachexia. Especially muscle loss has a relevant
      influence on morbidity and mortality of chronic liver patients. The loss of muscle is
      probably due to a deteriorated protein synthesis with concurrent anabolic resistance. These
      pathologic processes increase the protein requirements of chronic liver patients
      dramatically.

      The purpose of this study is to establish an innovative combined therapy involving optimized
      nutritional therapy and highly effective muscle training by personalized whole-body
      electromyostimulation (WB-EMS) exercise to improve the quality of life (QLQ) of patients with
      serious chronic disease. An improvement of QLQ results from an increase in muscle mass and
      strength, thereby increasing physical activity, physical capability as well as tolerance to
      and applicability of therapy. In the course of a 3-months intervention study the efficacy of
      a combined German-guidelines-recommended protein-rich nutritional therapy with an innovative
      exercise therapy will be documented for patients with chronic liver disease. An effective
      stopping of the progress of muscle wasting or even increase of muscle mass, strength and
      function in the patients of the trial would benefit each patient and his family individually,
      since it could mean a considerable improvement in his QLQ and tolerability of therapeutical
      treatment.
