    
      The CHP registry consists of uniform data to evaluate the outcomes of military beneficiaries
      at CVD risk. These uniform data include variables (clinical, lifestyle, traditional,
      non-traditional, objective and subjective) that are used to assess a CVD risk profile and the
      effects of TLC. All data are collected in the course of the clinical CHP.

      Data are comprised of demographic information; past and intercurrent medical history
      including risk factors of CVD such as coronary artery disease (CAD), carotid disease,
      peripheral arterial disease, aortic aneurysm hypertension, diabetes and sleep apnea; smoking,
      alcohol and drug use history; family history of CVD and other chronic diseases; deployment
      history, injuries and occupational exposures; mental health history including PTSD,
      depression and anxiety; lifestyle information comprised of self-reported dietary patterns,
      exercise activities, stress levels, and sleep habits; physical examination including vital
      signs, body mass index, waist circumference and per cent body fat; laboratory data routinely
      requested by the CHP for risk assessment of all patients entering the program is comprised of
      total cholesterol, cholesterol fractions, fasting glucose, fasting insulin, hemoglobin A1C,
      highly sensitive C-reactive protein, and vitamin D levels; and CV diagnostic tests such as
      EKG, echocardiogram, cardiac stress testing; and sleep testing.

      Data are measured at baseline (CHP enrollment), completion of onsite CHP (6 months) and after
      follow-up of the telephonic coaching phase (approximately 1 year). Data may also be collected
      annually for up to 5 years if available.
