      effectiveness of Smartphone-linked versus standard HBPM for helping patients with
      uncontrolled hypertension achieve a reduction in their Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP), and
      patient satisfaction with the device. We aim to enroll 2000 patients who will be randomized
      in a 1:1 ratio to receive a Smartphone-linked or standard HBPM. We will use data from the
      electronic health record (EHR), an online patient portal, and the home BP monitor (in the
      Smartphone-linked arm) to collect outcome data for a period of at least 6 months (for the
      primary outcome), and up to 18 months (for secondary outcomes, depending on enrollment date).
      The primary BP control outcome will be reduction in SBP, by clinic measurements, at 6 months.
      The primary patient satisfaction outcome will be the Net Promoter Score derived from
      self-reported likelihood of recommending the device to a friend, at 6 months.
