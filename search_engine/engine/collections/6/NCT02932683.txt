      neonatal resuscitation.

      To ensure that the differences in outcome of Neonatal Life Support (NLS) learning are
      attributable to MedNav only, a simple randomisation process was carried out just prior to
      testing, where candidates pulled out a folded piece of paper assigning them to either

        1. No MedNav on performing NLS (control arm)

        2. Assistance of MedNav when performing NLS

      Blinding/masking was not possible for either the candidate or faculty as the testing process
      involved the use of a tablet device to display the MedNav system.

      On entering the room, candidates stated whether they were using MedNav or not. Each candidate
      was given an identical neonatal resuscitation scenario and technical skills in neonatal
      resuscitation were assessed using a 12-point mark sheet adapted from the Neonatal Life
      Support course provided by the UK Resuscitation Council. After testing, all candidates were
      asked to assess their confidence in performing NLS using a seven point Likert scale.

      Candidates were subsequently invited back for a follow-up session at 7 weeks. Testing of the
      same NLS scenario was undertaken with participants staying in their initial allocation
      groups. Again technical skills were assessed based on the UK resuscitation council mark sheet
      and candidates were asked to rate their confidence on NLS after.

      For further analysis, a small sample of 9 students from the "non-MedNav" group were asked to
      perform NLS with the use of MedNav immediately after their secondary testing at 7 weeks. The
      investigators aim here was to assess if this crossover group had a significant improvement in
      their task completion owing largely to the use of MedNav.
