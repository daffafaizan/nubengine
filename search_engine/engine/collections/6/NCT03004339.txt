    
      This is a two-center, randomized, placebo- and active comparator-controlled trial that will
      be double-blind for the investigational products (IPs) and observer-blind for the active
      comparator with intra-individual comparison of treatments. Twelve male and post-menopausal
      female volunteer subjects, aged 18 years or older, with psoriasis vulgaris and mild or
      moderate chronic plaque(s) in a stable phase and an area sufficient for six treatment fields,
      will be enrolled. SOR007 Ointment will be administered topically at four concentrations
      (0.15%, 0.3%, 1%, and 2%), in addition to a placebo ointment (SOR007 without the active
      pharmaceutical ingredient) and an active comparator, TaclonexÂ® Ointment (calcipotriene 0.005
      % and betamethasone dipropionate 0.064 %). Treatments will be administered once daily, 10
      times over a 12-day trial period. Assessments will include safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and
      preliminary efficacy as determined by measurement of psoriatic infiltrate using 22-megahertz
      (MHz) sonography as well as clinical scoring on a 5-point scale. Subjects who withdraw early
      for reasons unrelated to investigational product adverse events (AEs) will be replaced.
