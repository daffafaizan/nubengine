      volunteered to participate in the study, complying with the inclusion criteria and signed the
      consent paper will be randomly allocated into ES and Sham ES groups.

      The study includes women aged 18-65 diagnosed with staged 1-2 POP by the physician.All
      patients were evaluated by the same doctor who performed the POP-Q measurement, who was
      blinded to the baseline results. The treatment of patients will be given by the same
      therapist. Measurements will be made 3 times at baseline (before treatment), interim period
      (4th week) and after treatment.
