      who use the Vanderbilt Specialty Pharmacy (VSP) will be generated daily for patients with a
      Proportion of Days Covered (PDC) < 90% in the previous 4 and 12 months based on pharmacy
      claims. Patients who meet criteria will be randomized to receive an intervention by an
      adherence specialist (pharmacist) or to receive normal clinical care. For patients who are
      randomized to receive an intervention, the adherence specialist will review their medication
      fill history and electronic health record to identify potential reasons for nonadherence or
      to see if the pharmacy claims inappropriately categorize them as non-adherent (this could be
      due to holding treatment for a clinical reason, transferring the prescription outside of VSP
      or other reasons listed in Table 2). After reviewing the patients pharmacy and medical
      history, if the adherence specialist believes they should be taking treatment as prescribed,
      but are not (classified as truly nonadherent), she will contact the patient to identify
      potential reasons for nonadherence and intervene to improve adherence based on the identified
      reasons for nonadherence. Adherence rates for those receiving the additional adherence
      specialist and those receiving standard of care will be calculated 8 months after the date of
      randomization. The reasons for nonadherence and the intervention to improve adherence rates
      will be documented in a secured REDCap database. It is important to note that the adherence
      specialist is not study staff, but a full time employee of the Vanderbilt Specialty Pharmacy
      performing her normal functions. The randomization to receive these services or not will
      allow for evaluation of their efficacy.
