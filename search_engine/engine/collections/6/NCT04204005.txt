    
      ProLowCKD is a single-centre, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised study. At
      enrolment (T0) participants were prescribed a LPD in addition to their ongoing
      pharmacological therapy and according to their comorbidities; after 2 months (T2) they were
      randomized in accordance to a 1:1 ratio to receive probiotics or placebo for other 3 months
      (T5) in addition to the continuation of LPD. Enrolled subjects are invited to assume two
      doses of probiotic/placebo for 1 month and 1 dose for 2 months.

      Randomization is 1:1 to receive odd- or even envelopes, according to the odd- or even
      registration number at enrolment.

      Neither the clinician nor the patient knows the content of the odd- and even envelopes.

      The evaluations will be performed according to the following schedule: at T0 nephrological
      evaluation and biochemical analysis, dietary counselling, illustration of protocol and
      signing of the informed consent, administration of the SF36 questionnaire, body composition
      evaluation by bioimpedentiometry. At T0, T2, T5: blood biochemical parameters: haemoglobin,
      urea, creatinine, mean urea and creatinine clearance, CKD and MDRD calculation, sodium,
      potassium, uric acid, calcium, phosphate, PTH, acid-base balance, CRP, albumin, PC, IS,
      Lp-PLA2, LPS; 24h-urine biochemical parameters: urea, creatinine, sodium, proteins; microbial
      stools analysis; clinical nephrological and dietitian evaluation.
