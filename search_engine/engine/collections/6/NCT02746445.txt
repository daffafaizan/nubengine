      subjects with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) who received Magnetic EEG/ECG-Guided Resonance
      Therapy (MeRT) in the IRB approved clinical trial. A total of twenty-eight (28) subjects will
      be followed in this study. After providing informed consent, twenty-eight (28) subjects who
      participated in the previous protocol will be observed for up to three (3) years post-MeRT
      treatment. During this period, subjects will be evaluated at 104 and 156 weeks post-MeRT
      treatment.
