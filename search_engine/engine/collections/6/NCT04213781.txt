      enrolled in this study and their anxiety level will be collected via a questionnaire.

      After randomization, patients will either benefit from audiovisual distraction using HappyMed
      Video Glasses, (medical device with CE marking), or from the usual management during
      procedure. The anaesthesiologist will check that no anxiolytic or sedative drug was given 12
      hours before anaesthesia. The patients will be stratified according to whether or not a
      previous intervention was performed. Anaesthesia will be started and maintained with
      administration of sufentanil (0.1 Î¼g/kg) and propofol (using the Dixon's up-and-down method).
      The aim is a patient who spontaneously ventilates and does not react to gynaecological
      stimulation. Prevention of postoperative pain and nausea/vomiting will be carried out at the
      initiation of the surgical procedure. The effect of these drugs is longer than the
      intervention duration and will not influence the protocol.
