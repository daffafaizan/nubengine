      wall can significantly alter the electrocardiogram. Induction of ventricular ectopy is
      important in determining the focus of the arrhythmogenic tissue during an electrophysiology
      (EP) procedure; however, instrumentation with stiff ablation catheters can temporarily
      eliminate VT during the mapping portion of the procedure making it difficult to track the
      arrhythmia prior to ablating the tissue responsible for its genesis. The catheters used with
      the Stereotaxis Magnetic Navigation System (MNS) are less stiff compared to manual catheters
      since no pull wires are required to deflect the distal tip. Large external magnets positioned
      on either side of the EP procedure table create a magnetic field within the patient's chest.
      These large magnets (in direct relationship to the magnetic field) can be manipulated using
      specialized software. The physician controls the distal tip of the catheter by using the
      software while remotely using a catheter advancing system (QuickCASÂ®, Stereotaxis, Inc, St.
      Louis, MO) to reach the desired location within the heart. The soft catheters may provide a
      unique quality to the electrophysiologist who may assist by providing accurate maps without
      temporarily eliminating the ventricular ectopy due to excessive mechanical forces applied to
      the cardiac tissue. This study will assess the physician's ability to appropriately map and
      ablate the ventricular substrate using remote magnetic technology. All devices are approved
      by FDA and no off-label use of the products is mandated within the protocol.
