    
      Patients with high-risk resectable cSCC who have yet to undergo definitive surgery will be
      eligible to enroll. Patients with nodal and/or in-transit relapse including those who have
      received prior adjuvant RT are eligible to enroll. This trial excludes patients who have
      received either nivolumab or pembrolizumab or other anti-PD-(L)1 therapy. Suitable patients
      will be identified pre-operatively. Patients will undergo a 28-day screening evaluation
      consisting of systemic staging scans, tumor biopsy, and blood studies to confirm suitability.
      Once enrolled, patients will receive pembrolizumab peri-operatively for 6 weeks (200mg Q3Wq3;
      2 cycles) prior to definitive surgery (Neoadjuvant Phase). Following peri-operative therapy,
      patients will undergo restaging scans and surgical evaluation followed by definitive surgical
      resection (Surgical Phase). Post-operatively, patients will receive 15 further cycles of
      pembrolizumab over a 45-week period (200mg q3Q3W) (Adjuvant Phase). In the post-operative
      period, if patients are deemed eligible for RT, this will be administered concurrently with
      pembrolizumab. The total duration of pembrolizumab therapy is 1 year (52 weeks).
