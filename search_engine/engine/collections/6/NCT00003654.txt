      nodal basin is valid in staging breast cancer. II. Determine the sensitivity of combined
      methods of identification of sentinel lymph nodes by patent blue V dye and gamma probe
      detection in these women.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive patent blue V dye injection peritumorally prior to surgery.
      Preoperative lymphoscintigraphy is performed using technetium Tc 99 sulfur rhenium colloid
      injected around the tumor associated with intraoperative gamma probe detection. Nonpalpable
      tumors receive a localized injection using stereotactic injection techniques. Patients then
      undergo standard axillary (level I and II) lymph node dissection.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 200 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
