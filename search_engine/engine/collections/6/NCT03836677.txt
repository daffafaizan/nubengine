    
      This is a randomised, controlled, two period cross-over, 4 weeks chronic dosing, study to
      evaluate the effects of Budesonide/Glycopyrronium/Formoterol Fumarate (BGF), and
      Glycopyrronium/Formoterol Fumarate (GFF), on specific image based airway volumes and
      resistance in subjects with moderate to severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. In this
      study, airway dimension parameters will be calculated for each of the active compounds.

      This imaging methodology will allow an assessment of the extent of airway changes using a
      triple combination of Budesonide/Glycopyrronium/Formoterol Fumarate (BGF) and the dual
      combination Glycopyrronium/Formoterol Fumarate (GFF).
