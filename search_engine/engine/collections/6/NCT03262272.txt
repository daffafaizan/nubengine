      Schema

      Details of the cross-over plan :

      8 patients will be treated successively with the 4 hemodialyzers. Patients will be treated
      with the dialyzer "test" for the two first sessions of the week. During the last dialysis
      session of each week, only their usual dialyzer will be used as wash-out. A randomization
      will define the order of use of the dialyzers in the 4 centers. This order will be identical
      in a center.

      Number of patients :

      32 (8 patients per center (4 centers))

      Duration :

      One week per dialyzer
