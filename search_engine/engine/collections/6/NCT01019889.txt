      incur a significant health burden on populations in terms of human suffering and economic
      losses. Usually, antibiotic therapy is not helpful since most infections are virally induced.
      Over 200 serologically different viral types are responsible for human URTIs, so that
      preventions of URTIs including vaccination are impassable. SCRT and YPS are widely used to
      treat the respiratory disease. The objective of this study is to determine the efficacy of
      SCRT and YPS in symptomatic relief of patients with URTIs.
