      participant is receiving), placebo-controlled (an inactive substance; a pretend treatment
      [with no drug in it] that is compared in a clinical trial with a drug to test if the drug has
      a real effect), randomized (study drug assigned by chance), multi-center (when more than one
      hospital or medical school team work on a medical research study), parallel-group study. The
      study consists of 3 Parts; Screening Phase of 90 days, double-blind Treatment Phase of 6
      months and Follow-up Phase of 7 to 28 days following the last dose in Month 6. Eligible
      participants in the early (predementia) AD spectrum will be randomized to either Treatment
      group 1, 2 or placebo and participants who previously participated in study 54861911ALZ1005
      will be enrolled in this study and will receive the same treatment as in study
      54861911ALZ1005. The study duration for each participant will be approximately 10 months.
      Blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples will be collected to evaluate the plasma
      pharmacokinetics of JNJ-54861911, as well as amyloid beta fragments. Participants' safety
      will be monitored throughout the study, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
      cognitive measures.
