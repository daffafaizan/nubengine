      moisturizer with sunscreen SPF 50+ for the potential to induce contact sensitization by
      repetitive applications, healthy subjects received 9 applications at 48 to 72 hour intervals
      of the moisturizer to the upper back. Patches were remained on the skin for approximately 48
      to 72 hours. Twelve to 24 days after the previous applications, subjects were patched with
      the moisturizer at the original site and an alternative site for 48 hours.
