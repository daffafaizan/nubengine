      randomized into each group Conventional Laparoscopic Hysterectomy (Group #1) and
      Robot-Assisted Laparoscopic Hysterectomy (Group #2) using a random number generator. Data
      collection will occur during the following points of patient interaction: pre-operative
      appointment, the surgical procedure, the patient's hospitalization, first post-operative
      appointment, and final post-operative appointment.

      The care for the patients enrolled in this study will not deviate from the standard care of
      patients who are currently undergoing laparoscopic and robot-assisted laparoscopic
      hysterectomy. The patients who present to the office for pre-operative history and physical
      examination for laparoscopic hysterectomy will be counseled about participation in this
      study. Basic data collection will commence at the pre-operative visiting, including: patient
      demographics, past medical history, past surgical history, physical exam findings, and
      imaging results. The pre-operative appointment will occur between one to thirty days prior to
      surgery. Intra-operative and immediate post-operative data will be collected by the surgical
      assistant (resident or fellow) and will include surgical procedure (conventional laparoscopic
      or robot-assisted), operative time, hematocrit, estimated blood loss, length of stay, and
      complications.
