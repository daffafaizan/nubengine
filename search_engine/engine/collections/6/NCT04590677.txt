      preterm birth are multifactorial and include stretch, oxidative stress, inflammation,
      infection and thrombosis. 85% of women have no identifiable risk factors for preterm birth
      and there is a requirement to develop a biomarker which can be used early in pregnancy to
      identify such women at risk. Equally important is to have a detection tool which will allow
      us to offer an individualised approach to preterm birth prevention and the women to benefit
      personalised surveillance and timely preventative measures such as cervical cerclage or
      progesterone.

      The aim of this study is to collect samples from pregnant women in order to identify
      biomarkers that relate to onset of spontaneous preterm labour. We will use maternal blood,
      urine and vaginal secretion to look for biomarkers in these samples which can be use in the
      clinical setting to determine which women will go on to give birth preterm. This will allow
      clinicians to correctly identify these women and initiate treatment in the right woman to
      prevent preterm labour and birth. Equally important it will reduce unnecessary intervention
      and admission in those women who are not at risk.
