      the abnormal red blood cells that are found in patients with severe thalassemia or sickle
      cell disease.

      We will do this by using three drugs: busulfan, cyclophosphamide, and CAMPATH-1H. CAMPATH-IH
      is an investigational drug. CAMPATH-1H is used to prevent participants from rejecting or
      refusing to let the donor blood cells grow in the body. After the drug treatment,
      participants will be given bone marrow from a brother or sister who has healthy bone marrow
      that matches.
