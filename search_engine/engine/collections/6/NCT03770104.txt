      depth of insertion of endotracheal tube (ETT) at the time of oral intubation. Minor
      differences in tube length may lead to intubation of the right main bronchus or extubation.
      However, none of them has shown to be better than others when compared in the context of
      randomized clinical trials.

      Commonly, clinicians use a formula based on the newborn's weight (Tochen formula: ETT
      insertion depth (cm)=6 + wt (kg)). While this method is widely used and recommended by
      international guidelines, it has been found to frequently result in incorrectly positioned
      tubes, especially in infants <1000 g in weight in whom it may lead to overestimation of ETT
      insertion depth.

      On the other hand, Spanish Society of Neonatology recommended in their last published
      guidelines (2017) to use an alternative version formula (ETT insertion depth (cm)=5.5 + wt
      (kg)), which is commonly used among Spanish neonatal units.

      Finally, no studies have been performed in newborns who require oral intubation in the
      delivery room, since these intubations are usually excluded because infants are not routinely
      weighed prior to resuscitation and weight can not be rapidly obtained. Given that Obstetric
      Unit in our hospital is a high standard one with a highly reliable estimated fetal weight in
      prenatal ultrasound, the investigators will use estimated fetal weight referred on
      ultrasounds or 50th percentile for gestational age for calculations.
