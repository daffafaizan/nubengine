      first visit to the pre-natal centres. They will be monitored at regular intervals, blood
      samples will be taken and they will be asked about compliance and any adverse reactions.

      Approx 8 weeks after delivery, the women will come to the pre-natal centres for a check-up.
      During this visit, a blood sample will be drawn and a breast milk sample will be collected.

      The blood samples will be analysed for haemoglobin, serum ferritin, vitamin D and DHA. The
      breast milk samples will be analysed for vitamin D and DHA.
