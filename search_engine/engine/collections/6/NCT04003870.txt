      study was to compare two clinically applied treatment options: Customized arch support
      orthoses (CASO) and orthotic heel lift (HL) on the effect of ATL in recreational runners with
      pronated feet. It implicated to provide a better understanding of the types of foot orthoses
      for flatfeet runners and additional biomechanical evidence for the clinical field to guide
      orthotic prescription as well as selection for Achilles tendinopathy management.
