      unresponsive to conservative medical management since it was shown as a safe and effective
      alternative to hysterectomy.(2,3) Monopolar resectoscope necessitates an irrigating fluid
      that should be a non-conductive and salt free solution such as glycine 1.5% or sorbitol
      3%.(4) Physiologic irrigating fluids (e.g. saline 0.9%) are contraindicated with these
      instruments since electric current generated by any monopolar electro surgical unit is
      preferentially conducted through low impedance fluid rather than through tissue and
      consequently it's difficult to initiate cutting and impossible to create significant tissue
      coagulation with these devices The clinical drawback of non-conductive irrigating solution
      (e.g. glycine 1.5%) is the risk of excessive fluid absorption leading to symptomatic
      dilutional hyponatremia and for hypotonic solutions, hypo-osmolarity and secondary cerebral
      oedema as Glycine is metabolized to carbon dioxide, water and ammonia, and may lead to
      intra-cellular over hydration and neurotoxicity which is clinically reflected as hypoxemia,
      agitation, nausea and hypertension.(5).Although rare, irreversible neurologic damage and
      death have been reported after excessive absorption of salt free irrigating solutions during
      routine operative hysteroscopy(6)Theoretically, distension with 0.9% saline as a distension
      medium avoids most of the above mentioned risks associated with hyper absorption of non
      electrolytic distension media(7) However, there is no doubt that excessive absorption of
      normal saline can be fatal(8).

      Recently , it has been suggested that the type of anesthesia could modify fluid
      absorption(9). General anaesthesia has been associated with less Glycine absorption than
      epidural anaesthesia: the latter being associated with systemic vasodilatation(9).
