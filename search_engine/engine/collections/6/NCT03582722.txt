      to diet and exercise alone. PBB is a Persistent Organic Pollutant (POP), characterized by a
      very long half-life and storage in adipose (fat) tissue.The study will explore whether if the
      use of Orlistat results in weight loss that is accompanied by a reduction in the body burdens
      of polybrominated biphenyls (PBB) and other Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs).
