      conditions as well as burdensome chronic diseases. Healthy maintenance of the intestinal
      mucosal barrier requires oxygenation and blood flow and avoidance of mechanical or physical
      injury. Potent digestive enzymes are maintained within the intestine as long as normal blood
      flow continues and no damage or disturbances to the wall occur.

      Breakdown of the intestinal mucosal barrier can be produced by wide variety of events. These
      include prolonged low blood pressure (e.g. during shock), disruption of blood flow (e.g.
      during ischemia), and physical and mechanical perturbations (e.g. during trauma or abdominal
      surgery).

      One of the key advances toward the use of LB1148 to reduce postoperative complications was
      the learning that with more subtle perturbations of the mucosal barriers, such as during
      abdominal surgery, intraluminal pancreatic digestive enzymes played a role in GI dysfunction.
      Perioperative oral administration of LB1148 in preclinical models was sufficient to reduce
      the delayed return of GI function. Furthermore, the reduction in pancreatic digestive
      enzyme-induced tissue damage resulted in a profound reduction in postoperative adhesion
      formation. Together, these preclinical studies provide evidence that blocking pancreatic
      digestive enzymes with LB1148 in the intestine reduces local tissue damage, preserves GI
      function, and reduces adhesion formation.
