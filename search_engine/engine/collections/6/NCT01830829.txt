      associated with voiding (obstructive) and storage (irritative) lower urinary tract symptoms
      and is in part related to prostate enlargement and obstruction [1]. The standard medical
      therapy for this condition includes 5-alpha reductase inhibitors -5ARI (eg dutasteride) or
      alpha blocker therapy (eg tamsulosin), while the most effective medical therapy for BPH is
      the combination of these two medications [2]. Approximately 10 to 20% of patients diagnosed
      with BPH also have either a diagnosis of or symptoms of chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic
      pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) with typical genito-urinary pain and discomfort [3,4,5]. This
      particular subset of patients of BPH patients with prostatitis symptoms pose a therapeutic
      dilemma [6].

      CP/CPPS (organ specific phenotype) is the third most prevalent prostate disease after
      prostate cancer and BPH. CP/CPPS is very prevalent (3-9% of men) [7,8] and represents a
      significant percentage of urology outpatients (3-8% of male outpatient visits) [9,10]
      resulting in a major impact on quality of life of patients [11] and economic costs to society
      [12].

      There are no good evidence based therapies for CP/CPPS [13,14], although there is some
      evidence available to consider 5 alpha reductase inhibitor and alpha blocker therapies [22].
      There is an enormous unmet need to evaluate potential therapies for this condition.

      Our current understanding of CP/CPPS patients are that they are a heterogeneous group of
      unique patients (the "snow flake" hypothesis) presenting with different clinical phenotypes
      [15]. We have proposed [16,17], validated [18] and recently proved that clinical phenotyping
      (using our UPOINT classification system) is possible and provides more effective treatment
      strategies [19].

      There are studies that suggest that the same medical therapy that has proven effective for
      the treatment of BPH would also be beneficial for prostatitis like symptoms as well. A number
      of small pilot studies with finasteride [20], including a contemporary 6 month RCT [21], have
      strongly suggested that 5 ARI therapy may be effective in patients with CP/CPPS, but these
      studies were limited by study design including inclusion of all patients with the diagnosis
      of CP/CPPS (ages and clinical phenotypes that we now know could not possibly benefit from a
      5ARI). REDUCE and many other epidemiology studies, have documented that men over 45 years old
      suffer from prostatitis and prostatitis symptoms [23]. REDUCE also clearly shows that
      dutasteride favorably impacts on prostatitis-like symptoms and men with prostatitis-like
      syndrome enrolled in that study [24]. In fact, the potential benefits suggested by
      extrapolating REDUCE results far outweigh any other intervention we have evaluated in any of
      the large North American NIH sponsored RCTs in the last decade [25,26,27]. A further
      sub-analyses of REDUCE shows that men with IPSS â‰¥ 8 and enlarged prostates (eg BPH) have a
      significant symptom benefit with dutasteride, irregardless of prostate size [28].These
      initial findings in REDUCE in patients not specifically diagnosed with CP/CPPS should be
      expanded to examine the benefits in a CP/CPPS population.

      There are more clinical trials evaluating alpha blockers than any other therapy in CP/CPPS
      [22, 29]. While two North American RCTs [25,26] did not show benefit, 6 other alpha blocker
      randomized placebo controlled trials using validated contemporary outcomes were positive in
      terms of measureable benefits [30-35]. The latest clinical trial confirming the benefits of
      alpha blocker therapy in selected CP/CPPS patients (approximately 50 patients per arm in 12
      week study) was recently published [35] and showed benefit, primarily in the LUTS symptom
      domain.

      Clinical phenotyping allows for prediction of the patients with CP/CPPS most likely to
      respond to dutasteride and tamsulosin (age, Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms [LUTS] and prostate
      related phenotypes [BPH]). It can be estimated that up to 30% of men currently diagnosed with
      CP/CPPS will include men with co-existing Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH)
