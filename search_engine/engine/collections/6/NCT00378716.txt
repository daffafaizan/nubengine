      (CF) vs. fluorouracil (5-FU) with CF in prolonging overall and disease-free survival in
      patients with potentially curatively resected stage II/III adenocarcinoma of the colon. II.
      Compare the prognostic significance of several biomarkers alone or in combination, including
      DNA mismatch repair gene mutations, p53, deleted colon cancer gene, proliferation status, and
      thymidylate synthase, in patients treated with UFT/CF vs. 5-FU/CF. III. Evaluate the
      relationships of various biomarkers to each other and their association with patient and
      tumor characteristics. IV. Compare quality of life in patients treated with UFT/CF vs.
      5-FU/CF.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified by number of positive lymph
      nodes and participating institution. For the quality-of-life portion of the study, patients
      are stratified by age, sex, and ethnicity. Treatment begins within 6 weeks after curative
      resection and within 1 week of randomization. Patients are randomly assigned to one of two
      groups. The first group receives intravenous leucovorin followed by intravenous fluorouracil
      weekly for 6 weeks. Treatment repeats every 8 weeks for a total of 3 courses. The second
      group receives oral uracil/tegafur, and oral leucovorin every 8 hours for 28 days. Treatment
      repeats every 5 weeks for a total of 5 courses. No concurrent halogenated antiviral agents
      (e.g., sorivudine) are permitted. After completing treatment, patients complete
      quality-of-life questionnaires at one year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 1,500 patients will be entered over 3 years to provide 1,452
      evaluable patients.
