    
      Dental anxiety and fear related behaviors are global problems in Pediatric Dentistry.
      Preschoolers represent a dental behavior management problem and there is always a debate over
      the best behavioral management technique for preschoolers undergoing dental treatment.
      Moderate sedation is considered as an acceptable option.

      Children who need treatment under local anesthesia, for thirty minutes will be included in
      the study. A total of 72 uncooperative pediatric dental patients, of age range 4-6 years,
      will be selected from the Pediatric Dentistry and Dental Public Health Department, Faculty of
      Dentistry, Alexandria University, Egypt. The participants will be randomly allocated into 3
      groups that will undergo a procedural sedation session via a nebulizer. Children of group I
      will receive nebulized solution of 0.5 mg/kg Midazolam, Group II will receive nebulized
      solution of 5µg/kg Dexmedetomidine, and Group III will receive a nebulized solution of 0.3
      mg/kg Midazolam and 3µg/kg Dexmedetomidine respectively.
