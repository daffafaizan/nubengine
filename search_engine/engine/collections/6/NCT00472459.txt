      At baseline the area will be treated with fractionated Metvix速 PDT treatment consisting of
      two treatment one week apart and at 3, 9, and 15 months visits with single Metvix速 PDT
      treatment. The patients will be evaluated for occurrence of new lesions, lesion response and
      recurrence at 3 (not recurrence), 9, 15, 21 and 27 months visits. New and recurrent lesions
      in the treated area will be treated with Metvix速 PDT treatment. Lesions with partial response
      in the treated area will be re-treated with Metvix速 PDT and lesions with no response will be
      treated with lesion specific treatment at the discretion of the investigator.

      In the contralateral control area (5x10 cm2), new and recurrent lesions and lesions in
      non-complete response will be treated with lesion specific treatment at the discretion of the
      investigator at each study visit.
