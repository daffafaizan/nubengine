      Primary

        -  Compare the overall survival time in patients with unresectable Bismuth type III or IV,
           stage III-IV cholangiocarcinoma treated with double plastic endoprostheses insertion
           with vs without adjuvant photodynamic therapy using porfimer sodium as palliative
           treatment.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the effect of these regimens on cholestasis in these patients.

        -  Compare the 1-year survival rate in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare health-related quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, controlled, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are
      stratified according to participating center.

      Patients undergo endoscopic or percutaneous drainage followed by insertion of bilateral
      plastic endoprostheses into the bile ducts. Patients are then randomized to 1 of 2 treatment
      arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive porfimer sodium IV on day 1. Patients undergo endoscopic laser
           light therapy to the tumor site on day 3.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive no further treatment. Quality of life is assessed at baseline
           and then at weeks 2, 13, 26, 39, 52, and 65.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed within 30-90 days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 120 patients (60 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
