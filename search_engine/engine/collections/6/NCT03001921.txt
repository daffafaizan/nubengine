      hemodialysis (HD) treatment, and developing a HD database in China. Patients' demographic
      characteristics (including age, gender, height, weight, BMI, smoking, drinking, and
      education), clinical characteristics (including systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood
      pressure, primary cause of ESRD, and lab measurements of serum, urine, and access patency),
      complications, drug information and scores of quality of life at the baseline will be
      collected. Patients will be follow-up every 3 month, the demographic and clinical
      characteristics, complications and drug information of patients will be collected at each
      visit. The investigators also record the outcome at each visit, such as mortality (including
      all-cause mortality and cardiovascular disease mortality), technical survival, kidney
      transplantation, transfer to peritoneal dialysis, hospitalization, access failureï¼Œetc. The
      patient survival, technical survival, patency rate of access, quality of life and residual
      renal function for HD patients will be compared using the HD database.
