    
      Study Design:

      This study is an access and distribution protocol for unlicensed cryopreserved cord blood
      units (CBUs) in pediatric and adult patients with hematologic malignancies and other
      indications.

      Primary Objective:

      The primary aim of this study is to examine the incidence of neutrophil recovery of
      (Bullet)500/mm3

      after cord blood transplantation in a multi-institution setting using CBUs that are not Food
      and

      Drug Administration (FDA) licensed.

      Secondary Objectives:

      In patients receiving a non-licensed CBU:

        -  Assess incidence of graft rejection

        -  Assess incidence of transmission of infection

        -  Assess incidence of serious infusion reaction

        -  Determine 1 year survival after cord blood transplantation

        -  Assess cumulative incidence of acute graft vs. host disease (GVHD) grades II to IV and

      grades III to IV

        -  Assess cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD

        -  Determine platelet engraftment of >20,000 mcL and >50,000 mcL

        -  Determine CBU-derived engraftment

      Eligibility Criteria:

      Inclusion Criteria

        -  Patients with FDA-specified indications (see Appendix B for further details):

        -  Hematological malignancies

        -  Certain lysosomal storage and peroxisomal enzyme deficiency disorders

        -  Hurler syndrome (MPS I)

        -  Krabbe Disease (Globoid Leukodystrophy)

        -  X-linked Adrenoleukodystrophy

        -  Primary immunodeficiency diseases

        -  Bone marrow failure

        -  Beta-thalassemia

        -  Signed informed consent (and signed assent, if applicable)

        -  Pediatric and adult patients of any age

      Exclusion Criteria

        -  Patients who are receiving only licensed CBUs

        -  Cord blood transplant recipients at international transplant centers

      Treatment Description:

      Treatment, including pre-transplant conditioning and GVHD prophylaxis, will occur per each

      transplant center s specifications.

      Accrual Objective:

      In this access and distribution protocol, U.S. patients undergoing transplant using
      unlicensed

      CBUs will be enrolled and there is no accrual maximum.

      Accrual Period:

      The accrual period is open ended.
