      together in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. II. Assess the total dose of
      irinotecan received per 6 week course in these patients. III. Determine the incidence of
      irinotecan-induced leukopenia, neutropenia, and diarrhea in these patients. V. Determine the
      response rate for this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is an open label study. Amifostine is administered by 10 minute IV infusions.
      Irinotecan is administered by IV infusions 15 minutes after completion of amifostine.
      Treatment is repeated every 2 weeks for 6 weeks. This 6 week course is repeated in the
      absence of disease progression. Treatment may be delayed up to 2 weeks after a course to
      allow for recovery from toxic effects. Patients are followed at the end of study and at 30
      days after study.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: There will be 25-30 patients accrued into this study.
