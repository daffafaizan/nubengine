      NovaBay that has been cleared by the FDA as a 510(k) medical device. Many in vitro studies
      have evaluated the efficacy of hypochlorous acid against microbacterial and viral agents. In
      ophthalmology, it is commonly used as a lid cleanser in the treatment of blepharitis and
      meibomian gland dysfunction. It is applied directly to the lid margin and has an excellent
      skin and ocular safety profile, which includes a lack of ocular irritation on application.The
      investigators propose a study to evaluate the role of Avenova® (0.01% hypochlorous acid) in
      the treatment of common ocular viral infections.
