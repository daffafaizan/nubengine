      magnetometer (OPM) sensors, which combine high sensitivity with small size, low cost and low
      power operation. These sensors are an attractive alternative to superconducting quantum
      interference device (SQUID) magnetometers for the reasons outlined below, but remain largely
      unverified for use in biomagnetic applications. While considerable testing can be carried out
      without the use of humans, human testing is considered essential to encourage acceptance of
      this technology by the biomagnetic research community and more broadly by the medical
      community.

      The goal of this research is to assess and validate how well the new types of sensors perform
      for non-invasive brain imaging and to optimize and improve their performance for imaging. The
      goal is to show that these sensors are not just more economical and easier to use, but also
      improve signal quality. In this project specifically, OPMs can prove usefulness for
      telemetry, which means that long-term measurements over several days are possible, in
      principle. This is important, since these non-invasive imaging with these OPM sensors might
      be able to use replace the invasive imaging with implanted electrodes (electrocoticography
      (EcoG) for pre-surgical mapping of epileptic seizures. The project proposes to compare the
      use of OPM and SQUID sensors during recording spontaneous and evoked brain activity in
      healthy human volunteers as well as in patients with intractable epilepsy. Two objectives:
      (1) to show that the patient can move with a confined area during measurements (this is
      currently not possible with rigid MEG systems) and (2) to show that images can be generated
      with a spatial resolution equivalent to that of internal electrodes.
