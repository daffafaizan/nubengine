      evaluate the comparative pharmacokinetics and safety of fixed-dose combination(micronized
      fenofibrate160mg+pitavastatin Ca 2mg) versus coadministration of Lipilfen
      cap.160mg(micronized fenofibrate160mg) and Livalo tab. 2mg(pitavastatin Ca 2mg) under fed
      condition in healthy male volunteers.
