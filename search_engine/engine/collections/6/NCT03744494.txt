      simple orchidectomy), BSCO (bilateral subcapsular orchidectomy) and BESO (bilateral
      epididymal-sparing orchidectomy). Preoperatively, baseline serum testosterone, PSA, Quality
      of life (QoL) and pre-operative testicular volumes were obtained. Timed interval sampling for
      serum testosterone and PSA variation was done post-operatively. By three months post-op, the
      cosmetic appeal of the scrotal appearance, post-operative pseudotesticular volumes and QoL
      were also assessed.

      The therapeutic efficacy of the surgeries was determined by the rates of decline of serum
      testosterone and PSA, as well as the nadirs achieved. The variations in the pre-and
      post-operative QoL was analysed.
