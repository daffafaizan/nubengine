      explored. In this double-blind, 2-way crossover trial, healthy volunteers will consume one of
      two beverages on each visit: either an erythritol sweetened beverage or an aspartame
      sweetened beverage. Both beverages will be prepared to the same level of sweetness.

      Timed blood samples will be collected over a period of two hours following consumption of the
      sweetened beverage. Serum total ghrelin and serum insulin will be measured from all blood
      samples. A validated hunger scale will be administered three times within the two hour
      period. Data analysis for all measures will be reported with respect to deviation from the
      initial baseline measured at time 0.
