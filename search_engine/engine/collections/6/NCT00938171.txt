      immune system including both the innate and adaptive immune responses.

      The break of immune homeostasis might enhance tumor growth and spread. Minimal invasive
      surgical procedures have been shown to be beneficial to patients in terms of preserving
      better systemic immune function. Impaired cellular immunity after general anesthesia has
      significant undesirable effects on tumor surveillance after breast surgery. The local block
      technique might avoid the surgery inducing neuroendocrine, metabolic, and cytokine responses,
      which will offer some advantages from better preservation of early postoperative cellular
      immune function and attenuate disturbance in the inflammatory mediators. Our research will
      focus on the effects of local block anesthesia on mediators that may be important in
      inflammatory response, tumor cell dissemination, deposition, and propagation in the early
      postoperative period. As importantly, local block method is not only a safe procedure but
      also reduces the need for post operative opioids and prevents nausea following breast cancer
      which can result in markedly reduced hospital stay and health costs. It is plausible that
      inhibition of the surgical responses by local block anesthesia may attenuate perioperative
      tumor enhancing factors and/or potential beneficial actions of lidocaine infiltration
      combined with propofol sedation per se in anticancer effect to have better cancer control.
