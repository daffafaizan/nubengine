the effect of nortestosterone phenylpropionate on compensatoryhypertrophy of the remaining kidney after unilateral nephrectomy.forty-eight hr. after unilateral nephrectomy,both in non-castrated and in castratedmale mice the relative dry weight of theremaining kidney increased significantly.this compensatory hypertrophy was significantlystimulated as early as 96 hr. afteroperation by treatment with 19-nortestosteronephenylpropionate (= npp) at thetime of operation.  the percentual increaseof the kidney weight was approximatelythe same in non-castrated as in castratedmice.  the absolute initial values as wellas the resulting values 96 hr. after operationwere higher in non-castrated malemice than in castrated animals.  the numberof cells and the dna concentration perg. tissue decreased during the period ofnon-stimulated compensatory hypertrophyin both groups of animals.  npp caused a stillfurther decrease.  the concentrationof dna per cell did not change.  followingnon-stimulated compensatory hypertrophy,there was no change in the rna concentrationper g. tissue or per cell in castratedmice.  in non-castrated mice the concentrationincreased.  npp caused approximatelythe same percentual increase of rnaconcentration in non-castrated as incastrated animals during the period of compensatoryhypertrophy.  the difference betweenboth groups of mice in the rnaconcentration in the remaining kidneyfollowing stimulation of the compensatoryhypertrophy by npp was statistically significant.
