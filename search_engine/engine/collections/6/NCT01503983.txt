      geographical differences in Spain with an incidence of 15 cases/100,000 per year. Although
      the incidence and mortality of gastric cancer (GC) have experienced a marked reduction in the
      past 40 years, this disease remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality, accounting
      for more than 870,000 deaths worldwide in the year 2000.

      Gastric cancer has a high mortality rate because usually diagnosed when in advanced stage and
      in many cases has a high relapse rate. Advanced gastric cancer cases are considered to be
      diagnosed with unresectable disease, either by having locally advanced disease (30% of cases
      at diagnosis), or having metastatic disease (another 30%) and patients with relapses (60% of
      resected). Thus, overall around 84% of patients with gastric cancer will have advanced
      disease.

      The only curative treatment so far is surgery. Thanks to early detection and implementation
      of appropriate surgical techniques, survival has improved in some countries such as Japan and
      Korea, being the rate of 5-year survival of 47%Over the years, a large number of studies with
      a single agent chemotherapy has been shown that gastric cancer is a relatively sensitive to
      chemotherapy. Based on these observations, the trend was the investigation of the combination
      of chemotherapy agents.

      Based on these results FDA and EMEA has approved capecitabine in the treatment of advance
      gastric cancer combined with platinum.
