      I. To describe the 6-month progression-free survival rate, progression-free survival, and
      overall survival of patients receiving bicalutamide and raloxifene.

      II. To describe the adverse event profile of combined treatment with bicalutamide and
      raloxifene (adverse events graded using the NCI CTCAE version 3.0).

      III. To describe the quality of life of patients receiving bicalutamide and raloxifene.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral bicalutamide and oral raloxifene on days 1-28. Treatment
      repeats for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3-6 months for up to 3
      years.
