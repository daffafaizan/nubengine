      I. Compare the survival and response of patients with stage IVB, recurrent, or persistent
      carcinoma of the cervix when treated with paclitaxel and cisplatin vs vinorelbine and
      cisplatin vs gemcitabine and cisplatin vs topotecan and cisplatin.

      II. Compare the toxic effects of these regimens in these patients. III. Compare the quality
      of life of patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 treatment
      arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 24 hours on day 1 and cisplatin IV over 1-4 hours
      on day 2.

      ARM II: Patients receive vinorelbine IV over 6-10 minutes on days 1 and 8 and cisplatin IV
      over 1-4 hours on day 1.

      ARM III: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30-60 minutes on days 1 and 8 and cisplatin as
      in arm II.

      ARM IV: Patients receive topotecan IV over 30 minutes on days 1-3 and cisplatin as in arm II.

      In all arms, treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, before courses 2 and 5, and at 9 months after study
      entry.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually thereafter.
