      such as Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, mood disorders, and attention-deficit
      hyperactivity disorder. Several positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission
      computed topography (SPECT) tracers have been developed including [11C]CFT and
      [123I]beta-CIT. These tracers have been successfully applied in patients, particularly to
      stage those with Parkinson's disease. However, these tracers lack selectivity among monoamine
      (dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine) transporters. Recently a new PET tracer, [18F]FECNT
      brain uptake and washout has been developed, which has high selectivity and affinity to the
      dopamine transporter (DAT). Part 1 of this study will measure the kinetics of [18F]FECNT
      brain uptake and washout. Part 2 will estimate radiation-absorbed doses in healthy human
      subjects by performing whole body PET imaging studies. Part 3 will assess the reliability of
      measuring DAT densities in the brain by performing a test retest brain PET studies in healthy
      human subjects. The results of this overall study are required to apply this tracer in
      various neurological and psychiatric disorders in the future.
