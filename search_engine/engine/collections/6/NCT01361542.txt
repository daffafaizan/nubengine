      with Anti TNF therapy. In addition studies have shown that TNF has a role in osteoporosis of
      inflammatory diseases. The hypothesis that anti TNF therapy may decrease osteoporosis and
      tilt bone metabolism to the osteoblastic side has been tested in few studies. These have not
      been studied in an Indian population. Another great issue in the usage of anti TNF therapy in
      Indian population is the high incidence of developing infective complications; especially
      tuberculosis. The investigators are thus studying these in a north Indian population at a
      tertiary centre. The results would come to important conclusions regarding treatment and in
      the important issue of tuberculosis screening and prevention.
