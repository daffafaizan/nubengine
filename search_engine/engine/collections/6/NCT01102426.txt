    
      Phase III Study in Patients with Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma to compare the efficacy
      of plitidepsin in combination with dexamethasone vs. dexamethasone alone measured by
      progression-free survival (PFS) and to evaluate tumor response, duration of response (DR),
      overall survival (OS) and to rule out any effect of plitidepsin on the duration of the QT/QTc
      interval (time corresponding to the beginning of depolarization to re-polarization of the
      ventricles).
