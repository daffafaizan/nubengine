        -  Each treatment cycle lasts four weeks (28 days). There are no breaks from taking
           PF-00299804 between treatment cycles. Participants will take PF-00299804 once a day for
           a total of 7 to 9 days before surgery. They will then stop taking PF-00299804 until they
           have recovered from surgery.

        -  Once they have recovered from surgery, they will continue to take PF-00299804 once a day
           until their disease worsens, they experience side effects or they decide to stop study
           treatment.

        -  The following tests and procedures will be performed at the time intervals specified:
           Research blood tests (Day 1 of study drug administration, day of surgery, day 1 of all
           cycles after surgery, day 14 of the first cycle after surgery); tissue samples (day of
           surgery); physical and neuro exams (day 1 of all cycles after surgery); skin exam (day 1
           of all cycles after surgery and day 14 of the first cycle after surgery).

        -  An assessment of the tumor by CT or MRI scan will be made within 24 hours after surgery.
           Another assessment by CT or MRI scan will be made at the end of cycle 2 and then at the
           end of every even numbered cycle thereafter.
