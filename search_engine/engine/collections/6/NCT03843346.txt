      treatment is generally given to reduce the risk of cancer recurrence. For patients with
      estrogen receptor (ER) positive breast cancer, this treatment has traditionally been
      chemotherapy and hormone therapy. However, it is increasingly recognised that tumours which
      are ER positive and negative for the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), are
      relatively resistant to chemotherapy. It is likely that many more people are exposed to the
      risks for chemotherapy than ever benefit from it. In order to select patients who will get
      more benefit from chemotherapy and to spare those who get very little benefit from side
      effects, risk assessment tools are being developed.

      The 21 Gene Recurrence Score is a test that examines the tumour genes to estimate the risk of
      the tumour relapsing and possible chemotherapy benefits. Currently, the 21 Gene Recurrence
      Score (OncotypeDxÂ®) is used In Ireland for patients with no cancer in their lymph nodes. For
      these patients it can help in deciding who should get chemotherapy. Patients with low scores
      can sometimes avoid chemotherapy. In some countries, this test is offered to almost all
      patients with ER positive breast cancer, irrespective of whether the cancer has spread to
      lymph nodes or not. However, in Ireland this test is not standardly available for patients
      who have breast cancer involving lymph nodes.
