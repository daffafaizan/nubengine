      modalities (hot pack, TENS), ROM exercises, stretching, strengthening, soft tissue
      mobilization and set of pragmatic manual techniques.The set of pragmatic manual therapies are
      novel techniques (comprises of acromioclavicular mobilization, serratus anterior stretch,
      thoracic manipulation, RC facilitation, and PCS) and its isolated effectiveness on ROM in
      healthy subjects has been investigated and found effective. These studies recommended the use
      of a pragmatic protocol for the prevention and rehabilitation of shoulder injuries and
      pathologies (unpublished data).As per our knowledge there is insufficient literature to
      support the comparison of the effectiveness of a set of pragmatic protocols with traditional
      interventions. Our research is proposed to compare the efficacy of pragmatic interventions
      with that of traditional interventions in patients with shoulder pathology and their effect
      on the quality of life.
