      intervention (CTO-PCI) improves angina, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and
      survival. None of these studies aimed to assess the benefits in populations with heart
      failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). The investigators studied the effect of
      CTO-PCI on left ventricular function and clinical parameters in patients with HFrEF.

      Using cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR), the investigators studied 29 patients with HFrEF and
      evidence of viability and/or ischemia in the territory supplied by an occluded vessel who
      were successfully treated with CTO-PCI. Non-CTO PCI was also performed in patients with
      multi-vessel disease, . Imaging parameters, clinical status, and brain natriuretic peptide
      (BNP) levels were evaluated before and six months after CTO-PCI.
