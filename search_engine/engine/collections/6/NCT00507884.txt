      available MRI scanners.

      Currently, CT scanning is the main way of evaluating tumors in the kidneys. However, there
      are some patients who cannot have CT scans (usually, because of allergy to CT contrast medium
      or kidney damage/failure). It is with these patients that researchers are hoping to use a
      technique (using MRI) that is as good as CT scanning.

      As part of your standard of care, your doctor is requesting a CT scan of your kidneys and
      abdomen. If you take part in this study, you will have a "3 Tesla" MRI scan of your kidneys
      and abdomen as well, within 15 days following your routine CT.

      For the "3 Tesla" MRI scan, you will be lying flat on the MRI scanner, and as with a regular
      scan, you will have a small needle placed in a vein in your arm to inject the contrast dye. A
      diuretic, Lasix, will be given to help distend the internal tubes in the kidney to help view
      your kidney better. The MRI scan will take between 1-2 hours to perform. As with regular
      scans, you may be asked to hold your breath on occasions.

      If there is a concern about your kidney function, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn to
      test your kidney function before you have the MRI.

      Your participation in the study will be complete at the end of the MRI scan. The routine CT
      scan will be the main decision making examination. However, if the MRI shows something
      different and potentially relevant to your care, your referring physician will be informed.

      This is an investigational study. A total of 45 patients will take part in this study. All
      will be enrolled at MD Anderson.
