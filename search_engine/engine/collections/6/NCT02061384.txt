      13-cis retinoic acid and calcitriol on sperm indices in infertile men. Twenty infertile men,
      ages 21-60 with abnormal sperm analyses will be enrolled for 20-week and given 20 mg 13-cis
      retinoic acid, twice daily. Subjects#11-#20 will also be administered calcitriol to see if
      adding calcitriol with Accutane will improve sperm motility. All subjects will be closely
      followed for side effects related to treatment. The impact of treatment on indices of
      spermatogenesis will be determined by monthly seminal fluid analyses.
