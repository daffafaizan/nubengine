      phenylacetic acid (PAA), and phenylacetylglutamine (PAGN) on 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG)
      parameters in health male and female subjects with the primary endpoint being the
      time-matched change from baseline in the QT interval corrected for heart rate(HR) based on an
      individual correction method (QTcl).
