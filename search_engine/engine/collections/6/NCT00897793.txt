        -  To determine whether there is a dose-dependent increase in TGF-beta following
           radiotherapy in patients with epithelial cancers.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo blood sample collection prior to treatment, 24-72 hours after the
      first fraction of radiotherapy, and at the end of radiotherapy. Patients will also be asked
      for a weekly blood sample, but this is optional. Samples are analyzed to compare pre- and
      post-treatment TGF-beta levels.
