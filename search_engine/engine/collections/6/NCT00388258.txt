      slowing down of movement of contents of the intestines. This functional impairment persists
      for a variable duration following surgery, usually resolving within 1 day in the small
      intestine, 1 to 3 days in the stomach and 3 to 5 days in the colon. When POI persists for
      more than 5 days, it is generally considered severe, sometimes referred to as complicated or
      prolonged POI, and increases the risk for related morbidity. No drug therapy has been shown
      to consistently shorten the duration of POI. This study is designed to demonstrate that
      alvimopan, a novel, peripherally acting mu opioid receptor antagonist, accelerates the
      recovery of GI function in patients undergoing bowel resection of hysterectomy.
