      destruction (ablation) of Papillary Thyroid Micro Carcinoma by means of optical fibers that
      deliver high-energy light (laser) into the lesion through skin puncturing (percutaneous). The
      procedure is performed under ultrasound imaging guidance (ultrasound-guided). The destruction
      of the lesion occurs through overheating and coagulation. PLA, however, still needs a
      large-scale validation trial in order to be considered as an effective alternative to both
      surgery or follow-up for low-risk PTMC in elderly patients and/or in patients with
      co-morbidities that might expose the patients to a high surgical risk.

      After a comprehensive information, patients will be consecutively assigned to Group 1
      (surgery, preferentially lobectomy) or to Group 2 (percutaneous laser ablation, performed
      according to the attached procedure).Peri and post-operative complications, need of drug
      treatment, length of hospital admission and customer satisfaction will be registered.

      The aims of this study are as follows: 1.To establish the rate of cure or partial ablation;
      2.To compare the complication rate, time expenditure and costs of two procedures; 3.To assess
      changes in thyroid function and the need of substitution therapy with two procedures; 4.To
      assess the tolerability of the procedure, the customer satisfaction and the impact on the
      quality of life of the patients between conventional surgery and PLA.
