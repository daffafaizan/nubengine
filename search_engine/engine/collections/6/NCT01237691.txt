      Code 5058.1. The phase I evaluation is intended to assess whether or not frequent drug
      testing and immediate short-term incarceration for drug use and/or other violations and
      mandated drug treatment for multiple violations, reduces the recurrence of drug use and/or
      other violation behaviors by California parolees assigned to the study group compared with
      parole-as-usual.
