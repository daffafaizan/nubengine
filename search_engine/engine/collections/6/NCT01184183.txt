      from the use of two different patches (Accuseal vs Bovine Pericardial) used for CEA.Our
      proposed study will evaluate the perioperative (within 30 days of operation) and long-term (6
      month, 1 year, 2 year, 3 year) complications associated with the Accuseal and Bovine
      Pericardial patches. This will include thrombosis of the carotid artery, and the degree of
      recurrent plaque formation of the patched artery as determined by duplex ultrasound
      evaluation in the perioperative and long-term periods.Patients will be blinded to the type of
      patch they received.Survival analysis (Kaplan-Meier) (used in this case for time to the event
      analysis) will be used for time to restenosis, time to stroke, and time to late death.
