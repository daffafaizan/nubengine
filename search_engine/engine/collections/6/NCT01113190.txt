      audio (~4,900 patients) and will test intervention strategies in a two-factorial design
      (3x2). Specifically, 900 patients aged 18-60 in an inner-city ED who screen positive for drug
      use in the past 3 months will be randomized to the combinations of three ED-based conditions
      (computer brief intervention-CBI; intervener brief intervention-IBI; enhanced usual
      care-EUC), and two follow-up conditions (adapted motivational enhancement therapy-AMET;
      enhanced usual care-EUC) that will take place 3 months post-ED. All individuals who meet
      criteria for a drug use disorder will additionally receive the "referral to treatment" or
      "RT" component of SBIRT. Stratified random assignment [by gender and diagnosis of a drug use
      disorder (yes/no)] will take place at baseline for all ED based and follow-up conditions. All
      participants will receive written information including substance abuse and other community
      resources, and HIV prevention materials. Recognizing that brief interventions are important,
      but not necessarily sufficient, for change in all patients who use drugs, the primary
      specific aims of the proposed study will determine the independent effectiveness of immediate
      "on-the-spot" ED-based brief intervention conditions, 3-month followup brief treatment
      conditions, and combinations of conditions, for decreasing drug use and improving
      health-related outcomes (including physical and mental health, and HIV risk behavior) at 6
      and 12 months.
