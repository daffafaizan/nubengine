    
      This study is a three-month, placebo-controlled trial of folate 2mg/d in 50 schizophrenia
      patients who score at least a 3 (moderate or greater severity) on at least one of the SANS
      global assessment subscales, with the exception of the attention global assessment subscale.
      The specific aims of this study are:

        -  To examine factors potentially contributing to differences in blood folate, homocysteine
           or B12 levels between patients at baseline, including dietary intake and cigarette
           smoking.

        -  To test the hypothesis that low folate is associated with negative symptoms by examining
           correlations between red blood cell folate concentrations and clinical ratings of
           negative symptoms and by comparing folate concentrations in deficit syndrome versus
           non-deficit syndrome patients. We will also control for dietary intake cigarettes
           smoking, gender, and age.

        -  To examine the efficacy of folate supplementation for reducing negative symptoms
