    
      1. Study Objective: To determine the safety and effectiveness of the ologen (OculusGen)
           Biodegradable Collagen Matrix Implant in filtration surgery. The primary endpoint is to
           prove the effectiveness via the reduction of IOP, and the secondary endpoint is to prove
           the safety via the incidence of complications and adverse events.

        2. Study Design: The study is designed as an open-label, randomized, parallel, comparative
           study. Patients who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria and sign informed consent will
           be included. After enrollment, patients will be randomized into two groups:
           trabeculectomy with OculusGen implant or trabeculectomy without antifibrotics.

        3. Follow-Up: There will be 7 post-operative and follow-up visits within 6 months of
           surgery: postoperative days 1, 7, 14, 30, 60, 90 and 180. A window of ± 7 days is
           allowed for the 30, 60, 90 day visits and ± 14 days for the 180 day visits. Further
           follow-up of subjects after the trial will be the responsibility of the investigator.
