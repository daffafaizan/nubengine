      ABC-DIBH, VRT-DIBH has several potential advantages:

        1. VRT monitors patient (surface) position in addition to DIBH signal, while ABC only check
           the tidal volume, which can remain the same even if the patient shifts slightly on the
           couch;

        2. VRT is more cost effective, as patient tubing needs to be replaced daily for ABC;

        3. VRT potentially has advantage on patient compliance, as with ABC breath is forced
           impeded while with VRT breath-hold is voluntary.

      In this study, we renovate the established DIBH motion management strategy by adopting
      AlignRT system. The purpose of this study is to develop, validate, and prove the feasibility
      of VRT-DIBH technique for lung and liver SBRT.
