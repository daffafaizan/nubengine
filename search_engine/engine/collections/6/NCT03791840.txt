      ultrasound to detect lymph node metastasis. We designed this study to obtain in vivo and
      vitro ultrasound features and parameters. Before surgery, the detailed ultrasound features
      are collected during routine ultrasound examination. After the completion of the axillary
      surgery, fresh lymph node specimens are collected for in vitro ultrasound evaluation one by
      one in a specially-designed detection system. Statistical models are built to categorize the
      probability of metastasis of lymph node according to a proposed categorization system similar
      as BI-RADS(Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System), which is named NI-RADS (Node Imaging
      Reporting and Data System).
