      pediatrician and the pediatric gastroenterologist. Treatment for this disorder is
      multifactorial, and usually involves different medications combined with behavioral
      techniques, depending on the severity of the underlying constipation. Studies have shown that
      medication compliance is one of the strongest predictors of successful treatment, but
      maintaining good medication adherence at home is uncommon for a variety of reasons. In this
      study, the investigators are aiming to improve home medication adherence for functional
      constipation to improve treatment outcomes. The investigators will be administering surveys
      for all enrolled participants to determine the child's and family's overall quality of life
      related to functional constipation. For the treatment group, the investigators will be
      providing tools to help with medication adherence. This will include a daily log to determine
      symptom severity, along with an "action plan" with instructions for how to adjust medicines,
      if necessary, depending on symptoms. By empowering families with this knowledge and
      medication roadmap, the investigators hypothesize that there will be overall symptomatic
      improvement in functional constipation, along with improved quality of life for both the
      patient and their family. The investigators will measure adherence (by reviewing symptom log
      and action plan at 2-month and 4-month follow up appointments.) with the treatment group. The
      investigators will be measuring overall quality of life and symptom improvement using a
      validated pediatric constipation quality of life survey (PedsQL GI) with both the treatment
      group and the control group at follow up appointments.
