      n=16). Prior to participation, informed consent was obtained from all subjects. The
      evaluation was performed at the lower limb with severe symptoms of anterior knee pain in the
      patients, and at the dominant limb in the control group. Quadriceps Muscle inhibition was
      estimated using the Interpolated Twitch Technique, which involves applying a single
      electrical twitch stimulation to the femoral nerve (gold standard) during a maximal isometric
      knee extensor contraction. Muscle inhibition measurements were obtained with the aid of a
      Grass S88 (Quincy, MA, USA.) Muscle Stimulator in combination with and isolation unit
      approved for human use. Isometric and isokinetic knee extensor torques were obtained with a
      Biodex System 3 dynamometer (Biodex Medical System, Shirley - NY, USA). Electromyographic
      muscle activity was measured with bipolar surface electrodes (Kendall, Meditrace - 100;
      Ag/AgCl) that were placed on the muscle bellies of vastus medialis, vastus lateralis and
      rectus femoris. Muscle architecture was measured with a B-mode ultrasonographic system (SSD;
      Aloka Inc., Tokyo, Japan) with a linear-array probe (60 mm, 7.5MHz; Aloka). Single Leg Squat
      was used for clinical evaluation of the lower limb functionality.
