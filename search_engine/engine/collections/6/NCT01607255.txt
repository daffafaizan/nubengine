    
      1. Design: Prospective, single center, patient blinded, randomized controlled trial

        2. Methods: Colonoscopy with traditional air insufflation, water exchange or water exchange
           plus indigocarmine to aid insertion of colonoscope; split dose bowel preparation; all
           patients will receive sedation; assessment of serum electrolytes level before and after
           colonoscopy

             1. Control method: Traditional air insufflation method.

             2. Study methods:

                  -  Water exchange method.

                  -  Water method combined with chromoendoscopy (0.008% indigo carmine).

        3. Population to be studied Veterans between age 50 and 75 referred for first time
           screening colonoscopy

        4. Unit(s) of analysis

             1. Primary outcome: overall adenoma detection rate.

             2. Secondary outcomes: patient demographic variable and procedure related measures.

        5. Sampling strategy: all Veterans referred for screening colonoscopy will be offered
           enrollment in the study.

             1. Sample size calculation. A total of 480 subjects will be recruited and randomized
                with 160 in each group.

      5. Subject recruitment: patients referred for screening colonoscopy come from three sources.

      6. Description of base population and groups to be studied and method of randomization.

      Veterans between age 50 and 75 referred for first time screening colonoscopy. After informed
      consent, assignment to control or study arm based on computer generated random number codes
      stored in pre-arranged opaque envelopes.
