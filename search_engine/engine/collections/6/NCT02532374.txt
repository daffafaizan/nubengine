        -  a screening period of up to 4 weeks prior to admission,

        -  1 day of admission (Visit 2): after all inclusion/exclusion criteria are checked, all
           eligible subjects will be enrolled and perform a product test, first with P3L (at
           nicotine dose levels of approximately 50 μg/puff) and subsequently with Nicorette®
           inhalator (3 to 5 inhalations for each product).

        -  4 days of on-site product use (one day with Nicorette® inhalator [Visit 3] and three
           days with P3L [Visit 4, Visit 5 and Visit 6]),

        -  1 to 3 days between each product use and

        -  a 7-day safety follow-up period (discharge + 7 days), during which there are no
           scheduled investigational visits, and during which adverse events (AEs) and serious
           adverse events (SAEs) can be spontaneously reported by the subjects and the follow-up of
           AEs/SAEs will be conducted by the study investigational site.

      Subjects will come to the investigational site the night before each assessment day, at least
      12 hours prior to the product use, on Visit 4, Visit 5, and Visit 6. Subjects will stay
      overnight at the investigational site between the admission visit (Visit 2) and Visit 3.
      Smoking or use of any tobacco/nicotine-containing products or electronic cigarettes, apart
      from product use assigned on the assessment days, will not be allowed during their stay at
      the investigational site. Smoking will be allowed once the subjects have left the
      investigational site.

      The maximum concentration of nicotine (Cmax) and the area under the concentration-time curve
      from start of product use to the last quantifiable time point (AUC0-last) will be derived
      from multiple blood sampling pre- and post-product use, and corrected for baseline nicotine
      concentration.
