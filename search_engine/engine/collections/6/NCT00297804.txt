      the initial response to stent implant injury and sustaining the arrested response until
      vascular healing has taken place.

      The purpose of the TAXUS VI trial is to study the safety and efficacy of the TAXUS(TM)Stent
      under controlled trial circumstances and targets patients with a higher risk of target lesion
      revascularisation and restenosis. The study population will include longer lesions, smaller
      diameter vessels, multiple lesions in the same vessel, and allows for the use of up to 2
      randomized study stents.

      The clinical investigation will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the TAXUS(TM)Stent
      with 1 Âµg/mm2 (loaded drug/stent surface area) of paclitaxel incorporated into a moderate
      rate-release formulation of a triblock copolymer carrier system for treatment of de novo
      coronary artery lesions.

      Patients are stratified by site and presence or absence of medically treated diabetes
      mellitus and then randomized to receive either the TAXUS(TM)Stent or the uncoated
      EXPRESS(TM)stent.

      The primary objective of the study is to show superior 9-month target vessel
      revascularization (TVR) rate for TAXUS(TM) Stent compared to uncoated Express(TM)control
      stent.
