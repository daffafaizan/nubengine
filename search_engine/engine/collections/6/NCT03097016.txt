      dose of 3 mg CC-122 in subjects with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment as compared
      to sex, age (± 15 years), and weight (± 20%) matched control subjects with normal renal
      function. Estimated renal function for the purpose of group assignment will be determined at
      screening. Matched control subjects will have normal renal function, defined using the
      Cockcroft-Gault (C G) equation, as an estimated creatinine clearance (CLcr) of ≥ 90 mL/min.
      Subjects with impaired renal function will be classified by stage of renal impairment (mild,
      moderate, or severe) using estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), calculated by the
      Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation. Each group will enroll at least 2
      subjects of each sex

      During the course of the study, each subject will participate in a Screening period (Days -
      21 to -2), Treatment Period (including baseline visit), and a follow-up telephone call
      between Days 11 to 18. Subjects will be screened for eligibility. Eligible subjects will
      return to the clinical site on Day 1 for baseline assessments, and will be domiciled at the
      clinical site from Day 1 to Day 4. PK samples will be collected through 72 hours post dose.
      Safety will be monitored throughout study.

      The study will be conducted in compliance with the International Council on Harmonisation
      (ICH) of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use/Good
      Clinical Practice (GCP) and applicable regulatory requirements.
