    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      l. To compare the overall survival of patients receiving bevacizumab plus everolimus and
      everolimus alone among patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma progressing after first
      line vascular epidermal growth factor receptor (VEGFR)-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)
      treatment.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the progression-free survival and proportion who experience an objective
      response (defined as complete clinical response [cCR] + partial response [PR]) in patients
      with advanced renal cell carcinoma receiving bevacizumab plus everolimus and everolimus
      alone.

      II. To compare grade 3 or higher toxicity in patients receiving each treatment regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive everolimus orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28.

      ARM II: Patients receive everolimus PO QD on days 1-28 and bevacizumab intravenously (IV)
      over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15.

      In both arms, courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 8 weeks until disease
      progression and then every 6 months for up to 5.5 years.
