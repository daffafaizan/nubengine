    
      Context:

      Whether the performance of cardiopulmonary resuscitation can be positively influenced by
      teaching leadership with a short debriefing remains largely unknown

      Objective:

      To test the hypothesis that (1) leadership instruction are effective and (2) improved
      leadership results in better performance in a high fidelity simulated cardiopulmonary
      resuscitation.

      Design:

      Prospective, randomized-controlled superiority trial

      Setting:

      Simulator Center of the University Hospital Basel in Switzerland

      Patients or Other Participants:

      237 volunteer medical students in teams of 3

      Intervention:

      During a baseline visit, the medical students participate in a video-taped simulated
      witnessed cardiac arrest. Participants are randomized to receive thereafter a short
      video-assisted debriefing focusing either on correct positions of arms and shoulders
      (technical debriefing) or on leadership and communication to enhance team coordination
      (leadership debriefing). A follow-up simulation is conducted after 4 months. Leadership
      utterances, technical skills and the resuscitation performance of the teams are compared
      based on videotapes coded by two independent researchers.

      Main Outcome Measures:

      The primary outcomes for this study are the amount of hands-on time in the first 180 seconds
      after the onset of the cardiac arrest and the time elapsed until cardiopulmonary
      resuscitation was started. Secondary endpoints are the effectiveness of the technical and
      leadership instructions, respectively.
