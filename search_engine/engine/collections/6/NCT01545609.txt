      and support to female adolescents initiating a birth control method, will improve adherence
      and correct use of the method and so reduce unwanted pregnancies.

      Methods. Female adolescents aged 15-19 year olds attending Mount Sinai Adolescent Health
      Center (MSAHC) for initiating a birth control method will be asked if they are interested in
      participating in the trial.

      The Intervention Group. Upon initiation of a birth control method patients will be signed up
      to the text messaging platform. Via this program they will receive personalized messages
      regarding their chosen method of birth control. Participants will receive 3 messages during
      the initial 3 weeks, 2 messages per week in weeks 4-8 and then one message a week thereafter
      for a period of 12 months. They will be signed up for reminders to take/change their method
      (as appropriate) and have access to a Healthcare Provider to ask questions via text message
      that they may have regarding their method. Participants will be reminded (via text message)
      to attend the clinic for a birth control refill (if necessary) at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months.

      The Control Group. Participants randomized in to the control group will have standard care.
      This is the usual counseling by the Health Care Provider or Health Educator. Patients in the
      intervention arm will also receive this standard care.
