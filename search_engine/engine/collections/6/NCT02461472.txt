      neuropathy in Chinese population. A large-scale, community-based, cross-sectional study was
      conducted to explore the extent to which risk factors associated with diabetic cardiovascular
      autonomic neuropathy (DCAN) in general Chinese population. A total of more than 2000 diabetic
      participants were recruited by using multiple stages sampling (first cluster sampling and
      then simply sampling). Data involved in demographic information, clinical biomarkers such as
      glucose and lipids profiles, medical and therapy history were collected. Every participants
      was complete DNA extracted and genotyped. Diabetic Cardiovascular autonomic functions were
      measured by using short-term heart rate variability (HRV) to evaluate the outcome of DCAN.
      Univariate and multiple variables analysis have been performed to examine potential
      environmental and genetic risk factors of CAN. In addition, clinical risk model, simply
      screening model and nonlinear system model such as artificial neural network was created,
      respectively.
