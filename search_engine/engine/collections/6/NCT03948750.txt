    
      Goldmann-Witmer coefficient (GWC): compares the levels of intraocular antibody (igG)
      production to that serum, as measured by ELISA.

      GWC = (Level of specific IgG in aqueous humour/level of specific IgG in serum)/(Total IgG in
      aqueous humour/Total IgG in serum)

      0.5 to 2: No intraocular antibody production, 2 to 4: Suggestive of intraocular antibody
      production, > 4: Diagnostic of intraocular antibody production to a specific microbial
      pathogen
