        1. . For patients with large radiolucent stone，ERCP with balloon sphincteroplasty was
           performed directly to remove radiolucent stone. If ERCP intubation failed, endoscopic
           ultrasound-guided drainage of pancreatic duct, surgery or medication would be applied.
           ESWL was performed in the following situations. Frist, MPD strictures was so severe that
           dilation catheter can not be inserted during ERCP. Second, there was cystic dilatation
           in MPD and pancreatic radiolucent stone located in cystic dilatation could not be
           extracted by extraction balloon or basket. In the above cases, the naso-pancreatic
           catheterwas inserted during ERCP, and then ESWL would be performed with repeated
           injection of contrast medium. After ESWL, repeated washing and negative pressure
           drainage were performed, and at last contrast medium was injected again to make sure the
           stones were cleared. For patients without MPD strictures, the nasopancreatic catheter
           can be directly removed, otherwise the nasopancreatic duct would be cut off into a
           stent.

        2. . For patients with large radiopaque stone, repeated P-ESWL sessions were performed, and
           ERCP was routinely performed 48 hours after the last P-ESWL. If ERCP intubation failed,
           medication or surgery would be recommended.

      2. A prospective cohort study was conducted in CP patients with large radiolucent stone.
      Patients with large radiopaque stone were matched as the control group, with a ratio of 1:2
      according to admission time.

      3. The primary outcome was pain relief. The secondary outcomes were stone clearance, quality
      of life score, and changes in pancreatic exocrine and endocrine function.
