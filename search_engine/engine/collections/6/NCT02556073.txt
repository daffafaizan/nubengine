      in a single center (Taipei Veterans General Hospital). After screening, the enrolled patients
      will be randomized to either routine care or Smartphone self management group. In the routine
      care group, the patient will be treated as routine practice as a real-world setting. No
      additional intervention will be done. In the Smartphone self management group, an asthma self
      management Apps (My asthma App, GlaxoSmithKline, Chinese version, or Line), which provides
      multiple function, including health information (real-time weather condition, air pollution
      index) at the point-of-living, personalized health assessments (asthma control test, peak
      flow rate) and interactive action plans (green, yellow, and red light), and regular reminding
      for controller administration, will be downloaded to the participant's Smartphone. The
      participant will be educated to operate the Apps to improve asthma control. Participants in
      both groups will use identical controller (Sal/flu 2 inhalations twice daily plus as-needed
      rescue ventolin) and will be scheduled to follow up for 24 weeks.
