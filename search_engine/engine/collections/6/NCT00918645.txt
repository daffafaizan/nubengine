      Primary

        -  To measure the pharmacokinetics of a single oral dose of calcium-41 (41Ca) chloride
           aqueous solution (^41Ca) over 18 months in patients with hormone-refractory prostate
           cancer and bone metastasis.

        -  To correlate the ^41Ca-tracer kinetics with time to disease progression,
           skeletal-related events, and death.

      Secondary

        -  To correlate modulations in baseline urinary ^41Ca clearance with changes in clinically
           relevant disease parameters, including isotope bone scan data and PSA.

        -  To combine bone turnover assessments with ^41Ca and collagen/bone cell biomarkers with
           clinical imaging techniques, especially isotope bone scans, to provide improved
           stratification of disease stage.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral calcium-41 (41Ca) chloride aqueous solution (^41Ca) on day 1.
      Some patients also receive oral calcium-46 (46Ca) chloride aqueous solution (^46Ca).

      Urine and blood specimens are collected periodically for 18 months. Blood samples are assayed
      for bone collagen residues, bone alkaline phosphatase, and PSA. Urine specimens are assessed
      for ^41Ca/Ca. Isotope bone scintigraphy is use to measure radioactivity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for 3 years.
