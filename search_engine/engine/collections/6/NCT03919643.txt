    
      DESIGN Establish the influence of certain polymorphisms in the levels of expression of
      different transcripts and proteins.

      Quantify the levels of B cell activating factor belonging to the TNF family (BAFF) and a
      proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL) in serum and urine of patients and controls by
      Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). BAFF Determine the expression levels of different
      BAFF and APRIL transcripts in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients and controls
      using a digital PCR (polymerase chain reaction) system.

      Compare distribution of gene polymorphisms in BAFF and APRIL in patients and controls. by
      sequencing the exome of the ligand and receptor genes using next generation sequencing (NGS).

      Correlate the transcript and protein levels with clinical manifestations and disease
      activity.

      The results of the quantification of anti- double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid.(dsDNA)
      antibody levels tests will be recorded together with those demographics,
      clinical-epidemiological and response to the treatment.data.
