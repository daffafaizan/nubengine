      with endurance training and muscle strength training, each with two different intensities.
      For endurance training; post-exercise fatigue will be assessed after one session of high
      intensity interval training, and one session with longer duration of moderate intensity. For
      muscle strength training, fatigue will be measured after one session with high loads/few
      repetitions and one session with low loads/many repetitions. In addition, changes in
      sub-maximal and maximal metabolic and ventilatory responses to a maximal cardiopulmonary
      exercise test on a treadmill (CPET) and association to sarcoidosis-related fatigue before and
      after a 4-weeks exercise training period will be studied.
