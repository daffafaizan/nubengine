      leg ulcer, diabetic foot ulcer, decubitus ulcer) that has been present for over two (2)
      months and has failed to progress towards healing (less than 20% decrease in size over 2-week
      period of time). Also any suspicious wound in which cancer is strongly considered on a
      clinical basis should be biopsied immediately without any arbitrary timeline being imposed.
