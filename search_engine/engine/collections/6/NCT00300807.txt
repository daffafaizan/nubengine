    
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and virologic activity of
      escalating single and multiple doses of XTL6865, a mixture (1:1) of two human monoclonal
      antibodies (HCV-AbXTL68 and HCV-AbXTL65), in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus
      infection.

      An additional purpose of this study is to assess the pharmacokinetics of XTL6865 in the
      presence and absence of viral infection.

      This study is a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center design of
      ascending single doses in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. In
      addition to Placebo, the following XTL6865 doses will be administered: 5 mg, 20 mg, 75 mg,
      250 mg, 600 mg, 1200 mg, and 2400 mg. No patient will be enrolled in more than one dose
      level. At each dose level, 3 patients will receive XTL6865 and 1 patient will receive the
      Placebo. After the single dose infusion, the patients will be followed for 6 weeks.

      If certain criteria are met and the safety review of the 1200 mg dose cohort data determines
      that XTL6865 was safely administered and tolerated at that dose level, the patients in the
      600 mg and 1200 mg dose levels are eligible for the multiple dosing phase. Infusions of 600
      mgs will be given to 4 eligible patients, one infusion per day, for 5 days. One patient will
      receive Placebo and 3 patients will receive XTL6865 600 mg. The patients will be followed for
      6 additional weeks.

      If certain criteria are not met, the 2400 mg dose cohort will be infused. After the safety
      review has determined that XTL6865 was safely administered and tolerated, the patients in the
      1200 mg and 2400 mg dose levels are eligible for the multiple dosing phase. Infusions of 1200
      mgs will be given to 4 eligible patients, one infusion per day, for 5 days. One patients will
      receive Placebo and 3 patients will receive XTL6865 1200 mg. The patients will be followed
      for 6 additional weeks.
