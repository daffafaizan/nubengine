    
      This randomized controlled trial with two parallel arms is to determine the effect of an
      online educational intervention developed to reduce ageism in undergraduate students enrolled
      in an entry-level Nutrition class. Eligible study participants will be randomized into either
      the "Intervention group" (INT) or the "Control group" (CON). The two groups will have
      different learning material delivered online via Blackboard (Learning Management System/LMS).
      These include a collection of short videos developed by the researchers, as well as relevant
      videos available on the web. Participants in the INT group will learn about aging and ageism,
      while the CON group will learn about diversity and cultural competence. Sociodemographic
      data, percieved risk of COVID-19, preventative behaviors related ot COVID-19 will be
      collected using a questionnaire at baseline. Ageism will be assessed using standard
      questionnaires. Data collection will be done at three time points: Pre-intervention,
      immediate post intervention and 2-weeks post-intervention. Difference between groups for
      pre-post intervention changes will be assessed.
