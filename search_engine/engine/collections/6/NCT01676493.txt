      scheduled procedure. Screening will be permitted on the day of the procedure. At screening,
      the subject's parent or guardian will provide written parental permission/informed consent to
      participate in the study and subjects will provide assent (if required by the local
      Institutional Review Board [IRB]) before any protocol-specified procedures or assessments are
      performed.

      Subjects may be inpatients, outpatients, or day-surgery patients at the study site who will
      undergo procedures expected to result in at least mild to moderate post-procedure pain with
      the day of the procedure noted as Day 0, and will be followed until discharge from the study
      site.
