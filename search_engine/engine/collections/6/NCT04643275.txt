      (reduction of excess adipose tissue) will be assessed via correct identification of
      pre-treatment and 3-months follow-up images by at least two out of three independent blinded
      evaluators. The fat reduction will be also measured by means of ultrasound. Comfort and
      satisfaction will be assessed via standard questionnaires.

      Safety measures will include documentation of adverse events (AE) during and after the
      procedures.
