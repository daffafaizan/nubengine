    
      This is a multi-centre, non-randomised, open label Phase I clinical trial of an Advanced
      Therapy Investigational Medicinal Product named CD19 Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cells
      (CD19 CAR T-cells) in patients with high risk, relapsed CD19+ haematological malignancies
      (Leukemia and lymphoma). Following informed consent and registration to the trial, patients
      will undergo an unstimulated leukapheresis for the generation of the CD19 CAR T-cells.
      Patients will receive the CD19CAR T-cells following lymphodepleting chemotherapy. The study
      will evaluate the safety, efficacy and duration of response of the CD19 CAR T-cells in
      patients with high risk relapsed CD19+ malignancies.
