      resistance, T cell profiles, macrophage profiles and inflammation of the fat cells. This
      study will add human subjects to that body of evidence.

      Overview Aim 1: Test the hypothesis that the balance of anti- inflammatory vs proinflammatory
      T cells is protective for systemic insulin resistance. T cell profiles in subcutaneous and
      visceral tissue and blood will be compared in IR vs IS obese humans at baseline and
      potentially after 12 months following weight loss. Tcell profile will be evaluated for
      relationships with IR and inflammation, with adjustment for total body fat. Secondarily, they
      will be evaluated for relationship to adipose cell size.

      Overview Aim 2: Test the hypothesis that macrophage phenotype in adipose tissue is associated
      with T cell profile and IR. Frequency of macrophage phenotypes (M1 vs M2) will be analyzed in
      IR vs IS obese humans at baseline and potentially after 12 months following weight loss.

      Overview Aim 3: Testing the hypothesis insulin resistance is associated with T cell receptor
      phenotypes in subcutaneous and visceral tissue. IR and IS subjects will be evaluated at
      baseline by sequencing of expressed TCRs in paired SAT, VAT, and blood. We will determine
      whether TCR phenotypes are shared between different IR individuals.
