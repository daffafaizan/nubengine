      occurring in approximately 30% of unselected patients, and can be increased up to 70% in
      certain populations and procedures. Despite screening for patients at high risk for PONV,
      current prophylactic interventions fail to completely eliminate PONV for a substantial number
      of patients, leading to dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, prolonged hospitalizations,
      multiple doses of rescue therapy, and readmissions to the hospital (2). Aprepitant (Emend) is
      the first neurokin-1-receptor antagonist in a new class of antiemetics, which has already
      demonstrated powerful additive effects when combined with dexamethasone and a 5-HT3 to
      prevent both acute and delayed chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV). Early studies
      have also suggested it may useful in the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting
      (PONV).

      Patients undergoing elective inpatient or outpatient hysterectomy will be offered enrollment
      in this prospective, randomized, double blinded, placebo controlled trial. Subjects will
      receive Aprepitant vs. placebo prior to induction of standardized anesthesia. Postoperative
      nausea (assessed with a VRS), vomiting, and use of rescue antiemetic therapy will be
      documented over a 48h period. Additionally, hospitalization days and readmissions for PONV
      will be compared. Adverse events will be reported to the IRB and manufacturer. By reducing
      PONV in a group of high risk patients, we anticipate a demonstrated decrease in rescue
      antiemetic costs and hospitalization days for PONV related issues.
