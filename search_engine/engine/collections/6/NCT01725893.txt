      in our hospital between 1993 and 2010. Five patients received FHL and flexor digitorum longus
      (FDL) tenolysis at the musculotendinous junction; among them, two also underwent Z-plasty
      lengthening of the FHL tendon. Nine patients underwent percutaneous segmental toe flexor
      tenotomy. The Hallux Metatarsophalangeal- Interphalangeal Scale (Hallux MTP-IP scale) and
      Foot and Ankle Outcome Score (FAOS), English version LK1.0 self-explanatory questionnaire
      were used to evaluate the functional outcomes.
