    
      In this clinical protocol, the CliniMACSÂ® CD34 Reagent System will be used for processing
      hematopoietic progenitor cells collected by apheresis (HPC, Apheresis) from an allogeneic,
      HLA-haploidentical, related donor to obtain a CD34+ cell-enriched population for
      hematopoietic reconstitution. The haploidentical donor will be mobilized by G-CSF and undergo
      one apheresis to collect CD34+ stem cells. The products will be cryopreserved until the time
      of transplantation. Recipients with hematologic disorders who require transplant will receive
      a standard conditioning regimen and will receive an allograft on day 0 containing donor CD34+
      cells that have been positively selected and T-cell depleted following G-CSF mobilization
      combined with a single UCB unit.
