      fear of weight gain despite significantly low body weight, is a serious psychiatric disorder
      with high rates of morbidity and mortality. Low weight eating disorders (LW-ED), the broader
      category of eating pathology that includes AN and similar variants, are characterized by a
      chronic course, poor response to treatment, and food avoidance. Emerging neuroimaging
      evidence suggests that deficits in insula-amygdala-ventral striatum (IAVS) neurocircuitry
      contribute to individual variability in aversive and reward learning, and that these brain
      regions demonstrate abnormal responses to food/eating stimuli. The researchers' pilot data
      suggest that patients with LW-ED experience difficulty extinguishing food-cue associations in
      a reversal learning paradigm compared to healthy controls, a difficulty that is related to
      psychophysiological measures of aversive disgust (not fear). The researchers have also
      successfully piloted an interoceptive exposure intervention for this population that targets
      visceral sensitivity and seeks to increase 'top-down' regulation of the IAVS neurocircuit.
      The proposed project will (a) use novel fMRI-EMG to test the relationship between effective
      connectivity within amygdala-insula-ventral striatum network and its relationship to
      psychophysiological and behavioral measures of acute threat and reward learning in 60
      adolescents with LWEDs and 30 healthy controls, (b) test the sensitivity of this network to
      an experimental interoceptive exposure paradigm relative to patients receiving family based
      therapy for weight restoration using dynamic causal modeling of fMRI-EMG data pre-post
      experimental conditions, (c) validate this model against objective measures of laboratory and
      real world eating behavior. The results of this study will help better understand the core
      neurocircuitry that underlies both threat processing and reward/aversive learning and how
      this circuit relates to objective behavior. Further, the researchers will determine the
      modifiability of this neurocircuitry via two distinct behavioral interventions chosen to
      target different aspects of affective processing and reward learning. These data will be used
      to inform future clinical interventions targeting aversive/reward learning within this
      population and dysregulation in insula-amygdala-ventral striatum subcircuits.
