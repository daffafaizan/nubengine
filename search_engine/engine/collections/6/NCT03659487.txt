      major herniation without reflux and those with other contraindications against laparoscopic
      surgery are excluded. In addition, patient completes a QOL protocol. Patients in the study
      are randomized to laparoscopic fundoplication performed either with a 360 degrees (Nissen)
      alternatively 270 degree (modified Toup√©t). Both of these techniques are well established
      clinical routines. General intubation anesthesia is standardized to all study patients.
      Discharge from the hospital is typically on the first postoperative day. At a visit, after
      6-8 weeks for clinical control, is a QOL protocol is completed as well. After 12 and 36
      months, patients undergo upper endoscopy and manometry with 24 hour pH-registration and QOL
      protocol completion. The latter also occurs after 24 months and 60 months.
