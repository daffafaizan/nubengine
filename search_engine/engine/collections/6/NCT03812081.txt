      interruption of gas exchange, even for a few minutes, can result in catastrophic outcomes
      such as brain damage or death.

      Supraglottic airway devices are devices that ventilate patients by delivering anaesthetic
      gases/oxygen above the level of the vocal cord. Since the development of the laryngeal mask
      airway, many other supraglottic devices have been introduced in the clinical practice of
      airway management, trying to offer a simple and effective alternative to endotracheal tube.

      However, following experience with such simple cases, clinicians soon become comfortable with
      more complex cases, such as cases of longer duration, cases with sicker patient reported
      favorable outcomes in safety profile, risk, ease of insertion, recovery of patients and cost
      analyses. However, there is an under reporting of complications aris¬ing during ventilation
      with this device and the risk factors associated with such complications in adult patients.
      These include Hypoxia, laryngospasm, and difficulty with insertion, suboptimal ventilation,
      bronchospasm, aspiration, desaturation, hy¬potension and conversion to intubation with ETT.
      These can be significantly serious and life threatening
