      several steps of RSI are not based on evidence based data (EBM) and are considered
      controversial. In an electronic evaluation form that will be send to European Society of
      Anaesthesiology (ESA) members. The electronic survey will contain 22 question (11 for adult
      RSI and 11 for paediatric RSI). In the questionnaire the participants will have to describe
      their routine clinical practice in performing rapid sequence induction.

      The 11 will be consulted with the research committee of ESA.
