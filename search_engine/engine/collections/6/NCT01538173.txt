      included a large percentage of breast conserving therapies and risk factors for patients
      undergoing more extensive procedures like breast reduction (BR) are underrepresented and risk
      factors for more extensive breast surgeries might not be identified. Our approach to decrease
      SSI after BR was the application of an i.v. isotonic crystalloid solution, 6%
      hydroxyethylstaerke (HES) as a diminished peripheral blood flow and impaired vasculogenesis
      are characteristics of poorly healing wounds. HES causes a medium- to long-term increase in
      blood volume, blood flow and improved blood oxygen transport. Blood flow and tissue
      oxygenation are parts of regulating the healing process by utilizing molecular oxygen as a
      terminal oxidant. This antioxidant capacity can influence the wound healing process
      positively, as a characteristic feature of the inflammatory phase is the oxidative burst. HES
      additionally decreases haematocrite, blood viscosity and aggregation of erythrocytes
      positively influencing the complex components regulating wound healing. These characteristics
      and the increase in blood circulation might influence the postoperative healing and
      regeneration process.
