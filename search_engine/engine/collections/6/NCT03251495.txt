      drinking the Vibrio cholera bacteria. Each year, there are about 1.3 to 4.0 million cases of
      cholera worldwide, resulting in 21,000 to 143,000 deaths. The bacteria is spread through
      water or food that has stool in it. Up to 50 countries with limited access to clean water are
      more likely to have outbreaks. In the United States most cases are linked to travel to these
      countries; however, there are 10-15 cases acquired in the United States each year because of
      undercooked seafood. Cholera spreads very easily. Illness from Cholera can vary from no
      symptoms to severe watery diarrhea that can cause death by dehydration in a healthy person
      within hours.

      Vaxchora is a live attenuated cholera vaccine that protects against some cholera strains. It
      has been approved by the FDA since June 2016. Since October, 2016, this vaccine has been
      recommended for certain travelers 18 through 64 years of age going to cholera-affected areas.
      The purpose of this study is to look at the immune responses to the FDA approved cholera
      vaccine (VaxchoraÂ®).
