      strives to improve quality of life (QOL) and to prevent "bad deaths" by providing expert,
      interdisciplinary care to manage the effects of disease and treatment. Effective end-of-life
      (EOL) care depends upon proactive, patient-centered interventions to prepare patients and
      families for the challenges of terminal illness. We were able to demonstrate the feasibility
      and efficacy of a concurrent oncology palliative care (COPC) intervention in improving
      quality of life and mood in our previous studies ENABLE I and ENABLE II; however, a number of
      gaps in our knowledge remain.

      Patients will be randomized to begin the intervention either immediately or 12 weeks after a
      new diagnosis of advanced or recurrent cancer. This phone-based intervention consists of: 1)
      an Advanced Practice Palliative Care Nurse Interventionist instituting 1a) a 6-session
      manualized patient curriculum- Charting Your Course (CYC), 1b) a 3-session manualized,
      caregiver curriculum- the Creativity Optimism Planning Expert information (COPE) program, and
      1c) on-going patient and caregiver follow up; and 2) Palliative Care Team Comprehensive
      Assessment & Management.
