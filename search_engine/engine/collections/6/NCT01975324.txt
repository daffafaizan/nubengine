      patients who have had nonarteritic ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) with stable visual
      impairment.

      The objective of this double masked crossover study is to determine whether visual function
      can be improved in numerous parameters. This includes high contrast visual acuity, low
      contrast visual acuity, visual field, visual quality of life (VFQ-39), electrophysiology,
      multi focal electro retinography (mERG), visual evoked potential (VEP), and structure,
      spectral domain optical coherence tomography (OCT).

      Based on the promising results of the use of dalfampridine in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and in
      stroke, we hypothesize that the patients with chronic stable deficits after nonarteritic
      ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) will have improved visual function with the administration
      of dalfampridine.
