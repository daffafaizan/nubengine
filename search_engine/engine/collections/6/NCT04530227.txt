      chemotherapy, followed by camrelizumab alone after 4-6 cycles of combination in participants
      with medically inoperable stage I or IIA non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The primary
      objective of this pilot study is to determine the Camrelizumab plus chemotherapy improves
      progression-free survival (PFS) . All the efficacy and safety are assessed by investigator :
      1) response rate (ORR), 2) disease control rate (DCR); 3) overall survival (OS), 4) PFS rate
      of 1-year, 2-year, and 5-year; and 5) OS rate of 1-year, 2-year, and 5-year.

      Explore objective is potential biomarker associated with efficacy.
