      venous ulcers of lower extremities and recurrence after operation of varices which is a hot
      button issue worth discussing in clinical practice. Minimally invasive surgery has become the
      trend of IPVs' treatment. Currently, sclerotherapy can be performed to treat incompetent
      perforating veins, which showed a 90% occlusion rate after three or fewer sessions, the
      recurrence was present nearly 1/3 of cases. While electrocoagulation has a reliable effect on
      the closure of incompetent perforating veins and simplify treatment. No comparative studies
      of different PAPS modalities are currently available. Therefore, this study aimed to compare
      the efficacy of punctured electrocoagulation and sclerotherapy in the treatment of
      incompetent perforating veins. Methods:This study is a multicenter, randomized controlled
      trial. We will recruit 84 patients with IPVs from five hospitals. Moreover, these patients
      will be randomized to either the experimental group (electrocoagulation) or the control group
      (sclerotherapy). The primary outcome is incompetent perforating veins occlusion rate in the
      12th month. Secondary outcomes are quality of life scale survey results (CEAP classification,
      VCSS score, CIVIQ-14 score), skin ulcer recurrence rate, deep venous Thrombosis, hemorrhage,
      all-cause mortality, and other vascular events and serious complications.Discussion:This
      study will provide reliable, evidence-based clinical evidence for the efficacy of
      electrocoagulation therapy for incompetent perforating veins.
