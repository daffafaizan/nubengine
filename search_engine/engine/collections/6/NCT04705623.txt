      Universitätsklinik für Frauenheilkunde in Bern or are recruited through public advertisement.
      After giving informed consent the patients will be screened for inclusion and exclusion
      criteria and their biofunctional Status will be assessed. The participants of the study will
      then be randomly assigned to the intervention group (12 week yoga program) or to the control
      group. In addition to the 90 minutes yoga sessions instructed by a professional yoga teacher,
      the participants of the intervention group are asked to perform two yoga sessions lasting 45
      minutes per week at home and document these in a diary.

      After the 12 weeks the biofunctional Status of all participants of the study will be
      reassessed.
