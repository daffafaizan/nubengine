      available, on the cardiac effects of sacubitril/valsartan in patients with LVSD, better
      characterise the neurohumoral actions of sacubitril/valsartan and gather "proof-ofconcept",
      mechanistic, evidence in humans to support adoption of this new treatment in patients at high
      risk after myocardial infarction as a result of residual LVSD.

      Surprisingly, there is currently limited evidence about how sacubitril/valsartan works in
      humans. PARADIGM-HF was a large pragmatic mortality/morbidity trial with no mechanistic
      sub-studies and this is also true of a ongoing trial (PARADISE-MI) in acute myocardial
      infarction. Moreover, both trials either used or will use an ACE inhibitor (enalapril and
      ramipril, respectively), rather than an ARB as the active comparator for
      sacubitril/valsartan; use of valsartan in our study will allow us to precisely define the
      effects of neprilysin inhibition. A-type (or atrial) natriuretic peptide (ANP), C-type
      natriuretic peptide (CNP) and adrenomedullin are substrates for neprilysin and may play a
      role in the action of sacubitril/valsartan but have not been measured in existing clinical
      trials (in part because of the instability of these peptides and unfeasibility of measuring
      them in multi-centre, multi-national trials).

      Indeed, ANP and CNP are more specific substrates for neprilysin than BNP. As has been
      mentioned above, cardiac fibrosis appears to be important in the process of LV remodelling in
      patients with asymptomatic LVSD and the development of HF-REF and is reflected in circulating
      biomarkers which may be influenced by sacubitril/valsartan
