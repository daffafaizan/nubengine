      Non-pharmacological interventions have been investigated as potential treatment although,
      unfortunately, the literature on their efficacy is poor and showed mixed results. The
      psychological interventions tested up to now are the Acceptance and Commitment Therapy and
      the Mindfulness. Well-Being Therapy (WBT) is a brief psychotherapy which has been manualized
      in 2016 and has shown efficacy in randomized clinical trials. It showed to be effective in
      decreasing the relapse rates of depression in adults, it showed to be effective in
      generalized anxiety disorder and in cyclothymia. Thus, psychological well-being can be
      implemented and empowered via a specific psychotherapy and this implementation might produce
      a protecting effect, thus favoring prevention. The aim of the present study is to test the
      efficacy of WBT in a sample of patients with chronic migraine. First the efficacy of WBT will
      be verified in terms of disability due to migraine. Then, the efficacy of WBT will be
      measured in terms of psychological well-being, euthymia, and distress. For this purpose, 30
      chromic migraine outpatients will be enrolled in a randomized, controlled, open clinical
      study.
