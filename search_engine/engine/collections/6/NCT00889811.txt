      preconditioning showed very powerful myocardial protection by simple and safe procedures such
      as the brief inflation of pneumatic tourniquet on the upper or lower limb. However, despite
      these impressive results, the clinical studies are lacking yet. Moreover, two previous
      studies were done on the cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. Considering different
      mechanism, level of myocardial injury and the increasing popularity of OPCAB, we need the
      clinical study on remote preconditioning with the OPCAB patients.

      In this study, we will conduct randomized controlled clinical trials in which the remote
      preconditioning was induced by lower limb ischemia with double-blinded technique. Myocardial
      injury will be assessed by postoperative serum troponin I levels and they will be compared
      with those of control group.
