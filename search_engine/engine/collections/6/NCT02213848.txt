      endotracheal intubation and the view of operative field. The neuromuscular blockade should be
      reversed at the end of anesthesia to recover spontaneous breathing of the patient.

      Residual neuromuscular blockade (RNMB) is defined as train of-four ratio < 0.9. RNMB is a
      risk factor for postoperative pulmonary complication and increases postoperative mortality.
      Neostigmine is acetylcholinesterase inhibitor routinely used at the end of anesthesia to
      prevent RNMB. A meta-analysis, however, showed that 40 percent of patients who received
      intermediate-acting neuromuscular blocking agent during anesthesia showed RNMB in PACU.

      Calcium triggers the release of acetylcholine from the motor nerve terminal and enhances
      excitation-contraction coupling in muscle. Increasing calcium concentrations decreased the
      sensitivity to dTc and pancuronium in an animal muscle-nerve model. The effect of calcium
      chloride on residual neuromuscular blockade is not studied yet.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of calcium chloride on residual
      neuromuscular blockade at the end of general anesthesia
