      antibody (mAb) drug conjugate SGN-15 (cBR96 - Doxorubicin immunoconjugate), used in
      combination with the taxane agent, TAXOTERE (docetaxel) as a strategy for targeting advanced
      stage, hormone refractory prostate carcinoma (HRPC). This is a randomized, open label, phase
      II study evaluating the immunoconjugate SGN-15 in combination with the taxane TAXOTERE in
      comparison to TAXOTERE alone in patients with HRPC. Based on a previous phase I study of the
      SGN-15/TAXOTERE combination, the weekly dose of SGN-15 will be 200 mg/m2 and the weekly dose
      of TAXOTERE will be 35 mg/m2. The schedule of administration for both agents will be weekly,
      with SGN-15 administered prior to the TAXOTERE in the patients treated with the combination.
      A single course of therapy will be defined as 6 weekly doses followed by a 2 week rest period
      for a total of 8 weeks. The study will perform an interim analysis of the data after 80
      patients have completed two courses. Patients should be treated for a minimum of 2 courses of
      therapy. Additionally, for patients who remain eligible and have experienced tolerable levels
      of drug toxicity, repeat dosing with subsequent cycles is possible. Patients will be removed
      from study if there is evidence of tumor progression or intolerable toxicity. Follow-up
      assessments include adverse event reporting, clinical laboratory studies, and quality of life
      (QOL) assessment using a validated QOL instrument.
