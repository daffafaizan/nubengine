      development of artificial respiratory devices. According to that, the ratio of cardiac
      dysfunction as a cause of death has been increasing. This cardiac dysfunction was associated
      with minor cardiac damage as indicated by elevation of plasma cardiac troponin I (cTnI).
      Furthermore, and the detection rate of cTnI plasma as revealed to be correlated with the
      deterioration speed of LV dysfunction assessed by serial echocardiography measurements.
      Accordingly, if this minor cardiac damage is suppressed, it is postulated that the
      progression of cardiac dysfunction can be stopped. In the cases with ventricular arrhythmia
      and tachycardia, we found plasma cTnI became undetectable after administration of
      beta-blocker. Accordingly, we investigate whether administration of beta-blocker, carvedilol
      can persistently suppress the minor cardiac damage and lead to suppress the deterioration of
      LV function. Note that his study preventive study for preserved to moderate LV dysfunction
      and is not intended to the beta-blocker treatment for severe LV dysfunction. Because we
      assume that the mechanism of elevation of cTnI is different; spontaneous in preserved to mild
      LV dysfunction in patients but LV wall stress in severe LV dysfunction in patients with
      Duchenne muscular dystrophy.
