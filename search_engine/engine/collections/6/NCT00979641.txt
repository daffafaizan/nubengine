    
      Patients with histologically or cytologically proven measurable or nonmeasurable metastatic
      breast cancer are treated with a combination of biweekly docetaxel and bevacizumab as the
      first line treatment in multicenter phase II trial. The outcome measures would be PFS,
      Response rate (RECIST), duration of response, safety (NCI CTC-AE version 3) and survival. In
      addition several biochemical makers are tested as possible predictive factors. Treatment
      would be continued until PD, patient's refusal or treatment discontinuation due to
      side-effects or patients death. In responding patients bevacizumab would be continued either
      alone or in hormone receptor positive patients combined with hormone treatment until
      progression.
