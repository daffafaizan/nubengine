    
      During Cycle 1, patients will receive capecitabine alone for the first 7 days (Cohort A will
      receive 750 mg/m2 of capecitabine twice daily, and Cohort B will receive 1000 mg/m2 of
      capecitabine twice daily for the first 7 days of Cycle 1). For days 8-14 of Cycle 1, patients
      will receive capecitabine (750 mg/m2 twice daily for Cohort A; 1000 mg/m2 twice daily for
      Cohort B) combined with sorafenib (400 mg twice daily for both cohorts); on days 15-21 of
      Cycle 1, patients will receive sorafenib alone (400 mg twice daily for both cohorts).
      Beginning with day 1 of Cycle 2 and all treatment cycles thereafter, patients will be dosed
      as follows: Cohort A will receive sorafenib orally at 400 mg twice daily for 21 days, and
      capecitabine orally at 750 mg/m2 twice daily for the first 14 days of a 21-day treatment
      cycle.

      Cohort B will receive sorafenib orally at 400 mg twice daily for 21 days, and capecitabine
      orally at 1000 mg/m2 twice daily for the first 14 days of a 21-day treatment cycle. After 6
      patients each are enrolled into Cohort A and Cohort B, one of these two cohorts will enroll
      an additional 6-12 patients in an expansion phase.
