      attention has been paid to their effects on family members, particularly those in non-Western
      countries. This multi-site randomized controlled trial evaluated the effectiveness of a
      bi-weekly, 12-session, family-led mutual support group for Chinese caregivers of
      schizophrenia sufferers over 36 months, compared with a family psychoeducation group program
      and standard psychiatric care. It was conducted with 114 families of outpatients with
      schizophrenia in Hong Kong of whom 38 were assigned randomly to a mutual support group, a
      psychoeducation group, or standard care. Families' psychosocial health status and patients'
      symptom severity and length of re-hospitalizations at recruitment, one-month, 18-month, and
      36-month post-intervention were compared between groups.
