      (low micromolar range) immunomodulatory and direct anti-myeloma activity attributable to
      BETbromodomain inhibition at higher concentrations. NMP is nontoxic, stable and already in
      use as a solvent in biomedical applications. It has been the subject of numerous toxicity
      studies in humans and been demonstrated to have few adverse effects. The study is proposing
      an empiric starting dose of 50mg daily, 50% of that seen in healthy volunteers with no
      observable toxicity. Dose escalation will follow a rule based on accelerated trial design in
      order to minimise the number of patients treated at sub-therapeutic doses and minimise the
      length of the study. During the accelerated dose-escalation phase, one patient will be
      entered per cohort with a dose escalation increment of 100%, with up to 6 dose escalation and
      up to two dose de-escalation levels.The accelerated phase ends when one patient experiences
      DLT during the first cycle of treatment or when a total of two patients have experienced
      moderate toxicity during the first cycle of treatment regardless of the dose level; or the
      most recent patient has been treated at the highest dose level in the first cycle. If 1
      patient experiences a DLT in the first cycle at any dose level, the cohort will be further
      expanded to a total of 6 patients treated at the same dose level. The maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) in the study will be defined as the highest dose in which the incidence of DLT was less
      than 33%.
