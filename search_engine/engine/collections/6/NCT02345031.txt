      has been linked to hearing problems, like age-related loss of hearing or tinnitus (a
      'ringing' or buzzing noise in the ears).

      AUT00063 is an experimental new medicine that enhances the action of these specific channels
      and so may treat the brain component of these hearing problems.

      The main purpose of this study is to try to demonstrate an improvement in a speech-in-noise
      deficit after 4 weeks of treatment with the study drug versus the placebo (dummy drug which
      does not contain the drug). Subjects will undergo a safety follow-up after the treatment
      period.

      Safety and efficacy will be determined by looking at a number of assessments (physical
      examinations, blood sampling, hearing assessments, questionnaires, etc.).

      The amount of drug in the blood will also be measured. It is expected that around 70 people
      (at least 35 in each arm) with age-related hearing loss may take part in the study. The study
      participants will be recruited at around 13 sites in the USA.
