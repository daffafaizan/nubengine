      countries the most frequent reason to consult a general practitioner. However, general
      practitioners are under pressure with increasing workloads. The increasing number of patients
      and the typical 10-15 minutes of available time for each patient are challenging the
      provision of sufficient information and advice. According to international guidelines
      information and advice are recommended for every patient with LBP, therefore, new methods to
      support general practitioners (GPs) are very much needed. Online technologies give new
      opportunities to extend the treatment. Furthermore, involving patients with LBP in the
      development of online information material may produce more user friendly content and design
      and thereby increasing patients' acceptance and usage. Thus, optimizing clinical outcome.
      This project will study patients' satisfaction and clinical outcomes of a web-application for
      patients with LBP consulted in general practice compared to best existing technology (the
      Patient Handbook).
