      the PREDECESSOR STUDY (NCT00214526).

      Written, informed consent will be obtained prior to performing any study procedures.
      Enrollment will be limited to only those subjects who were in either the Control or Treatment
      groups of the PREDECESSOR STUDY (NCT00214526).

      The present study will extend the follow-up evaluation of subjects from the PREDECESSOR STUDY
      (NCT00214526) to 3 years post-treatment for the Control Subjects and 5 years post-treatment
      for Alair-Treated Subjects. These evaluations will consist of two (Control Group) to four
      (Alair Group) additional study visits corresponding to the two-year, three-year, four-year
      and five-year time points following completion of Alair treatments (or similar time point for
      control subjects) in the PREDECESSOR STUDY (NCT00214526). For consistency with the
      PREDECESSOR STUDY (NCT00214526), ideally the subject's drug therapy should continue to be
      consistent with the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) Guidelines for the severity of the
      subject's asthma. Any changes in maintenance levels of asthma medications should be
      documented.

      The goal of this follow-up study is to enroll all subjects who participated in the
      PREDECESSOR STUDY (NCT00214526). Inclusion of subjects from the treatment arm will allow for
      the assessment of long-term safety of the Alair procedure for up to 5 years post treatment
      with the Alair System. Inclusion of subjects from the Control arm will allow for appropriate
      analysis of long-term effectiveness data for up to 3 years post "treatment".
