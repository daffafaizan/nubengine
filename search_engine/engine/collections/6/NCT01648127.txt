    
      This study is planned to be a Phase I, open-label, single period, single-dose pharmacokinetic
      study conducted in 32 healthy adult male and female subjects. Adult subjects will be
      recruited and assigned to one of four groups based on their body mass index and total body
      weight. Subject will receive a single dose of ceftaroline fosamil 600 mg as a 1-hour
      continuous intravenous infusion. Serial blood and urine samples will be collected over the
      next 12 hours to determine serum and urinary pharmacokinetics of ceftaroline. Safety
      evaluations will be assessed throughout the study and will include physical examination,
      vital sign monitoring, clinical laboratory tests (serum chemistry and hematology), pregnancy
      testing (female subjects only), monitoring of adverse events, and recording of concomitant
      medications.
