    
      This study is a multicenter phase 2, randomized, double-blind, efficacy and safety study of
      enzalutamide (160 mg/day) vs. bicalutamide (50 mg/day) in patients with recurrent prostate
      cancer who have serologic and/or radiographic disease progression despite primary androgen
      deprivation therapy.

      Throughout the study, safety and tolerability will be assessed by the recording of adverse
      events, monitoring of vital signs, physical examinations, and safety laboratory evaluations.

      Following study unblinding, study patients receiving enzalutamide or bicalutamide at the time
      of unblinding and qualifying patients randomized to bicalutamide who discontinued prior to
      unblinding will be offered the opportunity to receive open label enzalutamide treatment.
