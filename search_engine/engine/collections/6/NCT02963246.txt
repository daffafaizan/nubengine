      relapsing disease course. Managing the relapsing nature of the disease causes daily stress
      for IBD patients. Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) is an evidence-based
      psychological program designed to help manage depressive and stress symptoms.

      Aim: To compare the effects of a specific application of Mindfulness vs. Treatment-as usual
      control group in patients with bowel disease.

      Outcome measures: quality of life, inflammatory and stress markers. Design: randomized
      controlled trial. Setting: Outpatient setting. Population: patients who attended bimonthly
      check up.
