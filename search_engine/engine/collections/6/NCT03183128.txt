    
      ECOSPOR III is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      parallel-group study of the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of SER-109 versus placebo in
      adult subjects 18 years of age or older with recurrent CDI, defined as: a history of ≥ 3 CDI
      episodes within 9 months, inclusive of the current episode. This study is designed to
      demonstrate the superiority of SER-109 versus placebo to reduce recurrence of Clostridium
      difficile infection (CDI) in adults who have received antibacterial drug treatment for
      recurrent CDI (RCDI), based on the proportion of subjects experiencing a CDI recurrence
      requiring antibiotic treatment up to 8 weeks after initiation of treatment. Approximately 188
      subjects with a history of CDI, diarrhea and a positive C. difficile toxin test result on a
      stool sample, who have responded to standard-of-care (SOC) antibiotic treatment will be
      enrolled. Subjects will be randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to 1 of 2 treatment groups
      (Treatment Group I [SER-109] or Treatment Group II [Placebo]) and stratified by age (<65
      years; ≥65 years), as well as antibiotic regimen for the qualifying episode (vancomycin;
      fidaxomicin).

      Subjects will receive an oral dose of SER-109 in 4 capsules once daily for 3 consecutive days
      in Treatment Group I or matching placebo once daily for 3 consecutive days in Treatment Group
      II.

      Subjects with confirmed CDI recurrence, as defined in the Protocol, up to 8 weeks after
      administration of SER-109 or placebo treatment, and who have completed their Week 8 visit,
      may be eligible to enroll in the open- label SER-109 extension study (Study SERES-013).
