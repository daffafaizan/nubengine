      protein type VII collagen (COL7). The objective of this study is evaluate the safety FCX-007
      intradermal injections in RDEB subjects. Additionally, the trial will evaluate type VII
      collagen expression, the presence of anchoring fibrils resulting from FCX-007, as well
      evidence of wound healing.

      Approximately twelve subjects are expected to enroll in the Phase I/II trial. Phase I will
      enroll approximately six adult subjects. Phase II will enroll approximately six pediatric
      subjects (ages 7 or older). All subjects will receive FCX-007 to one or more paired target
      RDEB wounds. Proof of mechanism will be monitored through digital photography of target
      wounds and assays conducted on biopsies taken from target wounds.
