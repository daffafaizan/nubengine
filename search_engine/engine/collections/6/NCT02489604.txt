      progressive disease, somatostatin receptor (SSR) positive and FDG negative will be enrolled
      in the study and will be randomly assigned to 2 different dosages (total activity of 25.9 GBq
      and total activity of 18.5 GBq). The two levels of dosages are:

        1. Total activity of 25.9 GBq 100 mCi for 7 cycles at 6 ± 2 weeks (700 mCi)

        2. Total activity of 18.5 GBq 100 mCi for 5 cycles at 6 ± 2 weeks (500 mCi) The randomized
           study design allows for two active treatments to be evaluated in a comparable patient
           population. The estimates of primary objectives can be evaluated for each regimen
           separately by a Bryant and Day design. While the sample size is not powered for
           statistical test of a specific hypothesis for comparison between groups, this study
           design allows the unbiased collection of activity and safety in these two regimens in
           the same population, which will be useful for planning future studies.
