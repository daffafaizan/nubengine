      and anxiety, cervical/shoulder range of motion and mood state in breast cancer survivors
      suffering shoulder/arm morbidity.

      Methods: Randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over study. Twenty-one enrolled
      participants who had a diagnosis of breast cancer stage I-IIIA and had completed adjuvant
      therapy except hormonal treatment. The study consisted of two intervention sessions of 30
      minutes separated by a wash-up period of 4 weeks. The interventions consisted of a Myofascial
      Induction (experimental group) or placebo pulsed shortwave therapy (control group). The main
      outcome measures were: Visual Analogue Scale for pain and anxiety, shoulder-cervical
      goniometry for range of motion, Profile of Mood States for psychological distress and
      Attitudes Toward Massage Scale.
