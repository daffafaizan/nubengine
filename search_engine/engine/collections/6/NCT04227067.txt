    
      Adult patients presenting to the emergency department with moderate to severe back pain of
      relatively short duration without neurological deficits will be eligible for inclusion in the
      study. After signing informed consent the patients will rate their pain severity and receive
      a 400 mg dose of ibuprofen and then randomly be assigned to either TENS or sham TENS for 30
      minutes. At the end of the study period patients will again be asked to rate their pain
      severity and indicate whether their pain got better or worse. We will also ask them to try
      and guess which treatment they received and whether they require any medications for their
      pain.
