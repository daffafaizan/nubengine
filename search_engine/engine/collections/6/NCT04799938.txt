      GDF-15 is higher than healthy controls. The effect of exercise on GDF-15 levels in
      prediabetic patients is unknown.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate whether there is a change in GDF-15 levels after the
      application of guideline-based exercise programs in individuals with prediabetes at the 2nd
      hour after the first exercise and after a 12-week exercise program.
