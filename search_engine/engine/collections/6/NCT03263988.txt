      is a standard monitoring to assure an adequate cerebral perfusion pressure and is a basic
      parameter of hemodynamic optimization. Until now standard methods for blood pressure
      measurement are non-invasive interval monitoring by arm cuff (Riva-Rocci) or direct,
      continuous and invasive by inserting an intraarterial catheter. This observational study will
      show, that a new non-invasive piezocapacitative-interlayer technology will make continuous
      blood pressure monitoring and non-invasive pulse contour analysis available. For this reason
      all patients will get a basic monitoring (NIBP, ECG, SpO2)
