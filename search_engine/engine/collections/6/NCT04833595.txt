      cause lethal health conditions (e.g. stroke, cardiovascular diseases). In addition, 3.6
      million Malaysians are suffering from diabetes, the highest rate of incidence in Asia and one
      of the highest in the world. There is crucial need to find ways to improve the situation.
      Tele-health interventions and mindful eating behaviours are proposed to be effective in
      improving the levels of cholesterol and glucose. To investigate and explore the intervention,
      a small-scale randomised controlled trial will be conducted by comparing the effectiveness of
      mindful eating and the effect on cholesterol and glucose level. Students will collect and
      analyse both quantitative and qualitative data.

      A small-scale randomised controlled trial will be conducted to compare the effectiveness of
      mindful eating and the effect on lipid level. Subjects will be randomly assigned to
      intervention or control group. For intervention group, subjects will be required to snap
      picture of every meal that they consume. At the end of the day, they are required to actively
      recall and reflect on how healthy they consider their meals to be. The reflection will be
      submitted to the research team daily together with the taken pictures of meal. As for the
      control group, subjects will only snap and submit the picture of their meals but without
      active recall and reflection.

      Subjects are required to return to the community pharmacy after two months to follow-up on
      their glucose and lipid levels post intervention.
