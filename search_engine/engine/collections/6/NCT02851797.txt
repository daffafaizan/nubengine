    
      Givinostat or placebo oral suspension (10 mg/mL) will be administered orally as 2 oral doses
      daily while the subject is in fed state, according to the child's weight.

      Study drug should be permanently stopped if any of the following occur:

        -  severe drug-related diarrhoea;

        -  any drug-related Serious Adverse Event;

        -  QTcF >500 msec;

        -  platelets count ≤50 x 10^9/L.

        -  white blood cells ≤2.0 x 10^9/L

        -  hemoglobin ≤8.0 g/dL

      Study drug should be temporarily stopped if any of the following occur:

        -  moderate or severe diarrhoea.

        -  platelets count <75 x 10^9/L but >50 x 10^9/L (the treatment should be temporarily
           stopped and a platelets count has to be performed and re-tested until platelets will be
           normalized);

        -  white blood cell <3.0 x 10^9/L but >2.0 x 10^9/L (the treatment should be temporarily
           stopped and white blood cells have to be measured by 1 week and re-tested until white
           blood cells will be normalized);

        -  hemoglobin <10.0 g/dL but > 8.0 g/dL (the treatment should be temporarily stopped and
           hemoglobin has to be measured by 1 week and re-tested until hemoglobin will be
           normalized);

        -  Triglycerides >300 mg/dL (3.42 mmol/L) in fasting condition (the treatment should be
           temporarily stopped and triglycerides has to be measured every 2 weeks until
           triglycerides return to levels below 300mg/dL (3.42 mmol/L)

      In case the study drug was temporarily stopped, the study drug can be resumed at a level 20%
      smaller than the one at which the Adverse Event leading to temporary stop occurred, once
      platelets and/or white blood cell and/or hemoglobin are normalized and/or triglycerides
      return to levels below 300 mg/dL (3.42 mmol/L) or diarrhoea is mild.

      In addition, in case a subject will have a consistent (e.g., at least 2 consecutive
      evaluations) platelets count ≤150 x 10^9/L and not meeting the stopping criteria for
      platelets, the Investigator will have to reduce the dose by 20% of the current dose.

      Only one dose reduction is allowed during the treatment period.

      This trial design a single planned interim analysis. The interim will be governed by an IDMC
      in order to solely assess futility.
