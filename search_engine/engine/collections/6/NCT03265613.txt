      Numerous topical and systemic therapies are available for the treatment of psoriasis.
      Treatment modalities are chosen on the basis of disease severity, relevant comorbidities,
      patient preference. For moderate to severe psoriasis, phototherapy, systemic therapy and
      biologic immune modifying agents are recommended, but all of them have some drawbacks or
      limitations. Until now, no curative treatment is available. Therefore, it is important to
      find new treatment for psoriasis.

      Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a kind of adult stem cells that can differentiate into
      bone, cartilage and adipose cells. Adipos-derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells(AD-MSCs) were
      isolated from fat tissues and were reported to treat moderate to severe psoriasis vulgaris
      and psoriasis arthritis successfully by case reports. For the mechanism of the disease,
      involvement of the immune system in psoriasis is now widely accepted. Mesenchymal stem cells
      (MSCs) are found to have the function of immunomodulation, migration to skin lesions,
      limitation of autoimmunity. Therefore, investigators supposed that the injection of AD-MSCs
      could be beneficial for treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis.
