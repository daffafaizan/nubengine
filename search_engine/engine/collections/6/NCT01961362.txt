      one-year study of supplemental oxygen (O2). In the one-year study, the investigators will
      collect data before and for one year after PF patients are prescribed daily-use supplemental
      oxygen and compare outcomes, including shortness of breath, quality of life, fatigue, cough,
      and day-to-day functioning before and after O2.
