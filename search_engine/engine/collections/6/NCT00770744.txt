    
      Schizophrenia is a serious and disabling mental disorder that affects approximately 1% of the
      world's population. Antipsychotic drugs remain the cornerstone in the pharmacotherapy of
      schizophrenia. However, none of the available drugs is ideal, in particular because of their
      complex safety profile and the limited effectiveness against certain symptom domains. Whereas
      positive symptoms respond to treatment the effects on negative symptoms and cognitive
      impairment are only very modest.

      Thus present treatment options leave room for improvement and call for new, more effective
      pharmacotherapies for the treatment of schizophrenia. In the current study, patients
      suffering from schizophrenia and experiencing clinically significant symptoms of the disease
      will be included. Eligible patients will be randomised to blinded treatment with either
      flexible doses of Lu 31-130 or flexible doses of a standard antipsychotic treatment
      (olanzapine) for 12 weeks. The efficacy (including potential effects on cognitive symptoms)
      and the safety of Lu 31-130 will be explored in comparison to olanzapine.
