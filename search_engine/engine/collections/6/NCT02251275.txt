      treatment in ADPKD participants with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Eligible participants
      could enroll into Trial 156-13-211 after completing the follow-up visit(s) of their previous
      trial (156-13-210, 156-08-271, 156-04-251, or 156-09-290). Renal function was assessed during
      screening by using historical laboratory values for serum creatinine levels to calculate the
      estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).
