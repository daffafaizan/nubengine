    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the proportion of patients who survive progression-free for at least 6 months
      and the proportion of patients who have objective tumor response (complete or partial) in
      patients with persistent or recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary
      peritoneal carcinoma, treated with dalantercept.

      II. To determine the frequency and severity of adverse events associated with treatment with
      dalantercept as assessed by the Active Version of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the duration of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To measure the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), fibroblast growth
      factor (FGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-B),
      activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK1), cluster of differentiation 105 (CD105), and other
      markers via immunohistochemistry (IHC) and determine if there is correlation between
      expression and clinical response to treatment.

      II. To determine the correlation between ALK1 gene expression, other markers, and clinical
      response to treatment.

      III. To determine the correlation between concentration of VEGF, bone morphogenetic protein
      (BMP)9, BMP10, and ALK1 in pre-cycle 1 plasma using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
      (ELISA), and clinical response to treatment.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive dalantercept subcutaneously (SC) on day 1. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.
