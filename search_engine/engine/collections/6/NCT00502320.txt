      symptoms worsen in the winter. These patients' depressive symptoms often lessen in the spring
      and summer months. Much of the focus of the treatment of SAD (light therapy and melatonin)
      has involved the brain's suprachiasmatic nucleus(SCN), as it is hypothesized that one
      potential reason for SAD is a desynchronized SCN. Ramelteon offers a new and more
      pharmacologically exact mechanism to re-synchronize the SCN. The administration of ramelteon
      for this patient population may improve sleep, and in addition, do so in a manner that may
      also reduce their seasonal affective depressive symptoms. Patients eligible for enrollment
      will be administered either ramelteon or placebo and return to the study office for 4 monthly
      visits over the winter months, to evaluate the effects of ramelteon versus placebo on sleep
      and mood.
