      immunomodulatory drugs with the aim of increasing efficacy without causing serious adverse
      effects such as those associated with the available high-efficacy therapies. Cellular
      therapies represent a highly specific treatment aimed to target selective "pathogenic" cells
      subsets. Tol-Dec loaded with immunogenic peptides interacts with Ag-specific T lymphocytes
      inducing regulatory T cells without affecting other cell subsets leading to a antinflammatory
      shift of immunological responses.
