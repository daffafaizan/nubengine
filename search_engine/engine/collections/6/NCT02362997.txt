    
      Pembrolizumab is an antibody drug that blocks a molecule called PD-1. PD-1 is a receptor
      molecule on the surface of immune cells that can be used to turn off the immune response.
      Some cancers use this as a way to turn off the immune response against them. Blocking PD-1
      with pembrolizumabmay restore an effective immune attack against the lymphoma cells.

      On this study, patients who undergo ASCT for R/R cHL, DLBCL or PTCL in 1st remission will
      receive pembrolizumab at a dose of 200mg intravenously every 3 weeks for up to 8 cycles,
      beginning within a few weeks of ASCT.
