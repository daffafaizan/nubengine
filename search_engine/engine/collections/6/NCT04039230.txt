      portion of the study. A Phase I clinical trial tests the safety of an investigational drug
      and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational drug to use for further
      studies. "Investigational" means that the drug is being studied.

      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved sacituzumab govitecan as a
      treatment for any disease.

      The FDA has not approved talazoparib for this specific disease, but it has been approved for
      other uses in breast cancer.

      Sacituzumab govitecan is an antibody-drug conjugate which means it's made up of an antibody
      attached to an anticancer drug. An antibody is a protein normally made by the immune system
      (the system in the body that fights off diseases). Sacituzumab govitecan is believed to work
      by binding the antibody portion of the drug to the tumor(s) while the anticancer drug portion
      works to prevent the cancer cells from growing/spreading.

      Talazoparib belongs to a group of drugs called PARP inhibitors. PARP is a protein that is
      involved with repairing damaged DNA (the genetic material of cells). Talazoparib is believed
      to work by inhibiting (stopping) the PARP proteins from working in the cancer cells so that
      the cancer cannot fix its damaged DNA.

      The investigators believe that the combination of sacituzumab govitecan and talazoparib may
      help stop the cancer from growing and spreading by administering an anticancer drug directly
      to the cancerous tumor(s) through sacituzumab govitecan and by stopping the cancer's cells
      from fixing its damaged DNA through talazoparib.
