      to pain during this critical of brain development may have adverse consequences. Application
      of nasal CPAP is one of the painful procedures. A consensus statement on neonatal pain made
      recommendations for analgesia for neonatal procedures. Topical lidocaine is frequently used
      as a topical anesthetic during venipuncture, heel lancing, circumcision, endotracheal
      intubations, nasogastric tube insertion, endoscopy and bronchoscopy. However, the use of
      topical lidocaine for its analgesic effect on application of nasal CPAP has not been
      evaluated.

      This study proposes a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the relative efficacy of
      topical lidocaine on reducing pain associated with the application of nasal CPAP in preterm
      infants.
