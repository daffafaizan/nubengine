      threshold used to diagnose a heart attack identify patients who are at risk of having a heart
      attack in the future. Our research in patients with stable chest pain demonstrated that
      computed tomography coronary angiogram (CTCA) improved the diagnosis of coronary heart
      disease, leading to improvement in patient care that prevented many future heart attacks.
      This study will build on these two major strands of research to confirm whether these low
      levels of troponin can identify patients who have underlying coronary heart disease and may
      benefit from further testing and preventative treatment.

      The investigators will evaluate consecutive patients presenting to hospital with suspected
      acute coronary syndrome and cardiac troponin concentration within the normal reference range
      for the presence of underlying coronary artery disease. All participants will be invited for
      an outpatient CTCA.

      Findings from this study will help inform a randomised controlled trial to evaluate the role
      of CTCA in patients who have a heart attack ruled out, but are identified as intermediate
      risk on troponin testing.
