      years with unilateral PHP who will present to physiotherapy screening clinic through the
      medical referral. The participants will be evaluated then distributed randomly to receive a
      single session of either JM or MFR followed by an immediate reassessment and a follow-up
      reassessment after 2 weeks. The assessment will include ankle ROM, pain intensity (visual
      analog scale), static balance (one leg stance test), dynamic balance (time up and go test),
      plantar pressure distribution, and functional level (lower extremity functional scale LEFS).
      Analysis of parametric data will be done using ANOVA for the repeated measure. LEFS score
      will be calculated using Mann-Whitney U test for nonparametric data. Alpha < 0.05.
