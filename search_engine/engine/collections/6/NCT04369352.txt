    
      Patients at their first platinum-sensitive ROC will be invited to participate in the
      register.

      These are all patients with recurrent disease 6 or more months after the last cycle of
      platinum containing chemotherapy.

      The Observation Period will begin by signing the Informed Consent Form (ICF) and will
      continue for up to a total of 24 months (+/- 4 weeks) after the diagnosis of the first
      relapse or until patient discontinuation for any reason, or patient's death.

      Data on First Study Visit, Subsequent Recurrence during Observation Period and Last
      Observation will be collected in the electroinic Case Report Form (eCRF).

      The register will identify symptoms and factors that led to the diagnosis, chosen therapy and
      the reason for choosing the therapy. At inclusion, data on general patient information,
      primary diagnosis, previous therapy, and tumor characteristics are collected. During the
      course of observation data on systemic and maintenance treatments, radiotherapies, surgeries,
      and outcome are documented.
