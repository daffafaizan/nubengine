      GLP-1R-targeted radiopharmaceuticals were devoted to insulinoma localization
      imaging.68Ga-NOTA-MAL-Cys39-exendin-4 is an optimal probe targeting GLP-1R. A single dose of
      111-185 Mega-Becquerel (MBq) 68Ga-NOTA-MAL-Cys39-exendin-4 will be injected intravenously.
      Visual and semiquantitative method will be used to assess the PET/CT images.The investigators
      will determine the use of 68Ga-NOTA-MAL-Cys39-exendin-4 PET/CT in the detection of
      insulinomas, and to compare its diagnostic value with conventional imaging.
