      parent will be recruited to pilot the VR system. Participants will be identified through the
      Mayo Clinic Pediatric Anxiety Disorders Clinic. Each patient will participate in a single (up
      to) 2-hour visit. During the first 30 minutes the patient and parent will be introduced to
      the VR system and the rationale for this feasibility study. Next, a therapist will lead the
      patient through exposure exercises using the VR system for up to 30 minutes. During the next
      period, up to 30 minutes, the therapist will go to a different room and the patient, with
      support from their parent, will complete exposure exercises using the VR system that the
      therapist directed them to complete. During the exposures the interviewer will observe, code
      and record the patient's interaction with the VR system. For the remaining time (up to 30
      minutes) the interviewer will interview the patient about his or her experience with the VR
      system and then will ask for observations and opinions from the parent.
