      ringing sounds and fullness in the ear. In one out of five patients, standard first line
      medical treatment is not effective in controlling vertigo attacks. For these incapacitated
      patients, gentamicin injections through the ear drum is a well established minimally invasive
      treatment. Major surgery of the balance organs or nerve, risking complete hearing loss, CSF
      leak, meningeal infections, are rarely performed nowadays. Gentamicn is very effective in
      controlling vertigo and acts by chemical ablation of end organs. As hearing and balance
      organs are entwined around each other, gentamicin treatment does not come without the risk of
      hearing loss. In fact, meta-analysis shows hearing deterioration in 13% to 35% percent of
      gentamicin treated patients. On the other hand, steroids are drug of choice for autoimmune
      inner ear disease and commonly used for sudden hearing loss. They are non toxic drugs without
      any known side effects during local treatment in ear. We will compare the two in this
      randomised, double blind trial.
