      cancer. The study procedures are as below:

        -  After the Informed Consent Form is signed, swab from the lesion site and normal site to
           obtain oral epithelial cells.

        -  Collect tissue from the tumor site and the non-cancerous matched site from the surgery
           or the tissue bank.

        -  Collect oral swab from the lesion site and the normal site when patients return to the
           clinic for a regular follow-up.

      Specimens will be collected for DNA methylation testing, and the results will be compared
      with patient's clinical diagnosis. It is expected that the relationship between DNA
      methylation, oral cancer, and the recurrence of oral cancer will be found.
