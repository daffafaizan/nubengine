      18 and 65 years of age and diagnosed as AS according to the modified New York diagnostic
      criteria were included

      Patients group was divided two part as patients with (group 1)and without (group 2)
      osteoporosis.

      The patient's global rating scale is a self-assessed scale of the patient with a grade of 10
      (1: very bad, 5: moderate, 10: very good). To assess the disease activity, Bath ankylosing
      spondylitis disease index (BASDAI) and Bath ankylosing spondylitis functional index (BASFI)
      were evaluated. BASDAI is a self-assessment scale used to determine disease activity in
      patients with AS.

      Schober measurement was used to evaluate lumbar mobility of the patients. Chest expansions
      were measured in all patients.

      Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as kg/height m2. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESH mm
      / h), C-reactive protein (CRP mg / l) levels were measured in all patients.

      BMD measurements were made by using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) and lumbar
      vertebra (L1-4) and left femur (femoral neck and total) regions. DEXA measurements (GE /
      LUNAR DPX PRO) were performed and the results were recorded using standard T score. Bone
      mineral densities of patients were based on the World Health Organization (WHO)
      classification of a T score between -1 and -2.5 for osteopenia; and a score of -2.5 for
      osteoporosis.
