      conducted. Participants must have a clinical reaction during this OFC to initiate study
      dosing. After the initial OFC, the study design includes four phases:

        -  Initial dose escalation (1 day): Peanut or placebo dosing will be given incrementally
           and increase every 20 minutes until a dose of 12 mg peanut flour (6 mg peanut protein)
           or placebo flour is given.

        -  Build-up (30 weeks): Initial observed dose administration of highest tolerated dose,
           followed by daily OIT at home with return visit every 2 weeks for dose escalation.

        -  Maintenance (104 weeks):The participant will continue on daily OIT with return visits
           every 13 weeks. At the end of this phase the participant will undergo a blinded OFC to
           10 g peanut flour (5 g peanut protein).

        -  Avoidance (26 weeks): In this final phase participants will be seen every 13 weeks. At
           the completion of this phase participants will have a final blinded OFC to 10g peanut
           flour (5 g peanut protein).
