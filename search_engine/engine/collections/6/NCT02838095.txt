      groups took part in a 15-day protocol that started with 2 9-hour adaptation and baseline
      nights, followed by two successive cycles of sleep restriction (5-h time-in-bed [TIB];
      01:00-06:00) and recovery (9-h TIB; 23:00-08:00) intended to simulate the weekday sleep loss
      and weekend attempt to 'catch up' that are familiar to high school students. The nap group
      received a 1-hour nap opportunity at 14:00 following each sleep-restricted night, while
      participants in the no nap group watched a documentary. Sleep was monitored with
      polysomnography on 9 selected nights. Cognitive performance, subjective sleepiness, and mood
      were assessed 3 times daily (10:00, 15:45, and 20:00).

      All participants stayed in air-conditioned, twin-share bedrooms with en-suite bathrooms.
      Bedroom windows were fitted with blackout panels to ensure participants were not woken up
      prematurely by sunlight. Earplugs were also provided, and participants were allowed to adjust
      the temperature of their bedrooms to their personal comfort. 3 main meals were served each
      day, with snacks being provided for upon request. Caffeinated drinks, unscheduled sleep, and
      strenuous physical activities were prohibited.

      Outside of scheduled sleep, meal, and cognitive testing times, participants spent the
      majority of their free time in a common room that was illuminated by natural and artificial
      lighting. They were allowed to read, play non-physically exerting games, watch videos, and
      interact with research staff and other participants. Participants were under constant
      supervision by the research staff.
