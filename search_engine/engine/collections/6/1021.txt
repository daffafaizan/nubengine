haemophilic pseudotumours (3 cases).the 2 first cases of haemophilic pseudo-tumoursin 2 adults affected with haemophiliaa reported are remarkable on account of theirclinical latency and their intertrochantericlocalization.  the third, in a haemophiliac b, isvery extensive and is accompanied by verymarked clinical symptoms of tumour.  there isan extensive femoral gap with a subjacentimage of osseous infarction and a progressiveturgid tumour of the iliac wing of thesame side.  the literature data stress the discrepancybetween the progressive characterof this veritable tumour and the absence ofany sign of histological malignancy.
