    
      Children diagnosed with either Crohn's disease (CD) or Ulcerative Colitis (UC) under
      follow-up at the Pediatric gastroenterology institute, Schneider Children's Hospital, will be
      enrolled. Patients can be enrolled at diagnosis or at any time point during follow-up.
      Patients' characteristics will be retrieved from their medical files including demographic
      details, disease phenotype, anthropometric measures, laboratory evaluation, complication and
      therapeutic regimens. At enrollment all patients will perform body composition assessment by
      air displacement plethysmography (ADP) and DEXA (no greater than 7 days between the 2 methods
      of measurement). At one and two years following initial assessment ADP measurement will be
      repeated, mid arm circumference and skin fold measurements will be taken and the patient will
      fill a physical activity questionnaire. Disease activity score (either Pediatric Crohn's
      Disease Activity Index for CD or Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index for UC) will be
      calculated. Similar evaluation will be performed prior and immediately following exclusive
      enteral nutrition or corticosteroid courses and prior to any biologic therapy initiation.
