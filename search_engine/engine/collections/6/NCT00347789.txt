      for the trabeculectomy procedure. In order to control the rising intraocular pressure due to
      the failed trabeculectomy, medications may be restarted and/or filtering surgery may need to
      be repeated. Our primary research showed that transconjunctival mitomycin-C in needle bleb
      revision may be an effective procedure to control this situation.

      This retrospective study will follow over 100 patients from May 1997 to May 2006. This
      long-term follow up will help assess the future role of this technique in glaucoma practices.
