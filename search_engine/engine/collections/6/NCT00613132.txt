    
      This is open-label, single center, 1-arm ph I dose-escalation study of continuous, daily
      doses of imatinib mesylate & RAD001 administered orally in combination w fixed doses of
      hydroxyurea in adult pts w recurrent or relapsing glioblastoma multiforme. Study format
      includes classical "3+3" dose escalation design to determine MTD & DLT of imatinib mesylate +
      RAD001 when combined w hydroxyurea among GBM pts. Pts will be stratified based on whether
      they who are receiving EIACD & each stratum will independently dose escalate. Additionally,
      study will characterize safety, tolerability, biologic activity, & pharmacokinetic profile of
      this combo therapy.
