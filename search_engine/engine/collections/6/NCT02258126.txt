    
      The control group will attend a healthy lifestyle education program (2 days/month) and
      supportive therapy and behavioral advice for both children and parents to improve nutrition
      and physical activity (nutritionists and psychologists).

      The intervention group will attend an exercise (3 days/week) and healthy lifestyle education
      (2 days/month) combined program. Training sessions will include 90 minutes of exercise,
      comprising warm-up and skill development, moderate to vigorous aerobic activities,
      flexibility and strength exercises.

      Before (baseline) and after the intervention (6 months) total and abdominal adiposity, lean
      tissue mass and bone mass density (dual-X-ray-absorptiometry), abdominal visceral and hepatic
      adiposity (magnetic resonance imaging), and blood insulin, glucose, C-reactive protein,
      alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, gamma-glutamil transpeptidase and lipid
      profile will be measured. Furthermore, cardiorespiratory fitness (treadmill test) and blood
      pressure will be measured before and after the intervention. Changes (6 months - baseline) in
      dietary habits will be estimated by using two repeated 24h recalls and food frequency
      questionnaires and changes (6 months - baseline) in physical activity by accelerometry.
