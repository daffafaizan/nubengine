      levels of SERCA2a protein compared to those with normal kidney function. We propose that such
      a correlation will provide convincing evidence that these patients,have a defective
      redistribution in intracellular calcium handling as an explanation for their increase risk in
      sudden cardiac death an fatal arrhythmias. To achieve our specific aims: 1) we will screen
      patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) going for certain vascular procedures. 2) obtain
      an echocardiogram on these patients including only those with isolated diastolic dysfunction
      or LVH. 3) Patients who has diastolic dysfunction or LVH will be assessed for underlying
      microvolt (TWA) 4) vessel and skin tissue on these patients will be collected for SERCA2a
      quantification.
