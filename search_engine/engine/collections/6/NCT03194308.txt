      unknown-serostatus partner. For a woman who cannot depend on a partner to test, initiate and
      adhere to ART, sex without condoms puts her at high risk of acquiring HIV and increases the
      risk of perinatal transmission to her child. Daily, oral TDF/FTC PrEP dramatically reduces a
      woman's risk of HIV-acquisition and is the only female-controlled option for reducing the
      risk of periconception HIV-acquisition. Understanding whether daily, oral PrEP is feasible
      for uninfected women seeking pregnancy is critical to reducing HIV incidence among women and
      their children.

      Placebo-controlled trials identified adherence as a major challenge to long-term PrEP use.
      However, women are eager for prevention strategies that allow for conception, and we
      hypothesize that adherence to a proven prevention strategy, for a limited time with the
      motivation to have a healthy child, will confer drug levels required to prevent HIV
      transmission. This project will inform whether daily, oral PrEP is a feasible HIV-prevention
      strategy for South African women who intend to conceive with risky partners. Given the
      repercussions of acquiring HIV during conception and pregnancy, this is an important step
      towards providing a key prevention strategy to women and their children.
