      I. To utilize clinical and biological characteristics of acute leukemias to screen for
      patient eligibility for available phase I/II Pediatric Acute Leukemia (PedAL) sub-trials.

      II. To maintain a longitudinal and comprehensive registry from relapse in children and young
      adults with recurrent and refractory leukemia.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo collection of blood and/or bone marrow samples at baseline, end of treatment
      cycle(s), and at relapse/refractory disease status (if applicable).

      After completion of study, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years, and then
