      assigned to 1 of 3 study arms: (1) the in-person education group, (2) the online education
      group, and (3) a control group. The in-person intervention group attended four class sessions
      addressing numeracy skills used in the management of diabetes (e.g., counting carbohydrates).
      The online education group completed a single online module providing training on
      diabetes-related numeracy skills. The control group received written diabetes educational
      materials. The investigators collected data at baseline, then again immediately after
      intervention participation (in-person or online classes), and one final time about three
      months after the conclusion of the intervention. The investigators will conduct analyses to
      determine if intervention participants experienced positive changes in diabetes numeracy (the
      primary outcome) as well as several secondary outcome measures following intervention.
      Secondary outcomes include: diabetes knowledge, self-efficacy, outcome expectancies,
      readiness to change, self-care behavior, and clinical outcomes (i.e., body mass index, blood
      pressure, blood sugar [A1c]) . The investigators also will assess whether change in numeracy
      predicts change in these secondary outcomes.
