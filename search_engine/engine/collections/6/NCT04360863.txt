      According to World Health Organization (WHO), due to the harmful effects on the lungs and the
      possible viral transmission from fingers to mouth during smoking, tobacco use is considered a
      major risk factor for developing COVID-19. Both tobacco use and COVID-19 can cause damage to
      the cardiovascular and respiratory systems. Smokers infected with COVID-19 are at higher risk
      of developing severe COVID-19 symptoms or death than non-smokers.

      The Hong Kong SAR (HKSAR) government has announced different regulations to combat the spread
      of COVID-19 since late January 2020, which significantly affect the working patterns and
      everyday lives of people. It remains unknown how smoking habits and smoking cessation
      services are being affected during the pandemic.
