      post-market clinical follow up study whereby patients undergoing routine cataract surgery
      will have bilateral implantation of trifocal intraocular lenses FineVision POD F GF (PhysIOL,
      Li√®ge, Belgium).

      The study purpose is to obtain clinical data on visual acuity, contrast sensitivity,
      questionnaire outcomes and PCO rate on patients implanted with FineVision POD F GF.

      The device under investigation (FineVision POD F GF) is a trifocal glistening-free
      hydrophobic acrylic intraocular lens (IOL) manufactured by the sponsor of this study PhysIOL
      sa/nv. The IOL will be implanted as part of the routine cataract surgery on patients
      suffering from cataract development.

      In total 25 patients will be recruited for this clinical study and receive a bilateral
      implantation of FineVision POD F GF intraocular lens.

      Subjects participating in the trial will attend a total of 8 study visits (1 preoperative, 2
      operative and 5 postoperative) over a period of 24 months.
