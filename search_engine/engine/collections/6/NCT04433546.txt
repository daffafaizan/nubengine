      treatment. On Day 0 (Visit 2) subjects who meet inclusion criteria and none of exclusion
      criteria will receive a weekly subcutaneous injection that will continue once weekly until
      hospital discharge or for a maximum of 4 weeks during hospitalization, whichever is shorter.

      All subjects will be randomized to either a low control (10 mg), middle (40 mg), or high (100
      mg) dose of active treatment. If subject is not discharged, they will continue to Day 7, 14,
      21 treatments. Pemziviptadil (PB1046) is expected to improve the clinical outcomes of
      hospitalized COVID-19 subjects with an earlier hospital discharge and improvement in
      survival.

      The duration of hospitalization for each subject will be determined by clinical status
      independent of study procedures. The estimated duration of the study for each subject,
      including screening, is approximately 35+7 days. The subjects may be involved up to 42 days.
