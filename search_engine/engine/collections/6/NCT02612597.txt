      in contrast hereto that physical activity improves insulin sensitivity the underlying
      mechanisms are still to a large extend unknown. With this study the investigators wish to
      test two independent hypotheses that may explain the observed changes:

      The first hypothesis is that part of the explanation for the known increase in circulating
      levels of glucose in response to an oral glucose tolerance test (indicating reduced insulin
      sensitivity) following bed rest is due to a concomitantly reduced blood volume and thereby
      dilution space.

      In addition the investigators also speculate that the reduced glucose response to an oral
      glucose tolerance test (indicating improved insulin sensitivity) after a training period is
      related to the exercise induced increase in blood volume, and hence an increased dilution
      space.

      Based on this, the hypothesis to be tested with these two experimental approaches (bed rest
      and aerobic exercise training), is that at least part of the changes observed in the glucose
      tolerance following bed rest and aerobic exercise training are related to concomitantly
      occurring changes in blood volume.

      The second hypothesis to be tested is that another important contributor to the changes in
      circulating glucose levels following an oral glucose tolerance test after bed rest and
      physical training are related to diminished or improved capacity for skeletal muscle glucose
      uptake and glycogen storage, respectively. The rationale here fore are that exercise training
      increases skeletal muscle glycogen content and storage capacity in healthy and type 2
      diabetic patients, respectively, and that bed rest does the opposite.

      To test this hypothesis two different intervention studies will be conducted. Study 1 is a
      bed rest study with healthy untrained subjects and study 2 is a training study with obese
      "pre-diabetic patients".
