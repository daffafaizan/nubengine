      days 5/6, in 10 ul medium. A total of 100 samples (50 spent media from Day 3 and 50 from Day
      5/6) will be use in the study.

      Double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) amplifiability will be evaluated in embryos culture media by
      quantitative PCR on a multicopy gene target (TBC1D3). Quantification will be made with a
      standard curve constructed with genomic DNA (with culture media -day 3 and day5-, to take
      into account media inhibitory effects) TSPY1 amplification will be use to assess the presence
      of Y chromosome WGA followed by PCR on a single copy gene (MTHFR gene) will be performed on a
      subset of some samples to monitor the C677T polymorphism (genotyping by sequencing) WGA
      followed by PCR on a single copy gene (MTHFR) will be also performed on blastocoele fluids
