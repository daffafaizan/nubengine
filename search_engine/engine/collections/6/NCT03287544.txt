      standard treatment of aphasia after stroke although it is based on weak scientific evidence.
      To date, the efficacy criteria of aphasia rehabilitation are early stage, intensity as well
      as personalized treatment. Usually these patients receive in acute phase a linguistic
      training focused on the linguistic impairment. This approach is based on the cerebral
      plasticity postulate. However the superiority of this practice compared to other methods has
      never been shown. Moreover the benefit of the combination gathering linguistic treatment with
      communication treatment has to our knowledge never been studied.

      In the present study investigators propose to compare the effect of a combined
      linguistic/communication rehabilitation versus a linguistic treatment. To do so,
      investigators will recruit patients with aphasia after a first stroke, in the acute phase.
      After a allocation to the " combined " and " linguistic " groups, all the patients will have
      a comprehensive language and neuropsychological assessment before and after 3 months of
      rehabilitation, and finally 6 months after the onset.

      The "linguistic" group will have a rehabilitation only focused on linguistic processes
      whereas the "combined" group will have a linguistic training as well as communication
      training. The therapy will be personalized and the therapists will exclusively use
      standardized linguistic and/or communication toolboxes of rehabilitation containing dedicated
      activities.
