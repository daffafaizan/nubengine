      immune activation and inflammation augment MI risk among women. To this end, WHIV and
      non-HIV-infected women will undergo structural and functional cardiovascular imaging studies
      (Cardiac PET, 99mTc-tilmanocept SPECT/CT, Contrast Enhanced Coronary and Aortic Computed
      Tomography Angiography) as well as vascular, metabolic/hormonal, and immune phenotyping.
      Measures of immune activation, arterial inflammation, and cardiovascular pathology will be
      compared between groups and interrelationships between these parameters will be assessed
      among WHIV.
