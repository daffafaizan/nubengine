      (LOC) eating, during which individuals experience an inability to control the amount of food
      they are consuming. LOC eating appears to be associated cross-sectionally with greater
      adiposity in children and adolescents, and appears to predispose youth to gain weight or body
      fat above that expected due to normal growth, thus likely contributing to obesity in
      susceptible individuals. Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT), a form of psychotherapy that has
      been adapted for the treatment of eating disorders, has demonstrated efficacy in reducing
      binge eating episodes and inducing modest weight loss (or at least weight stabilization)
      among adults diagnosed with binge eating disorder. We adapted group IPT for the targeted
      prevention of excessive weight gain (IPT-WG) among adolescent girls. Our pilot data support
      the feasibility and acceptability of a 12-week group IPT-WG trial among adolescent girls at
      high risk for obesity who report LOC eating, and preliminary findings suggest that IPT-WG has
      the potential to prevent excessive weight gain. We now propose an adequately powered clinical
      trial to evaluate the efficacy of IPT-WG compared to a standard-of-care health education for
      stabilizing weight and body fat gain trajectories in 117 adolescent girls at high risk for
      adult obesity who report LOC eating. Participants will be randomly assigned to a 12-week
      group IPT-WG or health education group; anthropometric variables will be measured at
      baseline, immediately after, and for up to 1 year following the initiation of treatment. We
      will assess the efficacy of IPT-WG in improving social functioning and reducing negative
      mood, disturbed eating patterns, and emotional distress. We also aim to determine the impact
      of IPT-WG on objective measures of LOC eating during a test meal and on appetitive hormones.
