      cause malnutrition, intellectual retardation and cognitive and educational deficits.

      Although school-based intervention specifically the deworming antihelminths drugs programme
      were introduced into school but still Orang Asli villages in Malaysia having a high intensity
      and higher prevalence rate for STH, therefore the objective of this article was to review
      other intervention means mainly the health education intervention into school children and
      rural community, where most of these studies concluded that health education intervention was
      successful in increasing knowledge and changing some of practices among people and children
      which in turn decreases the prevalence and intensity of the STH. Also we think applying such
      intervention in Malaysia would be a benefit to change knowledge and attitude towards STH, and
      it will be the first research study to be applied in this field.
