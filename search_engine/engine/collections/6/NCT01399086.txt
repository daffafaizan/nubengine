      postmenopausal women with metastatic breast cancer in current clinical practice in Greece. In
      view of this significant lack of knowledge, we designed this retrospective study in order to
      evaluate the effectiveness of fulvestrant in real-life settings, by obtaining data regarding
      the use of fulvestrant in current clinical practice among treating physicians in Greece. This
      retrospective study aims to address the following questions:

        -  What is the clinical outcome of fulvestrant treatment in terms of TTP when used in
           metastatic breast cancer in a real life clinical setting?

        -  What is the positioning of fulvestrant in the hormone therapy sequencing in metastatic
           breast cancer in Greece?

        -  What are the other clinical outcomes (ORR, duration of response, CBR) of fulvestrant
           treatment in metastatic breast cancer in a real life clinical setting and what is the
           relation between clinical outcomes and fulvestrant's position in the treatment sequence?

        -  What is the usual duration of fulvestrant treatment in metastatic breast cancer in the
           real life clinical setting and which are the reasons for treatment discontinuation?

        -  Treatment failure with fulvestrant: what is the next step in sequencing according to
           patients' breast cancer treatment history?
