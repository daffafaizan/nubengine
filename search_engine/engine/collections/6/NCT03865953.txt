    
      This is a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover, phase IIa study to
      investigate the efficacy and safety of oral LAT8881 in neuropathic pain. After a one week
      baseline period, subjects entered into the study will be randomised to receive
      Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) (LAT8881 or placebo) twice daily for four weeks.

      The first treatment period will be followed by a washout period of two weeks and then a
      second baseline period of one week. Subjects will not take any IMP over these three weeks.

      After the second baseline period, subjects will cross over to receive the second treatment
      (either LAT8881 or placebo, whichever treatment was not received in the first treatment
      period) twice daily for four weeks.

      The pharmacokinetics (PK) of LAT8881 will be investigated in 15 subjects (PK subjects) at
      selected Australian sites.
