    
      Hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) is the most common sexual complaint in women. Over
      the past 8 years, Dr. Stephanie Cacioppo has developed and validated the Desire Intention
      task, in which individuals are instructed to indicate as rapidly and as accurately as
      possible whether or not each visually presented stimulus (e.g., attractive persons of the
      opposite sex) is sexually desirable to them at the moment of the experiment. Flibanserin
      (Addyi) is a new medication approved by the FDA for the treatment of HSDD in pre-menopausal
      women. The investigators propose a study using the DIT to determine the extent to which
      Flibanserin normalizes brain activity in women with HSDD and the extent to which regional
      brain activation is associated with changes in symptoms and behavior.
