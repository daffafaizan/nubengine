    
      Primary Objectives

        -  To evaluate the feasibility and toxicity of vaccination in women with CIN2/3 caused by
           HPV16

        -  To evaluate the effect of vaccination on histology

        -  To compare immunogenicity of three different routes of administration: intradermal (ID),
           intramuscular (IM), intralesional (IL).

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To evaluate changes in HPV viral load

        -  To evaluate the cellular immune response to vaccination

        -  To evaluate the humoral immune response to vaccination

        -  To evaluate local tissue immune response

        -  To correlate measures of immune response with clinical response

        -  To correlate measures of immune response with those observed in the preclinical model
