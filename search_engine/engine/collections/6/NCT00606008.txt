      by a 2-week rest period. This 6-week regimen constituted 1 cycle. Patients were treated for
      up to 9 cycles [~ year) or until disease progression or death or if persistent toxicities
      occurred. Complete blood count with differential, complete metabolic profile, neurologic
      exam, and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with contrast were obtained after each
      cycle. Toxicity assessments were obtained after each cycle. Toxicity was graded according to
      National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE), version
      3.0.
