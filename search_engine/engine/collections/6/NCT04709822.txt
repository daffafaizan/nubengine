      remotely via telephone or secure video platform (Kara Connect). In the baseline session,
      questionnaires are administered and the individual intrusive trauma memories will be logged
      for monitoring their frequency in a daily diary. Participants will record their intrusive
      memories in the daily diary for at least one week (Week -1) before commencing the
      intervention. In the first intervention session, a memory will be selected and targeted with
      the intervention (memory reminder followed by 25 min gameplay with mental rotation). We aim
      to deliver a second intervention session soon after the first (within approx. one week),
      targeting the same or a different intrusive memory. Participants are instructed that they may
      continue using the technique self-guided after the first intervention session, and they may
      opt for additional intervention sessions with remote researcher support (maximum 6
      intervention sessions). Participants continue to monitor the frequency of both targeted and
      non-targeted intrusive memories in the daily diary throughout Weeks 0-5. Follow-up
      questionnaires are completed at Week 1, 1-month, and 3-months after the second intervention
      session. The primary outcome is change in total number of intrusive memories from the
      baseline week (Week -1) to the fifth week after the second intervention session (Week 5).
      Participants will also monitor the frequency of their intrusive memories for one week at the
      3-month follow-up. The investigators note that the intended time-frames may differ slightly
      across participants depending on availability and the practicalities of remote delivery.
