      particularly of the hip, shoulder and foot. Additionally, type 2 diabetes is associated with
      a 50-60% increase in the risk of falling. The higher risk of fracture associated with type 2
      diabetes is an important health burden for these patients. More frequent falls and perhaps
      reduced bone strength in those with diabetes are thought to be key contributing factors. The
      best approach to preventing fractures in type 2 diabetes is not yet understood. There is
      observational evidence to support our hypothesis that better glycemic control will preserve
      bone and reduce falls and fractures. The ACCORD-BONE study provides a unique opportunity to
      determine whether intensive glycemic control will prevent fractures, falls, and bone loss in
      older diabetic adults, which may lead to improved treatment and prevention in the future.
