      advanced, and metastatic gastric cancer is better than that compared to best supportive care.
      In general, combination chemotherapies are more efficient than monotherapy and so it is
      reasonable to give combination chemotherapy to patients with good performance status.

      Especially dual combination chemotherapy with fluoropyrimidine and platinum has shown the
      objective response rate of 25-48% in patients with newly diagnosed advanced metastatic
      gastric cancer and several studies about triple combination with oxaliplatin, irinotecan, and
      fluoropyrimidine have shown the response rate of 53~75% but also higher rate of hematologic
      adverse events. So the investigators had conducted the phase I study of these three drugs
      with modification of dosage and schedule and will conduct a phase II study with recommended
      dose of triple chemotherapy from this phase I study.
