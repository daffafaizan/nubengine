      I. To measure the overall efficacy of the intervention in reducing the rate of incident
      cervical HPV infection.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Perform in vitro exploratory testing of how long after vaginal application the drug
      retains biological activity by collecting cervicovaginal lavage (CVL) at different times and
      spiking the samples with HPV pseudovirions (PsVs) and measuring PsV entry into target cells.

      II. These studies will be expanded to test multiple HPV types and to examine whether the
      anti-HPV activity of the intervention is preserved in the setting of semen.

      III. Store swabs to potentially test candidate biomarkers of microbicide efficacy and safety.

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Participants apply carrageenan-containing gel vaginally within 12 hours prior to each
      vaginal sex act and as soon as possible within 12 hours after each vaginal sex act and use
      condoms for 12 months.

      ARM II: Participants apply placebo gel vaginally within 12 hours prior to each vaginal sex
      act and as soon as possible within 12 hours after each vaginal sex act and use condoms for 12
      months.
