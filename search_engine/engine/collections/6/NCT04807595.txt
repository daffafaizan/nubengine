    
      This is a worldwide, multicenter, non-interventional, retrospective study. The study will
      consist of 2 components. The first component involves local lab rescoring of qualified
      historical HER2 fixed tissue immunohistochemistry (IHC) stained slides (preferably using
      Ventana 4B5 assay) at sites (post-training) for mBC patients previously identified as
      HER2-neg, and independent central retesting of HER2 status using Ventana 4B5 assay for any
      enrolled patients with available archived tissue samples at designated central laboratories.
      Local lab rescoring and independent central retesting/local lab retesting will be conducted
      blinded of historical HER2 IHC scores.

      The second component involves linking the rescored IHC status to the patient medical record
      either through registry databases or patient chart review. Such information will be used to
      describe the patient demographics, histopathological features, clinical presentation, and
      treatment patterns following mBC diagnosis, and clinical outcomes in real-world settings for
      all patients with HER2 scores of 0, >0 and < 1+, and 1+2+/ISH- (HER2 low). The
      clinicopathological and other relevant BC biomarker information will also be examined based
      on historical biomarker testing results and/or new testing conducted as part of this study.
