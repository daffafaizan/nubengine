      infection and sepsis remain the leading acquired causes of morbidity and mortality in
      critically ill children. Subsequent use of antibiotics to treat nosocomial infection and
      sepsis is considered a major attributable factor in the rise of antibiotic-resistant
      organisms in this population of children. Presently, "prophylaxis" strategies are used to
      prevent stress-induced gastrointestinal bleeding; however, no "prophylaxis" strategy is used
      to prevent stress-induced nosocomial infection and sepsis. When left unopposed, the stress
      hormone, cortisol, induces lymphocyte apoptosis, lymphopenia, and immune insufficiency.
      Prolactin is the counter-regulatory stress hormone that prevents cortisol-induced apoptosis
      and immunosuppression. Zinc, selenium, and glutamine are also important in maintenance of
      lymphocyte health. Critically ill patients commonly develop hypoprolactinemia secondary to
      increased central nervous system dopaminergic activity, as well as zinc, selenium, and
      glutamine deficiency caused by increased utilization and decreased supply. Hypoprolactinemia
      can be prevented by metoclopramide, a dopamine 2 receptor antagonist commonly used as a
      prokinetic in children, and zinc, selenium, and glutamine deficiency can be prevented with
      enteral supplementation. This study will use a double-blind randomized controlled trial
      design to test the hypothesis that daily prophylaxis with metoclopramide, zinc, selenium and
      glutamine will reduce nosocomial infection and sepsis in critically ill children.
