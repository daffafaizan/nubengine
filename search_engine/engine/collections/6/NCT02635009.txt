      I. Determine whether the 12-month intracranial relapse rate following hippocampal avoidance
      (HA)-prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) is non-inferior compared to the rate following
      PCI for patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC). (Randomized Phase II Component
      [Non-Inferiority]) II. Determine whether HA-PCI reduces the likelihood of 6-month
      deterioration from baseline in Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (HVLT)-Revised (R) delayed recall
      compared to PCI for patients with SCLC. (Phase III Component [Efficacy])

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare time to cognitive failure, as measured by a battery of tests (HVLT-R, Controlled
      Oral Word Association [COWA] test, and Trail Making Test [TMT] parts A and B), after PCI
      versus HA-PCI in SCLC.

      II. Compare time to cognitive failure as separately measured by each test (HVLT-R for Total
      Recall and Delayed Recognition, COWA test, and TMT parts A and B), after PCI versus HA-PCI
      for SCLC.

      III. Compare patient-reported cognitive functioning and other quality of life domains
      (assessed by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer [EORTC] Quality
      of Life Questionnaire [QLQ]-Core [C]30 and BN20) between PCI versus HA-PCI for patients with
      SCLC.

      IV. Compare overall survival after PCI versus HA-PCI for patients with SCLC. V. Compare
      12-month intracranial relapse rate (at completion of phase III) and time to intracranial
      relapse after PCI versus HA-PCI for patients with SCLC.

      VI. Evaluate adverse events according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
      (CTCAE) criteria.

      VII. Correlate changes in health-related quality of life (HRQOL) domains with changes in
      cognitive testing outcomes following PCI versus HA-PCI for patients with SCLC.

      VIII. Assess cost-effectiveness of HA-PCI (intensity modulated radiation therapy [IMRT]) and
      PCI (3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy [3DCRT]) using the EuroQual (EQ)-5-Dimensions
      (5D)-5L.

      IX. Correlate miRNA signatures with cognitive failure in SCLC patients who received PCI and
      HA-PCI.

      X. Evaluate APOE genotyping as potential predictor of neurocognitive decline, hippocampal
      atrophy after brain irradiation and/or differential benefit from hippocampal avoidance.

      XI. Evaluate baseline MR imaging biomarkers of white matter injury and hippocampal volumetry
      as potential predictors of cognitive decline and differential benefit from HA-PCI as compared
      to PCI.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Collect serum, whole blood, and urine for future translational research analyses.

      II. Evaluate baseline magnetic resonance (MR) imaging biomarkers of white matter injury and
      hippocampal volumetry as potential predictors of cognitive decline and differential benefit
      from HAPCI as compared to PCI.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients undergo PCI using 3DCRT daily for 2 weeks.

      ARM II: Patients undergo PCI with HA using IMRT daily for 2 weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, then
      every 6 months until 3 years and then annually until death.
