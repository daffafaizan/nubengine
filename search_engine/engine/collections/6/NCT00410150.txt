      inpatient length of stay in children hospitalized with acute asthma exacerbations. Severity
      of asthma will be characterized using a modified Becker Clinical Asthma Score (CAS) based
      upon the acuity of physical signs for four clinical characteristics (respiratory rate,
      wheezing, I/E ratio, and accessory muscle use). Scoring will occur at the time of enrollment
      and every 4 hours thereafter until the patient meets hospital discharge criteria. All scoring
      using the CAS will be performed by an independent physician, nurse or respiratory therapist
      blinded to the subject treatment arm. All children will receive standard cardiopulmonary
      monitoring and treatment, consisting of supplemental oxygen delivered as needed by either
      nasal cannula or face mask to maintain oxygen saturation >90%, maintenance intravenous
      fluids, corticosteroid therapy and nebulized albuterol therapy. After written informed
      consent, eligible children will be randomized to one of two study groups using a sealed
      envelope technique:

      Group 1 (Heliox-Powered Albuterol) patients will receive all albuterol nebulizer treatments,
      including continuous therapy, powered by 70:30 Heliox.

      Group 2 (Oxygen-Powered Albuterol) patients will receive all albuterol nebulizer treatments,
      including continuous therapy, powered by 100% oxygen per usual standard of care.
