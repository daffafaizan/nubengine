    
      The purpose of this trial is to study the clinical effects of increasing the weekly fraction
      number for locally advanced head and neck cancers by a multi-institutional prospective
      randomised trial. The primary endpoint is to clarify whether a six fraction per week protocol
      has a greater effect on the survival, as compared to the conventional five fraction per week
      protocol.
