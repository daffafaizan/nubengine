      the mortality of the patients with COPD. Guidelines have recommended systemic glucocorticoid
      as regular treatment. Recently, evidences have shown that systemic glucocorticoid cannot not
      be benefit to all of the patients with AECOPD. Thus the problem that how the clinicians can
      screen the patients who can benefit from systemic glucocorticoid needs to be solved urgently.
      A previous study found that plasma metabolome changed significantly after dexamethasone
      treatment in health participants. Furthermore, inter-person variability was high and remained
      uninfluenced by treatment, suggesting the potential of metabolomics for predicting the
      efficacy and side effects of systemic glucocorticoid. Our previous study found that serum
      metabolites profile in COPD patients differed from that in controls. Therefore, the
      investigators hypothesized that metabolome changes in patients with AECOPD may be associated
      with the efficacy of systemic glucocorticoid. In this study, the investigators will utilize
      ultraperformance liquid chromatography / mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and gas chromatography /
      mass spectrometry (GC-MS) methods for analysis of the metabolites in AECOPD patients and
      compare the metabolites profiles between patients with systemic glucocorticoid treatment
      success and treatment failure. The investigators aim to detect the metabolic biomarkers and
      metabolic pathways which are related to efficacy of systemic glucocorticoid and contribute to
      the precise treatment of COPD.
