      deregulation of hormonal balance, causing both acute and chronic systemic inflammatory
      reactions mediated by white blood cells. We furthermore postulate that a carbohydrate-rich
      diet is a major risk factor in the development of obesity and life style diseases directly
      resulting from chronic systemic inflammation. We therefore want to use an integrated
      multidisciplinary systems biology approach to identify the hormones, genes and pathways
      specifically responding to a dietary carbohydrate reduction, to develop biomarkers that can
      be used for risk assessment, to identify molecular pathways and build mathematical models
      that describe the link between diet and inflammation, and use this knowledge to provide
      personalised dietary advice.
