      patients who present with different diseases that involve or implicate the immune system
      dysregulation (HIV infection, autoimmune diseases and cancer). These PBMC will be studied in
      vitro for a number of functional parameters, including generating soluable factors that
      inhibit HIV infection, developing patterns of immune dysregulation, and inducing apoptotic T
      cell death. The purpose of such studies is to obtain insight into the mechanisms of natural
      resistance to viral infections, AIDS pathogenesis, and disease-induced immune dysregulation.
