      100 patients over a 12-month period. This cohort will be the largest pathological database of
      COVID-19 patients who developed ARDS. In accordance with the French law, this study has been
      approved and registered by the French Agency of Biomedicine and the French Ministry of
      Education and Research (#PFS 20-016). Two transcutaneous lung biopsies per patient will be
      performed using a 14G needle and anatomical landmarks (1 anterior biopsy and 1 posterior
      biopsy). All biopsies will be referred to the Department of Pathology of Nantes university
      hospital and analysed by a group of pathologists specialized in lung tissue. The primary
      objective is to describe and characterize the lesions of the lung induced by the SARS-CoV-2
      infection. The secondary objectives are to correlate the pathological findings with the
      patients' demographics, the treatments administered during the ICU stay, the ventilator
      settings, to document the percentage of co-infections and their types, compare the
      radiographic findings (Chest X-ray and CT-scan of the chest) with the pathological findings,
      to compare the pathological findings of early deaths (<1week after ICU admission) versus late
      deaths (>1 week). These pathological findings will undoubtedly help to better understand the
      pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and pave the way to the development of new
      therapeutic strategies
