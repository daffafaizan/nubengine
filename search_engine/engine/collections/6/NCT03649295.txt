      and, since 1990's, it has been used as a relevant therapeutic tool in the cases of
      oropharyngeal dysphagia in addition to speech therapy. Positive results have been observed in
      the treatment of swallowing disorders, including in patients that carry neurological
      diseases. However, there is no substantial evidences for this interventions.

      In this study, the electrotherapy will be used as a complement to conventional speech therapy
      and performed the application of electrical stimulation protocol in dysphagia, through the
      apparatus Neurodyn Portable TENS/FES (transcutaneous electrical neurostimulation/ functional
      electrical stimulation), which is a transcutaneous neuromuscular stimulator flow TENS/FES
      from two channels with independent intensity adjustment. It is about a non-invasive technique
      with no systemic effect, causing no dependence or undesirable side effects, and consists by
      gentle application in electrical stimulation, through electrodes placed in body areas
      affected by pain or to activate skeletal muscles and produce movements. A channel of
      electrodes will be placed in the submental region and the other channel on the thyroid
      cartilage., in formation of a T. The explication of the procedure in the patient treatment,
      is describing the sensations that he should expect that happened during the stimulation. The
      intensity of necessary flow to apply in the treatment, will depend in the sensation of the
      patient, therefore, it is applicable until the tolerance level or desirable muscular
      contraction. Thus, the treatment should be initiated with minimal levels of intensity, by
      being carefully raised if appropriate effects are achieved on the procedure and according to
      the patient report.
