      treatment of chronic pain. On October 3, 2002, FDA approved Codman's IDE Study of Codman's
      Implantable Constant-Flow Infusion Pump System (ARCHIMEDES). The first Subject was implanted
      on February 12, 2003. Since then, ten Subjects have had the ARCHIMEDES implanted, with one
      Subject, implanted twice. Codman notified the FDA in 2004 that it wished to discontinue
      enrollment into the study & bring it to a close because of projected slow enrollment and
      waning physician interest.

      Codman felt there was no readily acceptable alternate therapy that would not require a pump
      explant first. It is possible to replace the ARCHIMEDES with another pump system, which is
      already approved for use in the United States. However, such an action would necessitate the
      removal or explant of the ARCHIMEDES, thereby exposing the Subjects to additional risks
      inherent in such a surgical procedure, including those associated with anesthesia. Since
      these Subjects have been treated with the investigational device for at least 2 years without
      experiencing any unanticipated adverse device effects, Codman felt that the risk of
      explanting the pump was significantly greater than the risk of continuing treatment with the
      investigational device.

      It should also be noted that this pump does not have a battery and that replacement is
      dictated by the number of times the septum is punctured (500). This translates into
      approximately twenty years of therapy if the septum is punctured an average of 20 times.

      FDA approved Codman's Compassionate Use Protocol in 2005.
