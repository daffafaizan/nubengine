      approved and widely used ALS treatment in the European community, in Japan and in the USA.

      Therefore, in this study, TRO19622 will be assessed as add-on to riluzole in patients
      suffering from ALS.

      At the start of the study, patients will be randomized to one of two groups : TRO19622 (330
      mg QD or placebo (once a day).

      Each treatment will be administered for 18 months under double-blind conditions. The product
      under evaluation will be administered to patients receiving the standard of care for ALS,
      including riluzole.

      Riluzole dosage (50 mg bid) must be stable and well tolerated for at least one month prior to
      inclusion into the study.

      After the double-blind period, open-label administration of TRO19622 will be allowed for
      safety and survival assessments and until efficacy results are available.

      A separate open-label protocol will be written 6 months after the randomization of the last
      patient into the study.
