      I. To evaluate the safety of ONTAK infusion in patients with advanced refractory breast
      cancer.

      II. To evaluate the effect of ONTAK administration on peripheral blood T-regulatory cells.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the incidence of IL-2R expression in tumor samples and investigate the
      correlation of tumor IL-2R expression and tumor response to ONTAK therapy.

      II. To evaluate levels of circulating sIL-2R before and after ONTAK therapy. III. To evaluate
      the effect of ONTAK on endogenous tumor specific immunity. IV. To evaluate the potential
      anti-tumor effects of ONTAK in patients with advanced refractory breast cancer.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive ONTAK IV over 1 hour on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to
      6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year.
