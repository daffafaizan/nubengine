    
      This is a clinical trial with 12 weeks treatment of Intranasal fentanyl (INFS) in cancer
      patients with breakthrough pain (BTP). It was composed of a dose titrated,
      placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomised, cross-over efficacy phase, combined with a
      titration and a tolerability phase assessing the safety and nasal tolerability of INFS. The
      trial is set up with a screening period and three treatment phases: a titration phase (I), an
      efficacy phase (II) and a tolerability phase (III). The entire trial period for each
      completed patient consisted of the one week screening period and 12 weeks treatment with
      INFS.
