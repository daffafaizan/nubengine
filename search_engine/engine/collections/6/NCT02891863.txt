    
      The LEVER study is a prospective, unblinded, non-randomized, first in human feasibility study
      that will assess and characterize early safety and effectiveness of low energy therapies in
      converting monomorphic ventricular tachycardias (MVTs). Subjects must be already indicated
      for standard of care VT procedure during which VT is likely to be induced (such as VT
      testing, VT ablation, VT mapping, or VT risk stratification testing.)

      The study patches will be applied to the subject's torso, and the patches will be connected
      to the LEVER Acute Study System. Pacing capture threshold capture may be assessed. If
      monomorphic VT is induced and reaches at least 170bpm (350ms/cycle), one or more of the low
      energy therapies will be applied under oversight of the investigator, in an attempt to treat
      and convert the VT.
