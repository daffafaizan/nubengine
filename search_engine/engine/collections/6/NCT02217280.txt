      conditions, particularly radiculopathy. The efficacy of epidural spinal injections has been
      attributed to the anatomic location reached by the injectate. Cervical epidural steroid
      injections are also used as an injury location indicator. This application is based on
      documenting pain relief after injection into a specific location in the cervical spine. Both
      the diagnostic and therapeutic applications for epidurals assume that the injectate remains
      local to the injection site in order to have its effects. However, in a recently completed
      study, the investigators group documented substantial diffusion of injectate after lumbar
      epidurals used computerized tomography (CT) assessments.1 Based on the exposure to ionizing
      radiation associated with CT along with the superior imaging specificity and sensitivity of
      MRI, the investigators are shifting their imaging modality to MRI for future studies. The
      proposed study is designed to evaluate the use of gadolinium and MRI to assess nature and
      amount of diffusion of injectate in the cervical region after standard-of-care epidural
      injections. To the investigators knowledge, this will be the first study to critically assess
      this common procedure in order to evaluate safety and efficacy in a clinical setting.
