    
      Patients will be identified and enrolled by the Mayo Clinic St. Marys Emergency Department
      staff as they are undergoing medical care in the Emergency Department.

      The investigators will calculate the difference in oxygen saturation pre- and post-deep
      inspiration (Î”SpO2 at 1 minute, 2 minutes and 4 minutes), and then correlate these values
      with the CT result.

      In cases of PE, The investigators expect the SpO2 to remain unchanged, or to change less than
      3-5%. The investigators expect alternate hypoxemic conditions to have a significantly greater
      increase in SpO2.
