    
      This is a single-blind, randomized pilot study conducted in patients with bilateral venous
      stasis leg ulcers.

      The aim of the study is to compare the rate of healing for venous stasis ulcers when using
      the PICO™ single use Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) system versus standard care.

      The primary objective is to determine if the PICO™ NPWT system results in an increased rate
      of healing when compared to standard of care for the treatment of venous stasis ulcers.
