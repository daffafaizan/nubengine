      hyperalgesia. Operative hyperalgesia corresponds to an increase in morphine needs
      postoperatively which is proportional to the morphine dose necessary during the surgery. This
      effect is due to two mechanisms: opioids tolerance and induced hypersensitivity.

      N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (R-NMDA) play a key role in this induced hypersensitivity.
      Polyamines, organic compounds with several amines functions, are known R-NMDA agonists. They
      increase the phosphorylation of the tyrosine group within the NR2B subunit responsible for
      the inflammatory hyperalgesia.

      Limiting the binding of polyamines to the R-NMDA seems an easy, safe and efficient way to
      limit the hypersensitivity induced post-operatively.

      Most of the polyamines in the human body come from food. One study listed food regarding
      their polyamines content and allowed to check the safety of a polyamine deficient diet. Such
      a well-followed diet would allow to reduce by 20 the polyamines quantity present in the body.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate whether a deficient polyamine diet introduced 7 days
      before and continued up to 7 days after an abdominal surgery requiring the use of morphine
      post-operatively reduces the post-operative pain, the consumption of analgesics (morphine)
      post-operatively and improve the recovery ability. Abdominals surgeries concerned will be the
      eventration cure and digestive continuity.

      The medico-economic impact will be observed during this study.
