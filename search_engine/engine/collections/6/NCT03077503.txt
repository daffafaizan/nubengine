      2016 in Srinagarind Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Khon Kaen University, Thailand. Sixty
      patients who underwent craniotomy with insertion of skull pin were randomly allocated into
      group A and B. After patients entered the operative room, blood pressure and heart rate were
      measured (T1) then repeated measurement again (T2) when started induction, intubation and
      infusion dexmedetomidine 1 µg/kg over 10 min infusion in group A whereas group B received
      normal saline. At 3 minutes before skull pin insertion (T3), patient in group B received a
      single bolus of fentanyl 1 µg/kg whereas group A received normal saline. Then hemodynamic
      responses were recorded and repeated again at one minute before skull pin insertion (T4).
      Blood pressure and heart rate were observed at the time of skull pin insertion (T5) then
      repeated every 1 minutes after skull pin application until 5 minutes (T6 - T10).
