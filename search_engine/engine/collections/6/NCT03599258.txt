      examine the mean values in patients' unconjugated bilirubin level for a new, FDA cleared
      device (Neolight Skylife) with the standard phototherapy treatment. Patient data on
      unconjugated bilirubin level, pressure ulcer and body temperature will be evaluated at
      baseline, 12-hours post-intervention, 24 hours post-intervention and at discharge.

      Neolight Skylife is a compact device that offers phototherapy to infants across all neonatal
      beds, supplanting multiple, enclosure specific phototherapy devices. Neolight Skylife weighs
      less than 10 lbs. and is ergonomically designed for portability that allows for easy carrying
      of the device between beds. Neolight Skylife offers the choice between treatment intensity
      levels. Neolight Skylife utilizes blue Light-Emitting Diodes (LEDs) to achieve low irradiance
      of 30 plus or minus 5 μw/cm²/nm, and high irradiance of 45 plus or minus 10, μw/cm²/nm.
      Neolight Skylife emits light in a narrow bandwidth between 430-475 nm. This light bandwidth
      corresponds to the spectral absorption of light by bilirubin, and is thus considered to be
      the most effective for treatment. Neolight Skylife eliminates the risk of UV exposure
      typically seen with phototherapy treatment through the use of blue LEDs, as this light source
      does not emit significant energy in the ultraviolet (UV) spectrum. However, as with all
      phototherapy treatment, protective eye coverings are used to protect the baby's eyes from
      excessive light exposure.
