      Phase III clinical trial conducted under F.D.A. Investigational New Drug license #45,466,
      with a target enrollment of 1000 at four clinical centers with vastly different populations.
      The centers participating in this proposed research are: Kaiser Permanente's Dental Plan in
      Portland, Oregon; Tufts University Dental Clinic in central Boston, Massachusetts; Delta
      Dental Massachusetts' Dental Clinic in Southborough, Massachusetts; and the dental clinic of
      the Tuba City Regional Health Care Corporation in Tuba City, Arizona. Kaiser Permanente's
      Center for Health Research in Portland, Oregon will act as the data-coordinating center, and
      Tufts University will act as the Administrative Center. This study is designed to evaluate
      the efficacy of a topical, temporary, 10% w/v chlorhexidine dental coating in reducing caries
      increment in at-risk adult dental patients. This study will treat participants in months 1(4
      weekly applications) and 7(1 application) with final outcome measured at 13 months after
      randomization. Examiners were trained and certified before data collection started and were
      recalibrated annually. The primary outcome analysis in the intent -to- treat sample compares
      active to placebo group on the rank-normalized caries increment score, adjusting for
      examiner, age and age squared. Multiple imputation (data augmentation using MCMC) will be
      used to replace missing outcome. Planned secondary analysis examine the secondary caries
      increment outcomes using the same model, as well as parallel analyses in the per-protocol
      group. Safety of the coating will be evaluated by comparing development of resistant S.
      mutans or C. albicans as well as incidence of MedDRA-coded adverse events between the two
      arms.
