    
      Twenty patients will be enrolled: ten patients treated by rituximab and ten patients treated
      by rituximab and plasma exchange. The plasma concentration of rituximab and the efficacy of
      the treatment will be compared between the two groups of patients.

      The enrollment in the study will not change the treatment of patients except for blood
      sampling.

      Each patient will undergo fifteen blood samples between the start of infusion of rituximab
      and three months after the start of infusion. For the patients who will undergo plasma
      exchange, three additional blood samples will be performed at each plasma exchange (at the
      start, at the end and one day after the plasma exchange) and a sample of the plasma exchanged
      will be keep.

      The plasma concentration of rituximab will be determined by ELISA method (Enzyme Linked
      ImmunoSorbent Assay) The pharmacokinetic analyse will consist in the determination of the
      Area Under the Concentration Curve (AUC) by a non compartmental approach.

      The AUC levels will be compared (using the t Student test) between the two populations of
      patients (patients treated by rituximab, versus patients treated by rituximab and plasma
      exchange) The efficacy of the treatment will be evaluated by the CD19+ B Cell count.
