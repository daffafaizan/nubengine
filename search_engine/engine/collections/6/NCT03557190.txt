      Angiogenesis is essential for tumour growth and metastasis and vascular endothelial growth
      factor (VEGF) is fundamental to this process.3,4 Chemotherapeutic VEGF inhibitor (VEGFI)
      drugs have revolutionised therapy and improved the prognosis and survival of patients with
      previously untreatable malignancies.1,2 Blood pressure elevation is a common complication
      that occurs in up to 80% of patients treated with VEGFI and almost all patients have an
      absolute increase in blood pressure, with 30-60% developing frank hypertension.1,5 Patients
      are at risk of acute hypertensive complications, including stroke, acute coronary syndrome or
      reversible leukoencephalopathy and the development of VEGFI-associated hypertension may
      mandate the premature discontinuation of these important anti-cancer therapies. Those who
      survive their cancer are at risk of developing end-organ damage leading to ischaemic heart
      disease, heart failure, renal failure and stroke.1,5 Indeed, with substantially increased
      cancer survivorship patients often survive long enough to allow cardiovascular morbidity to
      take precedence over their initial cancer diagnosis.

      Mechanisms contributing to the development of VEGFI-associated hypertension may include
      endothelial dysfunction, capillary rarefaction and vascular remodelling.1,5 Endothelin-1
      (ET-1) is a potent endogenous vasoconstrictor and is strongly implicated in the pathogenesis
      of hypertension and endothelial dysfunction. 3,6,7 However, the effects of VEGFI on
      endothelial function and the role of ET-1 in VEGFI-associated hypertension are incompletely
      defined. Indeed, there is a paucity of information on mechanisms contributing to
      VEGFI-induced hypertension and our study will address this key issue.
