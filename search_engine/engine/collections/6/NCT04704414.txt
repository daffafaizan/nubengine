      for diagnosing different causes of exophthalmos, as well as following patients with Grave's
      orbitopathy and retroorbital tumors. The current clinical gold standards for measuring
      abnormal eyeball protrusion is the Hertel exophthalmometer, which is prone to reading errors
      and inconvenient to use.

      OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the EX3D-project is to replace the historic Hertel Exophthalmometer
      with a state-of-the-art mobile smartphone app that every ophthalmologist can carry in his
      pocket.

      METHODS: The investigators developed an accurate and easy to use method for measuring
      abnormal eyeball protrusion using the TrueDepth camera of the iPhone 11 in comparison with a
      high-resolution 3D scanner as a reference to compare with the Hertel Exophthalmometer.

      OUTCOMES:

        1. Accuracy and precision of 3D face-scanner and iPhone in comparison to Hertel
           Exophthalmometer.

        2. Test re-test reliability in comparison to Hertel Exophthalmometer.

        3. Inter-operator reliability against Hertel Exophthalmometer.

        4. Patients before and after exophthalmos changing treatment.

        5. Applicability in daily clinical practice.

      BROADER IMPACT: The invention makes exophthalmometry quick, easy and objective. A mobile
      smartphone application would replace measurements with the traditional Hertel
      Exophthalmometer, which are cumbersome, prone to reading errors and have a poor inter-rater
      reliability as well as test-retest reliability.
