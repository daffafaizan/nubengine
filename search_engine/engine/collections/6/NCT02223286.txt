      matched-cohort evaluation of diagnostic testing in a community-based cardiology practice
      setting that used a personalized age, sex, and gene expression test during early work-up of
      patients with symptoms suggestive of obstructive CAD (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov,
      NCT02223286). The study measured the rates of advanced cardiac diagnostic testing after
      initial work-up, including stress testing with imaging, CTA, or ICA. Rates of advanced
      diagnostic testing for patients who received the age, sex, and gene expression test (ASGES)
      were compared with testing rates for matched historical controls (usual care). The study
      hypothesis was that incorporating the age, sex, and gene expression testing early in the
      diagnostic work-up pathway would permit the identification of patients for whom advanced
      diagnostic testing was not required, thereby avoiding unnecessary testing and enabling
      cardiologists to focus their diagnostic resources more efficiently.

      This single-center study was conducted at the North Phoenix Heart Center (Phoenix, AZ), a
      community-based group cardiology practice that receives patients on referral from primary
      care physicians and other specialists in the surrounding area. The practice incorporated age,
      sex, and gene expression testing into its diagnostic protocol beginning in June 2011. Data
      collection was completed in December 2013. Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval of the
      study protocol was granted by Quorum Review. Informed consent waivers were granted as data
      collection was retrospective and all data were de-identified.
