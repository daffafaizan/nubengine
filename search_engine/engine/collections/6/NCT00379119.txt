        -  Determine if inhibition of sex steroid action is associated with increased thymic size
           in older patients who have undergone radical prostatectomy for localized adenocarcinoma
           of the prostate.

        -  Determine if inhibition of sex steroid action is associated with an increase in the
           absolute number or percentage of circulating "naive" phenotype T cells, and/or an
           increase in the frequency of T-cell receptor excision circles in peripheral blood cells.

      OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, single-blind, cohort study. Patients are stratified
      according to hormonal therapy after surgery (yes vs no).

      Patients undergo CT scan of the thymus. Blood samples are analyzed by flow cytometry to
      determine phenotype of T cells.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study.
