      variability in terms of clinical and biological response towards Integrase Strand Transfer
      Inhibitors, an important ARV drug class used in the treatment of HIV infection. We aim at
      identifying predictors of drug efficacy and toxicity, which are eagerly awaited by clinicians
      as INSTIs are now prescribed worldwide and concerns about previously unidentified side
      effects are emerging.

      The specific objectives of the project are:

        -  To study the impact of genetic polymorphisms in selected pharmacogenes (including genes
           coding for biotransformation enzymes and transport proteins) on INSTIs PK parameters and
           biomarkers relevant for TDM, such as trough (C0) and intracellular (IC) concentrations.

        -  To determine whether genetic polymorphisms in selected pharmacogenes might affect INSTIs
           efficacy, as assessed by the measurement of the viral load.

        -  To address the important question of the pathophysiological mechanisms lying behind the
           two main side effects of INSTIs, namely neuropsychiatric adverse events and abnormal
           weight gain.

        -  To describe how INSTIs affect the gut microbiome of treated patients, and to determine
           in turn how and by which pathways the gut microbiome might influence the clinical
           response (i.e. efficacy and toxicity) to INSTIs.
