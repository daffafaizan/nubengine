      intervention into a scalable mobile health (mhealth) format.

      Specific Aim 2: Conduct a pilot study of the video-text intervention.

      Study Design:

      2-arm semi-pragmatic randomized design among current tobacco users

      Cuyahoga Metropolitan Housing Authority residents will be randomly assigned to receive (1)
      the newly translated Path2Quit or (2) SmokeFreeText (NCI's publicly available, standard text
      messaging program) combined with brief behavioral counseling session plus 2 weeks of nicotine
      replacement therapy (NRT). Primary outcomes will include intervention evaluations (content
      and format), acceptability, coping strategies, engagement, and NRT adherence. Secondary
      variables will include 24-hour quit attempts and biochemically verified tobacco use
      abstinence at the 1-month follow-up. Exploratory mediational analyses will examine the roles
      of urban hassles, acculturation, neighborhood environment, ethnic discrimination, and
      psychological distress in intervention effects.
