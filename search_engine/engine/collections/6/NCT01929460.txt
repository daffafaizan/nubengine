      prevalence of pancreatic cysts being incidentally discovered.

      A critical step in the workup of pancreas cysts is to determine whether the cyst is mucinous
      or non-mucinous, through a procedure called endoscopic ultrasound - fine needle aspiration
      (EUS-FNA).

      Current guidelines suggest the use of antibiotics in cyst aspiration, usually 3 days after
      the procedure. However, these recommendations are based on limited data from over 15 years
      ago. More recent retrospective observations suggest equivalent safety when little, or even no
      antibiotics are given.
