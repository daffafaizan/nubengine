      accumulation. Obesity is a low-severity systemic inflammatory condition that predisposes to
      chronic diseases.Obesity is closely related to adipose tissue, it can have direct or indirect
      effects on physical activity and musculoskeletal system. The systems working with oscillation
      techniques, subcutaneous tissue thickness may affect the probe stroke of the device and
      oscillation in the tissue. In previous studies were investigated mechanical properties, and
      BMI used as exclusion criteria is over 30 kg/meter square or keeping it at certain intervals
      (18-28 kg /meter square) but this proof is not demonstrated and still lack.This study is
      planned to determine the relation of mechanical properties (tone, stiffness and elasticity)
      obtained by myotonometric assessment with body mass index.
