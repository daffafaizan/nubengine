      including those on pancreatic beta cells; when activated these receptors affect the secretion
      of glucagon and insulin. Pasireotide is also known to decrease glucagon-like peptide 1
      (GLP-1) and gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) secretion. Hyperglycemia is a
      well-documented adverse effect of pasireotide in its approved indications for treatment of
      Cushing's disease and acromegaly.

      In light of this, the investigators hypothesize that pasireotide may be an effective therapy
      for hypoglycemia due to hyperinsulinism. Therefore a small controlled pilot study to assess
      the effect of subcutaneous (s.c.) pasireotide on preventing hypoglycemia due to
      hyperinsulinism over 7 hours of observation in both fasting and fed states is proposed.
