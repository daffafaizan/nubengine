      diseases. It is necessary for endoscopists to operate gastroscope according to the
      standardized process, in order to avoid missing early lesions. However, with the rapid
      increase in the number of endoscopies, the workload of endoscopists increases further. High
      workload reduces the quality of endoscopy, resulting in incomplete observation of anatomical
      parts that are easy to be missed in the process of gastroscopy. There are significant
      differences in the operation level of different endoscopists. Therefore, carrying out
      artificial intelligence methods has good academic research and practical value for improving
      the quality of endoscopic diagnosis and treatment.

      Artificial intelligence devices need to use a large number of endoscopic images, based on
      this, we intends to collect endoscopic image data from our hospitals for training and
      validation of the model.
