      in the bladder are relatively easy to visualize by cystoscopic examination under white light.
      However, dysplasia, carcinoma in situ (CIS) or small exophytic tumors are easily overlooked.
      These lesions are predictive of recurrence and progression of disease, and the identification
      of these lesions is a crucial factor for the prognosis of the patient. The present situation
      with 50-75% recurrence rate show the inadequacy of white light cystoscopy for detection and
      resection of the lesions.

      A better detection of papillary bladder cancer and early detection of CIS lesions will
      provide the patient with a more complete TURB, a more optimal pharmacological treatment when
      needed, may reduce the need for follow up cystoscopies and hopefully result in a better
      prognosis for the patient.

      The aim of the present study is to compare Hexvix cystoscopy with white light cystoscopy in
      the detection of histology confirmed papillary bladder cancer in patients with papillary
      bladder cancer and to compare early recurrence rate after Hexvix and white light
      transurethral resection (TURB) with white light TURB in patients with superficial bladder
      cancer.
