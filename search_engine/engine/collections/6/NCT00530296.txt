      not tend to improve over time. The implementation of effective interventions to treat and
      prevent recurrence of depressive episodes is needed. The objectives of this study are: 1)the
      detection of Major Depression in hemodialysis patients; 2)to allocate patients with
      depression in two groups: structured program of treatment with CBT (group therapy)and control
      group (conventional psychotherapy at the dialysis unit); and 3)to verify whether after 3
      months of CBT there was a remission of depressive symptoms and a improvement of the quality
      of life in the CBT group.
