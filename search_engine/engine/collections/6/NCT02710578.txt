    
      This study will examine the effects of an intoxicating dose of alcohol on driving-related
      skills among young drivers using driving simulator technology.

      This study is a double-blind, placebo-controlled mixed design study, including randomized
      between-subjects comparison of the effects of alcohol intoxication and both between- and
      within-subjects examination of acute and residual effects at approximately 24 and 48 hours
      following one-time alcohol administration.

      Initial contact with potential participants will be made by telephone, where study personnel
      will conduct a telephone screen for eligibility. Those telephone screened as eligible will
      attend CAMH for an eligibility assessment. Enrolled participants will complete four sessions
      on consecutive days: a practice day, an alcohol administration day, and a 24-hour and 48-hour
      post-alcohol session.
