    
      The primary objective is to investigate the regenerative capacity of direct intra-myocardial
      injection of mesenchymal stromal cells in patients with reduced left ventricular EF (â‰¤45%)
      and heart failure NYHA 2-3.

      A total of 60 patients with will be enrolled in the study and randomised 2: 1 to cells or
      placebo (saline).

      The patients will be followed for 12 months. The primary endpoint is changes in left
      ventricle end-systolic volume (LVESV) at 6 months follow-up.

      The secondary endpoints are changes in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF),
      end-diastolic volume and end-systolic mass at 6 months follow-up.

      Other secondary endpoints are NYHA, CCS, Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ), 6
      min walking test, and major adverse events endpoints: all-causes death, cardiovascular death,
      and hospitalization for worsening heart failure and MI at 12 months follow-up.
