      I. To determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) or maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the
      combination of duvelisib with nivolumab in patients with advanced mycosis fungoides/Sezary
      syndrome (MF/SS).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity. Ia. To determine the overall response rate at
      four months to the combination of nivolumab and duvelisib.

      Ib. To determine the time to maximum response, best overall response rate, complete remission
      rate, and duration of response among responding patients.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate whether intra-patient changes in serum cytokines (soluble CD40L, TNF-beta,
      IL-17alpha, IL-15, CXCL13, IL-12p40) predict response to duvelisib in combination with
      nivolumab in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL).

      II. To explore whether the combination of duvelisib and nivolumab changes the T-cell
      repertoire including T-cell receptor sequencing pre- and post- treatment with duvelisib and
      nivolumab in effort to better understand skin flare and other immunogenic reactions to this
      combination therapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of duvelisib in combination with fixed dose
      nivolumab followed by a dose-expansion study.

      Patients receive duvelisib orally (PO) once daily (QD) or twice daily (BID) on days 1-28 and
      nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 2 years.
