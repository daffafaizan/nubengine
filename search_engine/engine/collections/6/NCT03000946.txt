      technical and pharmacological intervention have been investigated, with conflicting results.

      Despite several prospective studies, and metaanalyses, the prophylactic role on pancreatic
      fistula of octreotide, remains controversial, even if recommended for routine use in patients
      undergoing pancreatic resection.

      In view of recent result, the investigators can hypothesize that higher affinity for
      somatostatin-receptor lead to stronger pancreatic exocrine secretion inhibition, and better
      pancreatic fistula prevention.

      Consequently, continuous intravenous infusion of somatostatin-14, the natural peptide
      hormone, associated with 10 to 50 time stronger affinity with all somatostatin receptor, will
      be associated with a improved pancreatic fistula prevention compared to octreotide.
