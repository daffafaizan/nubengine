      infection causes more than 90% of the cases. Other risk factors include smoking, a weak
      immune system, birth control pills, starting sex at a young age, and having many sexual
      partners, but these are less important. Worldwide, CC is both the fourth-most common cause of
      cancer and the fourth-most common cause of death from cancer in women. The treatment of CC
      consists of surgical intervention, radiation, chemotherapy and immunotherapy.

      Adoptive immunotherapy with cytotoxic T lymphocytes reactive with specific viral antigens has
      proven to be effective. Here, the investigators aim to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      multiple infusions of CC-specific engineered immune effectors including cytotoxic T
      lymphocytes in patients.
