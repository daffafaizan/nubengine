      recurrent small intestinal hemorrhage due to GIVM. Patients with annual average bleeding 4
      times or more and lesions located in the small intestine which are not suitable for
      endoscopic therapy will be randomly assigned to receive A(25mg,Thalidomideï¼Œqid), B(25mg,
      Thalidomide, bid& placebo bid ) or placebo(deferred treatment group) for 4 months. The
      primary endpoints were the difference in yearly bleeding Episodes, followed by the difference
      in Blood Transfusions, Total Transfused Red Cell Requirements, Bleeding Duration, yearly mean
      Hemoglobin (Hb) level, hospitalization and iron requirement. After one year follow-up, the
      treatment of 100mg thalidomide might be paid as supplementary therapy for non-responders if
      necessary. This study will be done at 10 centers in China.
