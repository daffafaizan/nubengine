      photocoagulation on diabetic neovascularization that is persistent despite previous treatment
      with panretinal photocoagulation. We hypothesize that ranibizumab intravitreal injections
      would induce neovascular regression in similar or better fashion than supplemental laser
      photocoagulation. Consented, enrolled subjects will either receive open-label intravitreal
      injections of 0.5-mg dose of ranibizumab or additional panretinal photocoagulation (up to 500
      300-500 um laser spots) in a ratio of two-to-one (2:1) at the beginning of the study period.
      ETDRS best-corrected visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, and Optos color photography will be
      performed at enrollment, at weeks 1, 2, 3 and 4, and at months 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. The subjects
      will undergo fluorescein angiography utilizing the Optomap FA (fluorescein angiography)
      system and optical coherence tomography (OCT) at enrollment, at weeks 2 and 4, and at months
      2, 3, 4 and 6. The subjects will be followed for a 6-month period for stabilization,
      regression, or recurrence of neovascularization. In addition, patients will be evaluated for
      occurrence of macular edema.
