    
      This is a Phase III, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to
      assess the efficacy and safety of canakinumab in patients with COVID-19-induced pneumonia and
      cytokine release syndrome (CRS). The study will enroll patients to canakinumab or placebo, in
      addition to standard of care (SOC) per local practice, which may include anti-viral
      treatment, corticosteroids and/or supportive care.

      Patients who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to
      either canakinumab + SOC or placebo + SOC and can be dosed immediately after ensuring that
      the patient has met all eligibility criteria. Patients in the canakinumab arm will be dosed
      on Day 1 with canakinumab 450 mg for body weight of 40-<60 kg, 600 mg for 60-80 kg or 750 mg
      for >80 kg in 250 mL of 5% dextrose infused IV over 2 hours. Patients in the placebo arm will
      be administered with 250 mL of 5% dextrose infused IV over 2 hours.

      The study will include:

        -  Screening period of 0-1 day

        -  Study period from initial dose on Day 1 to Day 29 or hospital discharge

        -  Follow-up to Day 127 The primary objective is to demonstrate the benefit of canakinumab
           + SOC in increasing the chance of survival without ever requiring invasive mechanical
           ventilation among patients with COVID-19-induced pneumonia and CRS.
