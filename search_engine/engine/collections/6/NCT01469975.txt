    
      PART 1: Imaging with OTSA101 DTPA-111In OTSA101-DTPA-111In (1.5mg OTSA101-DTPA radiolabeled
      with 185 MBq of 11In) will be administered intravenously (IV) as a single injection on Day
      -28 (D-28). Patients will undergo serial anterior-posterior gamma scans and single photon
      emission computed tomography (SPECT/CT) at 1, 5, 24, 48, 72, 144 hours post-dosing to
      estimate absorbed radiation doses to tumor, to normal organs (i.e., liver, lung, kidney, and
      bone marrow), and whole body in order to determine OTSA101-DTPA-111In tumor uptake (ID%/g [%
      of injected dose (ID) per gram of tumor]) and biodistribution (ratio tumor/normal tissue of
      estimated radiation-absorbed dose). PK sampling will be performed at the same time points
      with additional sampling at D-14 and D0.

      A Steering Committee meeting is planned at the end of PART 1 for each patient. The Steering
      Committee will evaluate on a case by case basis at Day -7 for each patient if he/she can
      proceed to the therapeutic part based on tumor targeting, biodistribution, safety and
      clinical assessments:

        -  Patients with expected biodistribution and tumor uptake, no safety concerns and no overt
           signs of disease progression will proceed to the therapeutic part of the study after
           validation by the Steering Committee.

        -  Patients displaying abnormal/unexpected biodistribution of OTSA101-DTPA-111In, safety
           concerns and/or overt sign of disease progression will be taken off the study and other
           therapeutic plan will be envisaged.

      PART 2: Therapeutic dose of OTSA101-DTPA-90Y OTSA101-DTPA-90Y will be administered IV as a
      single injection on Day 0 (i.e. 14 days after the injection of OTSA101-DTPA-111In - A
      1week-delay [i.e. +7 days] is authorized from the planned D0).

      Twelve (12) patients should be randomized in the PART 2 and treated with OTSA101-DTPA-90Y at
      two initial dose levels (6 patients per dose level):

        -  Arm A: 1.5 mg of OTSA101-DTPA radiolabeled with 370MBq of 90Y (Dose level 1 (DL1)

        -  Arm B: 1.5 mg of OTSA101-DTPA radiolabeled with 1110 MBq of 90Y (Dose level 2 (DL2)

      Based on safety and preliminary efficacy data, a third dose level will be evaluated in 6
      additional patients:

        -  Arm C: 3 mg of OTSA101-DTPA radiolabeled with 2220 MBq of 90Y (Dose level 3 (DL3).

      Such a study design will allow the determination of an optimal and recommended dose,
      surrounded by a lower suboptimal dose and a higher maximal tolerated (or possibly toxic)
      dose.

      The first 3 patients will be enrolled at Centre Léon Bérard. Following the randomization of
      the first 2 patients, the accrual will be stopped for a maximal period of 1 month. The safety
      data will be reviewed every 2 randomized patients. Thee benefit/risk ratio will be regularly
      reviewed by the iDSMB and the Steering Committee (See Section Study Committee).

      A compassionate program is planned for all randomized patients who derive clinical benefit
      from the study drug (at least stable disease and acceptable tolerance). A maximum of 4
      injections per year will be planned. Subsequent injection will be performed provided that the
      eligibility criteria (except criteria related to previous treatment) are met before the day
      of administration. All inclusion in the compassionate program will be validated by the
      Steering Committee.
