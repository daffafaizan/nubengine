    
      This study is aimed at assessing the effectiveness of the NanoVibronix™ UroShield™ System in
      comparison to Urinary catheter alone in patients requiring urinary catheterization.

        1. Primary objectives

             -  To observe the effect of UroShield in reduction of patient's complaints relating to
                indwelling Urinary Catheters

                  -  Pain

                  -  Discomfort

             -  To observe the effect of UroShield in the reduction/prevention of Biofilm

             -  To observe the effect of UroShield on the occurrence of bacteriuria and/or UTI's on
                patients with Indwelling Urinary Catheters

        2. Safety Objective To assess the safety parameters of the UroShield system

        3. Secondary Objectives

             -  To observe the effect of UroShield in reduction of Foley Catheter related pain
                medication in patients with Indwelling Urinary Catheters

             -  To observe the effect of UroShield in reduction of antibiotic medication in
                patients with Indwelling Urinary Catheter

             -  To observe the effect of UroShield on the clogging of Urinary Catheter when used
                chronically and the need to replace the catheter

             -  To observe the effect of UroShield on the decrease of Tissue damage of patients
                with Indwelling Urinary Catheters by measuring cell count before and after removal
                of catheter
