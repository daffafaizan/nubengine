      including conservative and invasive techniques. It has been shown that conservative
      techniques including therapeutic massage, stretching, transcutaneal electrical nerve
      stimulation, spray and stretch, cold laser treatment, and ultrasound are the most applied
      treatments for myofascial pain syndrome, but no single strategy has proved to be universally
      successful. Instrumented massage has shown clinical effectiveness on shoulder pain, low back
      pain, and only one study (case report) on myofascial trigger points. This study aimed to
      verify the mechanical and clinical effects of instrumented massage on myofascial trigger
      points of trapezius muscle in adult subjects.

      Methods/Design: The study includes 31 volunteers with myofascial trigger points on right
      trapezius muscle. Clinical and patient data were obtained from questionnaires, VAS,
      algometry, sono-myoelastography and myotonometry. Also, physiotherapist grip strength was
      measured. Subjects were randomly allocated into one of two groups: Instrumented massage or
      Manual massage. The intervention consisted in a single 20 minutes session of massage on the
      back and neck by the same therapist, depending of the group, massage was applied manually or
      instrumented.
