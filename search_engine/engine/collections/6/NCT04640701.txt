    
      This proposed research is a retrospective chart review to determine if trauma patients with
      different body mass indexes differed in hospital course, clinical outcomes, disposition, and
      the cost of treatment.

      Records of trauma patients who were admitted to MHS between January1st 2006 and June 30th
      2016 will be retrieved to review the clinical charts according to the investigator's
      inclusion and exclusion criteria.

      Basic demographics and clinical outcomes parameters as noted above will be attained from the
      patient's medical records.
