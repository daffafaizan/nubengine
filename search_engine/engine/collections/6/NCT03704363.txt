    
      The following information will be collected at baseline, in addition to pre-specified
      efficacy assessments: age, gender, BMI (measured at site), ethnicity, marital status,
      children, educational level, work status, physical work load, leisure time activity, smoking
      habits, expectations about treatment effect and characteristics of pain (duration, agrevating
      factors, morning stiffness, morning pain, relief by NSAIDs, night time pain and former
      treatment). Emotional distress will be measured using the Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25 at
      baseline. The researchers will measure fear-avoidance beliefs about physical activity and
      work with Fear-avoidance beliefs Questionnaire (FABQ) at baseline. Subjective health
      complaints (SHC) will be measured using a formal inventory which consists of 29 questions
      concerning severity and duration of subjective somatic and psychological complaints and will
      be measured at baseline. In addition, routine clinical investigations (pain provocation tests
      (springing test, active flexion / extension of the lumbar spine) and neurological tests
      (strength, toe-/heel walking, sensibility, reflexes, straight leg raising test, reverse
      Lasegue test)) will be structured and registered in the CRF at baseline.
