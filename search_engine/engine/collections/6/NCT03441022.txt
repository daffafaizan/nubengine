      detect your heart rate and rhythm similar to electrocardiograms (ECG). These wristbands
      detect your pulse based on a technique called "photoplethysmography," (PPG). PPG is a common
      method in which an individual's pulse is detected based on a light signature interpreted by
      the wristband. Most commercially available heart rate monitors use PPG to determine your
      heart rate, but the accuracy is variable.
