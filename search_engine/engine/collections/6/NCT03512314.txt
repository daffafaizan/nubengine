      NLRC4 and with recurrent MAS-like flares with constitutive IL-18 hypersecretion, may require
      long-term blockade of the IL-18 pathway.

      Patients with X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) deficiency and suffering from
      Hemophagocytic-Lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), a MAS-like syndrome, also show high levels of serum
      IL-18 and may benefit from IL-18 blockade treatment until a curative hematopoietic stem cell
      transplantation can be performed The safety of IL-18 blockade during long-term periods is of
      major interest for the treatment of these patients
