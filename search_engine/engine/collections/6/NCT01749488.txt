    
      The secondary objectives of this study are to compare the impact of the intervention of a
      dietician on:

        -  daily and accumulated energy balance at the end of the intensive care unit (ICU) stay

        -  deficits in protein intake per day, accumulated over 7 days, and accumulated for the ICU
           stay

        -  intake of vitamins, trace elements and pharmaco-nutrients per day

        -  predominant route of nutrition administration (enteral / parenteral / mixed)

        -  the course of the stay: duration of mechanical ventilation, organ failure, the ICU stay,
           number of days on antibiotics

        -  the presence / absence of complications: mortality, on catheter bacteremia, ventilator
           acquired pneumonia, other infections, bedsores, episodes of hyper-or hypoglycemia

        -  presence/absence of diarrhea

        -  costs related to the management of malnourished patients in terms of enteral and
           parenteral nutritional therapy, dietary supplements, antibiotics and sedatives as well
           as the costs of ICU stay and those related to diarrhea and sores
