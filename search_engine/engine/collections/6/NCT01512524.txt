    
      Severe Traumatic Brain Injury, when not leading to mortality, is a major cause of morbidity
      in early adulthood.

      Recent studies have demonstrated a previously unappreciated association between Severe
      Traumatic Brain Injury and endocrine dysfunction.

      The current trial aims at evaluating the quality of life 18 months post-trauma and
      associating this outcome to growth hormone levels.
