    
      In August 2005 the heart transplant team at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta began a protocol
      of Daclizumab 1mg/kg IV every two weeks for 5 doses; 1st dose to be received in the operating
      room following discontinuation of cardiopulmonary bypass.

      Since one year has passed following initiation of this practice, it is necessary to review
      this immuno-suppression strategy and determine if, in fact, there was clinical benefit of
      reducing rejection without increasing the vulnerabilities of the immuno-compromised host.

      We wish to review all heart transplant recipient records between August 1, 2004 and October
      15, 2006. Historically, Children's has done approximately 10 transplants per year; therefore,
      we will review approximately 15 charts at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta and Sibley Heart
      Center Cardiology.
