      positive diagnostic test for H pylori will be screened. Included patients will undergo
      randomisation into 3 groups. Randomization will be performed by a random sequence generator
      to create equal sized groups in boxes of 12.

      Group 1-amoxicillin 1000mg bd and rifabutin 150 mg bd and esomeprazole 40 mg bd Group 2-
      amoxicillin 1000mg bd and rifabutin 150 mg d and esomeprazole 40 mg bd Group 3- standard of
      care Standard of care in previously untreated patients will consist of concomitant treatment
      (amoxicillin 1000mg, clarithromycin 500 mg, tinidazole 500 mg and esomeprazole all given
      twice daily for 14 days). In previously treated patients standard of care will consist of
      bismuth quadruple therapy, quinolone based therapy, or other susceptibility guided treatment
      where available.

      Treatment duration will be 14 days in all groups. Patients who are randomised to Group 3 and
      fail treatment will be offered open label rescue treatment with amoxicillin 1000mg bd,
      rifabutin 150 mg bd and esomeprazole 40 mg bd (14 days).
