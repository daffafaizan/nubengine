      Boards for (a) chemotherapy for early stage breast cancer (chemotherapy versus no treatment),
      (b) mastectomy versus lumpectomy plus radiation and (ii) to compare the relative
      effectiveness of the computer and paper based versions with the standard Decision Board for
      patients with early breast cancer.
