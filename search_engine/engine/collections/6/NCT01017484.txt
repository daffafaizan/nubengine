      Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) dietary pattern, which emphasizes fruits, vegetables
      and low fat dairy and is low in saturated and total fat. The DASH studies were designed to
      establish efficacy, not to determine mechanism of action. Other studies suggest that the DASH
      diet may have effects on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). These effects have
      not been directly evaluated, nor have other potential mechanisms of action such as effects on
      adrenergic tone, vascular function and inflammation. The BP-lowering effect of the DASH
      dietary pattern was maximal after two weeks of controlled feeding, and was comparable in
      magnitude to antihypertensive medication among participants with stage 1 hypertension.
      Understanding the possible mechanism(s) by which the DASH diet lowers BP will potentially
      enhance the value of this intervention by elucidating the conditions under which it will be
      most effective, identifying target populations, examining its impact on vascular health
      beyond BP, and enhancing our understanding of the interactions among diet, BP and vascular
      function. In addition, results of this study may help to identify additional therapeutic
      targets. Therefore, the overall goal of the proposed study is to determine the mechanism(s)
      by which the DASH diet lowers BP. Our unifying hypothesis is that DASH diet lowers BP through
      effects on vascular function and sodium excretion, mediated through the effects on RAAS.
