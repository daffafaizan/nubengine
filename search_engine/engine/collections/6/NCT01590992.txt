      of medically unexplained symptoms. They are among the most prevalent disorders in the general
      medical setting, leading to individual suffering and having huge impact on public health
      alike. Unfortunately, many patients still remain untreated and not all patients get better,
      even when receiving currently proposed treatments. The aim of the present project is twofold:
      First, we want to improve the understanding of risk factors and psychobiological processes
      leading to the development of FSS. Second, we will explore and evaluate new ways of treating
      subjects with FSS. Within the project, we will examine subjects with globus sensations in the
      throat, a very common und impairing form of FSS. The proposed study i) may provide insight
      into the development of FSS, thereby improving our way by which we recognize and diagnose
      subjects with FSS, and ii) may help fostering our understanding of how to better treat
      subjects suffering from FSS.
