           evaluation of the prognosis of patients with abnormal hemodynamics after abdominal tumor
           surgery, and is expected to be a new monitoring index to improve the therapeutic
           efficacy of this kind of patients.

        2. Pcv-aCO2 effectively reflected the improvement of tissue and organ microcirculation
           disorder through the individual goal target treatment to guide the fluid resuscitation
           in the hemodynamic instability patients.

        3. Research of the correlation between Pcv-aCO2 and the organ function in patients with
           abnormal hemodynamics after operation.
