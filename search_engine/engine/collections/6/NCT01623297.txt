      invasive or laparoscopic surgery can prevent these changes. A study will be conducted on
      patients scheduled to have abdominal surgery. The patients will have cognitive evaluations
      before and after surgery. A small amount of blood, about 2 tablespoons, will be collected no
      more than 5 times in 6 months. The results will be analyzed to determine if there are changes
      between those having open surgery versus patients having laparoscopic or minimally invasive
      surgery, and if these changes coincide with cognitive changes.
