      screening/baseline and follow-up visits. Participants in the intervention program will have 2
      additional visits with a group of other people with MS to view and discuss the DVDs on
      spasticity education and stretching for lower extremity MS spasticity and then practice the
      stretching exercises learned. They will be asked to track exercise electronically and on
      paper for 4 weeks. Participants will be compensated for participation.
