    
      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the effectiveness and efficacy of
      intermittent Theta Burst Stimulation (iTBS) for treatment of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD).
      Subjects will be randomly assigned to two weeks (10 sessions) of treatment with open-label
      iTBS, blinded iTBS or blinded sham. 'Open-label' means that you (the subject) and the study
      staff will know that you are receiving active iTBS treatment. 'Blinded' or 'sham-controlled'
      means that you, the subject, will not know whether the treatment you receive is the active
      treatment or the non-active treatment. In the 'sham' condition, the stimulator will turn on
      but will not actually be stimulating your brain. Subjects who do not show remission of
      symptoms after the first 2 weeks of treatment will receive 10 additional treatment sessions
      with open-label active iTBS. Subjects will be evaluated at Week 12 to assess the durability
      of symptoms changes.
