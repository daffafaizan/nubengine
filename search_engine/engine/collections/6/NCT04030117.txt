           The null hypothesis is that there is no difference between using ACTIVA and Dyract® in
           children to restore Class II cavities in carious vital primary second molars.

        2. Trial design:

             -  A pilot study, parallel group, two arm.

             -  Allocation ratio is 1:1.

        3. Method

      Intervention:

      A) Diagnosis:

        -  Diagnostic chart will be filled with personal, medical and dental history.

        -  The intra-oral examination will be made using gloves, mask, gauze and dental mirror.

        -  A pre-operative radiograph (bitewing) will be taken for diagnosis. b) The intervention
           in this pilot study will be (ACTIVA™ BioACTIVE, Pulpdent, USA) - Gp1 while the
           comparator will be (Dyract® DENTSPLY, Germany)- Gp2.

      Three follow up visits for restoration at:

      T1 (3 months), T2 (6 months) and T3 (12 months).

      Same procedure in both groups will be followed:

        1. The tooth will be anesthetized using local anesthesia, and isolated using rubber dam.

        2. Caries will be removed.

        3. A proximal box is prepared.

        4. A metal matrix band is fixed around the tooth and a wedge is placed interdentally.

        5. The restorative material chosen according to the randomization is placed in the cavity
           according to the manufacturer's instructions.

        6. A post-operative digital bitewing radiograph will be taken immediately after the
           treatment as a base line reference and to check for voids or any defect in the
           restoration.
