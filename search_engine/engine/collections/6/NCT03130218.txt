      to manage health-related issues are significantly growing interests. One frequent
      intervention for healthy weight management is bariatric surgery. In the post-operative period
      following bariatric surgery, nausea is a common consequence. Peppermint oil aromatherapy is
      an effective intervention for relieving nausea and other gastrointestinal symptoms in the
      bariatric and surgical population. This study has multiple aims. One is to determine
      effectiveness of peppermint oil aromatherapy in relieving post-operative nausea in the
      bariatric surgery patient population. A second aim is to establish relative
      cost-effectiveness of peppermint oil aromatherapy versus traditional anti-emetic drug
      therapies. A third is to determine whether peppermint oil aromatherapy increases patient
      satisfaction versus anti-emetic drug therapies. This is a randomized study with control and
      experimental groups. The control group will receive no peppermint oil aromatherapy and only
      traditional anti-emetics as needed. The experimental group will receive peppermint oil
      aromatherapy and traditional anti-emetics as needed.
