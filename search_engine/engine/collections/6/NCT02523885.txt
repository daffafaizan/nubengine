      and antibiotic prescription that influence CAP presention and outcome. The investigators'
      working hypothesis is that NSAIDs use may mask initial symptoms and delay antimicrobial
      therapy, thus predisposing to worse outcomes. All patients presenting at one of the three
      following locations (emergency department, ICU or pneumology ward) with a suspicion of
      community-acquired pneumonia will be screened for eligibility. Exposure or not to NSAIDs will
      be investigated. Clinical, biological and radioloigcal features and outcome of CAP will be
      compared with respect to NSAIDs exposure.
