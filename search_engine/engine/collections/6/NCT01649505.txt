    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate differing surgical techniques (sharp dissection v. electrosurgical, use of
      fibrin glue) in latissimus dorsi donor flap harvest and their effect, if any on the
      prevention of post-operative seromas.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients undergo sharp dissection technique with fibrin sealant closure.

      ARM II: Patients undergo standard electrocoagulation dissection technique.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 90-180 days.
