      delayed ETI may affect adversely on the outcomes of OHCA. However, there was no known
      detailed data of explaining this issues.

      This study tried to evaluate effect of factors of ETI including numbers of trial, time for
      ETI trial, interruption time and esophageal intubation during CPR on outcomes of OHCA
      patients.
