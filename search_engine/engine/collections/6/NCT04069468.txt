    
      TheraSphere is a radioembolic therapeutic device used in the treatment of liver cancers. The
      goal of the registry study is to collect prospectively: participant description, treatment
      goal, treatment description, treatment results, safety, quality of life and survival data to
      ultimately demonstrate that TheraSphere treatment meets the claims that led to the
      reimbursement in France. The registry study is also an opportunity to improve the proper use
      of the device by team training especially for the personalized dosimetry treatment approach.

      Clinical data will be collected and held in a secured, validated system and can be downloaded
      by Biocomplatibles UK Ltd Data Management on an ongoing basis. Data verification will be
      performed by Biocompatibles UK Ltd Data Management and data validation checks will be created
      by the validated data system (with the Biocompatibles UK Ltd team performing User Acceptance
      Testing on them before they go live). Adverse Events and concomitant diseases will be coded
      according to the version of Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) agreed with
      Biocompatibles UK Ltd. Concomitant medications will be coded using the version of the World
      Health Organisation (WHO) Drug dictionary agreed with the validated data system.

      Appropriate study plans implemented to manage all aspects of the trial to ensure quality and
      integrity of the data collection.
