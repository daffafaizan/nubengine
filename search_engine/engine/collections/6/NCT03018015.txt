    
      The clinical trial will be performed in a single centre, open-label, randomised (order of
      treatments), balanced, 3-period, 6-sequence, single dose change-over design with
      administration under fasting conditions separated by a washout period of at least 2
      treatment-free days.

      Blood sample collection will be performed over 16 h after administration. This time is
      considered adequate to characterise plasma concentration vs. time profiles long enough for
      reliable estimation of the extent of absorption, i.e. the AUC derived from measurements is
      expected to cover at least 80 % of the AUC extrapolated to infinity.
