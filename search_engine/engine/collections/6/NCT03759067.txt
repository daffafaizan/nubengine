      myonecrosis or periprocedural myocardial infarction (PMI), which is associated with an
      increase in cardiac events and mortality. Thus, we aimed to evaluate various clopidogrel
      pre-treatment methods for preventing PMI among patients undergoing conventional CAG for
      stable angina pectoris. The Method of Clopidogrel Pre-treatment Undergoing Conventional
      Coronary Angiogram in Angina patients (MECCA) study was a prospective, partially randomized,
      multi-center clinical trial. Between October 2010 and July 2011, 511 patients underwent PCI
      for angina pectoris at the Korean University Anam Hospital, the Eulji Hospital, and the Hanil
      General Hospital. Clopidogrel-naïve patients were enrolled to receive a loading dose (the LD
      group; clopidogrel at 600 mg, usually 2-24 h before the procedure) or routine therapy using
      daily clopidogrel doses (75 mg/day for ≥5 days). Patients receiving daily doses were
      randomized to receive either an additional 300-mg reload (the RL group) or no additional
      loading (the maintenance dose [MD] group). The 600-mg or 75-mg treatment regimens were
      selected at the physician's discretion. The primary outcome was creatinine kinase myocardial
      band (CK-MB) levels at several time points. The CK-MB levels were measured at baseline, 8 h,
      and 24 h, while troponin-I levels were measured at 8 h after the PCI.
