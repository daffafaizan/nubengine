      mortality rate up to 30%.

      Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) has ben recently proved to be effective. To date,
      however, no prospective randomised study has been published on the comparison between CPAP
      and O2 administration by Venturi mask for the treatment of severe acute respiratory failure
      in patients with pneumonia. .
