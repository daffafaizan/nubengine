      hepatectomy involving the gallbladder fossa is a critical part of the resection but can range
      from a wedge resection to an anatomic resection of segments 4b and 5 to an extended right
      hepatectomy. This study enrolls Patients with T2 or T3 gallbladder cancer on preoperative CT
      exam or patients who were pathologically diagnosed as T2 or T3 gallbladder cancer after
      initial simple cholecystectomy. Eighty eight patients are randomized to wedge resection group
      or bisegmentectomy group. Except the extent of hepatic resection, all the procedures
      including hepatoduodenal,common hepatic, posterior pancreatic lymph node dissection are same.

      Primary endpoint is recurrence-free-survival rates and overall survival rates.
