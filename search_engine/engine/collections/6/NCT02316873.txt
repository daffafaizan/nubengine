      and in music. Musical activity increases phonological awareness, word segmentation, working
      memory, as well as reading abilities in children with typical development, a compelling
      evidence for a role of music training in fostering brain plasticity. Within this theoretical
      framework, we investigate the hypothesis that music training, by improving temporal
      processing and rhythm abilities, improves phonological awareness and reading skills in
      children with dyslexia.

      Methods: The study is a prospective, multicenter, open randomized controlled trial,
      consisting of test, rehabilitation and re-test
