    
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the ventilation defect percent (VDP),
      apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and/or the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) obtained by
      analysis of hyperpolarized 129Xe MRI at one or more time-points (over time in the absence of
      therapeutic intervention or following clinically indicated therapy) in healthy volunteers and
      patients with lung disease including but not limited to: asthma, emphysema, COPD,
      bronchiectasis, sarcoidosis, pulmonary fibrosis, alpha 1-anti-trypsin deficiency,
      eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis and bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

      This will be a single centre exploratory study in 10 healthy volunteers with normal lung
      function and no history of lung disease and 50 patients with a clinical diagnosis of lung
      disease. There is one study visit required for participation. A subset of participants may be
      asked to return for up to five additional study visits per year for five years. The purpose
      of additional study visits is to understand how hyperpolarized 129Xe MRI measurements of lung
      structure and function change over time in the absence of therapeutic intervention or
      following clinically indicated therapy.

      All subjects will visit St Joseph's Healthcare Hamilton and undergo: vital signs, pulmonary
      function testing, questionnaires, proton (1H) MRI, static ventilation and/or
      diffusion-weighted 129Xe MRI, and sputum induction. Up to four doses of hyperpolarized 129Xe
      will be inhaled during a single study visit.
