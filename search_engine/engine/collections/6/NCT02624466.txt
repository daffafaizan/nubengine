    
      This is a prospective observational multicenter study in children (â‰¤ 18 years) with chronic
      kidney disease (CKD) stage 2 to 5D with or without renal replacement therapy. In this study,
      60 children with CKD stage 2 - 5 (without renal replacement therapy)(GROUP 1), 30 children
      with CKD stage 5D treated with peritoneal dialysis (GROUP 2) and 30 children with CKD stage
      5D treated with haemodialysis (GROUP 3) will be followed for a total duration of 24 months.

      The study participants are evaluated on their standard visit at the outpatient clinic every 3
      months. At this visit, a blood sample for uraemic toxin concentration is withdrawn and
      several co-morbidities (growth, protein-energy wasting, cardiovascular disease, quality of
      life, psychosocial functioning, sleep, attention and executive functions) are assessed.
      Anthropometric parameters, dietary assessment, stool evaluation, nail evaluation, office and
      24 hours ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, echocardiography and questionnaires are used
      to map out the several co-morbidities.

      Blood analyses are performed to get the concentrations of a wide variety of uraemic toxins:
      i.e. small water soluble solutes, middle molecules and protein-bound solutes. All blood
      analyses within this project are performed in the Ghent University Hospital: i.e. urea,
      creatinine, calcium, and phosphorus are determined in the routine laboratory of the Ghent
      University Hospital using standard methods, while all other uraemic toxins are determined in
      the laboratory of the Nephrology Section using ELISA and (in-house developed) HPLC/UPLC
      techniques. For the protein-bound solutes two runs are needed to distinguish between total
      and free fractions of the protein-bound solutes.

      The following actions are performed prior to enrolment:

        -  Review medical history to determine eligibility based on inclusion/exclusion criteria
