      I. To determine the toxicities of escalating doses of flavopiridol administered in a timed
      sequence with ara-C and mitoxantrone in adults with refractory or relapsed acute leukemias or
      high-risk myelodysplasias (MDS).

      II. To determine if flavopiridol administered in a timed sequence with ara-C and Mitoxantrone
      will induce clinical responses in adults with refractory or relapsed acute leukemias or MDS.

      III. To determine if flavopiridol is directly cytotoxic to leukemic blasts in vivo.

      IV. To determine if flavopiridol can recruit and synchronize residual leukemic blasts to
      proliferate in vivo.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of flavopiridol. (Phase I closed to accrual
      effective10/24/2003).

      Patients receive flavopiridol IV over 1 hour on days 1-3 and cytarabine IV continuously on
      days 6-9 followed by mitoxantrone IV over 30-150 minutes on day 9. Patients achieving a
      partial or complete response after the first course of therapy may receive an additional
      course of therapy beginning 35 Â± 7 days after blood count recovery.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of flavopiridol until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2
      of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. (Phase I closed to accrual
      effective 10/24/2003). Once the MTD is reached, additional patients are accrued to receive
      flavopiridol at the recommended phase II dose.
