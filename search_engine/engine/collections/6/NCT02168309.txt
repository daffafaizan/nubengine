      consequences. While the true incidence of postpartum hypertension is unknown, blood pressure
      (BP) is known to initially decrease 48 hours following delivery then peak on postpartum days
      3-6, likely 45 from the mobilization of interstitial fluids following parturition.

      The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends medical treatment
      of persistent postpartum hypertension, defined as systolic BP (SBP) ≥150 mmHg or diastolic BP
      (DBP) ≥100 mmHg, on two or more occasions 4-6 hours apart. Prior studies compared intravenous
      medications to intramuscular and immediate-release oral 50 medications in the treatment of
      postpartum hypertension. However, oral labetalol and oral extended release nifedipine are the
      most commonly used medications for post- partum hypertension, and their efficacy has not been
      directly compared.

      Our aim was to determine whether oral labetalol is associated with a shorter time to BP
      control compared to oral extended release nifedipine for management of persistent 55
      postpartum hypertension. Our primary outcome was time to sustained BP control defined as the
      absence of severe hypertension (SBP ≥160 mmHg or DBP ≥105 mmHg) for at least 12 hours.
      Secondary outcomes included postpartum length of stay, need for increased dosing, need for
      additional oral antihypertensive agents, and patient-reported side effects.
