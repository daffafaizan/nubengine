      developing ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), an iatrogenic complication of ovarian
      stimulation during IVF treatment. In contrast to mild OHSS, severe OHSS is a life-threatening
      complication, characterized by massive ovarian enlargement, ascites, pleural effusion,
      oliguria, haemoconcentration and thromboembolic phenomena. Currently, no curative therapy for
      OHSS is available and thus prevention is considered the most effective "treatment". Several
      measures have been adopted to reduce the occurrence of the syndrome, the most effective being
      cycle cancellation and withholding of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), which seems to be
      the most critical factor for the development of OHSS.

      COMPARISON: This study aims to compare the development and severity of OHSS, as well as
      ongoing pregnancy rates in PCOS patients who received a flexible GnRH antagonist (Ganirelix)
      protocol vs a long GnRH agonist (Arvekap) protocol of ovarian stimulation.
