    
      This trial focuses on influenza vaccination among three recommended groups in China,
      including children (aged between 6 to 59 months), the elderly (aged 60 years old or above),
      and adult patients with chronic diseases (aged below 60 years old).

      The questionnaires will collect data on the economic burden of influenza-like illness (ILI),
      vaccine hesitancy, discrete choice experiment and willingness to pay for vaccines, and the
      financing strategies of influenza vaccines in China will be further analyzed accordingly.

      Besides the three recommended groups, vaccination and health care personnel will also be
      asked about their knowledge, attitude/belief and practice (KAP) in a supplementary
      questionnaire.
