cerebral dominance and speech acquistion in deaf children.in examining the prediction that left cerebraldominance, as indexed by hand andsighting preference, should be a positive accompanimentof speech learning in individualswhose cerebral speech areas are likelyto be in the left hemisphere, it wasfound that over a 10-12 year period of formaleducation right-handed-right-sightingdeaf students consistently earned higher speechgrades than their right-handed-left-sightingand right-handed-mixed-sighting counterpartsmatched on the basis ofhearing loss.  this finding supports the hypothesisthat the cerebral mechanismsrelevant to speech acquisition are simplified,facilitated, and/or less prone tointerference when control of speech, hand, andeye is localized primarily in 1hemisphere of the brain.
