      Cardio-Pulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) is undergoing a major paradigm shift, with new emphasis
      on optimizing neurological recovery. As a result, Cardio-Cerebral Resuscitation (CCR) is now
      the preferred term for describing protocols directed at promoting survival and recovery from
      cardiac arrest. Establishing and maintaining brain perfusion is the critical endpoint of
      resuscitation; however, there is currently no simple and reliable way to evaluate the
      adequacy of brain tissue perfusion in cardiac arrest patients. The overall goal of the NINCA
      study is to determine if non-invasive cerebral blood flow index (CFI) can be used as a simple
      and effective measurement of brain perfusion during and after resuscitation from cardiac
      arrest. Our researchers hypothesize that this monitoring may one day be routinely used to (1)
      evaluate the adequacy of chest compressions, (2) avoid brain tissue hypoperfusion induced by
      excessive hyperventilation or shivering, (3) serve as an endpoint for goal-directed
      hemodynamic support, (4) evaluate the potential for neurological recovery, and (5) help guide
      post-cardiac arrest care.

      Implications for Further Research:

      Successful completion of the research will hopefully establish that non- invasive cerebral
      blood flow monitoring is feasible during and after CPR; is dependent on adequate MAP, CO,
      temperature, SpO2 and ventilation; and is a valid predictor of neurological recovery. If
      confirmed, such monitors may one day become part of standard ICU post-cardiac arrest
      monitoring and even be part of standard resuscitation equipment.

      Determination of optimal CFI thresholds or targets will support future studies to determine
      if "goal directed" and individualized post-resuscitation ICU care is feasible using
      non-invasive cerebral perfusion indices. This could lead to a new way of optimizing
      hemodynamic support, temperature management and ventilation strategies to maintain adequate
      cerebral perfusion and improve neurological outcomes.
