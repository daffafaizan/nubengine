      indication for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) but also with longer antithrombotic
      therapy duration. Dual antiplatelet therapy with ASA and a thienopyridine is very efficient
      in preventing adverse events after coronary stenting but it is inferior to oral
      anticoagulation (OAC) to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. OAC
      is also superior to antiplatelet therapy in patients with mechanical heart valves and the
      therapy of choice for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. OAC is
      also administered for left ventricular thrombi and low ejection fraction. There is an
      increasing number of patients undergoing coronary stenting who are in need of life-long
      anticoagulation therapy and would therefore require a triple therapy consisting of aspirin,
      clopidogrel and oral anticoagulation. As oral anticoagulation and antithrombotic therapy
      impair primary and secondary hemostasis there are concerns that adding warfarin to dual
      antiplatelet therapy might cause increased bleeding rates. Several studies have
      retrospectively assessed efficacy and safety in patients receiving a triple therapy with
      various results: major bleeding rates varied from 3,1%-14,9% with total bleeding rates up to
      27,5%. Prospective randomized data on this topic are not available. Therefore the aim of this
      study is to compare a 6 week versus a 6 month triple therapy after DES implantation.
