      provided written informed consent. Iodixanol 320 mg/ml is injected followed by 30 ml of
      saline solution.In the test group,the tube voltage,contrast agent volume and flow rate are
      adapted to cardiac ejection fraction(EF) and body mass index(BMI)according to the pretest.
      participants in the contract group are injected 50 ml contrast agent with the flow rate of 5
      ml/s in tube voltage of 120 kVp. All participants are scanned in automatic tube current.
