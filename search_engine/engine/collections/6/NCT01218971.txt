    
      All participants in this study received Medisorb naltrexone at double-blinded dose strengths
      (ie, 190 mg or 380 mg); no participant received placebo. Participants who had received
      Medisorb naltrexone in Study ALK21-003 (NCT01218958) continued to receive the same dose
      strength in this extension study. Those who had received placebo for Medisorb naltrexone 190
      mg in the base study were given Medisorb naltrexone 190 mg. Participants who had received
      placebo for Medisorb naltrexone 380 mg in the base study were given Medisorb naltrexone 380
      mg.

      Neither the identity or dose of the treatment received in the base study, nor the Medisorb
      naltrexone dose strength (190 mg or 380 mg) received in this extension were revealed to any
      participant, the investigator, or any blinded member of the clinical study team during the
      conduct of the base study or this extension.

      All participants were encouraged to receive standardized biopsychosocial support at each
      clinic visit throughout the study; however, unlike the base study, participation was not
      mandatory.

      Participants eligible for this extension study had received all 6 injections of study drug in
      the base study; those who received Medisorb naltrexone in the base study who also received
      all 13 injections in this extension therefore had a duration of exposure of approximately 76
      weeks (~1.5 years) upon completion of this extension. For participants who had received
      placebo in the base study, maximum duration of exposure was approx. 48 weeks (1 year).
