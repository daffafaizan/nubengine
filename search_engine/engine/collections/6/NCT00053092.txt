        -  Compare the response rates in patients with previously untreated mantle cell lymphoma
           treated with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide with or without rituximab.

        -  Compare the time to disease progression in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the toxicity of these regimens, in terms of adverse event profile, in these
           patients.

        -  Compare the overall survival of patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of
      2 treatment arms:

        -  Arm I: Patients receive fludarabine IV* and cyclophosphamide IV* on days 1-3.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive rituximab IV on day 1 and fludarabine IV* and cyclophosphamide
           IV* on days 2-4.

      NOTE: *In both arms, fludarabine and cyclophosphamide may be administered orally instead of
      IV.

      Treatment repeats every 28 days for 2-8 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 56-82 patients (28-41 per treatment arm) will be accrued for
      this study.
