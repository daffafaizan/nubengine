      cervical stabilization training in patients with chronic neck pain. The results obtained from
      the study will contribute to the planning of the treatment of patients with chronic neck pain
      more effectively.

      The hypotheses we will test for this purpose; H1. Home exercise program will improve
      positively after treatment in patients with chronic neck pain compared to before treatment.

      H2. Mulligan mobilization will improve positively after treatment in patients with chronic
      neck pain compared to before treatment.

      H3. Cervical stabilization training will improve positively after treatment in patients with
      chronic neck pain compared to before treatment.

      H4. Mulligan mobilization will provide more effective results in patients with chronic neck
      pain compared to other applications.
