        -  Determine the transplant-related mortality and progression-free survival of patients
           with severe hemoglobinopathies receiving nonmyeloablative conditioning comprising
           fludarabine phosphate, cyclophosphamide, and total-body irradiation followed by
           partially HLA-mismatched bone marrow transplantation from first-degree relatives or
           HLA-matched donors.

        -  Characterize donor hematopoietic chimerism at 30, 60, and 180 days after transplantation
           in these patients.

        -  Determine the hematologic and non-hematologic toxicity of this regimen in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE:

        -  Preparative regimen: Patients receive fludarabine phosphate IV over 30 minutes on days
           -6 to -2 and cyclophosphamide IV over 1-2 hours on days -6 and -5. Patients also undergo
           total-body irradiation on day -1.

        -  Bone marrow transplantation: Patients undergo allogeneic bone marrow transplantation on
           day 0. Patients then receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1-2 hours on days 3 and 4.

        -  Graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis: Patients receive sirolimus orally daily on days
           5-365 and oral mycophenolate mofetil 3 times a day on days 5-35.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study.
