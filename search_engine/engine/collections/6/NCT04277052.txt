      Disorders (TMD). Physical examination, questionnaires towards symptoms, and imaging
      techniques provide objective data on pathology. The chewing muscles should also be evaluated
      in this way and the approaches to be followed in subsequent processes should be determined.
      It is known that muscle sections are changed in TMD, which develops due to muscle disorders.
      However, regardless of the origin of TMD chewing muscles are affected depending on the
      condition.
