      the Vasculitis Centers of Excellence. Participants will be randomized 1:1 either to taper
      their prednisone dose down to 5 mg/day according to a standardized schedule and stay at 5
      mg/day of prednisone for the duration of the study or until a study endpoint, or taper their
      prednisone dose down to 0 mg/day using a standard schedule and stay at 0 mg/day for the
      duration of the study or until a study endpoint. All study participants will be followed for
      6 months (from reaching a prednisone dose of 5 mg/day) or until an increase of prednisone
      dose (after randomization) occurs, whichever comes first.

      Participants will have up to four study visits, a screening visit (visit 1), a baseline
      (visit 2), a month 3 visit (visit 3) and a month 6 or flare visit (visit 3) and up to two
      follow-up phone calls from the study coordinator at randomization and at month 1
      (randomization and 1 month phone call may be combined if randomization occurs at month 1).

      This study is a project of the Vasculitis Clinical Research Consortium (VCRC) funded through
      the National Institutes of Health Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) with the
      purpose of promoting vasculitis research. The VCRC is the major clinical research
      infrastructure in North America for the study of vasculitis, and eight VCRC Centers of
      Excellence will be recruiting for this study.
