      years. 3% have persistent pain. Is it possible to predict these patients? Is it possible to
      make a determination as to which of the 3 outcome measures ((1) American Knee Society Score;
      (2) SF12 Oxford 12 and (3) Complications) is most appropriate to use and when is the most
      appropriate time to use it
