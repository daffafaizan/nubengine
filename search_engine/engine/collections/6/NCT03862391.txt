      anesthesia recovery. It is characterized by emergence agitation, hallucination, excitation,
      delusion and confusion. Increased hemorrhage due to hypertension may cause serious
      complications such as injury to the surgical site, patients' self-removal of surgical drains
      and catheters, and self-extubation. Due to these, emergence agitation results need for
      additional treatment, psychological stress and increased medical workload for patients and
      their families.

      Emergence agitation after general anesthesia in adult patients was reported up to 20%.
      However, the ratios are very wide.

      In our operating room, the investigators observed that patients with low flow anesthesia were
      less agitated in the recovery phase than patients with normal flow anesthesia. In our
      researches, the investigators have not found any studies on the agitation values of patients
      who underwent low flow anesthesia in the literature.
