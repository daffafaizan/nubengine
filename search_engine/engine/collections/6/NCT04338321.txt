    
      A depressive state with classical symptoms such as low (depressive/sad) mood, markedly
      diminished interest in activities, significant weight loss/gain, insomnia or hypersomnia,
      psychomotor agitation/retardation, excessive fatigue, inappropriate guilt, diminished
      concentration, and recurrent thoughts of death, persisting for more than 2 weeks is
      classified as major depressive disorder (MDD). The mechanism of action of ketamine is
      distinct from conventional antidepressants (ADs), which target the monoamines (serotonin,
      norepinephrine, and/or dopamine). Esketamine, the S-enantiomer of ketamine, is approved and
      widely used for the induction and maintenance of anesthesia via intramuscular or intravenous
      (IV) administration. There is a significant unmet need to develop novel AD treatments based
      on the relevant psychophysiological pathways underlying MDD. The goal of any novel treatment
      would be the rapid and long-lasting relief of depressive symptoms, especially in participants
      with treatment-resistant depression (TRD), who lack a sufficient response to the currently
      available treatment strategies. The study consists of a Screening Phase (up to 14 days), an
      Acute Phase (8 Weeks), a Maintenance Phase (24 Weeks) and a Safety Follow-up Phase (2 Weeks).
      Safety assessment includes adverse event, serious adverse events, physical examination, vital
      signs, electrocardiogram, clinical safety laboratory assessments, suicidal risk monitoring.
      The total duration of the study is approximately 36 Weeks for all participants.
