      women and men who are healthy with no history of abnormal blood sugar levels. The specimens
      will be used to evaluate new C-peptide and insulin assays (tests). Participants are being
      asked to voluntarily take part in this study because they are a healthy individual without a
      history of abnormal blood sugar levels.
