      vaccination against pneumococcus. Patients will be randomized to receive pneumococcal
      vaccination either 4 weeks prior (early vaccination group) or 24 weeks after (late
      vaccination group) their first belimumab dose. Vaccine response will be assessed 4 weeks
      after vaccine administration.
