      treatment in two dental settings, not exceeding thirty minutes each. They were randomly
      assigned to one of two groups, according to the treatment offered at the first visit. At the
      first visit, either buccal or intranasal aerosolized midazolam was administered. At the
      second visit the alternate route was implemented in a cross-over design with a one week
      washout period. Vital signs were recorded at baseline and at 5 minutes interval throughout
      the treatment session.
