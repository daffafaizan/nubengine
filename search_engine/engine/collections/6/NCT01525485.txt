      history of prior treatment for incontinence, medication list, obstetric and gynecologic
      history, medical history, and surgical history, as well as a complete review of systems. The
      physical examination will include vital signs (including BMI), genitourinary exam, including
      Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification (POPQ), and neurologic exam. All patients will undergo
      spontaneous uroflowmetry, urine dipstick from catheterized specimen, multichannel
      urodynamics, and 3-day voiding diary. Measurement of post-void residual will also be
      obtained. Completion of the UDI-69, King's Health Questionnaire10, and the Modified Body
      Image Perception Scale (MBIS) will also be part of the initial visit 11,12.

      All participants taking anticholinergics will undergo a 2 week flush-out period prior to the
      intake assessment. After the intake assessment, the provider will determine which treatment
      option is appropriate to the participant, and they will then be assigned to one of the two
      treatment arms: Group A will use vaginal electrical stimulation using the Empi Intravaginal
      Stimulation Unit Minnova (Empi, St. Paul, MN, USA) and participants in Group B will receive
      sacral neuromodulation using InterStim (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA).
