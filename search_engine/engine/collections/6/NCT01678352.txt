      Imiquimod/BTIC lysate-based vaccines in post-vaccine PBMC using IFN- ELISPOT. ELISPOT assays
      indicate functional status of the antigen-specific T cells as cytokine-expression, and we are
      particularly interested in Type-1 (i.e. IFN expressing) T cell response. Therefore, IFN
      ELISPOT will be used as the primary assay for the immunological endpoint.

      Using flow-cytometry, we will also evaluate the numbers of lymphocyte subsets such as CD4+ T
      cells, CD4+/Foxp3+ regulatory T cells in an exploratory manner. In addition, in participants
      who undergo surgical debulking of the progressing tumor, if the tumor tissue is available,
      infiltration of antigen-specific CTLs will be evaluated by flow cytometry of
      tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes with the Imiquimod/BTIC lysate-based vaccine-targeted GAA
      specific MHC-tetramers. In addition, serological responses will be evaluated with
      flow-cytometry of BTIC cells as well as western blotting. These plans (in this paragraph) are
      immunological evaluations; however, do not compose the primary endpoints due to their
      exploratory nature.

      We will determine whether it is safe to administer Imiquimod/BTIC lysate-based vaccines in
      patients with grade II gliomas. Endpoints will therefore include incidence and severity of
      adverse events, using standard criteria as well as close clinical follow-up as would be
      performed normally in this group of participants following vaccinations. All reported or
      observed toxicities and adverse events at all clinic visits will be graded, documented and
      reported according to a standard toxicity table, the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
      Events (CTCAE) version 4.0
