      the occurrence of arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease(ASCVD).Peri-renal fat is a special
      type of visceral fat which is different in histology, physiology, and functions. The positon
      of peri-renal fat is more stable than other visceral fat,which might be influenced by breath
      or body position changes.Studies have found that perirenal fat is an early predictor of
      ASCVD, and its accumulation is closely related to the occurrence and development of
      ASCVD.Therefore, the reduction of visceral fat,especially peri-renal fat , has a sufficient
      scientific basis for treating dyslipidemia and reducing the occurrence of cardiovascular
      disease.

      In investigators' previous experiments, surgical ablation of bilateral perirenal adipose
      tissue led to long-term, effective reduction of serum cholesterol in high-fat diet rats and
      alleviated the cardiovascular injury,based on which,in this study the investigators provide a
      novel non-invasive therapy of high-intensity focused ultrasound mediated perirenal fat
      modification to lower the serum cholesterol and protect subjects from ASCVD.
