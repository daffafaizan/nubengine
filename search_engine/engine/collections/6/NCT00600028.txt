      testing the efficacy of thalidomide in suppressing the chronic cough of IPF. All subjects
      will be randomized to either begin the study receiving the active study drug - (thalidomide)
      or inactive drug (placebo). Study drug will be administered in escalating dose starting at 50
      mg a day increasing to 100 mg a day if cough is still present after 2 weeks. Study drug will
      be taken by mouth at bedtime. Patients will remain on their initial treatment for 12 weeks.
