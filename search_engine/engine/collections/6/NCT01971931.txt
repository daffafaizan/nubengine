      revision surgery.

      Several proteins have been identified, which are involved in bone metabolism and remodelling;
      variations in serum levels of some of these proteins after TKR loosening have also been
      described.

      However, preoperative identification of risk factors for aseptic loosening remains a
      challenge.

      An observational study is conducted to evaluate how levels of the following serum biomarkers
      vary after TKR:

        -  osteoprotegerin (OPG)

        -  receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B (RANK)

        -  receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANK-L)

        -  sclerostin

        -  cathepsin K

      To avoid bias caused by inflammatory states, C reactive protein (CRP), interleukin 1 (IL-1),
      interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) levels and erythrocyte sedimentation
      rate (ESR) will be measured.

      Secondary goals are to evaluate the mRNA expression of OPG, RANK-L, cathepsin K and
      sclerostin on tibial bone biopsies and to study if changes in serum biomarkers levels after
      surgery are associated with:

        -  clinical outcomes

        -  periprosthetic bone density

        -  variation of two bone reabsorption markers, the postoperative change of which has
           already been described in details: type 1 collagen cross-linked C-terminal telopeptide
           (CTP1) and type 1 procollagen N-terminal telopeptide (P1NP).

      One day before surgery, after having signed informed consent, patients will undergo a
      vertebral and femoral dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan and blood samples will be
      collected.

      During surgery a tibial biopsy will be collected. Between 4 and 7 days postoperatively and 3,
      6 and 12 months after surgery patients will again undergo periprosthetic DEXA scans and blood
      samples will be collected.
