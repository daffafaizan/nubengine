      associated with a modified yoga program in a population of adults with ventricular
      dysfunction and clinical heart failure (HF). The researchers hypothesize that patients in a
      modified yoga training program will have a significant improvement in clinical outcomes,
      functional ability, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL). The researchers propose to
      evaluate 15-20 subjects with chronic HF and New York Heart Association Functional Class
      (NYHA) II-III and obtain baseline physiological, functional, and HRQOL measurements. After
      obtaining baseline measurements, patients will participate in a modified yoga program with
      instruction for home practice for 8 weeks. Baseline measurements include: Vital signs, oxygen
      saturation, heart rate variability, exercise distance, muscular strength and flexibility
      determination, and various indices of HRQOL. At the conclusion of 8 weeks of yoga training
      the same measurements will be obtained.

      In a group of chronic HF patients, the specific aims are the following:

        1. To develop a safe and feasible yoga program;

        2. To determine whether clinical outcomes (vital signs, oxygen saturation, heart rate
           variability), functional ability (exercise distance, muscular strength and flexibility
           determination), and HRQOL are positively affected by a modified yoga program.
