      function and fertility. When a woman's follicle cohort falls below a critical level, she
      enters a transitional time of diminished ovarian reserve known as ovarian aging. Recently the
      use of autologous platelet-rich plasma (A-PRP) has been proposed as an additional strategy
      for improving ovarian function. A-PRP is prepared from autologous blood using an FDA approved
      device. The rationale for the use of PRP is that it contains growth factors which stimulate
      cellular anabolism, inflammatory modulators that create an anti-inflammatory effect and
      fibrinogen which acts as a scaffold for regenerating tissue. The investigators hypothesize
      that the growth factors present in PRP may have a beneficial effect promoting growth and
      recruitment of antral follicles. The investigators will recruit a prospective cohort of 90
      patients with evidence of Premature Ovarian Aging/DOR. Women invited to participate in this
      RCT will have FSH above 12 and AMH below 1.0 ng/mL respectively and will have had fewer than
      6 oocytes retrieved in a previous ovulation attempt. Consenting participants in this trial
      will be randomized in a doubly blind fashion to two groups. One will receive Platelet Rich
      Plasma (PRP) and the other will receive Platelet Poor Plasma (PPP). Women assigned to PPP
      will be offerred PRP in a future cycle if they so desire.
