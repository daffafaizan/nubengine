      The researchers will enroll 204 elderly subjects (men and women) admitted to two large
      hospital centers with acute hip fracture. Subjects may be institutionalized or
      community-dwelling prior to admission. To be enrolled in the study subjects need to be 65
      years or older. Demented persons, who reach a Folstein Mini Mental Status of less than 15 are
      excluded.

      Design:

      Once written informed consent from participants or proxies is given, subjects will be
      randomly assigned to 4 different program combinations based on a 2X2 factorial design: (1)
      low dose vitamin D / low intensity physiotherapy; or (2) low dose vitamin D / high intensity
      physiotherapy; or (3) high dose vitamin D / low intensity physiotherapy; or (4) high dose
      vitamin D / high intensity physiotherapy. Low dose Vitamin D is 800 IU cholecalciferol per
      day and high dose vitamin D is 2000 IU cholecalciferol per day.

      Subjects will be recruited within 5 days after hip fracture surgery and followed for adverse
      outcomes over a 12-month period. Dose of vitamin D will be double-blinded.
