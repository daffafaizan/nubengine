      skeletal muscle size, skeletal muscle function and body composition in middle-aged women,
      forty eight women (45-60 yrs old) will be recruited to complete a 12-week intervention (n=12
      per group; 4 groups). Participants will be randomized to complete a non-exercise control
      period or a resistance exercise training program. In a double-blinded fashion, participants
      in the non-exercise or resistance exercise groups will be randomized to consume either
      placebo or HMB+VitD. Before and after each intervention the investigators will evaluate
      skeletal muscle size, skeletal muscle function, and body composition.
