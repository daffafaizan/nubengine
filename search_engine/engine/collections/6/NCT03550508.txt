    
      This is a Phase I, first-in-human, multi-center, open-label dose escalation clinical study of
      recombinant fully human Anti-RANKL Monoclonal Antibody (JMT103) administered subcutaneously
      to patients with bone metastases from tumors.

      The study includes two phases: dose escalation study and expansion study. The dose-escalation
      stage is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of single dose
      and following repeat doses of JMT103 given every 4 weeks (Q4W) for three times. The expansion
      study stage is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of repeat
      doses of JMT103 given every 4 weeks (Q4W) for three times.
