      (In-Vivo Optical Spectroscopy; Covidien) can detect changes in oxygen levels reflecting
      regional blood oxygen saturation of the brain tissue beneath the sensor. If this monitoring
      can add further information towards reliable prognostication after cardiac arrest is unknown
      so far.
