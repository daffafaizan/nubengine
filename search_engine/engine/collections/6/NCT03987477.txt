      techniques and change procedures used in cognitive-behavioral therapies. While original CBM
      studies train participants to change cognitive biases in an automatic manner, by forcing
      individuals to find positive outcomes to ambiguous scenarios, this new intervention focuses
      on teaching participants the meaning of emotional cognitive biases and how to modify them by
      using an effortful type of processing (i.e., looking for adaptive alternative interpretations
      to ambiguous stories).

      The study has been design to overcome some of the limitations that have been pointed out in
      this emerging research area. Firstly, although there are recent efforts to understand how
      interpretation, attention and memory cognitive biases may be related, it is still not clear
      how they interact with each other. For this purpose, some authors have pointed out the need
      to use longitudinal data to see how one process may affect each other over time. Secondly,
      different systematic reviews and meta-analyses have investigated the moderating role of
      variables that may be affecting the heterogeneity of results found in CBM interventions.
      Mental imagery has been found to be a useful tool to help participants in their changing
      process, while there is no preferred number of sessions for these interventions. This study
      will help shed some light into this factors by using mental imagery during four sessions
      online.
