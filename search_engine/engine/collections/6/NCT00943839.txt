      Primary

        -  To determine whether a link exists between the effectiveness of therapy with sunitinib
           malate and development of blood biomarkers, specifically the angiogenic factors VEGF and
           interleukin-8 (IL-8), in patients with kidney cancer.

      Secondary

        -  To evaluate the link between the time to progression and the development of VEGF and
           IL-6 CXCL7 and CXCK5 blood levels in these patients.

        -  To evaluate the link between VEGF and IL-6 CXCL7 and CXCK5 blood levels and disease-free
           survival of these patients after 3, 6, 9, and 12 months of treatment.

        -  To evaluate the link between VEGF and IL-6 CXCL7 and CXCK5 blood levels and overall
           survival of these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral sunitinib malate once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 6 weeks
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Blood samples are collected at baseline and then every 6 weeks for pharmacokinetic analysis.
