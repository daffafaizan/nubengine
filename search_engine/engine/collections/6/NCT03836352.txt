    
      This study is a Phase 2 with safety lead-in study to assess the safety and efficacy of
      DPX-Survivac, low dose cyclophosphamide, and pembrolizumab combination therapy in subjects
      with selected advanced and recurrent solid tumours. Two ovarian cancer arms will be recruited
      and randomized in this study, one with and one without cyclophosphamide. All other cohorts
      will be single arm, receiving treatment with the triple combination.

      Up to 20 subjects, from any cohort, will be enrolled to assess the safety of study treatments
      before the study moves to the expansion phase. Once the safety lead-in is completed, the five
      cohorts will be expanded to recruit additional subjects following a Simon two stage design.
      Enrollment in the ovarian cancer cohort will be randomized 1:1 into two arms.
