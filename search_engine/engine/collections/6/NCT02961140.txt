      reconstruction, which is associated with high incidence of postoperative morbidity and
      mortality. Excessive fluid administration may result in pulmonary complication, while
      extremely hypovolemia may lead to shock, circulatory dysfunction, and renal damage. Little is
      known about fluid status will have impact on anastomotic leakage. Goal-directed fluid therapy
      has shown to benefit perioperative outcome in major abdominal surgery. This study aims to
      investigate the effect of goal directed fluid management on the postoperative outcome of
      esophageal resection and reconstruction.
