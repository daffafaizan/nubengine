      chronic liver disease. It is currently estimated that over 170 million individuals (3% of the
      world's population)are infected. In New Zealand, an estimated 25,000 people are living with
      hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and prevalence is predicted to increase by 50% over the
      next 10 years. HCV is primarily spread by blood-to-blood contact. The single most important
      risk factor for acquiring HCV is the use of injected recreational drugs, accounting for
      approximately 80% of infections.

      Unlike hepatitis B, no hepatitis C vaccine is currently available. In the absence of an
      effective vaccine the current treatment of choice is interferon and ribavirin. However,
      treatment of chronic HCV infection with interferon-alpha monotherapy does not achieve
      sustained virologic response. Therefore, it is important to develop alternative treatment
      strategies for patients who are unresponsive or intolerant to current antiviral therapy.

      The aim of this protocol is to compare two doses of a mitochondrial antioxidant treatment
      (MitoQ) and placebo for the treatment of patients with raised liver enzymes due to HCV
      infection. Approximately 36 eligible patients with chronic HCV infection will be randomised
      to receive one of two doses of MitoQ or placebo in a 1:1:1 ratio. Treatment duration will be
      28 days with 28 days post-treatment follow-up.
