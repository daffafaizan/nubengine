      ICU (Intensive Care Unit) patients die with the establishement of a procedure for the
      limitation and cessation of therapeutics (LAT). During a viral pandemic, medical resources
      can be saturated, limiting reflexive abilities in favour of binary decisions. This sorting of
      patients leads to LAT that could be performed without the elementary modalities stated by the
      law. Thus, arbitrary medical decisions made alone could expose patients to unjustified " loss
      of luck ". Increasing the resources mobilized during a pandemic must not make us forget the
      quality of care provided for the benefit of quantity. In therefore seems legitimate to keep
      the LAT modalities to ensure our ethical principles. No work in the literature based on
      actual facts explores the impact of a pandemic on compliance with and maintenance of ethical
      principles and the legisltaive framework, in particular as regards the procedures of the
      application of LAT.

      The purpose of this study is to assess whether the terms of the LAT are being complied during
      a pandemic for patients with or without Covid.
