      attractive alternative to lateral plating of distal fibula fractures. Biomechanical studies
      have shown it to be a stronger construct than lateral plating, and other purported advantages
      include less dissection, decreased potential for intra-articular screw placement, and less
      palpable hardware decreasing the need for hardware removal.However, although posterior
      plating has become an accepted technique for operative management of these injuries, there is
      little clinical information in the literature regarding this treatment, and only one
      published retrospective study directly comparing posterior to lateral plating.

      In 1996, Ostrum published a prospective study evaluating posterior plating in 32 patients,
      but only compared his results to a cohort of patients treated with lateral plating that was
      not part of his actual study group.Patel et al. recently presented a retrospective comparison
      of both techniques, but their study only included 29 patients in the lateral plating group
      and 23 in the posterior group.In both these studies, posterior plating was felt to be
      superior to lateral plating based on both the decrease in complications/re-operations related
      to symptomatic hardware, and improved function and pain scores.

      However, in a much larger study, Lamontagneet al. showed no differences in operative time,
      complications or hardware removal rates in 193 patients reviewed retrospectively, and
      concluded that they could not recommend one treatment method over the other. They even
      elected not to proceed with a planned prospective study based on their results.A recent
      retrospective analysis of 70 patients showed a 43% incidence of need for hardware removal due
      to pain, with 30% of these patients having peroneal tendon lesions identified
      intra-operatively.
