      forehead, in the mouth, ear, armpit or rectum. Non-contact thermometers allow a person's
      temperature to be taken with no contact with the person, reducing the discomfort of having to
      sit still for several minutes. Additionally, there is no need for disinfection between
      patients to occur, allowing for easier and faster use when screening large numbers of people.

      This study is to evaluate the clinical accuracy of the welloStationX, a non-contact
      thermometer by comparing its measurements with that of the gold standard Welch Allyn SureTemp
      oral thermometer.
