    
      The study started after the launch of MorphaBond ER in October 2017 and will continue until
      September 2020 and the final study report will be submitted to the FDA by December 2020.

      This is an observational study that will provide descriptive data on the utilization and
      abuse of MorphaBond ER and related outcomes (addiction, misuse, abuse, overdose,
      overdose-related deaths) for MorphaBond ER and selected comparators in response to the
      US-FDA's post-marketing requirement (PMR 2961-9 for MorphaBond ER).

      No investigational products or pharmaceutical agents will be provided or administered for the
      purpose of this study. Multiple data sources, representing different populations and large
      geographic areas in the US, will be utilized to study the patterns of MorphaBond ER
      utilization and abuse and related outcomes.

      The overall purpose of this study is to collect meaningful baseline data to support
      subsequent studies for formal epidemiologic assessment of abuse deterrence of MorphaBond ER
      as required by the FDA.
