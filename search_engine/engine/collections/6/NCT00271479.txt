      meningitidis serogroup W135 was identified as the causative organism. This event followed the
      outbreaks of 2000 and 2001 in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, and was the first large epidemic caused by
      serogroup W135. Mass vaccination of the population with the only vaccine protecting against
      W135, i.e. the tetravalent A/C/Y/W135 polysaccharide vaccine (TPSV), was not possible because
      of the global shortage in supply, in addition to its cost. In 2003, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK)
      produced a trivalent polysaccharide vaccine A/C/W135 for US$ 1.5. This vaccine was used in
      Burkina Faso in the new epidemic faced by this country in 2003. However, availability and
      affordability of the tetravalent A/C/Y/W135 polysaccharide vaccine and of the trivalent
      A/C/W135 polysaccharide vaccine are still under discussion between the WHO and the producers.
      The risk of further epidemics due to the W135 strain in other African countries is of high
      concern for the scientific community.

      The current dose of the licensed tetravalent A/C/Y/W135 polysaccharide vaccine contains 50 μg
      of each polysaccharide component. During the 1980's, researchers from the Walter Reed Army
      Institute of Research (WRAIR) did extensive works on the immunogenicity of meningococcal
      polysaccharide vaccines in adults. A first study performed by Griffiss et al. demonstrated
      that doses of 5 μg of group Y and group W135 polysaccharides were as effective as doses of 50
      μg in inducing production of bactericidal antibody amounts correlating with functional
      immunity (Griffiss et al. Mil Med 1985; 150: 529-33). A second study concluded that doses of
      7.5 μg (Y and W) and 15 μg (A and C) were sufficient to induce equivalent binding and
      bactericidal antibody responses as 50 μg (Griffiss et al. Infect Immun 1982; 37: 205-8). In a
      more recent study from Granoff et al., 1/50 (1 mcg) of the ordinary dose of tetravalent
      A/C/Y/W135 vaccine was given (Granoff et al. J Infect Dis 1998; 178: 870-4). The antibody
      responses to A and C have been measured, and this low dose was sufficient to mount a C
      response in most of the subjects, but the dose was less effective in eliciting a response to
      A. The antibody responses to W135 and Y were not reported.

      Hypothesis:

      Lower doses of each A/C/Y/W135 component of the meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine could
      confer a similar functional immunogenic response as the dose of 50 μg currently being used,
      and subsequently be equally protective.

      It would potentially bring two major benefits. Firstly, it would increase the number of
      tetravalent vaccine doses available on the market. Secondly, it would decrease the cost of
      the individual vaccine dose. As a result, more people could be vaccinated, and thereby
      protected against the disease, and to a lower price.

      Results obtained with the study on the tetravalent A/C/Y/W135 polysaccharide vaccine would be
      valid for the trivalent A/C/W135 polysaccharide vaccine.
