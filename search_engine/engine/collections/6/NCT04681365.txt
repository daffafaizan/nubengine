      transmission to NHS healthcare workers.

      This project aims to address these problems by taking a user centred design approach to
      develop and manufacture a highly functional Hood Integrated Personal Air Purifying Respirator
      (HI-PAPR) at a low cost. The design team brings together Manchester University NHS Foundation
      Trust (MFT) ICU frontline clinical staff, an experienced product design consultancy,
      Designing Science Limited (DSL) and the technical expertise of the School of Engineering at
      the University of Manchester (UoM). The project will run through a rapid design and
      evaluation cycle in simulated and clinical environments to refine the concept to meet
      regulatory requirements. The final product could be used in primary/secondary care and in the
      community and will be ready for wide-scale manufacture and supply for the UK NHS within six
      months of the project start.

      This study will evaluate Bubble PAPR in the clinical environment and gather usability data
      from frontline healthcare staff.

      We hypothesise that:

        -  The Bubble PAPR will meet or exceed the British and European standards for PAPRs.

        -  That participating staff who subsequently use the PAPR will rate the PPE as:

        -  More comfortable than current PPE

        -  Safer than current PPE

        -  Easier to communicate with colleagues than current PPE

        -  Easier to communicate with patients than current PPE

      Our research question is:

      â€¢ Do clinical staff report that the Bubble PAPR is more comfortable than current FFP3
      facemasks.
