    
      The study will recruit 40 participants to two groups as outlined below:

      Group 1: Early HER2 positive breast cancer (20 patients) Group 2: Metastatic HER2 positive
      breast cancer (20 patients)

      The two groups represent the natural spectrum of breast cancer in its clinical presentation.

      GROUP 1: EARLY BREAST CANCER

      Group 1 will include patients with early HER2 positive breast cancer recommended to receive
      neo-adjuvant chemotherapy inclusive of HER2 directed therapy (trastuzumab + pertuzumab),
      prior to proceeding to curative surgery. All participants are expected to have had a
      diagnostic core biopsy and definitive breast surgery on completion of neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy as standard of care. Blood samples will be obtained for biomarker analysis in
      exosomes. Participants in Group 1 A will be requested to have a biopsy on completion of
      anthracycline based chemotherapy and prior to commencing on HER2-directed therapy.

      Group 1 A: Participants in Group 1 commencing treatment with anthracycline based chemotherapy
      for up to 4 cycles followed by a switch in treatment to taxane based chemotherapy in
      combination with HER2 directed therapy (trastuzumab + pertuzumab) for up to 4 cycles

      Group 1 B: Participants in Group 1 commencing treatment with taxane based systemic therapy in
      combination with HER2 directed therapy (trastuzumab + pertuzumab) for up to 6 cycles:

      GROUP 2: METASTATIC BREAST CANCER:

      Group 2 will include patients with metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer recommended to
      receive HER2 directed systemic therapy (trastuzumab + pertuzumab) in a palliative setting.
      All participants are expected to have had a diagnostic core biopsy. Blood samples will be
      obtained for biomarker analysis in exosomes.
