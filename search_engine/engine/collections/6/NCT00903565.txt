    
      Primary Objective • To validate the performance of ColoPrint in estimating the 3-year relapse
      rate in patients with stage II colorectal cancer.

      Secondary Objectives

      • To assess the feasibility of using the ColoPrint test in the clinical setting.

        -  To compare the risk assessment in stage II patients using the ColoPrint profile vs a
           clinical risk assessment based on 1) Investigator's assessment of risk and 2) ASCO
           high-risk recommendations (T4 lesions, perforation / obstruction, inadequate node
           sampling (less than 12 nodes) or poorly differentiated histology).

        -  To establish the proportion of low-risk and high-risk ColoPrint profiles in stage II
           colorectal cancer patients in various countries.

        -  To investigate therapy as a potential confounding factor for ColoPrint results.

        -  To assess the performance of ColoPrint in estimating the 3-year relapse rate in patients
           with stage III colorectal cancer.

        -  To compare the performance of ColoPrint vs the clinical risk assessment in estimating
           the 5-year relapse rate.

        -  Assess the impact of ColoPrint on adjuvant chemotherapy treatment decisions in stage 2
           colorectal cancer patients

        -  Compare the ColoPrint results from fresh RNARetain colorectal tumor specimens to the
           matched formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue (FFPE) colon tumor specimens for
           concordance.
