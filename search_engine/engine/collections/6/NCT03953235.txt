      containing these mutations as non-self antigens in the context of HLA on the tumor cell
      surface. A fraction of mutated peptides result in neoantigens capable of generating T-cell
      responses that exclusively target tumor cells. Some of these tumor-specific neoantigens are
      known or expected to be common across a subset of patients and are called shared neoantigens.
      This study aims to target shared neoantigens using a heterologous prime/boost therapeutic
      vaccine approach (GRT-C903 first followed by GRT-R904) in combination with checkpoint
      blockade to stimulate an immune response. This study will explore the safety and early
      clinical activity of this neoantigen-based immunotherapy intended to induce T-cell responses
      specific for the shared neoantigens contained within the therapeutic vaccine. Phase 1 will
      test multiple doses and combinations with checkpoint blockade and Phase 2 will test for early
      signs of clinical activity using a vaccine regimen based on Phase 1 data.
