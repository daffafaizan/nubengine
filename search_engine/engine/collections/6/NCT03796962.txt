    
      The XEN1101 Phase 2 clinical trial is designed as a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, multicenter study with an optional open-label extension (OLE) to evaluate
      the clinical efficacy, safety and tolerability of XEN1101 administered as adjunctive
      treatment in adult patients aged 18 to 75 years diagnosed with focal epilepsy. Approximately
      300 patients will be randomized in a blinded manner to one of three active treatment groups
      or placebo in a 2:1:1:2 fashion (XEN1101 25 mg : 20 mg : 10 mg : Placebo). After screening,
      patients will have 8 weeks of baseline to assess frequency of seizures, followed by 8 weeks
      of treatment and a 6-week post treatment follow-up period. In order to be included in the
      study, patients must already be treated with a stable dose of 1 to 3 allowable current
      anti-epileptic drugs for at least one month prior to screening, during baseline, and
      throughout the double-blind portion (DBP) of the study. During the treatment period, patients
      will be given XEN1101 or placebo once daily in the evening. A one year OLE will be available
      to eligible patients who complete the DBP. All patients will receive a 20 mg daily dose of
      XEN1101 during this extension period.
