      using phacoemulsification. The study eye was implanted with the investigational device (All
      HMIOL Cohort). The fellow eye was treated with a commercially available intraocular lens
      (IOL) per standard of care procedure. At the scheduled Month 3 post-operative visit, subjects
      who did not opt to pursue an optic exchange procedure in the study eye were enrolled into
      subgroup Cohort 1 and followed for an additional 6 months. The total duration of
      participation for Cohort 1 was up to 15 months, which included a Day -90 to Day -1
      preoperative period and a 12 month post-operative follow-up period. At the scheduled Month 3
      post-operative visit, subjects who elected to pursue an optic exchange procedure in the study
      eye were enrolled into subgroup Cohort 2 and followed for an additional 12 months. The total
      duration of participation for Cohort 2 was up to 18 months, which included a Day -90 to Day
      -1 preoperative period, an optic exchange at Month 3 postoperative, and a 12 month
      post-exchange follow-up period.
