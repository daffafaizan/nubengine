      cerebrovascular and renal events, and overall survival. The study is designed to provide
      effectiveness and safety data by Q2 2023 which will cover a period up to 5 years after the
      migalastat launch date.

      This will involve a retrospective data collection up to migalastat initiation (for patients
      already receiving migalastat) and a prospective follow-up from 1 to 3.5 years (depending on
      the time of enrollment) in migalastat-treated patients with Fabry disease who have a GLA
      mutation amenable to migalastat.

      All visits will be scheduled and conducted according to the clinical site's standard of care.
      Standard of care is defined as a diagnostic and customary clinical treatment/practice process
      that a clinician chooses according to their clinical judgement for a Fabry disease patient.
      There are no study- required visits, tests or clinical assessments.
