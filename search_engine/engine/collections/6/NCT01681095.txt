      cardioplegic solution for myocardial protection by comparing standard cold blood cardioplegia
      to Custodiol solution with respect to myocardial injury as measured by Creatine phosphokinase
      MB isoenzyme (CK-MB),troponin-I at 7 hours post surgery and changes in ejection fraction by
      trans-thoracic echocardiogram (TTE)or trans-esophageal echocardiogram (TEE) at 24 hours post
      surgery.
