      mellitus. The role of the liver in the evolution of type 2 diabetes has not been as
      extensively studied as that of muscle. This has been, in part, due to the inherent difficulty
      of measuring hepatic insulin action in humans under physiologic conditions. Plasma free fatty
      acids (FFA) can cause insulin resistance in non-diabetic humans and are commonly elevated in
      people with type 2 diabetes. We will re-examine the mechanism(s) by which elevated FFA cause
      hepatic insulin resistance in non-diabetic humans, will determine whether elevated FFA alter
      insulin induced suppression of endogenous glucose production (EGP) in diabetic humans and if
      so, whether this is due to changes in glycogenolysis and/or gluconeogenesis. We will also
      seek to determine whether treatment with a pioglitazone (a thiazolidinedione) blunts or
      prevents FFA induced hepatic (and extrahepatic) insulin resistance in people with type 2
      diabetes and whether the effects of FFA on insulin action are influenced by gender. We will
      examine if use of thiazolidinediones reduces cortisol production by changing the overall
      activity of 11 beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1. We will also investigate whether use
      of thiazolidinediones alters objectively measured breathing or sleepiness in people with type
      2 diabetes.
