      people who have celiac disease. The study has two cohorts planned. The first cohort has 1
      dose level and the second cohort may include 1 or 2 dose levels, depending on safety,
      tolerability, and activity observed in the first cohort.

      The study will enroll approximately 108 patients. In the first cohort, approximately 45
      participants will be randomly assigned in 1:2:2 ratio in one of the three arm groups -which
      will remain undisclosed to the participant and study doctor during the study (unless there is
      an urgent medical need). Eligible participants will receive: Cohort 1:

        -  Placebo: 2 infusions

        -  TAK-101 2 mg/kg: 1 infusion + placebo: 1 infusion

        -  TAK-101 2 mg/kg: 2 infusions

      All participants will be asked to take TAK-101 intravenous (IV) infusion and TAK-101 placebo
      matching infusion on Days 1 and 8. After completion of Cohort 1, Cohort 2 may start based on
      the review of Cohort 1 data by an external data monitoring committee (DMC). Approximately 86
      participants may be randomly assigned in 1:2:2:2 ratio in Cohort 2 to receive: Cohort 2 (1
      mg/kg may not be needed based on review of Cohort 1 data):

        -  Placebo: 2 infusions

        -  TAK-101 4 mg/kg : 1 infusion + placebo: 1 infusion

        -  TAK-101 4 mg/kg: 2 infusions

        -  TAK-101 1 mg/kg: 2 infusions

      The TAK-101 1 mg/kg, 2 infusions may be open based on an interim analysis of the cohort 1
      Interferon-gamma Spot Forming Units (IFN-Î³ SFUs) reviewed by the DMC. If TAK-101 1 mg/kg, 2
      infusions is not open, approximately 86 participants will be randomly assigned in 1:2:2 ratio
      to receive:

        -  Placebo: 2 infusions

        -  TAK-101 1 mg/kg: 1 infusion + placebo: 1 infusion

        -  TAK-101 1 mg/kg: 2 infusions

      This trial will be conducted in United States and Canada. The overall time to participate in
      this study is approximately 26 weeks. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic,
      and will be contacted by telephone OR plus a final visit after receiving their last dose of
      study drug for a follow-up assessment.
