      the subject will be randomized to receive the study drug or a placebo. Subjects blood
      pressure will be monitored closely for the first 30 minutes and then have standard intensive
      care unit (ICU) care afterwards. Kidney dysfunction will be assessed for changes in urine
      production and laboratory values that are followed as a part of standard postoperative care.
      Study coordinators will obtain these values from subjects medical records for 7 days and
      subjects will be contacted by phone for follow up after 30 days.
