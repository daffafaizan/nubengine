      related like other drug classes and work through a variety of mechanisms. The term "muscle
      relaxant" is used to refer to two major therapeutic groups: neuromuscular blockers and
      spasmolytic. Some of them are working mainly through the central nervous system; they have
      many adverse effects such as sedation and dizziness that may limit their use.

      Pharmacists may also logistically serve as ideal health-care destinations to implement and
      deliver prevention, early intervention, and referral of oral health services to reduce the
      incidence of potentially preventable oral conditions including tooth decay, gum disease, and
      oral cancer. Interprofessional teamwork between pharmacist and dentistry may help to
      encourage pharmacists to take a more active role in promoting oral health. By providing
      information and assistance for self-care and the use of over the counter (OTC) products for
      minor problems on oral health, it can provide better patient care in the Malaysian
      health-care system
