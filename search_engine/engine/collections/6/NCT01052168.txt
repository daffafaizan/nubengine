      lead to improved learning and will translate to better operating room (OR) performance of
      novices than training to goals of speed or motion alone. BACKGROUND:: Motion tracking has
      been suggested to be a more sensitive performance metric than time and errors for the
      assessment of surgical performance. METHODS:: An institutional review board-approved, single
      blinded, randomized controlled trial was conducted at our level-I American College of
      Surgeons accredited Education Institute. Forty-two novices trained to proficiency in
      laparoscopic suturing after being randomized into 3 groups: The speed group (n = 14) had to
      achieve expert levels of speed, the motion group (n = 15) expert levels of motion (path
      length and smoothness), and the speed and motion group (n = 13) both levels. To achieve
      proficiency, all groups also had to demonstrate error-free performance. The FLS suture module
      (task 5) was used for training inside the ProMIS simulator that tracks instrument motion. All
      groups participated in transfer and retention tests in the OR. OR performance was assessed by
      a blinded expert rater using Global Operative Assessment of Laparoscopic Skills, speed,
      accuracy, and inadvertent injuries.
