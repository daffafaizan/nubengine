      Antigen (CA)-125 prior to the start of each new cycle with an assessment of measurable
      diseased by either CT or MRI every 6 weeks. Treatment will continue until disease
      progression, unacceptable toxicities, or the patient elects to withdraw from the study. All
      patients will be followed until disease progression or study withdraw. In addition, following
      disease progression, patients will be monitored for delayed toxicity and survival for a
      period of 5 years, unless consent is withdrawn.
