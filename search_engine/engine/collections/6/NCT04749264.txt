      yield significant improvement at post-relative to pre-retreat, compared to matched control,
      in each of these internal attentional processes: (i) enhanced ability to disengage from
      negative self-referential thoughts; (ii) reduced selection bias to negative self-referential
      thoughts; (iii) enhanced interoceptive attention and sensibility to a broader range of
      locations, intensities and hedonic tones of bodily sensations in response to negative and
      neutral self-referential thoughts; as well as (iv) enhanced mindful awareness during
      mindfulness meditation as expressed in the objects and temporal dynamics of mindful
      awareness. Second, the investigators will assess whether each of the aforementioned internal
      attentional change processes from pre- to post-retreat, will predict change from pre- to
      2-weeks post-retreat in mindful awareness in daily living, mindfulness-related processes
      (e.g., decentering), and mental health. Third, investigators will assess whether previous
      meditation experience moderates these effects.
