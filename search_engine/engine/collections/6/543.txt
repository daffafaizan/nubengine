266. immunology of the cancer cell: tumour-specific antigensafter a broad historical survey of immunologicalstudies of cancer, a review is givenof the evidence showing that antigens present innormal cells are missing from themalignant cells that arise from the same tissue.this evidence is considered in con-junction with the deletion hypothesis of carcinogenesis,and the author emphasizes,that in his view, the key event in carcinogenesisis enzymatic deletion.  antigenicgain and intensification in the course of spontaneous,chemical, and viral carcino-genesis is reviewed, together with experimentsdemonstrating the existence oftumour-specific antigens.  the question is thenposed: if tumours have specific anti-gens, why is evidence for their rejection so scanty?the occasional spontaneous re-gression points to host resistance but its raritysuggests that tolerance generallydevelops.  consideration is given to theapplication of immunological methods totherapy and although current achievementin this field is limited, new immunologicalstratagems might yet transform the picture.finally a plea is made for the integra-tion of the disciplines of immunology andcellular differentiation.  the prospect israised that through a synthetic and holisticapproach we might discover the suscepti-bility of the cancer cell to re-differentiationand re-recognition.
