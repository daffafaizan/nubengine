      gonadotropins used for COS in ART. The clinical use of the various progesterone preparations
      will also be monitored and registered. All medications will be used according to normal
      clinical practice, as described in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC). From the
      start of the program cycles data will be collected prospectively for 12 months and also a
      substantial amount of cycles will be analyzed retrospectively for the previous 6 months. Data
      will be collected from all subjects stimulated by follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), with or
      without down regulation and exogenous lutenizing hormone (LH) supplementation, and final
      follicular maturation triggered by human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and luteal phase
      support by any means for COS in ART and intracytosolic sperm injection (ICSI). All the
      medications should be used according to usual clinical practice. Data related to pretreatment
      (basal examination, history of infertility, LH suppression), stimulation (gonadotropin use,
      concomitant medications, luteal phase supplementation, ovulation triggering, cycle
      cancellation, fertilization methods), safety aspects and clinical outcome will be captured.
