      advanced soft tissue sarcomas. II. Determine the duration of response in these patients. III.
      Determine the acute side effects in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive ecteinascidin 743 (ET-743) IV over 24
      hours every 3 weeks. Treatment continues for at least 2-6 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 6 weeks until disease
      progression and every 12 weeks after disease progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 28-44 patients will be accrued for this study.
