      with the Fontan operation. In this procedure, systemic venous return is rerouted directly to
      the pulmonary arteries, which serves to separate the systemic and pulmonary circulations.
      Following this operation, deoxygenated blood flows passively from the body through the lungs
      without a pumping chamber. Although mortality following the Fontan operation is now uncommon,
      early postoperative morbidity including prolonged postoperative chest tube drainage and
      hospitalization remains significant. The efficacy of empiric inotropic, vasodilator and
      neurohumoral-inhibitory therapies in the perioperative period is unknown and practice varies
      widely between centers.

      We propose a single-center, randomized, double-blind, phase II clinical trial in children
      undergoing Fontan surgery. We plan to compare the effects of perioperative nesiritide,
      milrinone and placebo infusions on the early postoperative clinical course and neurohumoral
      profile. The primary aim of the study is to determine whether nesiritide, milrinone or
      placebo infusion is associated with fewer days alive and out of the hospital within 30 days
      of surgery. We hypothesize that, when compared to the milrinone and placebo groups, the
      nesiritide group will have more days alive and out of the hospital within the first 30 days
      after surgery. Secondary aims are to determine the effects of these infusions on
      postoperative resource consumption, hemodynamics, arrhythmias, renal function, neurohumoral
      activation and adverse events. Thirty-nine patients per group (117 total patients) will be
      enrolled over three years.
