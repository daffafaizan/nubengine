      post-exercise substrate oxidation, and appetite and energy intakes over 24h in postmenopausal
      women with overweight or obesity.

      Using a randomized crossover design, 12 postmenopausal women completed 3 cycling exercises at
      6-days intervals:

      i) Moderate Intensity Continuous Exercise (MICE) which consisted of 35 min cycling at 60-65%
      theorical Peak Heart Rate (thPHR) ii) High Intensity Interval Exercise 1 (HIIE 1) 60 cycles
      of speeding up for 8 s at 80-90%thPHR followed by pedaling slowly for 12 s (20min) iii) High
      Intensity Interval Exercise 2 (HIIE 2) which consisted of repeated 10 x 1min at 80-90% thPHR
      followed by pedaling slowly for 1min.

      Substrate oxidation (CHO and FAT) were measured at rest and 2h- post exercise. Enjoyment,
      perceived exertion and appetite were recorded and post-exercise energy intakes were assessed
      over 24h.
