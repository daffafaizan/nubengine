      test on an ergometer cycle to obtain their maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max).Their body
      composition will be assessed by DXA. They will be asked to complete 3 experimental sessions.

      During a first session the volunteers will remain inactive, and only a breakfast will be
      offered. During the second session, a breakfast will be offered and they will have to
      complete a sub-maximal exercise set at 60% of their VO2max 3 hours after breakfast. And the
      third session will consist in the realisation of exercise on fast state. Those three sessions
      will be realized in a randomized order. Several blood (catheter) and salivary samples will be
      collected during the three sessions, throughout the experimental day.
