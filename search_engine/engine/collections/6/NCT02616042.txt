      various herbal extracts have been introduced over the past few decades,Centella asiatica
      (CA), a small herb broadly cultivated in China, Southeast Asia, India and Oceanic countries,
      has long been used for therapeutic purposes since ancient times.CA has been reported to be
      useful in the treatment of skin diseases wound repair and healing of burn. In dentistry, few
      studies have explored the efficacy of CA. In one study, CA was demonstrated to be an
      effective supportive agent following periodontal treatment, resulting in reduced plaque and
      gingivitis. In spite of such wound healing properties of CA, its usage in dental field has
      been limited.

      Bamboo salt (BS) is a Korean folk remedy consisting of sea salt roasted in bamboo which has
      long been used for therapeutic purposes in Korea. Toothpastes containing BS has been sold in
      Korea for some decades. Some in vitro studies and animal studies using rats demonstrated
      anti-inflammatory effects of BS. Nevertheless, no human study has yet evaluated the effect of
      BS on periodontal health.

      Therefore, the new dentifrice containing CA and BS was developed.
