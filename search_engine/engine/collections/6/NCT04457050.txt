      resistance has been linked to poor response to interferon based therapy. recently, direct
      acting antiviral drugs are approved for hepatitis C elimination with high potency and safety.
      The aim of the study is to: 1. Determine the prevalence of insulin resistance among
      non-diabetic patients with chronic HCV infection. 2. Explore the impact of treatment with
      DAAs on insulin resistance among chronic HCV infected patients. 3. Investigate the role of
      insulin resistance as a potential prognostic factor for the response to DAAs. 4. Explore the
      utility of resistin as a potential biomarker IR among HCV infected patients.
