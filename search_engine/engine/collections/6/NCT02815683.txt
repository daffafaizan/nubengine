    
      Rationale: New bronchoscopic treatments for emphysema have shown promise in clinical trials,
      improving lung function, exercise capacity and possibly survival and are now being adopted by
      a number of centres in the Netherlands. It is important to ensure that the benefits seen in
      clinical trials are in fact reflected in clinical practice and that the best use of this
      early 'real world' experience is made to optimise the development and use of these novel
      therapies.

      Overall objective: to develop a national database to record bronchoscopic lung volume
      reduction procedures for patients with emphysema. This is desirable for audit purposes but
      will also be an important resource for research both in gathering data and in facilitating
      collaborations.

      Study design: This study is a nationwide, multicenter, observational post-marketing study
      with long-term follow up (5 years).

      Study population: The study population exists of patients with severe emphysema who undergo a
      bronchoscopic lung volume reduction treatment with one-way endobronchial valves.

      Main study parameters/endpoints:

      The main study parameter is the assessment of Target Lung Volume Reduction (TLVR) and correct
      placement of the valves at CT-scan at 30 days post treatment. This is the most accurate and
      directly treatment related endpoint which will also be used for quality control.
