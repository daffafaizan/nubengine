      durvalumab 1500 mg approximately 3-6 weeks prior to standard of care surgery. It will be
      given concurrently with the first dose of radiation (RT). The starting RT dose level will be
      given as 6 Gy for 2 fractions (12 Gy total) every other day over approximately one week to
      sites of gross disease (Table 1) only to minimize exposure to normal tissue. If toxicity
      develops and surgery is delayed by more than 8 weeks (qualifying as a DLT), the radiation
      dose will be dropped per protocol for the next set of patients. If this dose is tolerated,
      the dose will be increased to 6 Gy for 3 fractions (18 Gy total) for the next 3 patients.
      Patients will proceed to surgical resection approximately 3-6 weeks after radiation as
      recommended by the ENT surgeon.
