    
      Pragmatic, controlled, prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded endpoint clinical trial
      testing the benefits of beta-blocker maintenance therapy in patients discharged after an
      acute myocardial infarction (MI). Patients being discharged after an acute MI, with or
      without ST-segment elevation, and with a left ventricular ejection fraction >40%, and without
      history of heart failure (HF) prior to study inclusion, will be recruited. At discharge,
      patients will be randomized (1:1) to receive beta-blocker therapy (agent and dose according
      to treating physician) or no beta-blocker therapy. Primary outcome is the 3 years incidence
      of MACE (all cause mortality, reinfarction, heart failure admission).
