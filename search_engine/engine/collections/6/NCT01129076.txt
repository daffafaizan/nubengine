      life-long medical care. As a result of the chronic and demanding nature of the condition,
      studies have shown that TM might negatively affect an individual s quality of life, sense of
      self, social integration, and compliance with medical treatment. Yet, little is known about
      affected individuals overall experiences with and perceptions of TM. In this study, the
      concept of stigma will be used to explore and understand these experiences and perceptions in
      the population of individuals with TM in Singapore. This study will involve qualitative
      interviews with TM patients and parents of TM patients. Interviews will focus on individuals
      family, social and professional experiences with TM; the social messages that exist in
      Singapore about TM and their sources; individuals perceptions of how others view TM;
      individuals own perceptions of TM; and the impact of these various experiences, messages and
      perceptions on the individual with TM. Interviews will be conducted with approximately 20-30
      individuals with TM, and 10-20 parents of individuals with TM. Interviews will be transcribed
      and subjected to thematic analysis to identify common themes. The results of this study will
      further our understanding of the psychosocial burden of TM and the potential role of stigma
      in this population, which may ultimately inform the care for individuals with TM. The study s
      setting will also provide insights into the impact of the Singaporean sociocultural context
      on the psychosocial elements of living with a genetic condition, which might eventually help
      to inform the development of appropriate psychosocial support services and genetic counseling
      services in the region.
