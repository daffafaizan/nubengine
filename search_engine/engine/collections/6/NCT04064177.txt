    
      This is a 3-year prospective observational study.

      Principal research question:

      Is non-invasive continuous cardiac output (CO) measurement a validated tool of comprehensive
      cardiovascular assessment in neonatal intensive care (NICU)?

      Secondary research questions:

        1. Can robust normal ranges of CO be constructed for neonates undergoing cardiovascular
           measurement?

        2. How do neonatal interventions (fluid boluses, ventilation and inotropes) affect CO?

        3. Does the Non-invasive continuous cardiac output monitoring in children with foetal
           growth restriction (FGR) differ from normative CO data as above (1)?

      A prospective study of stable newborn babies in the postnatal ward and sick term and preterm
      infants in the NICU in 36 months.
