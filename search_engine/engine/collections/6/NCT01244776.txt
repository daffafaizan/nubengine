      which may damage corneal stroma and may lead to permanent corneal scars and blindness.
      Corneal transplantation is standard method for corneal ulcer, but severe shortage of donor
      corneas limits its application. Acellular porcine corneal matrix is similar to the native
      cornea, especially with the biological property and microstructure. Recently, this matrix has
      been proved to be safe when transplanted to animal subjects and will not be rejected by the
      recipient. In animal lamellar keratoplasty experiments, acellular corneal matrix showed that
      they can integrate into the corneal wound bed and help reconstruction of the lamellar
      integrity of corneal stroma. This study will investigate its healing effect on human corneal
      ulcer. It will provide a potential corneal substitute for this disease.
