    
      COVID-19 is a respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and causes
      substantial morbidity and mortality. There is currently no vaccine to prevent COVID-19 or
      infection with SARS-CoV-2 or therapeutic agent to treat COVID-19. The ongoing COVID-19
      pandemic has demonstrated increased risk to those with an aging immune system. The elderly
      and those with comorbidities are reported as being the most susceptible to COVID-19, which
      may be due to a higher basal state of inflammation ("inflammaging") and a primed inflammasome
      pathway. Disulfiram, an FDA-approved drug for the treatment of alcohol dependence, has a
      potential for limiting the hyperinflammatory response associated with COVID-19. Specifically,
      the drug inhibits gasdermin D pore formation, reducing pyroptosis and netosis and could
      target the root cause of hyperinflammation, weakening the cytokine storm and therefore
      reducing the risk of progression to severe illness.

      This is a stratified, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of disulfiram in
      hospitalized subjects over the age of 50 diagnosed with moderate COVID-19. 200 subjects are
      planned to be enrolled and randomized (1:1) to either receive 500 mg of disulfiram (active
      product) or placebo, orally (po) or enterally (only in patients that require mechanical
      ventilation) once daily for fourteen (14) days in addition to standard of care.
      Stratification will be done at randomization based on age and comorbidities.
