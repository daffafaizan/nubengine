      affects at least one in four older people. The most common painful musculoskeletal conditions
      among older adults are osteoarthritis, low back pain, fibromyalgia, chronic shoulder pain,
      knee pain, myofascial pain syndrome and previous fracture sites. Recent studies demonstrate
      generalized alterations of pain processing among older individuals with CMP. An improved
      understanding of the mechanisms underlying CMP-related changes in pain modulation will
      provide a basis for the development of targeted preventive and rehabilitative strategies. In
      light of evidence emphasizing plasticity of white matter connections, and the potential pain
      relieving effects of non-invasive brain stimulation interventions, it seems reasonable to
      identify these connections as potential targets for future treatment approaches. Given the
      expected growth of the older population, such strategies could have a monumental impact in
      reducing healthcare expenditures and improving the quality of life of older adults.
