      treatments are not available to treat suicidal patients. Thus, Rapid-acting treatments for
      suicidal individuals are truly needed. This project aims to evaluate the potential rapid and
      sustained antisuicidal and antidepressant effects of a single intranasal dose of ketamine in
      inpatients during a mood episode (in Major Depressive Disorder, MDD or Bipolar Disorder, BD)
      with or without comorbid recent abuse of alcohol. These results will elucidate the
      antisuicidal effects of ketamine using the intranasal route along with the identification of
      associated mediators or moderators; this approach has the potential for enormous public
      health impact.
