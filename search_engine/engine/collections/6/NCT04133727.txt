      a better position to deliver quality healthcare. In this study, the investigators randomized
      pharmacy students to either a polypharmacy workshop or an immersive aging simulation suit and
      polypharmacy workshop to examine if simulation will enhance empathy levels among students.
      This will be performed in all year 1 pharmacy students
