    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, five parallel groups efficacy and
      safety exploratory of tesofensine versus placebo in levodopa treated Parkinson patients with
      motor fluctuations.

      Patients will be treated either with one of the 4 doses of tesofensine (0.125mg, 0.25mg, 0.50
      mg or 1.0 mg) or with placebo, once daily, over 14 weeks.

      The two co-primary efficacy endpoints are the change in off-time and the change in the
      Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) II+III total score

      Study Hypothesis:

      The null hypothesis is that there is no difference between placebo and tesofensine.

      The alternative hypothesis is that treatment with tesofensine is superior to treatment with
      placebo.

      Comparison(s):

      For the primary comparison between tesofensine and placebo, change in percentage off-time
      during waking hours will be based on reports from patient's diary (completed at day -3 and
      day-2 prior to the study visits) and change in the UPDRS II+III will be based on UPDRS II
      averaged for on and off periods and UPDRS III evaluated at on periods during the study
      visits.
