    
      This aim of this study is to determine the efficacy of PBMT in combination with the
      institutional therapy on the management of BCRL. Therefore, we hypothesize that PBMT in
      combination with manual lymphatic drainage is able to reduce the limb circumference and the
      associated pain and improve the QoL of patients with BCRL during treatment and up to 12
      months post-treatment.

      Primary Objective 1: Arm circumference

      The study seeks primarily to determine the effectiveness PBMT and manual lymphatic drainage
      in reducing the arm circumference in patients with established BCRL during PBM treatment and
      up to 12 months post-PBMT.

      Primary Objective 2: Activity and participation

      Another primary aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of PBMT and manual
      lymphatic drainage in the enhancement of the patients' activity and participation status.

      Secondary Objective 1: Pain

      A secondary aim of this study is to evaluate if PBMT and manual lymphatic drainage can reduce
      the BCRL-related pain during PBM treatment and up to 12 months post-PBMT.

      Secondary Objective 2: Quality of life

      A secondary aim of this study is to evaluate if PBMT and manual lymphatic drainage can
      improve the patients' QoL during PBM treatment and up to 12 months post-PBMT.

      Secondary Objective 3: Depression

      A secondary aim of this study is to evaluate if PBMT and manual lymphatic drainage can
      improve the patients' mental status during PBM treatment and up to 12 months post-PBMT.

      Secondary Objective 4: Patient satisfaction

      A secondary aim of this study is to evaluate if patients are satisfied with PBMT and manual
      lymphatic drainage as a treatment for BCRL during the treatment sessions and up to 12 months
      post-therapy.

      Secondary Objective 5: PBM safety

      A secondary aim of this study is to evaluate the safety of PBM in oncologic patients up to 5
      years post-PBMT.
