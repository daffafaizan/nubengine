    
      Patients who fulfilled the selection criteria will be included in the study. One quadrant
      will be treated with HA gel (test) and the other without to serve as control. Clinical
      examination will be done in a dental chair under standard conditions of light, using mouth
      mirror and graduated Williams Periodontal Probe.

      All patients will receive full mouth scaling and root planing with hand instruments and
      ultrasonic scalers at baseline. Thereafter, in the test quadrant, 1 ml of 0.8% hyaluronic
      acid gel will be administered subgingivally in all selected test sites at baseline and 1 week
      later. The following clinical parameters will be recorded at baseline, after 6 weeks and 12
      weeks post treatment. Oral hygiene instructions will be given to all patients. The clinical
      measurements and treatment will be performed by a single examiner.For every patient and
      control subject, GCF samples will be collected at baseline, 6 weeks and 12 weeks post
      treatment. The samples will be pooled from two periodontal sites with clinical attachment
      level of 3 mm or more (in the two different quadrants). The sampling area will be isolated
      with cotton rolls and carefully will be cleaned supragingivally with sterile cotton pellets.
      A sterile absorbent paper point will be inserted into the gingival crevice or pocket until
      resistance will be felt. The paper point will be held in place for 30 s and then will be
      transferred to a vial containing 100 μL of distilled water and vigorously will be mixed. The
      paper points will be removed, and the samples will be centrifuged and will be washed twice
      with distilled water. The resultant pellets will be resuspended in 0.4 mL of distilled water.
      The samples will be coded and stored at -70 °C until use for ELISA test for identification of
      Human beta Defensin-2.
