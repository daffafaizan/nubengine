      art pieces that represent their hallucinatory experiences. Patients with diagnoses of
      schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease will be invited to take part in participating National
      Health Service (NHS) clinics, to capture and compare a wide range of hallucinatory
      experiences. Patients will meet with artists on several occasions who will then develop the
      piece, which may be a painting, drawing, or other media that the artist and service-user
      jointly select.

      Completed artworks will be the centrepiece for an exhibition at United Kingdom (UK) science
      festivals and a digital (on-line) presentation. The exhibition will be accompanied by
      researchers explaining the brain science of hallucinations, recordings of patients and
      artists describing their experience with hallucinations and the process of developing the
      artworks, booklets cataloguing the exhibition, and art materials available for artistic
      expression of their own experiences. A digital compendium of the artworks and supporting
      material will be publicly available alongside the opportunity to complete an online survey
      exploring the themes of the artworks and collecting information on personal experiences. The
      objectives are to engage the public in an appreciation of the experience of hallucinations
      and their prevalence across many common mental health and neurodegenerative disorders, as
      well as an experience many people will share without ever being diagnosed. The exhibition
      will also encourage the public to share their own experiences through the online
      questionnaires creating a platform to begin to improve the understanding of the diversity of
      hallucination-like experiences in the general population.
