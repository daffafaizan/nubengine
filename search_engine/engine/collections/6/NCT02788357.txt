      medications, especially amphetamine, given with specific physical therapy may improve motor
      learning (and therefore recovery from stroke) more than physical therapy alone. However, the
      number of patients in clinical trials who have received physical therapy and amphetamine is
      very small, for two reasons: because amphetamine may interact with many other medications
      that stroke patients are already taking, and because its potential for addiction precludes
      its use on a daily basis. The investigators now wish to evaluate the effectiveness of a more
      selective medication, atomoxetine, known to have many fewer side effects and no potential for
      drug addiction. The proposed mechanism by which amphetamine enhances recovery is by
      increasing central levels of norepinephrine. While the investigators already know that this
      drug is more selective than amphetamine, the investigators would like to evaluate its effects
      on hand motor learning and motor recovery in chronic stroke patients in a clinical setting.
