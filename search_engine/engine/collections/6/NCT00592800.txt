      in adult medicine but, the value and importance of decision making in the care of children is
      not recognized. The major objection raised against allowing children to express their
      opinions concerning outcomes is that children do not understand probability.

      One way of assessing children's ability to understand probability is to test their
      mathematical knowledge using tests focused on probability and percentage.

      We have designed a set of questionnaires with 10 questions each, taken from the US Department
      of Education's National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). They are divided into 3
      different groups (4th, 8th, and 12th grade), based on grade-level. We have also obtained the
      average percentage of correct-incorrect answers given to these questions by students
      nationwide, and the scoring system used to assess the student's proficiency level.

      In this preliminary study we intend to present this set of 10 mathematical questions to
      children and to one of their parents.
