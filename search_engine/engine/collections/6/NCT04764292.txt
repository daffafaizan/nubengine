      (CEM) in screening for breast cancer. The overarching goal of the research program is to
      improve cancer detection on screening, particularly in women with dense breasts. MRI depicts
      more cancers than other screening methods, including ultrasound. MRI is proven to both
      improve cancer detection and reduce clinically detected cancers ("interval cancers") after a
      negative screening mammogram in women with dense breasts. PA Senate Bill 595, signed into law
      June 30, 2020, requires insurance carriers to provide coverage for supplemental screening
      with MRI or ultrasound for a variety of indications. Relative to the number of women who may
      benefit from screening MRI, there is a shortage of equipment/capacity. Further, nearly half
      of women cannot have an MRI for medical or other reasons, such as claustrophobia, implanted
      devices, body habitus, or cost (deductible and copay apply even with the new legislation).
      Contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM) appears to have similar performance to MRI but has not
      been widely validated, particularly for screening. In order to lay the foundation for
      improved screening of women with dense breasts, the investigators seek to offer screening CEM
      as an alternative to MRI for women who meet guidelines for screening MRI but are unable to
      have MRI.
