      endobronchial lung volume reduction in symptomatic patients with severe emphysema and absent
      collateral ventilation, on lung function, exercise capacity and physical activity. As a
      secondary objective, changes in physical activity as result of a 3 month activity coaching
      program delivered between 3 to 6 months post intervention will be investigated. Exploratory
      objectives are to extend insight in the clinical characteristics of responders and
      non-responders and to address relationships between lung function response, physical
      functioning and its impact on inflammation, skeletal and cardiac function. Furthermore,
      comparison of the effects on lung function, exercise capacity, quality of life and physical
      activity between endoscopic lung volume reduction and surgical lung volume reduction will be
      made.

      The study will also explore if treatment response can be optimised by an intermediate
      evaluation with CT scan one month after intervention. Endoscopic evaluation and repositioning
      of the endobronchial valves will be imposed in case no lober atelectasis is visualised.
