        -  Determine the antitumor activity of gemcitabine in patients with persistent or recurrent
           nonsquamous cell carcinoma of the cervix who failed higher priority treatment protocols.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes weekly for 3 weeks. Courses repeat every 4
      weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 15-37 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
