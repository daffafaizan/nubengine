      (KS)/congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (CHH).

      The study includes two parts:

        -  online survey (less than 30 minutes to complete)

        -  focus groups with KS/CHH patients

      The aim of this project is to better understand what health needs are not presently being met
      for these patients and to identify targets for improving the care of patients diagnosed with
      KS/CHH
