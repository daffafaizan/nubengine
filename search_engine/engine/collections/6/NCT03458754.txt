      level and intermittent claudication. The number of studies investigating maximal and
      submaximal exercise capacity and physical activity level in PAD is limited. There is also no
      study investigated pulmonary functions, respiratory muscle strength and endurance in this
      patient population. According to the sample size analysis 15 patients and 15 healthy
      individuals with similar demographic characteristics will be included the study. Patients and
      healthy individuals will be selected according to predetermined inclusion and exclusion
      criteria. The assessments will be completed in two days.Maximal exercise capacity will be
      assessed using cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET), functional exercise capacity using
      six minute stepper test, physical activity using multi-sensor activity monitor, pulmonary
      function using spirometry, respiratory muscle strength using mouth pressure device,
      peripheral muscle strength using hand held dynamometer, respiratory muscle endurance using
      incremental threshold loading test, depression using Beck depression inventory (Turkish
      version), life quality using SF-36 Health Survey (Turkish version), intermittent claudication
      using Walking Impairment Questionnaire (Turkish version)
