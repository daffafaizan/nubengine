      people who have diabetes. This study will look at glycemic control in people who take
      fasiglifam.

      The study will enroll approximately 400 patients. Participants will be randomly assigned (by
      chance) to one of the three treatment groups-which will remain undisclosed to the patient and
      study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need):

        -  Fasiglifam 25 mg twice a day

        -  Fasiglifam 50 mg once daily

        -  Placebo (dummy inactive pill) - this is a tablet that looks like the study drug but has
           no active ingredient.

      All participants will be asked to take one tablet twice each day throughout the study. All
      participants will be asked to record any time they have symptoms of hypoglycemia in a diary.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this
      study is 18 weeks. Participants will make 9 visits to the clinic.

      Due to potential concerns about liver safety, on balance, the benefits of treating patients
      with fasiglifam (TAK-875) do not outweigh the potential risks.

      For this reason, Takeda has decided voluntarily to terminate the development activities for
      fasiglifam.
