    
      This is an open-label (all people involved know the identity of the intervention),
      multi-center (conducted in more than 1 center) study, to evaluate the safety and
      effectiveness of doripenem in treating Thai participants with nosocomial pneumonia,
      complicated intra-abdominal and urinary tract infections. The study consists of 4 visits:
      Visit 1 (Baseline), Visit 2 (End-of-Treatment [EOT], up to Day 14), Visit 3 (Phone visit,
      Test-of-Cure [TOC], up to Day 14 after EOT) and Visit 4 (Phone visit, Day 90). Participants
      will receive 500 milligram (mg) of doripenem as intravenous infusion (directly into the vein)
      every 8 hours for at least 3 days after clinical response and extended up to 14 days.
      Efficacy will primarily be evaluated by determination of clinical response. Participants'
      safety will be monitored throughout the study.
