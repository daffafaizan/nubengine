      adverse effects for their own mental and physical health that may have long term consequences
      for their children's health and development. The mental health consequences of stress are
      pervasive in low income pregnant women and mothers with almost half screening positive for
      depressive symptoms and a quarter meeting diagnostic criteria for major or minor depression.
      While national home visiting models have demonstrated improvement in health, developmental,
      and parenting outcomes for women willing to participate, they have had less success in
      reducing depressive symptoms during pre and postnatal periods, and often programs struggle to
      engage women with unmet mental health needs.

      We conducted a community-based, multi-site, randomized, controlled trial that included
      longitudinal assessment on five occasions during pregnancy and infancy to determine temporal
      program effects. We used a CC comparison group because Medicaid insured women in Michigan are
      eligible for home visiting through enhanced prenatal and infant services, and our goal was to
      determine if there was any advantage to the team approach when compared to community
      implementation of the state-sponsored home visiting program.

      Pregnant women, who telephoned one of five public clinics in Kent County, Michigan, a county
      that includes urban (Grand Rapids) and rural areas, were contacted and invited to participate
      in the trial. We enrolled women considered harder to reach with cultural, language, and
      literacy barriers to participation and with chronic or current medical problems-populations
      traditionally served by state-sponsored programs. Participation was not dependent on women
      coming to a research or health facility, participating in prenatal or child health care or
      the enhanced services, having reliable transportation, consistent phone service, or stable
      housing.
