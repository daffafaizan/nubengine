      postpartum prevents a high proportion of vertical transmission. Potential means of decreasing
      HIV transmission through breastfeeding, along with the risks and benefits of early weaning,
      need to be further evaluated. The potential impact of early weaning interventions on the
      breastfeeding habits of the HIV uninfected population needs to be considered as well. This
      study seeks to identify a way to make breastfeeding safe for HIV infected women who choose to
      breastfeed.

      A single dose of NVP given to infants of HIV infected mothers appears to provide some
      protection against vertical transmission. NVP's long half-life allows simple dosing, making
      it more feasible and affordable to implement in a developing country. This study will
      determine whether extending the NVP dosing to six weeks will significantly decrease
      transmission during the first several months of breastfeeding.
