    
      The 2 main surgical approaches in total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) are the anterior approach
      (deltopectoral) and the lateral one (deltoid splitting) (18).

      Their advantages and drawbacks have not been clearly evaluated in proximal humerus fracture
      treated with an arthroplasty.

      The goal of the study is to compare the results between patients (older than 65yo) presenting
      a proximal humerus fracture treated with a reversed shoulder arthroplasty performed through
      an anterior approach or a lateral one.
