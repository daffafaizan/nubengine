      haemato-oncology department of the Children University Hospital of Toulouse. The feasibility
      will be considered as acceptable if 60% of patients hospitalized for oral mucositis had
      successfully benefit from the procedure. The secondary objectives are the evaluation of
      efficacy of LLLT on pain and mucositis grade, the evaluation of tolerance of this treatment
      and the medical time needed for this supportive care. The athermic phototherapy laser diode
      will be used by scanning the entire oral mucosa area. It will be applied uniformly every two
      days as long as grade of mucositis is 2 or more, with a fluence of 4J/cmÂ², under two
      wavelengths (635 nm and 815 nm).
