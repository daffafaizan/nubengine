    
      Vago-sympathetic activity, arterial stiffness and endothelial function are integrators of
      cardiovascular risk. The effect of controlling fasting or post-prandial blood glucose or both
      on these parameters has not been studied in type 2 diabetic patients.

      The aim of this pilot study is to compare the effects of improving fasting or post-prandial
      blood glucose glycemic control or both with 3 different insulin regimens for 4 to 5 weeks, on
      vago-sympathetic activity, arterial stiffness and endothelial function.

      Patients will be recruited in the department of Endocrinology-Diabetology-Nutrition of Jean
      VERDIER hospital, AP-HP, and the department of Endocrinology and Metabolism of AVICENNE
      hospital, BOBIGNY, AP-HP, France. After an half day of cardiovascular explorations, 42
      patients will be randomized in 3 groups determining their treatment for the following 4-5
      weeks : insulin therapy with detemir at dinner or bed time, or with aspart at each meal, or
      with both of them.

      Investigations will be performed in the morning 1) at the time of randomisation and 2) 4-5
      weeks after the beginning of insulin therapy. We will evaluate at fasting and each hour after
      a standardized breakfast biological and metabolic parameters, arterial stiffness, endothelial
      function and nervous autonomic system with non-invasive devices: Sphygmocor速, Finapres速,
      laser-doppler et Endopat2000速. Body composition will be evaluated with impedance maestri and
      BodPod速.
