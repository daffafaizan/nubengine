      behavioural intervention designed to treat and prevent the aforementioned condition. Up to
      date clinical research studies have shown that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)
      can be considered a reliable tool for chronic pain. It has been shown how tDCS is able to
      decrease the intensity and duration of pain modulating the activity of brain areas involved
      in the circuits that regulate pain, such as the thalamus, and facilitating the mechanisms
      inhibitors descendants of pain control. The aim of this study is to test the feasibility of
      combining tDCS with a behavioural intervention (i.e. BS) in subjects with chronic low back
      pain. Specifically, we will test their effects on low back pain intensity and participation
      of patients' in daily activities.
