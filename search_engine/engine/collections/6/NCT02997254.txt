      electrophysiology study (EPS) in patients undergoing ablation for atrial fibrillation. These
      electrograms will be recorded from a variety of clinically approved catheters under standard
      of care conditions, and will be analyzed to better understand the mechanisms for atrial
      fibrillation and its relationship to outcomes.

      The investigators anticipate analyzing data from 200 patients through December 2017.
