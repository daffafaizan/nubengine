      methotrexate, cisplatin, and doxorubicin). Following surgery, non-metastatic patients were
      randomized by blocks to complete 31 weeks of MAP or to receive 73 weeks of maintenance
      therapy following MAP; while metastatic patients received maintenance therapy in combination
      with MAP since the beginning of treatment.
