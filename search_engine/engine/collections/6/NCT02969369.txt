    
      This is a multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study evaluating the
      efficacy, safety, and tolerability of double-blind SEP-363856 flexibly dosed at 25, 50, or 75
      mg/day for 6 weeks followed by 12 weeks of open-label extension of SEP-363856 flexibly-dosed
      at 25, 50, or 75 mg/day in male and female subjects ≥ 55 years of age with a clinical
      diagnosis of PDP. The study will randomize approximately 36 subjects to 2 treatment groups in
      a 2:1 ratio (approximately 24 subjects to SEP-363856 and 12 to placebo). The study will
      consist of 4 periods: Screening/Washout Period (up to 14 days prior to Double-blind
      Treatment), Double-blind Treatment Period (6 weeks), Open-label SEP-363856 Treatment Period
      (12 weeks), and Follow-up Period (1 week after last dose) as shown in the following figure.
      All postBaseline clinic visits will have a window of ± 2 days relative to the date of the
      Baseline visit (Visit 3).

      Treatment with SEP-363856 in subjects with PDP will result in a significant reduction in the
      Scale for Assessment of Positive Symptoms - Parkinson's Disease (SAPS-PD) total score at Week
      6 when compared to placebo. Let μSEP and μPBO represent the mean changes from Baseline at
      Week 6 in SAPS-PD total score for the SEP-363856 and placebo arms, respectively. The
      following hypothesis will be tested to compare the mean change values between the SEP-363856
      group and placebo group at Week 6: H0: μSEP = μPBO versus H1: μSEP ≠ μPBO
