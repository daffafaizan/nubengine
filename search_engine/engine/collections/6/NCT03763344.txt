      Number 17-167) and all participants provided their informed written consent prior to
      participating in this study. In order to reduce the placebo effect, the participants were
      randomly divided into the experimental and control groups. Participants from both the
      experimental and control groups received a total of three neuropsychological assessments over
      a three month period (i.e. baseline, 7 weeks, 11 weeks). Considering that an essential
      methodological component of the training studies is the use of standardized
      neuropsychological tests, validated and reliable measures such as STROOP TEST, DIGIT SPAN
      BACKWARD TEST, TRAIL MAKING TEST, VERBAL FLUENCY TESTS, CALIFORNIA VERBAL LEARNING TEST
      Second Edition (i.e., standard and alternate forms), were used at different time points. Each
      assessment was 50-60 minutes in duration and was administered by an expert neuropsychology
      resident. The first assessment was administered at baseline . Then, the experimental group
      underwent seven weeks of perceptual cognitive training, while the control group completed
      seven weeks without formal training. The treatment for the PCT group consisted of 14 sessions
      of training each lasting 25-30 min, twice per week for seven weeks. After the seven-week time
      period, a second neuropsychological assessment was performed on both groups. After eleven
      weeks, a follow-up assessment was conducted to verify whether the benefits of cognitive
      training endure over time.
