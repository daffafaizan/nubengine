    
      APG-1387 is a potent, bivalent small-molecule IAP antagonist. This study is multi-center,
      single-agent, open-label, Phase I dose-escalation study of APG-1387.

      This study has a 4-dose-schedule which is escalated one by one after confirming safety in the
      previous lower dose schedule. A total of 60 subjects with Chronic Hepatitis B will be
      participated in the study. APG-1387 will be administrated via intravenous infusion, once a
      week for consecutive 4 weeks as one cycle.The start dose is 7mg. 3 patients' cohorts will be
      evaluated, the dose of APG-1387 will be increased in subsequent cohorts, to 12mg, 20 mg, 30
      mg, 45 mg accordingly. 3 patients in 7mg,12mg cohorts and 6 patients in 20mg, 30mg and 45mg
      cohorts will be recruited. If there is any one of the following event is observed within 28
      days of the first dose of APG-1387, the recruitment will be hold and a discussion on MTD dose
      level will happened.1 ≥1/2 patients experience ≥Grade 2 toxicities[CTCAE 4.0.3] related or
      possibly related with APG-1387 and with clinical manifestation. 2 ≥1/3 patients experience
      ≥Grade 3 toxicities[CTCAE 4.0.3] related or possibly related with APG-1387.3 any SAE related
      or possibly related with APG-1387. Expansion study will be designed to explore primary
      efficacy and safety after the dose escalation study. The expansion number and dosage will be
      decided according to the results of each cohort.(no more than 36 patients).
