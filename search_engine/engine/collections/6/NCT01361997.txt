      institutions and patients, as they represent a waste of resources, and additionally increases
      the patient's hospital stay. The principal source of contaminant is the bacteria in the skin
      flora, so the greatest way to improve the sensibility of this test is to do an optimal skin
      antisepsis. It has been reported that 2% chlorhexidine gluconate in 70% isopropyl alcohol is
      superior that other skin disinfectants, and that 70% isopropyl alcohol has a high efficacy
      reducing the presence of bacteria on the skin, so both antiseptics are good options for skin
      antisepsis.
