    
      Pancreatic fistula is the major determinant of outcome after pancreaticoduodenectomy. Several
      strategies to reduce the burden of this complication have been proposed in the last decade. A
      definite answer about what is the best technique to approach a high-risk pancreatic stump is
      still needed. Both pancreaticogastrostomy and pancreaticojejunostomy with transanastomotic
      externalized drains have been proposed in this setting, but often studies do not provide a
      reliable risk stratification and result are extremely variable.

      The aim of this trial is to evaluate what surgical technique, between pancreaticogastrostomy
      and pancreaticojejunostomy with transanastomotic externalized drains, is associated with the
      lowest rate of pancreatic fistula in case of high-risk pancreatic remnants. Risk
      stratification will be provided through the Fistula Risk Score, a clinical risk score that
      has been extensively validated.
