      reversible ischemia in the area supplied by the non-revascularizable vessel(s) will be
      evaluated for eligibility in this study. Eligible subjects will undergo standard
      pre-operative testing after admission to the hospital, and then will undergo liposuction
      under anesthesia, after which ADRCs will be isolated from the lipoaspirate. According to
      randomization subjects will receive either ADRCs or placebo.

      The outcomes of this trial will be based on assessment of primary and secondary endpoints at
      6 months post index procedure. Long Term Follow-up will be conducted at 12, 18, 24 and 36
      months after the procedure.
