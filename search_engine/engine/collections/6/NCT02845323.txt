    
      This is phase II clinical trial design randomizing patients who are cisplatin-ineligible or
      chemotherapy-refusing with MIBC (stages T2-T4, N0-N2, M0) to one of two treatment arms: Arm A
      - Nivolumab in combination with Urelumab or Arm B - Nivolumab monotherapy.

      The study population will include male and female patients over the age of 18 with muscle
      invasive urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (MIBC) who are not suitable for cisplatin-based
      chemotherapy or refuse chemotherapy, but are fit to undergo surgical resection of their
      cancer by cystectomy. Patients with resectable clinical node positive disease within the true
      pelvis are eligible.
