      hemostasis, inflammation, proliferation and maturation. Although the stages of wound healing
      are linear, wounds can progress backward or forward depending on internal and external
      patient conditions. The four stages of wound healing are:Hemostasis Phase Hemostasis is the
      process of the wound being closed by clotting. Hemostasis starts when blood leaks out of the
      body. Inflammatory Phase Inflammation is the second stage of wound healing and begins right
      after the injury when the injured blood vessels leak transudate (made of water, salt, and
      protein) causing localized swelling. Proliferative Phase The proliferative phase of wound
      healing is when the wound is rebuilt with new tissue made up of collagen and extracellular
      matrix. Maturation Phase Also called the remodeling stage of wound healing, the maturation
      phase is when collagen is remodeled from type III to type I and the wound fully closes.

      Fat Injection In Facial burn scar:The effects of the lipofilling can be seen starting from 3
      weeks after the procedure, in terms of better scar color, pliability, thickness, relief,
      itching, pain, scar vascularization and pigmentation. Indeed, autologous fat grafting makes
      the skin softer, more flexible and extensible; besides, the color seems similar to the
      surrounding unharmed skin.

      Platelet Rich Plasma In Facial burn scar: Impaired wound-healing and a long treatment course
      in severe burns as well as secondary complications originating from uncovered wounds motivate
      research to accelerate the wound-healing process and speed up re-epithelialization in burn
      patients.
