      had blood drawn into 3 different types of blood-collection tubes (ie, Plain, EDTA, and
      NaF-EDTA). These tubes were then processed in different ways (ie, different durations between
      phlebotomy and centrifugation, different holding temperatures [room temperature or on ice]
      between phlebotomy and centrifugation). After defined periods of incubation, the tubes were
      centrifuged and the serum/plasma transferred into vials and frozen. The testosterone and TU
      levels in the serum/plasma were then measured using validated liquid chromatography/tandem
      mass spectrometry assays.
