        -  To determine feasibility of generating a cellular vaccine composed of CD40-activated
           autologous ALL cells

        -  To determine feasibility of vaccine administration according to the proposed schedule

        -  To determine toxicity of vaccination with CD40-activated autologous ALL cells

      Secondary

        -  To assess ALL-specific immunity following vaccination

        -  To assess the generation of immunity to control antigens

        -  To develop preliminary information on effect vaccination on tumor response
