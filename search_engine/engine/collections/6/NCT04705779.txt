      death and disability from chronic cardiometabolic (CM) illnesses. Furthermore, AAW have
      inadequate engagement in exercise and are least successful at achieving and sustaining CM
      risk-reduction goals compared to all men and women of other racial/ethnic groups, despite
      participating in comprehensive lifestyle interventions. These alarming disparities are due in
      part to disproportionately high rates of psychological stress. A shortcoming of interventions
      with AAW is an inadequate focus on stress exposure, including gender and racialized stress,
      stress physiology, and stress-related barriers to healthy eating and exercise to reduce CM
      risk. In response, the HARMONY study is a randomized controlled trial to test a
      culturally-tailored nutrition and exercise intervention to manage stress, designed to help
      AAW build on their strengths to promote self-management and to reduce stress-related CM risk.
      Certain information about the interventions is not disclosed to protect the scientific
      integrity of the trial.
