      hospitalized patients of up to 30%. Lassa fever is often described as being characterized by
      vascular leak and shock in the terminal phase, but, whilst animal data supports this, there
      are limited data in humans. A further aim of this study therefore is to characterize
      cardiovascular function in patients with Lassa fever, with the ultimate goal of informing
      future trials of supportive or therapeutic strategies.

      Summary of ribavirin pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics sub-study Lassa fever carries a
      treated mortality in hospitalized patients of up to 30% in Nigeria. Ribavirin is the current
      standard of care. However, the efficacy of ribavirin has not been established in RCTs. There
      is very limited PK data on ribavirin in patients with Lassa fever and the optimal dose of
      ribavirin for an RCT is unknown. The aim of this study is to characterize the PK of ribavirin
      in Lassa fever, and identify any associations between ribavirin PK parameters and viral load
      and markers of inflammatory status.
