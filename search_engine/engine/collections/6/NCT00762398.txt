      being and the need for blood transfusion. In the perioperative period this measurement is
      further more critical mainly due to the acute nature of blood loss and the need for an
      immediate response. Currently, hemoglobin concentration is determined by analyzing a blood
      sample. It requires venipuncture or arterial puncture (via an arterial line). Besides the
      patient discomfort there are additional disadvantages such as infection, dealing with blood
      product, delay with diagnosis, low update rate and cost. Masimo Labs is in the process of
      developing a noninvasive monitor to detect hemoglobin concentrations in real time. The
      monitor uses a probe placed on the patient finger that gives hemoglobin concentration
      continuously and noninvasively. Masimo Labs is using a technology that resembles the well
      accepted and clinically proven pulse-oxymeter.

      The study will include surgical patients at the UCI Medical Center, preferably in cases that
      are known to involve major blood loss. For these cases, the anesthesia team places an
      arterial line for anesthesia purposes. The arterial line is used for continuous blood
      pressure measurements and blood draw for the assessment of several indices. We plan to
      compare the hemoglobin concentrations measured from blood samples to the Masimo Labs
      pulse-hemoglobin level readings.
