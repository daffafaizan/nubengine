      nutritional supplement will experience a greater gain in adverse anthropometric measures, and
      experience a decreased risk of relapse and death, compared with patients with tuberculosis,
      who do not receive nutritional supplement. 260 patients will be recruited from and
      included/randomized at 4 trial sites in Bissau, Guinea-Bissau (Bandim Health Center, Belem
      Health Center, Cuntum Health Center and Hospital Raoul Follereau). Patients randomized to the
      intervention arm will receive one package of whey protein concentrate (approx. 62.5g) per day
      for the duration of the 6-month long anti-tuberculous treatment. Patients will be followed
      bimonthly during the treatment period, with clinical examinations, blood sample analyses, and
      nutritional status and dietary intake assessments.
