      Hemoglobin A1C, and lipid profile. All labs will be drawn in the fasting state

      Visit 1: Subjects will arrive after having fasted overnight (10 hours) at 7 to 7:30 am. An
      indwelling intravenous cannula will be placed in the anterior cubital vein for blood draws. A
      blood sample of the research labs and a urine sample will be collected. Blood pressure, heart
      rate and weight will be measured. Subjects will consume either a High Fat High Calorie (HFHC)
      meal or HFHC meal plus fiber (FiberOne Original cereal) according to randomization. Fiber
      will be consumed before and after the HFHC meal (28 grams in total, 14 grams before and after
      the meal). HFHC meal includes an egg muffin sandwich, a sausage muffin sandwich and two hash
      browns which contain 88g carbohydrate, 51 g fat (33% saturated) and 34 g protein. 35 ml of
      blood will be obtained at 1h , 2h, 3h and 5 h and 5 ml at 15 min,30 min,45 min,75 min and 90
      min. A total of 165 ml (11 tablespoon) blood will be collected.

      . Visit 2: Subjects will return 1 week later after overnight fasting (10 hours) at 7 to 7:30
      am. Blood pressure, heart rate and weight will be measured. Baseline blood and urine samples
      will be collected again and subjects will be crossed over to receive the second meal (HFHC
      only or HFHC with fiber). Visit details are similar to visit 1. After this, the subject will
      be discharged from the study.
