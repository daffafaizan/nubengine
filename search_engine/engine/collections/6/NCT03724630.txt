      flat bones (eg,humerus, femur). These cysts tend to expand and weaken the local bone,but they
      are not true neoplasms. In 1876, Virchow1 first described these lesions as cystic structures
      caused by abnormalities in local circulation.

      UBCs are also known as simple or solitary bone cysts. They occur almost exclusively in
      children and adolescents (up to 85% of cases), with a reported peak between ages 3 and14
      years and the average age at diagnosis being 9 years.

      These lesions represent approximately 3% of all bone tumors and occur more commonly in boys
      than in girls (2:1). Several treatment options exist for unicameral bone cysts (UBCs),
      including observation, steroid injection, bone marrow injection, and Surgical procedures have
      ranged from simple curettage with autologous bone graft or allograft to sub periosteal
      resection with internal fixation and grafting

      .Treatment by multiple injection of steroids produce minimal surgical approach, no hospital
      stay, and very low morbidity. Three or four injections over a period of 12 month may be
      enough
