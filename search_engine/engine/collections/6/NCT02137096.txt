      transplantation in recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma has shown promise when compared with
      standard chemotherapy. This study has been designed to evaluate response rates and toxicities
      associated with undergoing high dose conditioning with Etoposide, Carboplatin and Ifosfamide
      followed by autologous stem cell transplantation support in the treatment of recurrent
      nasopharyngeal carcinoma in children, adolescents, and young adults.
