      reliable measurements of cardiovascular disease (CVD) burden using contemporary surrogate end
      points of coronary artery calcium (CAC) score, coronary CT angiography and carotid intima
      media thickness (CIMT). By the end of the 5-year funding cycle we will develop an updatable
      web-based cardiometabolic risk assessment tool (RISK) that will allow clinicians and SCI
      consumers to quantify risk for a cardiovascular sentinel event (stroke, non-fatal heart
      attack, or death) and will also provide a body mass index (BMI) table adjusted for SCI.

      Specific Aims:

        1. Examine the relationships among surrogates of cardiovascular disease burden in persons
           with SCI and established cardiometabolic risks.

        2. Identify significant predictors of cardiometabolic risk (CMR) that are unique to persons
           with specific levels of SCI.

        3. Develop and validate SCI CMR assessment tool (RISK) based on cardiometabolic risk
           scores.

        4. Develop and validate an adjusted BMI table for SCI.
