      adults, and is associated with an increased risk for falls, hospitalizations,
      institutionalization, and death. Exercise is the most widely recommended treatment for
      improving physical function among the frailty, but the optimal type or intensity of exercise
      is unknown. Walking is a preferred physical activity among older adults, however, there are
      no clear guidelines on the best intensity of walking to reduce frailty. The specific goal of
      this project is to compare a high intensity walking (HIW) intervention (70-80% of heart rate
      maximum) to a moderate intensity walking (MIW) intervention (50-60% of heart rate maximum)
      for pre-frail or frail older adults to determine the impact on frailty, mobility, balance,
      quality of life, and healthcare utilization.
