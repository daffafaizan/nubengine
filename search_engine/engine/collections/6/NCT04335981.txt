      to enroll a total of 24 subjects in the United States. A baseline screening will take place
      where all subjects who provide consent and meet the eligibility criteria following completion
      of radiotherapy will begin a 6 weeks regimen of in-home swallow exercises. They will then
      return to the clinic for final screening and randomization into one of two treatment groups:
      Flexitouch Plus Cellular Connectivity (FT-CC) and Swallow Exercises (Intervention) or Swallow
      Exercises alone (Standard Care). A total of 3 in-clinic visits and 1 phone call will be
      conducted over a 12-week period. The Standard Care group will be offered an optional 6 week
      follow-up period to use the device in-home and will be seen in the clinic for one additional
      follow-up Visit 2. A reading center with personnel blinded to treatment assignment will be
      used to interpret the MBS and PET study results.
