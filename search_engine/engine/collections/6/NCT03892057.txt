      positive psychology (PP) intervention is associated with greater improvements in blood
      pressure compared to an attention control condition. The pilot trial additionally evaluates
      the efficacy of the internet-based PP intervention with respect to psychological well-being,
      hypertension-related health behaviors, autonomic cardiac control, and high-sensitivity
      C-reactive protein. Serum blood assays will facilitate exploration of mechanistic indicators
      linking psychological well-being to cardiac functioning.
