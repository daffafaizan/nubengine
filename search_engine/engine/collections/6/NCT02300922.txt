    
      This study investigates a pretargeted radioimmunotherapy (pRAIT) with the
      anti-carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) TF2 bispecific monoclonal antibody (BsMAb) and the
      90Y-IMP288 radio-labeled peptide.

      TF2 will be given once a week for 3 successive weeks at 75 mg/m2 per dose. IMP288 will be
      given 3 times, 1 day after each TF2 injection. IMP288 will be radio-labeled with 111In
      (imaging) for the first injection and then 90Y (therapy) for the 2 subsequent injections.
