      response to difficult emotions and/or food cravings. In the R61 phase, the team will ensure
      this measure is appropriate for further testing and assess the impact of the MBI components
      on our hypothesized behavioral mechanisms in N=60 persons with T2DM. The study plans 3 waves
      of 20 persons each with 12 weekly sessions. All participants will attend an in-person group
      course providing education on basic behavioral strategies for diet and physical activity.
      Participants will be randomized to receive this education alone (Ed) or this same material
      with added MBI components (Ed+MBI). The team will also pilot test two levels of intensity of
      maintenance phase intervention (monthly group meetings alone or supplemented by
      individualized attention) to prepare them for R33 testing. the investigators plan an R33
      phase trial in which 120 persons with T2DM will be randomized (using a 1:2 ratio) to Ed or
      Ed+MBI conditions and followed for 12 months, including a 9-month maintenance phase. The
      study will test the robustness of the effect of MBI components on our proposed behavioral
      mechanisms, and on dietary adherence, as well as preliminary effect sizes on weight and
      glycemic control. The study will use an innovative adaptive intervention design to optimize
      maintenance phase intensity, which the investigators believe may be key to augment the MBI
      effects. The R33 phase will be registered and reported in a separate clinicaltrials.gov
      record.
