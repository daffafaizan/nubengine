      procedure. There has been a dramatic increase in obesity rates in the US with more than one
      third of US adults being obese (Body Mass Index (BMI) of > 30kg/m2). There is a direct link
      between obesity and wound complications following surgery with an increasing BMI leading to
      increasing rates of complications. Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) is a system that
      utilizes sub-atmospheric pressure to improve wound healing by increasing the formation of
      granulation tissue. NPWT has been shown to improve outcomes in both the orthopedic and
      cardiothoracic surgery populations. To date, there is no prospective study evaluating the
      application of prophylactic NPWT in laparotomy patients.

      This study will be a randomized clinical trial. Patients will be enrolled at the time of
      consent for laparotomy for suspected gynecologic malignancy. Participants will be randomized
      to one of two groups: 1) Standard closure group (control arm): closure of the fascia,
      subcutaneous tissue and skin per the surgeon's standard method; or 2) NPWT group (study arm):
      closure of the fascia, subcutaneous tissue and skin per the surgeon's standard method +
      placement of a negative pressure wound therapy device over the closed incision for 2-3 days,
      with removal of the device prior to hospital discharge. The rate of wound complications for
      two groups will be compared.
