    
      This is a prospective, randomized, single-blind, intra-patient controlled, multicenter trial
      with 50 subjects enrolled at up to 15 sites across the United States. Study subjects undergo
      implant placement on one side following in-office balloon dilation, while the contralateral
      side undergoes balloon dilation only and serves as a control.
