      long term sequelae, and in particular respiratory sequelae, have been described mainly in
      adults. Decrease in diffusing capacity, lung volume and exercise tolerance were observed.
      Lung function parameters improve during the follow-up until 6 month after discharge from the
      pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). After that, abnormalities in PFT are observed in a
      significant proportion of patients. Only two studies described long-term sequelae in children
      surviving to an ARDS and their results are conflicting. Two studies carried out in adults
      described the morphologic long-term sequelae by thoracic computed tomography. They showed
      reticular pattern with a striking anterior distribution in most patients evaluated more than
      6 months after discharge from the PICU. There is, to our knowledge, no study describing
      morphologic pulmonary sequelae by thoracic computed tomography in children surviving to ARDS.

      Respiratory assessment: respiratory sequelae in children surviving to the acute respiratory
      distress syndrome will be evaluated 1 year after discharge from the PICU. Assessment will
      include a clinical evaluation (respiratory history and physical examination), respiratory
      function tests and thoracic computed tomography
