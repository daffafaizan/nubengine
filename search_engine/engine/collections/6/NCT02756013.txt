      Intensity (RDI) and toxicity of weight-based dose dense weekly paclitaxel and carboplatin in
      overweight patients with a BSA > 2.0 compared to the Japanese Gynecologic Oncology Group
      trial (JGOG 2016) during 6 - 9 cycles of chemotherapy.

      Secondary Objective(s) The secondary objective is to evaluate progression-free survival in
      this patient population.

      Study Design This is a descriptive study to determine what the relative dose intensity of
      patients who are overweight with a BSA of greater than 2.0 can achieve.
