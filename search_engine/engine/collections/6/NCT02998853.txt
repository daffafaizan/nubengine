      validated versus Adenosine FFR(ADOFFR) by several studies (FAVOR, VIRTU-1) ; in particular
      post contrast QFR (cQFR) showed a very good correlation with ADOFFR. Furthermore ADOFFR in
      non culprit vessel in acute stage of STEMI correlates well with ADOFFR of the same non
      culprit lesion in staged procedure. Aim of the study is to find a valid correlation between
      cQFR in acute study and ADOFFR in the staged procedure. A positive result may lead to a fast,
      easy and cost effective acute functional non culprit lesions evaluation during acute
      procedure for STEMI patients, selecting those,if any, to be treated immediately or in a
      staged procedure.
