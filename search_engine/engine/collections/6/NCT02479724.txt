      pressure that is based on the pulse analysis of the peripheral arterial pressure pulse. The
      approach, referred to as the Pulse Decomposition Analysis (PDA) model, goes beyond
      traditional pulse analysis by invoking a physical model that comprehensively links the
      components of the peripheral pressure pulse envelope with two reflection sites in the central
      arteries.

      In these experiments, approved by the University of Virginia Institutional Review Board, the
      arterial blood pressures of patients (23 m/11 f, mean age: 44.05 y, SD: 13.9 y, mean height:
      173.3 cm, SD: 9.4 cm, mean weight: 95.3 kg, SD: 27.4 kg) hospitalized in University of
      Virginia Medical Intensive Care Units (MICUs) were monitored using radial intra-arterial
      catheters, while the CareTaker system collected pulse line shapes at the lower phalange of
      the thumb of the ipsilateral hand.

      Systolic and diastolic blood pressures continuously collected from the arterial catheter and
      CT were compared. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated between arterial catheter
      and CT blood pressure measurements and a Bland-Altman analysis was created. Results were
      within the limits established for the validation of automatic arterial pressure monitoring
      (AAMI/ANSI/ISO 81060-1:2013).
