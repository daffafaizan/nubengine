      with families whose children require surgical intervention in the near future. The area of
      clinician-patient communication with pediatric families is under-researched and highlights a
      pressing clinical problem. There are several adult studies that describe the content and
      nature of patient-physician communications at the time of cardiac surgery. However, there are
      no studies that evaluate the communications between nursing, physicians, and pediatric
      patient's families at the time of cardiac surgery. Further knowledge in this area is valuable
      in that a disparity between the these groups can lead to medical error, damage the
      clinician-patient relationship and provide grounds for dissatisfaction, complaints, or claim.
      This research will provide insight into what patient's families value in their communications
      with the medical team and assist the medical community in better meeting our children's
      families needs.
