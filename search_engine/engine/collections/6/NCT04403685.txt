    
      Coalition VI (TOCIBR√ÅS) is a prospective phase III randomized controlled trial that evaluates
      the efficacy and safety of Tocilizumab, an antibody anti-IL-6 receptor in patients with
      moderate to severe COVID-19 with increased inflammatory markers. This is a superiority
      open-label study with two arms. The control arm receives the best supportive care, and the
      experimental receives it plus tocilizumab. Randomization is done centrally by REDCap 1:1.
      Patients will be followed until Day 29 after randomization.
