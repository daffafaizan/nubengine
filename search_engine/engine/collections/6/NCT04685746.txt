        1. Developing and standardizing a sensitive and specific test protocol for the detection of
           vestibular, cognitive and/or motor dysfunctions in school-aged children.

        2. Investigate the relationship with and the involvement of the vestibular system in the
           motor and cognitive development of typically developing school-aged children.

        3. Investigating whether a vestibular dysfunction (with/without an additional auditory
           disease) has an impact on motor and/or cognitive performances in school-aged children.

        4. Investigating if in children with a known neurodevelopmental disorder an (additional)
           underlying vestibular dysfunction can be identified.
