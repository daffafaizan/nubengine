      second-line chemotherapy for NSCLC, with a prolongation of patient survival in phase III
      randomized trials comparing docetaxel with vinorelbine or ifosfamide, or with the best
      supportive care, for NSCLC patients who have failed previous chemotherapy; thus, it has been
      recommended for the second-line treatment of NSCLC. Four years after these trials, pemetrexed
      showed similar activity with less toxicity, when compared with docetaxel treatment in a phase
      III randomized trial of NSCLC patients previously treated with chemotherapy.

      Pemetrexed is a multitargeted antifolate which exhibits clinical activity in a variety of
      solid tumors, especially malignant mesothelioma and NSCLC. It inhibits thymidylate synthase,
      dihydrofolate reductase and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyl transferase. Pemetrexed has
      confirmed activity against previously chemotherapy-treated NSCLC and has a better toxicity
      profile than docetaxel, in which study docetaxel dosage used was 75 mg/m2 intravenous
      infusion (IV) every 3 weeks. However, docetaxel dosage used in Japan and Taiwan is usually 60
      mg/m2 every 3 weeks.

      Whether or not toxicity profiles of these two different drugs in same individual patients is
      similar to findings of patients who received specific drug only is unknown, so is unknown of
      toxicity profiles of docetaxel 60 mg/m2 every 3 weeks comparing alimta 500 mg/m2 every 3
      weeks. Present phase II randomized clinical trial is designed to answer these questions, with
      addition of information about whether or not sequential therapy can prolong disease-free and
      overall survival.
