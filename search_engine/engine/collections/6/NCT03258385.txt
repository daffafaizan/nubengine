      of B12-fortified milk on maternal and infant B12 status, immune function and child
      development. Pregnant women (n=148) will be randomized to receive B12-fortified milk (100
      Î¼g/day) or milk without fortification. The daily supplementation beginning at the baseline
      visit (GW 11-14) will continue until 6 mo-postpartum. Biomarkers of B12 status will be
      measured in mothers (GW 11-14 and 6-mo postpartum) and infants (3 and 6-mo). Infant
      development (6 and 12-mo) will be evaluated by Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler
      Development. Immune responses will be measured in infant at 3 and 6-mo. Data on socioeconomic
      status, dietary diversity, and anthropometric indices will be recorded at baseline.
      Additional tests in mothers include screening for H. pylori and plasma gastrin.
