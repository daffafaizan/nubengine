      with hepatitis C prior to the transplantation to reduce the complications associated with
      hepatitis C in the post-transplant setting.

      The study will be conducted at Kaiser Permanente Los Angeles Medical Center and City of Hope
      National Medical Center, Duarte, CA.

      There is no data available on the outcomes of treating hepatitis C with DAA's pre-HCT in
      candidates with hepatitis C infection. The ASBMT task force made recommendation to consider
      treating hepatitis C infection pre-HCT based on potential benefits it may be associated with.
      A single case report has documented benefit of treating a donor infected with hepatitis C
      prior to stem cell collection with DAA and ribavirin

      Subject Population will include autologous or allogeneic HCT candidates (for hematologic
      malignancy) who have hepatitis C infection. Subjects will be considered treatment-experienced
      if they have received prior interferon-based therapy. Treatment-experienced patients with
      prior use of DAA(s) are excluded from study participation.

      This study will treat HCV patients prior to HCT, with the goal of reducing early post HCT
      complications in the first 100 days post HCT followed by measuring outcomes at 2 years post
      HCT.

      Subjects will receive LDV 90mg/SOF 400mg FDC for 12 weeks.
