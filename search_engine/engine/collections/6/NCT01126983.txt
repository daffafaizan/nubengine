      migration during the trial period can alter the success of a trial. There is no one way of
      securing the leads to the skin.

      Our endeavor was to look at different modes of securing the leads to the skin during the
      trial period and present their respective lead migration rates. The three methods are

        1. suturing the leads using 2.0 mono-filament nylon to the skin,

        2. suture (2.0 mono-filament nylon)over the lead anchor(St.Jude Med Co. long, model # 1106)
           attaching them to the skin,

        3. non- suture.

      In all three groups copious amounts of benzoin and steri-strips will be used.

      Fluoroscopy pictures were taken after the leads were inserted and the level of the leads will
      be marked. After the trial period, before the leads were removed, an AP/lateral plain X-ray
      was taken and compared to the fluoroscopy pictures taken at the time of lead placement.
