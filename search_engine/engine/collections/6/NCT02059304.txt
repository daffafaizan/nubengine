      speculum; the cervix was exposed and gently cleaned with sterile gauze pads. Cervical mucus
      was gently removed with a syringe if abundant. A nurse concomitantly performed transabdominal
      ultrasound scan. Estimated cervical length is determined before transfer procedure. The Sure
      View Wallace Embryo Replacement Catheter (No. CE118; Smith Medical, Hythe, Kent, UK). There
      are marked lines on the surface of catheter that show distances to half centimeters. The
      catheter has a sliding guide fixed at external cervical os. Correct position of the catheter
      is replaced guide on external os, and guide's endpoint is on internal cervical os. In
      relation to the internal os was verified on the scan. If required, re-fixation of sliding
      guide to external os will also be performed. After loading embryos, the length between the
      guide and the end of catheter will be noted.

      Data collection protocol: We will obtain data on pregnancy outcome from the hospital
      computerized records or the records from family practitioners of the women. We will record
      birth weeks as major outcome. The obstetric records of all patients will be examined to
      determine whether any exclusion criteria are present.
