      reduced quality of life. The swallow function is a multidirectional process that depends on
      complex neuro-muscular network. The function can be evaluated using instrumental, such as
      fibreoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES), videofluoroscopy, or well structured
      questionnaires. There are many questionnaire and scales for assessment of dysphagia in PD but
      very few have been validated. The study will assess the construct validity and reliability of
      the Turkish version of Swallowing Disturbance Questionnaire. The investigators developed the
      Turkish version of this questionnaire (SDQ-T), according to the cross-cultural adaptation
      guidelines. Two translators translated the SDQ into Turkish and a native English language
      speaker reverse-translated it into English. The back translation was sent to the original
      author for proofreading. The SDQ questionnaire consisted of 15 basic questions related with
      dysphagia symptoms in PD patients.
