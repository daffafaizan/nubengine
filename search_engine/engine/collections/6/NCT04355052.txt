      hydroxychloroquine for 5 days plus camostat mesylate for 10 days, initiated in patients older
      than 60 years or younger but with risk factors for severe COVID 19 disease will reduce the
      risk of progression to severe COVID-19 disease compared to hydroxychloroquine plus
      azithromycin for 5 days or not treating with neither. Severe disease is defined as
      progression to invasive mechanical ventilation, reduced respiratory parameters (according to
      NEWS criteria) and 14 and 30-day mortality. This trial will enroll hospitalized consenting
      adults, who are age 18 or over, have a risk factor for severe disease, have no
      contraindication to treatment with hydroxychloroquine, can swallow pills, and who do not have
      severe underlying comorbidity where treatment is not likely to be beneficial to the patient.

      The primary outcome will be clinical state of the patient according to NEWS scoring on day 7.
      Secondary outcomes will be the proportion of participants requiring invasive mechanical
      ventilation, 14 and 30 -day mortality, and positive viral PCR at day 14.

      Randomization will be stratified by age and sex.
