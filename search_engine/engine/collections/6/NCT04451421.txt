      pressure.Background: Long-term bed rest in ICU patients leads to upward movement of diaphragm
      and increased intrathoracic pressure in mechanically ventilated patients, resulting in lower
      cross-lung pressure. If the end-expiratory cross-lung pressure is negative, lung tissue
      compression and atelectasis will occur.Standing can lower the diaphragm, improve the pressure
      across the lungs, and improve ventilation.Selection methods: patients with invasive
      mechanical ventilation in the ICU, on the premise of stable hemodynamics, with the aid of
      electric bed training in standing in different angles, start from 20 degrees, 5 degrees up
      every five minutes, the largest up to 80 degrees, each Angle across the pulmonary pressure,
      die cavity ratio, tidal volume and breathe out carbon dioxide at the end of the record, and
      record whether low blood pressure, an accident in the process of take off the tube and other
      adverse reactions.
