      down-regulates iNOS production. In an ongoing Pediatric Pharmacology Research Unit (PPRU)
      Network study, plasma IL-10 levels were higher in patients that developed significant
      toxicity, as compared to those with minimal hepatic transaminase elevations. In these
      patients IL-10 elevation is likely a compensatory response to hepatic injury. To further
      examine the relationship of IL-10 and iNOS in the APAP overdose patients, we will examine
      genetic variability in the promotor regions of iNOS and IL-10 in patients with APAP overdose.
      Data from the literature indicate the polymorphisms in the promotor regions of iNOS and IL-10
      influence the severity and expression of various diseases. In addition to genotyping for iNOS
      and IL10 promotor region polymorphisms, plasma levels of nitrotyrosine and IL-10 will be
      measured in overdose patients.

      Blood samples will be obtained from study patients for the analysis of inflammatory cytokines
      and nitrotyrosine. Blood samples will be obtained at the time of blood sampling for the
      routine clinical management of the APAP overdose patient. Patients who are hospitalized will
      have study blood samples drawn at the time daily blood samples are obtained. The sampling
      will continue daily until the patient is discharged. In addition to blood sampling the
      following data will be collected: age, gender, race, circumstances of the ingestion, dose of
      the ingestion, treatment for the ingestion, concomitant therapy, medical history and
      cigarette use.
