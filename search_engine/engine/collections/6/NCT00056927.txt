      smoking, and youth who first smoke cigarettes during childhood are at high risk for
      subsequent addiction to tobacco. Parents influence their children's perceptions of the
      prevalence of smoking, the acceptability of smoking, the accessibility of cigarettes, and the
      personal and social consequences of smoking. All parents, including parents who smoke, can
      engage in anti-smoking socialization, which may lower children's risk of smoking.

      Although there are some programs available that are directed at preventing initiation of
      smoking during childhood, none of these prevention programs engage parents who smoke in
      altering children's smoking-specific socialization. This study will evaluate a program to
      change smoking-specific socialization of children in households where parents smoke
      cigarettes.

      Consenting volunteers will be randomly assigned to either treatment (anti-smoking
      socialization program) or control groups. Parents in the treatment group will participate in
      the "Smoke-free Kids" program and receive activity magazines, newsletters, and support calls.
      Parents in the control group will receive a fact sheet about youth smoking. Parents involved
      in the study will be assessed through a telephone interview 1 month after completion of the
      three-month anti-smoking program. Assenting children will complete surveys administered at
      school at 12, 24, and 36 months after completion of the anti-smoking program. Primary and
      secondary dependent variables include initiation of cigarette smoking and susceptibility to
      cigarette smoking by children. The child survey will also assess risk and protective factors.
