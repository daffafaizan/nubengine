      can detect the effects of a known pain medicine at over-the-counter doses in people with
      osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee. The fMRI is a harmless and painless technique that is used
      in the current study to collect images of brain activity to see if is changed when feeling
      pain. In this study, BOLD response to mechanical stimulation via pressure stimuli applied to
      the tibio-femoral joint and patello-femoral in participants with knee OA following four
      treatment doses of any of three treatment will be compared.
