    
      PART I 23.10.2008- 31.12.2005 Creation of the Polish national registry of patients referred
      for cardiac transplantation and after heart transplantation - including urgency of
      qualification and prognosis.

      Main goal of the study is the risk stratification of patients with advanced heart failure
      referred for orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT) according to HFSS score, other risk
      factors and biological markers and verification of their prognostic value in Polish
      population.

      All patients with advanced heart failure referred as potential candidates for OHT in all
      active transplantation centers were included in the registry.

      PART II 1.01.2006 -30.11.2007 Since 2006 only patients which were definitely enlisted on the
      waiting list for heart transplantation were included in the registry

      Clinical and laboratory data were recorded in the internet based form. Clinical data included
      the etiology of the disease, NYHA class, duration of symptoms pharmacological therapy, left
      ventricular ejection fraction, Ergospirometric maximal oxygen uptake (V02 max) results and
      right heart catheterization results , ecg data of leading heart rhythm and QRS duration
      >=0,12 s and other were stored Sodium ,NTproBNP levels and hs CRP plasma levels were recorded
      during first 48 hours of hospitalization. All patients were followed in a prospective cohort
      study until the end point : death or OHT , observations were censored at the end of the
      study. The urgency of OHT and death data was recorded by information from participating
      centers and national death registry quarries.

      Primary end point : Death for all causes or urgent (UNOS 1) heart transplantation Secondary
      end point: Death without transplantation Death or heart transplantation

      Substudy POLKARD HF registry - genetic polymorphism substudy Study start date 01.04.2004 end
      30.10.2007

      Study population: All consecutive patients included into POLKARD HF registry, who agreed to
      participate and signed ICF related to the substudy.

      Estimated size 350 - 450 patients.

      Aims: To describe the potential impact of selected candidate genes polymorphisms on the heart
      failure prognosis and the survival of patients after orthotropic heart transplantation
