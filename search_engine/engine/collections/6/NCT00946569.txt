      that the participant receives), randomized (study medication is assigned by chance),
      placebo-controlled (an inactive substance is compared with a medication to test whether the
      medication has a real effect in a clinical study), parallel group (each group of participants
      will be treated at the same time), exploratory study (JNJ-39758979 is introduced in
      participants with asthma for the first time). This study consists of 4 phases: screening
      phase (4 weeks prior to the start of the run-in period), placebo run-in phase (2 weeks prior
      to the start of treatment phase), double-blind treatment phase (12 weeks), and posttreatment
      phase (5 weeks). Approximately 100 participants will be randomly allocated to 1 of 2
      treatment groups: Treatment A (participants will receive JNJ-39758979 once daily) and
      treatment B (participants will receive placebo once daily). Safety will be evaluated by
      assessment of adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, physical examination,
      and 12-lead electrocardiogram. Total study duration for each participant will be
      approximately 23 weeks.
