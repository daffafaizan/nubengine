      physical, psychological, social, and spiritual aspects of a patient's life. Music therapy is
      often used to help palliative care patients and there is some evidence that music therapy
      helps improve their quality of life, especially in relation to reducing levels of pain. Many
      palliative care patients and their families have also said that music therapy is helpful.
      However, more research is needed to help healthcare providers and funders decide if music
      therapy really is a useful treatment for patients receiving palliative care.
