    
      This is a randomized, open-label study designed to assess the safety and efficacy of AQUAVAN®
      Injection versus midazolam HCl following pretreatment with an analgesic, fentanyl citrate
      injection, in producing sedation in patients undergoing colonoscopy. Randomization will be
      stratified by site. Following completion of pre-procedure sedation assessments, patients will
      be randomly assigned to 1 of the 2 i.v. treatment groups at a 3:1 (AQUAVAN® Injection:
      midazolam HCl) allocation ratio. All study patients, irrespective of treatment group
      assignment, will receive fentanyl citrate injection as an analgesic pretreatment.
      Supplemental doses of fentanyl citrate injection may be administered if the patient reports
      pain or if inadequate analgesia is present as demonstrated by increased heart rate and/or
      blood pressure in the presence of adequate sedation. At no time should fentanyl citrate
      injection be administered to increase sedation levels. AQUAVAN® Injection and midazolam HCl
      will be administered to induce a state of adequate sedation, defined as a Modified Observer's
      Assessment of Alertness / Sedation (OAA/S) score of 4 or less. Supplemental doses will be
      administered to increase depth or duration of sedation. Supplemental doses will not be
      administered if the Modified OAA/S score is 2 or less or if there is no purposeful response
      to stimulation. The depth of sedation will be measured by the Modified OAA/S scale, a
      validated measure. Patient and Investigator assessments will be used to confirm the depth of
      sedation provided met the goals of sedation, reduction of anxiet, and reduced awareness.
