      to a reduced mucosal response compared to serum. We further hypothesized that this response
      would be further compromised with HIV co-infection[32] due to lack of local CD4 lymphocyte
      support and an altered alveolar milieu. We measured pneumococcal capsular specific
      immunoglobulin responses to 7-valent conjugate vaccine in both lung fluid and serum from
      healthy HIV infected and uninfected volunteers, together with flow cytometric assessment of
      the relative numbers and phenotypes of BAL T lymphocyte, B lymphocyte and macrophages.
