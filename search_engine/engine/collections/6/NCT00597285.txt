      temporal lobe epilepsy that may be associated with HHV-6B infection; 2) To attempt to detect
      evidence for persistent HHV6 infection in CSF in patients with refractory temporal lobe
      epilepsy. 3) to obtain preliminary pilot data on the ability of high resolution structural to
      detect abnormalities in epilepsy patients not seen with standard scanners.

      Study Population: 45 patients with localization-related epilepsy; 45 healthy volunteers

      Design: 1) imaging with a 7T MRI magnetic resonance scanner; 2) Lumbar puncture. 3) blood
      sampling

      Main outcome measure: 1) Detection of evidence for HHV6 infection in CSF
