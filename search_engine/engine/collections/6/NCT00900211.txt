        -  Determine early in the course of treatment which patients treated on clinical trial
           CRUK-VORTEX have an increased likelihood of distant metastases so as to highlight
           individuals who might benefit from early adjuvant systemic therapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Tumour and normal tissue samples will be taken at the time of surgery during treatment on
      clinical trial CRUK-VORTEXand preserved for future microarray analyses. Tissue microarrays
      will be produced from both tumor and normal tissues. Blood samples will be collected for
      future DNA analysis.
