    
      The study is a longitudinal interventional study, with a control group who have treatment for
      their trauma with no guidelines for psychological management, staff training, patient and
      family intervention/education. In the intervention group, who will have all of the above,
      participants will be stratified according to risk factors for PTSD and randomized 1:1 in "low
      risk" and "at risk" groups-those who will have a prolonged exposure intervention and those
      who will not.
