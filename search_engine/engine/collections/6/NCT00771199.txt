      more than one hospital or medical school team work on a medical research study), single-arm,
      non-randomized study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of low-dose TTS-fentanyl in Taiwan
      participants with cancer pain. Eligible participants will be enrolled and scheduled to return
      at Day 0, 7, 14 and 28. Participants will receive TTS-fentanyl for 28 days at a starting dose
      of 12 micrograms per hour (mcg/h) (one patch). Dose of fentanyl can increased or decreased as
      per Investigator's discretion to maintain participant's pain score at 2 or less on the Brief
      Pain Inventory (BPI) question 6 (that tells how much pain you have right now). Safety will
      primarily be evaluated by measuring participant's dropout rate due to adverse events.
      Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
