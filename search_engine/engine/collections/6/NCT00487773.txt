      noticed in children. iGCS are the basic group of drugs in asthma, because of inflammatory
      character of disease. All iGCS are absorbed to the systemic circulation (small amounts)
      despite of local exposition in lungs and possess systemic effects. The purpose of trial is to
      check if iGCS have influence on bone condition (if iGCS increases risk of osteoporosis and
      bone fraction) in children with asthma.
