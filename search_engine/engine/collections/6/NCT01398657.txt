    
      Subjects (N=182) who have high-risk prostate cancer and have undergone primary prostate
      cryotherapy will be screened and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either adjuvant ADT
      (Adj-ADT) or No-ADT until disease progression. Screening and randomization will be done
      within four weeks after cryoablation. Only those who are assigned to Adj-ADT will receive ADT
      for a total of 12 months. PSA will be checked every 3 months in the first year after Cryo and
      every 6 months thereafter. Long-term follow-up parameters include serum PSA and
      protocol-mandated biopsies (at 36 months after Cryo, irrespective of PSA levels if recurrence
      has not been documented). For-cause biopsy will also be done if post-Cryo PSA elevation
      reaches the Phoenix criteria (Nadir + 2 ng/ml) or when the treating physician thinks it
      necessary to document tumor recurrence.
