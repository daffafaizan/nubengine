      the safe delivery of radiotherapy treatments for lung cancer patients. 4DCBCT meets exacting
      tumour localisation requirements by allowing radiation therapists to measure the tumour as a
      patient breathes (4D=volumetric images plus respiratory induced tumour motion). Despite the
      success of 4DCBCT to date, it suffers from relatively poor image quality, very long scan
      times (4min) and higher imaging doses than are necessary. The primary reason for these
      problems is that although the purpose of 4DCBCT is to acquire information about tumour motion
      due to respiration, there is no feedback from the patients breathing signal to adapt and
      optimise the image acquisition process. This clinical trial is a phase 1 first in human's
      pilot study and the aim is therefore to prove feasibility of RMG-4DCBCT, not necessarily
      efficacy. As such, patient scans will be acquired across a broad range of patient breathing
      conditions to optimise the RMG-4DCBCT technique and also to plan a hypothesis driven clinical
      trial to follow.
