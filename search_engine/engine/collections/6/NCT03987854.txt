      disorder that significantly impairs quality of life and increases the risk of obesity and
      type 2 diabetes as well as hyperandrogenism, infertility, hyperlipidemia, and cardiovascular
      disease. Diet and lifestyle weight-loss interventions are recommended as the first-line
      treatment of PCOS, but experts disagree about which nutritional approach is best. A review of
      previous diet and lifestyle trials in PCOS did find a slight benefit of lower carbohydrate
      diets for weight loss, glucose control, insulin, and insulin resistance. This may be because
      carbohydrate intake leads to increased insulin secretion, which then stimulates ovarian
      androgen production and inhibits the release of fatty acids from cells, both of which worsen
      PCOS-related issues. Although lower carbohydrate diets may be helpful, research from other
      populations with or at risk of type 2 diabetes suggests that prior PCOS studies may have set
      insufficient carbohydrate reduction targets. The investigators propose that a very-low
      carbohydrate diet may be needed to especially benefit women with PCOS, as greater
      carbohydrate reduction should have a larger impact on androgen levels and weight loss. Thus,
      the goal of this proposal is to pilot test our existing very-low carbohydrate diet
      intervention, adapted for women with PCOS.
