      are selected for the study. As a routine computed tomography imaging/MRI with contrast will
      be done preoperatively.

      The involvement of the skin is assessed by the palpation (skin pinch test). In imaging, the
      distance between the base of the tumour and the skin of the cheek is measured. If the
      distance between the base of the tumour and the skin is more than 5mm, then the skin is
      spared and the tumour is excised with 5 mm margin, if the distance is less than 5mm, then the
      skin is excised along with the tumour. The specimen will be sent for histopathological
      examination, and the depth of invasion of the tumour is measured and the clearance of the
      deep surgical margin is assessed.

      The difference between clinical examination and imaging and histopathological confirmation of
      the specimen in determining the number of cases where skin preservation is done is assessed.
