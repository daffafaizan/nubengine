      Therapies are needed to delay the appearance of metastatic disease and need for androgen
      deprivation therapy (ADT), which has significant adverse side effects. Observational evidence
      suggests that weight loss may slow the rate of disease progression. The EMPOWER trial will
      use an enhanced version of a remote weight loss intervention shown to yield clinically
      significant weight loss to test whether weight loss reduces prostate cancer progression at 12
      months. EMPOWER has the potential to provide men with BCR a "first line therapy" to slow
      disease progression and delay the need for ADT. Importantly, this "treatment" is without
      significant side effects, and can improve overall health.
