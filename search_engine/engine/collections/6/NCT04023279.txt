      biceps on TENS in the variables pain intensity, hand prehensile strength and upper limb
      functionality of individuals with lateral epicondylalgia, compared to a group that received
      only TENS. This was done in a sample of 32 individuals, assigned in two groups: group A that
      received an application of TENS and group B that received an application of TENS plus
      myofascial release therapy.

      Contrary to the hypothesis, the application of myofascial release therapy added to the
      application of TENS proved to generate a significant change only in the prehensile hand force
      with respect to the group that received only TENS.
