    
      This study was aimed to investigate the relationship between upper extremity muscle function
      and shoulder position sense in patients with MS and which best projects the disability
      status.

      21 PwMS and 20 healthy volunteers with matching ages and genders were included the study. A
      neurologic examination was performed using the EDSS by a neurologist.

      Upper extremity function was evaluated with 9-Hole Peg Test (9-HPT). Shoulder position sense
      was evaluated with Dualer IQTM digital inclinometer (J-TECH medical, Salt Lake City, UK,
      USA).
