      I. To evaluate the efficacy of BAY 43-0006 in previously-treated, platinum-sensitive and
      platinum-refractory patients with measurable disease and extensive stage small cell lung
      cancer (E-SCLC) in terms of response rate (confirmed and unconfirmed, complete and partial).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the qualitative and quantitative toxicities of BAY 43-9006 in this patient
      population.

      II. To assess overall survival in this group of patients treated with BAY 43-9006.

      III. To collect specimens via the Lung Cancer Specimen Repository Protocol (S9925) in order
      to perform exploratory analyses of the relationship between selected markers and patient
      outcomes.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to platinum
      sensitivity status (platinum sensitive vs platinum refractory).

      Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for up to 2 years
      from study entry.
