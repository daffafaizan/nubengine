      incidence and mortality. Recurrence of HCC is still a great challenge and threat to the
      patients after resection surgery. Anlotinib is a new, orally administered tyrosine kinase
      inhibitor that targets vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), fibroblast growth
      factor receptor (FGFR), platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFR), and c-kit. HCC
      patients who meet the eligibility criteria of this clinical trial will be administrated
      Anlotinib 12mg QD PO d1-14, 21 days per cycle. The disease free survival (DFS), overall
      survival (OS) and any adverse effect during the 8 cycles of Anlotinib treatment will be
      evaluated in order to assess the primary effects and safety of Anlotinib in HCC patients at
      high risk of post surgery recurrence.
