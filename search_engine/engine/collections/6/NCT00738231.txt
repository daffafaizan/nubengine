      Effective control of cardiovascular diseases necessitates a salutogenetic approach to develop
      efficient and economical methods to decrease risk factors.

      Methods:

      This study was conducted in three stages in a semi-rural region of Eskisehir, Turkey. In the
      first stage, individuals selected by random sampling were evaluated in terms of
      social-demographic characteristics and the risk factors present for cardiovascular diseases.
      A scale comprised of 19 questions was implemented for data assessment. In the second stage,
      training materials were randomly distributed. Group I's training material consisted of a
      brochure containing pictures and general information on heart disease; Group II members
      additionally received a personalized letter that further explained their individual risk
      factors and suggested measures for increased protection and prevention - in short, Group II's
      training material was formatted as a prescription. In the third stage, the subjects were
      screen against the cardiovascular risks factors one year later to assess and determine if
      there had been any changes in their attitudes towards the dangers of the cardiovascular
      diseases.
