      the same dosage of the study drug. Following baseline testing, subjects will undergo
      treatment during a 24 week treatment period and will receive six subcutaneous injections
      total, one injection every 4 weeks. A 24-week follow-up period after the treatment period
      will be concluded with patient interview. Behavioral questionnaires will be administered
      throughout the duration of the trial. fMRI will be conducted at baseline and at the
      conclusion of the treatment period. Blood will be drawn for serum testing at baseline, at
      Week 12 during the treatment period, and at the conclusion of the treatment period. Vitals
      and CGI will also be assessed throughout the trial.
