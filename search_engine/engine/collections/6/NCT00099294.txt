    
      TH-CR-302 is a randomized Phase 3 study that will evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      glufosfamide plus best supportive care (BSC) compared to BSC alone for second line treatment
      of metastatic pancreatic cancer. BSC includes all medical or surgical interventions that a
      pancreatic cancer patient should receive to palliate the cancer but excludes treatment with
      systemic therapies intended to kill the cancer cells.

      Study Hypothesis: Glufosfamide will provide benefits in survival to patients with metastatic
      pancreatic cancer over best supportive care.

      Comparison: Glufosfamide versus best supportive care.
