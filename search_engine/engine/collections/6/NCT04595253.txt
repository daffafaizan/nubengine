      lobe. One US national survey reported that 80% of patients undergoing pulmonary surgery
      experienced acute pain. 75-86% of these patients pointed out that experienced moderate,
      severe, or extreme pain, especially, on the 1st day after thoracoscopic surgery. However,
      inappropriate pain management after surgery is associated with limited the healing process,
      increased workload of heart, prolonged pulmonary rehabilitation, and increased medical costs,
      and can be a prediction of developing chronic pain. Acupressure is a nonpharmacological
      treatment for the management of postoperative pain. Recent studies have found that the
      application of acupressure is effective in decreasing operative pain intensity, morphine
      related side effects, and opioid consumptions after surgery. However, there was no further
      research about the role of acupressure applied to thoracoscopic surgery.
