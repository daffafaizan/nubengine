      erythema (redness) and variable levels of skin damage. Patients generally present with
      malaise, pain and if a lower limb is affected they have difficulty mobilising and weight
      bearing. Patients within this organisation are often referred to the tissue viability service
      only after significant skin damage has occurred (even thought they are receiving appropriate
      antibiotic therapy). At this point they will be offered an established plan of care that
      includes compression therapy if it can be tolerated however at present less than 50% of those
      being admitted are referred.

      Despite compression therapy being well proven in oedema management there is no data available
      to support or reject the early application in lower limb cellulitis. There is also a lack of
      information about the impact of early intervention in quality of life for patients in this
      specific group.

      This study has been developed in order to determine the feasibility of being able to
      undertake a wider trial which would evaluate the outcomes of patients with acute lower limb
      cellulitis treated with compression therapy versus standard care.

      The objectives of the study would be to test the procedures and data collection tools being
      considered for use in a wider study. This would include collection of quality outcome
      questionnaires, limb circumference measurements and photography as well as recruitment of
      participants, the follow up processes and participant attrition. Secondary objectives would
      be linked to quality of life outcome measures and would determine oedema reduction (and its
      impact on quality of life), the average number of beddays compared to a historical cohort and
      to determine recurrence within the study period.
