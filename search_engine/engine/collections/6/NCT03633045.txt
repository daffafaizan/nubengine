      relapsed/refractory setting. There is a discrepancy in reported ibrutinib toxicity profile,
      efficacy and tolerability between registrational clinical trials and observational studies,
      which to some extent may be explained by patient selection in the former. IB-RU-SCOPE is a
      first "routine-clinical practice" oriented cohort observational study of ibrutinib in CLL in
      Russia. The study is designed to include all previously untreated and relapsed/refractory CLL
      patients older than 18 years with active disease, who have recently started or are about to
      start ibrutinib (both as monotherapy and in combination), and to follow them to a minimum of
      18 and a maximum of 36 months. The study is being conducted in approx. 10 Russian
      hematological centers and aims to include approx. 70 CLL patients.
