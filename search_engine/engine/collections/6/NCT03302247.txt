    
      Primary Objective

      â€¢ The primary objective of this proposal is to evaluate gemcitabine as a method of MDSC
      depletion.

      Secondary Objectives

        -  Evaluate whether these measures result in enhanced T-cell activity and/or NK cell
           function and number.

        -  Determine the tolerability and clinical activity (including response rate and survival)
           of this approach.

        -  Correlate MDSC number with tumor PD-L1 expression
