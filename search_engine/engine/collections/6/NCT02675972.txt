      stroke are included into the study. During the first 24 hours after admission, the 24 hours
      blood pressure monitoring is to be taken and used to calculate various parameters of
      hour-to-hour blood pressure variability, including standard deviation(SD), coefficient of
      variation (CV), variation independent of mean(VIM) and average real variability (ARV) of
      systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). The demographic and
      clinical data are also recorded. This is an observational sturdy, thus the caring physician
      make clinical decisions according to individual patient's condition. The endpoints are
      defined as early neurological deterioration, functional outcome(modified Rankin scale<3 as
      good outcome) at discharge and 3 months.
