      Philadelphia Chromosome Positive (Ph+) patients have been registered. All patients will be
      treated and/or followed for up to approximately 3 years (144 weeks) after registration of the
      last patient or until study termination. Patients who discontinue study therapy early due to
      disease progression or intolerance to study medication will continue to be followed yearly
      for survival for up to approximately 3 years (144 weeks) after registration of the last
      patient or until study termination.
