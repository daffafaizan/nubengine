    
      MER® stent will be implanted in eligible patients with common and internal carotid stenosis
      after an informed consent.

      Potential benefit of the MER® stent implantation will be evaluated based on angiography and
      duplex Doppler ultrasound examination.

      Follow ups are scheduled at 30 days, 6 and 12 months after index procedure. Except for
      clinical follow up patients will undergo carotid vessels ultrasound examination after 6 and
      12 months. In case of an emergency visit, caused by the Serious Adverse Event, Patient will
      undergo: neurological and cardiac evaluation as well as carotid vessels USG examination and
      extended CT or MRI scans.

      In general, all procedures in the study will follow the local standard of care. The type of
      devices used during the angioplasty (including the MER® stents) will not differ from the
      devices used in the usual clinical practice in the hospital. DAPT and other medical therapy
      will be consistent with the rules of the Polish and European Society of Cardiology.
