    
      About 30% of epidural catheters are reported to have hypo or hyper functioning behaviour.
      This has and impact on postoperative pain control and can affect also surgical and global
      outcome since it is known that a malfunctional catheter carries an increased complication's
      rate.

      Our hypothesis is that rx-guided positioning can reduce the incidence of catheter malfunction
      afrom 30 to 15 %.
