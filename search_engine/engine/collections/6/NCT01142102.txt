    
      This is a single-arm multicentre feasibility trial in which the primary aim is to determine
      the compliance rate of patients to online adaptive radiotherapy for muscle invasive bladder
      cancer over multiple Australian and New Zealand centres. The compliance rate is defined as
      the proportion of patients successfully completing treatment without a major protocol
      deviation.

      Subject to the accrual being at least 40 patients in the first 2 years, accrual will continue
      until a total of 50 patients have been accrued. If this accrual target is not met, then
      consideration will be given to stopping the trial early due to poor accrual. Each patient
      will be followed-up until 2 years after the last patient's date of accrual. Assessments for
      toxicity and recurrence or progression will take place at four weeks after completion of
      treatment, then three monthly from the end of treatment for the first 12 months and then 6
      monthly thereafter.
