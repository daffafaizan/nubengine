    
      For both studies, sedentary men between 30 and 65 years of age, with a BMI between 25 and 30,
      without cardiovascular disorders, will be selected.

      Randomised crossover dietary intervention study:

      Sixty volunteers will be randomised into 2 groups of 30. The study will last 12weeks. The
      first 3 weeks will be an adaptation period or "run in". Volunteers will have every day20 g of
      the reference rapeseed oil and 20 g of the reference oil-based rapeseed margarine.
      Subsequently, the two groups will follow 2 dietary intervention periods of 3 weeks during
      which the volunteers will have alternatively either the reference oil/margarine or the
      optimized oil/margarine. Three weeks of "wash out" will separate the two dietary
      interventions of the cross over design trial.

      Cardiovascular risk and oxidative stress biomarkers will be assessed in plasma at week 0, 3,
      6, 9 and 12.

      Volunteers will alsoperform dietary surveys at the week 3, 6, 9 and 12.

      Post prandial study:

      16 volunteers will be cast lots among the 60 volunteers. They will be randomised into 2
      groups of 8. The first kinetic study will be done on week 3. 8 subjects will take 66 g of
      reference oil and 8 subjects will take 66 g of the optimized oil. 5 blood samples (20 mL
      each) will be taken.
