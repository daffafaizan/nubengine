      Up to 20% of cancer patients suffer from venous thromboembolism (VTE) induced by the
      underlying malignancy itself. Oncologic gastrointestinal surgery is a well-known risk factor
      for VTE. About 4-6% of patients undergoing elective hepatobiliopanreatic surgery develop a
      deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism. However, there are no data referring to
      the incidence of DVT shortly ahead of the surgical event, implementing that a certain
      percentage of postoperative DVT might have already been acquired before the operation.
      Furthermore, most studies only evaluate the rate of symptomatic VTE. In this study, all
      patients undergoing hepatobiliopancreatic surgery will be screened for deep venous thrombosis
      the day before surgery, on the third postoperative day (primary endpoint) and 90 days after
      the operation with a 2-point compression sonography of the lower extremities. The development
      of a symptomatic VTE (DVT or pulmonary embolism) will be recorded as secondary endpoint. Risk
      factors, perioperative morbidity / mortality and presence of circulating tumor cells will be
      analyzed with regard to VTE incidence.
