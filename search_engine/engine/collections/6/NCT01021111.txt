      active training feedback device to reduce the risk of ACL injury among healthy subjects by
      inducing patterns of movement that alter the known kinematic and kinetic risk factors
      associated with ACL injuries. 2) To evaluate the efficacy of the active device and determine
      if the device reduces the risk of ACL injury among healthy subjects by effectively inducing
      patterns of movement that alter the known kinematic and kinetic risk factors associated with
      ACL injuries.
