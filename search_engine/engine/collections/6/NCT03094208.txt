      lower limb loss report the need to concentration on gait. People with lower limb loss may
      need to use cognitive resources to monitor and control movements of the prosthetic limb. The
      need to concentrate on walking may be greater for those with transfemoral amputation. For
      examine the use of cognitive resources, dual task paradigm may use. Dual task rehabilitative
      training used in many patients like stroke, Multipl sclerosis osteoporosis. But there is no
      study about dual task training on amputation. The purpose of this randomized controlled study
      is to investigate the effects of dual-task balance training on balance and gait of patients
      with transfemoral amputation as compared with single-task balance training. We hypothesized
      that dual-task balance training would improve the balance and gait, it would be more
      effective than single-task balance training.
