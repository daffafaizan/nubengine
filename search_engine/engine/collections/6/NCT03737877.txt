      symptoms, including problematic behaviour and sleep. Research suggests dietary manipulations
      may be a helpful treatment option for children with ADHD, although the most effective are
      highly restrictive, with little known about why they might work. Optimising gut bacteria in
      individuals with ADHD may help alleviate some of the symptoms of this condition via the
      gut-brain-axis and would provide a plausible mechanism by which dietary interventions
      operate. We propose to conduct a feasibility pilot study of a dietary intervention designed
      to optimise gut bacteria in children diagnosed with ADHD.
