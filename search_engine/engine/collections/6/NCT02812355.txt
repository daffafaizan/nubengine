      coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). OPCAB determines a pro-coagulant state potentially
      deleterious on grafts patency, that is not counterbalanced by the adverse effects of
      cardiopulmonary bypass on coagulation occurring in CABG, and that lasts as long as one month.
      Therefore in OPCAB systemic heparinization is necessary to prevent thrombotic complications
      during transitory occlusion of coronary arteries and grafts. An internationally accepted
      standard intra-operative anticoagulation protocol for OPCAB has not yet been defined, and
      heparinization in OPCAB is a highly variable practice. The intraoperative anticoagulation
      regimen adopted in patients undergoing OPCAB may influence major postoperative outcomes, such
      as bleeding, transfusion requirements, inflammatory response, myocardial ischemia and grafts
      patency, but it has never been the object of large-scale randomized controlled trial (RCT).
      The 2 most widespread intraoperative anticoagulation protocols in OPCAB are represented by
      full (300 U/kg) or half (150 U/kg) heparinization, with target ACT ranging from 200 sec to
      >480 sec.

      Patients enrolled in the study will be randomized to receive full or half heparinization in a
      1:1 ratio using a randomization schedule blocked by site. Randomization will take place in
      the operatory room by the anesthesiologist, and will be blinded to the surgeon.
