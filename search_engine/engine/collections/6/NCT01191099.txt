    
      1. To perform a large scale assessment of tissue hypoxia by pimonidazole and hypoxia marker
           gene expression in human prostate cancers

        2. To characterize expression and hypoxia/HIF-responsiveness of myoglobin, cytoglobin,
           Î±-hemoglobin in prostate tumors and cell lines

        3. To identify uni- and multivariate associations between marker gene expression and
           clinico-pathological parameters for the detection of robust and novel prognostic tools
           in prostate cancers
