urinary excretion of neutral 17-ketosteroids and pregnanediol bypatients with prostatic cancer and benign prostatic hypertrophy .urinary neutral 17-ketosteroid fractions and pregnanediol excreted by21 patients with prostatic cancer, 17 patients with benign hypertrophy,and 59 clinically well subjects were assayed to determine whetherdifferences exist .patients with prostatic cancer and those with benign hypertrophyexcreted significantly less androsterone than the clinically wellsubjects . a disproportionately lower level of androsterone thanetiocholanolone resulted in a significantly lowerandrosterone/etiocholanolone ratio in both groups .the specificity of the findings is discussed . the lower levels ofandrosterone excreted by patients with benign hypertrophy wereassociated with an extended period of hospitalization . patientshospitalized less than 5 days excreted androsterone at levels notsignificantly different from the clinically well subjects .lower levels of androsterone excreted by patients with prostaticcancer were not explained by the presence of metastasis, the duration ofhospitalization, loss of appetite, or other definable differences, wheneach was considered singly . the possible interrelationships of clinicaldifferences prevent assigning lower excretion levels to the cancer statealone .
