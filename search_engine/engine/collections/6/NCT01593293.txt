      doublets consisting of cisplatin or carboplatin and another cytotoxic agent demonstrate a
      survival advantage compared with single agents generally, evidence of treatment efficacy for
      patients with diminished performance status (PS) or with age older than 70 years is limited.
      Guidelines from the US and Europe have preferred single-agent chemotherapy for the elderly
      and PS 2 patients. However, increasing studies are exploring this issue and presenting data
      that favour doublet therapy. The addition of carboplatin to paclitaxel and cisplatin to
      docetaxel have shown evidence that patients over 70 benefit more in face of increased
      toxicities.

      This study is designed to be multi-center, open-label, prospective, randomized, two-arm,
      parallel, phase III trial of elderly patients(â‰¥70 years old) with metastatic non-squamous
      NSCLC (Stage IV by AJCC 7th) who have not received prior systemic chemotherapy or biological
      therapy. Approximately 266 patients will be enrolled into the trial. This study compares the
      doublet therapy of pemetrexed (500 mg/m2) and carboplatin (AUC 5 mg/mL*min) administered
      intravenously every 21 days for 4 cycles followed by pemetrexed (500 mg/m2) every 21 days for
      maintenance therapy (Arm A) to single therapy of pemetrexed (500 mg/m2) every 21 days till
      progression or unacceptable toxicity (Arm B). Pemetrexed will be administered with vitamin
      B12 and folate supplements.
