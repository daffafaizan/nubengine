      SMGC for monitoring the glycemic control among women with GDM is limited. This study was
      designed to evaluate the efficacy of two different schemes of SMGC in GDM Mexican population,
      it is an open-label randomized clinical trial including 2 groups: group 1 (SMGC 4 times/day)
      measured in fasting and 1 hour postprandial of breakfast, lunch and dinner; group 2 (SMGC 2
      times/day), measured preprandial and 1 hour postprandial, of breakfast, lunch or dinner,
      alternating the meal each day, from GDM diagnosis until the resolution of pregnancy.
      Additionally, determinations of insulin, lipids and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) will be
      determinate at enrollment, and between the 30-32 and 36-38 of gestation week. The primary
      outcome: To compare the proportion of women who achieve glycemic control using SMGC 4
      times/day versus SMGC 2 times/day.

      Secondary outcome: To compare the risk of new-born large for gestational age, gestational
      hypertension, preeclampsia, preterm birth, cesarean section, new-born weight, neonatal
      hypoglycemia, neonatal hyperbilirubinemia and entry to neonatal intensive care between
      groups. An analysis for intention of treatment will be made according to the recommendations
      of the CONSORT guidelines.
