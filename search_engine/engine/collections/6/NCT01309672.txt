      Primary

        -  To assess the rate of achieving a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) of â‰¤ 0.2 ng/mL with
           abiraterone acetate therapy in men with metastatic prostate cancer with a sub-optimal
           response to androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT).

      Secondary

        -  To assess the overall survival and objective progression-free survival of this group of
           patients.

        -  To assess PSA partial response.

        -  To evaluate the qualitative and quantitative toxicity of abiraterone acetate.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive abiraterone acetate orally daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients receive androgen blockade with GNRH agonist (goserelin acetate or leuprolide
      acetate) or a GNRH antagonist (degarelix) per the treating physician and this will be given
      continuously until evidence of disease progression. Bilateral surgical orchiectomy is also
      acceptable.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year and
      then every 6 months for up to 3 years.
