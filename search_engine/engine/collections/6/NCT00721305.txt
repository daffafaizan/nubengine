      levels, and allows an increase in the CD4 T-cell count that leads to a diminution in the
      incidence of opportunistic infections and mortality, the cost and complexity of HAART
      regimens, the growing list of long-term side effects, and the eventual development of
      resistance have underscored the immediate need for additional therapeutic approaches. Statins
      exert pleiotropic effects through a variety of mechanisms, among which there are several
      immunological effects that are related and unrelated to their cholesterol-lowering activity.
      HIV-1 requires cholesterol and lipid rafts for several key stages of its replication cycle;
      statins-mediated depletion of cholesterol alters the capacity of a cell to form lipid rafts
      and decreases the HIV-1 infectivity. On the other hand, statins may exert significant
      modulator effects in the balance of the cytokine network, and alter the activity of Rho
      GTPases and LFA-1 and ICAM-1 adhesion molecules. Preliminary studies showed that statins
      (Lovastatin) had anti HIV-1 activity, and that its administration was safe and efficient to
      control HIV-1 infection in chronically infected individuals who did not receive HAART (in
      terms of decreasing viral load and increasing CD4 T-cell count). Because very limited
      clinical data are available on this topic, this study will be conducted.
