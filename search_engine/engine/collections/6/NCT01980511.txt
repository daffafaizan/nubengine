      to enroll 100 patients with additional cognitive testing, MRI sequences and a preoperative
      MRI scan.

      At Hamilton Juravinski Hospital, Hamilton General Hospital, Auckland City Hospital and Prince
      of Wales Hospital a planned sub study of NeuroVISION (PAFS - Perioperative Atrial
      Fibrillation and Postoperative Stroke) is being conducted aiming to enroll 400 participants.
      The purpose of this sub-study is to determine the prevalence of AF(Atrial Fibrillation)
      before surgery (i.e. "background" AF), as well of the incidence of AF after surgery using the
      Icentia CardioSTAT "patch-like" single lead heart rhythm monitor.
