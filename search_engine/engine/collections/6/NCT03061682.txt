      study was approved by Rabin medical center IRB.

      Patients will be examined for best corrected visual acuity prior to the surgery at 6 meter
      and for reading at 40 and 15 cm. Improvement of the reading ability at 15 cm compared to 40
      cm will predict the potential for vision improvement with the add on lens.

      Before the surgery patients will have a full ophthalmological examination. Patients will have
      axial length and keratometry examination using the biometry. The lens will be implanted in
      surgery through a 2.2 mm clear cornea and will be injected and positioned in the sulcus.

      Patients will be followed up at 1 day, 1 week, 4 weeks, 4 and 6 months following surgery.
      During follow up patients will undergo full ophthalmic exam and well as visual acuity both
      for distance and near.
