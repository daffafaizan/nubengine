      influences mortality. China has 100 million Hepatitis B virus (HBV) carriers and Chronic HBV
      infection is well-recognized risk factor for cirrhosis.But little is known about the
      prevalence of HPS in cirrhosis patients caused by HBV in western China. The aim of this study
      was to investigate the HPS incidence, and the signs, symptoms, arterial blood gas, and BMP9
