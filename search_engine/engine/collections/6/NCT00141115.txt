      individuals suffering from both alcohol dependence and anxiety have been limited.
      Anti-seizure medications have been used for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal for three
      decades. More recently, anti-seizure medications have been shown to reduce drinking and
      promote abstinence, and reduce drinking in abstinent alcoholics. Levetiracetam is a newer
      anti-seizure medication, with a structure different than that of other anti-seizure
      medications, that is safe and generally well tolerated. The Food and Drug Administration
      (FDA) has approved levetiracetam for use with other anti-seizure medications in the treatment
      of epilepsy in adults. The metabolism of levetiracetam is less complicated than older
      anti-seizure medications, which makes it easier to use and better tolerated, and it is not
      likely to interact with other medicines. Levetiracetam has been shown to prevent anxiety
      during sedative withdrawal, which is similar to alcohol withdrawal, in a laboratory study
      using mice. Levetiracetam also had anti-anxiety effects in laboratory study using mice. Given
      that other anti-seizure medications have been shown to be helpful in treating alcohol
      dependence, that levetiracetam is not likely to have interactions with other medications, and
      that in animals levetiracetam appeared to be helpful for treating a condition similar to
      alcohol dependence and anxiety, we believe it should be studied for the treatment of alcohol
      dependent patients with anxiety disorders.
