      Fluoropyrimidines and cisplatin have been widely used in a variety of combinations in the
      treatment of AGC. Capecitabine/cisplatin combination therapy showed an overall response rate
      (ORR) of 41- 55%, a median time to progression/progression free survival (TTP/PFS) of 5.6-6.3
      months, and a median overall survival (OS) of 10.1-10.5 months. Though no studies have
      compared two oral fluoropyrimidines in combination with oxaliplatin, both S-1 and
      capecitabine appear to be comparable in terms of efficacy and safety. The investigators
      conducted a phase II trial of oxaliplatin combined with S-1 in the treatment of first-line
      AGC.
