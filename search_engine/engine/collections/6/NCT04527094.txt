      healthcare cost. One of the most serious form of these complications is postoperative
      respiratory failure, which is also associated with morbidity and mortality. A lot of risk
      stratification models have been developed for identifying patients at increased risk of
      postoperative respiratory failure. However, these models were built by using a traditional
      logistic regression analysis. A logistic regression analysis had disadvantages of assuming
      the relationship between dependent and independent variables as linear. Recent advances in
      artificial intelligence make it possible to manage and analyze big data. Prediction model
      using a machine learning technique and large-scale data can improve the accuracy of
      prediction performance than those of previous models using traditional statistics.
      Furthermore, a machine learning technique may be a useful adjuvant tool in making clinical
      decisions or real-time prediction if it is integrated into the healthcare system. However, to
      our knowledge, there was no study investigating the predictive factors of postoperative
      respiratory failure using a machine-learning approach. Therefore, the main objective of this
      study is to develop a machine learning model that predicts postoperative respiratory failure
      within 7 postoperative day using a real-world, local preoperative and intraoperative
      electronic health records, not administrative codes and evaluate its performance
      prospectively.
