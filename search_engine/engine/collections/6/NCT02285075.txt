    
      Background: Temocillin is a renally cleared penicillin with long serum half-live and potent
      activity against most gram-negative bacteria, making it an ideal candidate for treatment
      given on dialysis days only of severe gram-negative infections in patients with ESRD treated
      with haemodialysis.

      Endpoints:

      Primary: The current study aimed to demonstrated by measurement of AUC whether or not the
      pharmacodynamics target of a time above a MIC of 8 and 16 mg/L of more than 40 and 60 % of
      the dosing interval could be obtained with a dosing schedule of 1 gram/24 hours, 2 gram/48
      hours and 3 gram/72 hours, all of these doses given after haemodialysis sessions only.

      Secondary: Key pharmacokinetic and dialytic parameters were determined as previously
      described16. The following parameters were recorded: the volume of distribution Vd
      (determined as Vd = dose / (Tempeak - Temtrough) in liter); the Vd/Wt (in liter/kg body
      weight); the non-dialysis clearance of temocillin (Ke(non-dialysis) = [ln(Tempeak) -
      ln(Tempre)] / time between peak level and start of next dialysis); the non-dialysis half-life
      (T1/2(non-dialysis) = 0.693 / Ke(non-dialysis) in hours); the dialysis clearance of
      temocillin (Ke(dialysis) = [ln(Tempre) - ln(Tempost)] / dialysis duration); the dialysis
      half-life (T1/2(dialysis) = 0.693 / Ke(dialysis) in hours); the Urea Reduction Ratio (URR =
      (BUNpre - BUNpost) / BUNpre); the Temocillin Reduction Ratio TRR = (Tempre - Tempost) /
      Tempre); the Temocillin Removal Ratio (the total amount of temocillin recovered in the
      dialysate, based on the area under the curve of the temocillin removal rate and the treatment
      time); and the AUC of temocillin. For all PK/PD analysis, the non-compartmental method using
      RStudio 0.98.501 with R 3.0.2 software was used.

      Methods: Pharmacokinetic study measuring total and free temocillin concentrations in patients
      treated with intermittent haemodialysis and temocillin. Blood samples were drawn just before,
      and at 0.5, 3, 6, 12, 20 (before dialysis) and 24 (at the end of dialysis) hours after start
      of the infusion when patients were dialysed with a 1-day interval; just before and at 0.5, 3,
      6, 12, 24, 36, 44 (before dialysis) and 48 (at the end of dialysis) hours after start of the
      infusion when patients were dialysed with a 2-day interval, and just before and at 0.5, 3, 6,
      12, 24, 36, 48, 68 (before dialysis) and 72 (at the end of dialysis) hours after start of the
      infusion if patients were dialysed with a 3-day interval. Patients were followed for 1 to 6
      subsequent AUC. Dialysate samples were taken 1, 2, 3 and 4 h after the start of dialysis. All
      samples were taken from an arterial or venous catheter, after thorough rinsing. Serum
      (obtained by centrifugation after blood clotting) and dialysate was frozen (-80 C)
      immediately after sampling until analysis.

      Temocillin total and free concentrations were determined with high performance liquid
      chromotography(HPLC) with a LiChrospher 100 RP-18 5 Î¼m column (Merck AG), using an elution
      buffer 100 mM Na acetate buffer pH 7/acetonitrile (95:5, v/v), a flow rate 1 mL/min and a
      Waters 2690 Alliance System (Waters Corp., Milford, MA, USA), with quantification at 235 nm
      as previously described.
