      hope to couple genomic techniques with more traditional methods involved in genetic discovery
      in order to investigate a broad range of conditions for which there is strong evidence that
      genetic factors are involved. To accomplish this, we plan to enroll approximately five
      families, in whom members have congenital malformations consistent with an error of early
      human development, in our research protocol each year. Patients will be referred from outside
      clinicians or may self-refer, and may be seen at the NIH Clinical Center or may send samples
      for testing. Some participants, for whom we already have DNA or tissue stored, may be
      reconsented for specific participation in this protocol.
