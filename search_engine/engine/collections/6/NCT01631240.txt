      Participants will be asked to collect urine samples over a 24-hour period. One-third of the
      participants (n=133) will be asked to collect a second 24-hour urine 4-11 days later. A
      24-hour dietary recall interview will be collected after the completion of each 24-hour urine
      collection. Results from this study will be used to assess how well the sodium excretion
      estimated from NHANES timed urine correlates with data from 24-hour urine collection. It will
      provide valuable information on the potential of NHANES timed urine collections to be used to
      characterize trends in U.S. population sodium intake.
