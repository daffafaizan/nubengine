      established in previous clinical trials. The purpose of the current study is to treat at
      least 3 ADA-SCID patients with OTL-101 prepared by the commercial manufacturing process in
      order to facilitate collection of data necessary for final manufacturing.

      Assessments will focus on monitoring safety and engraftment, through the evaluation of
      parameters describing immunological recovery, ADA enzyme activity and persistence of gene
      marking (VCN) at 6 months and 12 months. After completion of 12 months of follow-up on the
      current study protocol, subjects will be enrolled in an observational long-term follow-up
      study, in order to monitor the long-term safety of treatment with OTL-101.
