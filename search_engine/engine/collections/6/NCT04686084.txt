      researcher and the subject know the treatment the participant is receiving.

      To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of DE-CBCT to evaluate jaw bone density and compare
      HU values with those of multidetector CT, an established standard for assessing BD.

      The study is based on two visits (VISIT 1 and VISIT 2) • DAY 0 (enrollment): Subject is
      queried for inclusion/exclusion criteria and informed about the study. If he/she agrees to
      participate, inclusion/exclusion criteria and informed consent will be documented. An imaging
      stent, which bears radiopaque markers, will be also created for each patient.

      • VISIT 1: Inclusion/exclusion criteria will be reconfirmed and the DE-CBCT imaging will be
      completed.

      • VISIT 2 (no more than 30 days since the enrollment): Inclusion/exclusion criteria will be
      reconfirmed and MDCT imaging completed.

      - Depending on availability of scheduling on MDCT unit, Visit 2 may occur on the same day as
      Visit 1.
