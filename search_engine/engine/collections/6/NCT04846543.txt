      question is, if the re-fracture risk with Activa IM-nail is in line with the other treatment
      methods, namely ESIN.

      Primary objective: will be to assess clinical outcome by determining re-fracture rate of all
      treated patients, difference of re-fracture rate depending on the fracture type determined by
      X-ray (e.g. greenstick vs. non-greenstick fracture), subject's age, BMI, surgical technique,
      immobilization time and bony union formation.
