      greater reduction in alcohol use than placebo in outpatients with bipolar disorder and
      alcohol dependence. We will also examine if quetiapine treatment is associated with greater
      reduction in alcohol craving than placebo in outpatients with bipolar disorder and alcohol
      dependence and if quetiapine treatment is associated with greater improvement in depressive
      symptoms than placebo in outpatients with bipolar disorder and alcohol dependence.
