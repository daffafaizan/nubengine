      patients (1st for HLA-typing, 2nd for participation in the vaccination trial).

      The first four vaccinations, which were given every two weeks, were followed by four monthly
      vaccinations. Additional vaccinations were permitted on request for patients who exhibited
      stable disease (SD).

      Immediately before administration, KS24.22 cells were thawed and lethally irradiated. KS24.22
      cells were adjusted to 10E7/ml in Ringer-Lactate-solution, transferred to 1 ml syringes and
      stored on ice until injected within a time frame of 2h. Vaccinations were given i.d. in the
      thigh with a total volume of 1 ml divided between two injection sites.
