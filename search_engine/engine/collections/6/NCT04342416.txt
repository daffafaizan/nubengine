      remotely via telephone or secure video platform (Kara Connect). In session one, the intrusive
      memories will be logged for monitoring their frequency in a daily diary for the following
      weeks. Baseline assessment questionnaires will also administered. In the second session, a
      memory will be selected and targeted with the intervention (memory reminder followed by 25
      min gameplay with mental rotation) followed by monitoring the frequency of both the targeted
      and non-targeted intrusive memories. Participants will also complete self-rated questions
      concerning the impact of their intrusive memories. The intervention session will be repeated
      for other intrusive memories (maximum 6 intervention sessions). In the last intervention
      session, participants will be asked to complete questionnaires and self-rated questions
      assessing the impact of their intrusive memories. Participants will be asked to complete
      measures at 1 month follow-up and at 3 month follow-up. In the 1 month follow-up and the 3
      month follow-up, participants complete questionnaires and monitor the frequency of intrusive
      memories for one week. The investigators note that the intended timeframes (e.g. one-week for
      baseline and one-week for intervention phase) may differ slightly across participants
      depending on availability and the practicalities of remote delivery.
