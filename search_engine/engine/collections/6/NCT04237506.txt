      to 3.6 cases per 1000 living births in the United States. The motor signs of CP include
      abnormal muscle tone and motor control, preventing individuals with CP from participating in
      normal daily activity. The most common type of CP is spastic CP, in which spasticity is
      present and range of motion in the joints is reduced. Physical therapy is one fundamental
      method of rehabilitation that attempts to recover motor function via exercises, while the
      effects of physical therapy are still elusive due to the lack of comprehensive evidence. This
      study uses a targeted ballet class to promote balance, increased range of motion, and reduced
      spasticity. The combination of qualitative clinical measures and quantitative assessment
      spasticity aims to demonstrate the benefits brought by the dance class.
