      complete at least chemotherapy and GM1 injection/blank control. During the 3w per cycle
      chemotherapy, albumin-bound paclitaxel is conducted in D1 and D8, GM1(40mg+250ml N.S) is
      injected from D1 to D8. Neurotoxicity evaluation and quality of life assessment will be
      conducted every cycle and 3m/6m after the chemotherapy.
