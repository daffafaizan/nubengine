      Primary

        -  Determine the efficacy of capecitabine and pegylated interferon alfa-2a, in terms of
           6-month neurologic progression-free rate, in patients with recurrent or progressive
           brain metastases secondary to breast cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the toxicity spectrum of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the time to neurologic progression and overall survival of patients treated
           with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral capecitabine twice daily on days 1-14 and pegylated interferon alfa-2a
      subcutaneously on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for at least 6 months in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 38-98 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
