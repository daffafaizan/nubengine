      tolerability of PUR118 in these subjects over single and short multi-day dosing periods. The
      study will also provide preliminary data regarding PUR118's potential impact on biomarkers in
      COPD. Finally, this trial will assess PUR118's effect on mucociliary clearance. This is a
      four part study enrolling healthy volunteers in a single ascending dose design (SAD; Part I),
      followed by multiple ascending dose design (MAD; Part II). Contingent on demonstration of
      safety in a healthy subject population, the study will enroll mild COPD subjects for a short
      multi-dose design (Part III) incorporating safety and pharmacodynamic endpoints. Lastly Part
      IV of the trial will assess the effect of PUR118 on mucociliary clearance in mild COPD
      subjects.
