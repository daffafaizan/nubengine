      and 18F-FDG PET/CT and cardiac MRI as response to treatment with ranolazine. Subjects undergo
      imaging procedures at week 0 and week 26 (optional for normal function patients). This is a
      companion imaging trial for patients who are eligible for the treatment trial entitled "A
      randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, multi-center study to assess the effect of
      ranolazine on outcomes in subjects with pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular
      dysfunction accompanied by a comparative study of cellular metabolism in subjects with
      pulmonary hypertension with and without right ventricular dysfunction". Subjects must enroll
      in companion treatment protocol to qualify for the imaging protocol.

      The cardiac MRI portion of the study continued, but the PET portion of the study was
      discontinued due to funding.

      The treatment protocol is registered under: NCT01839110. Due to funding issues, the completed
      study was registered under NCT02829034.
