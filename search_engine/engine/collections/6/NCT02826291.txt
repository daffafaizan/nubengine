      After the sentinel lymph node detection (ICG, 99m Tc or Bleu Patente) and sentinel node/nodes
      removal is performed, the node/nodes is/are cut in 2-mm slices parallel to short axis of the
      node. The odd-numbered blocks will be examined by the OSNA method and the even-numbered
      blocks will be examined by conventional histopathological methods including
      immunohistochemistry.

      Statistical analysis to identify differences will be performed subsequently.
