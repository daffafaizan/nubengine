    
      This is a prospective, randomized, active controlled study in patients undergoing total knee
      replacement. The objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of Liposome Bupivacaine,
      in managing postoperative pain, to standard of care CFNB. Following informed consent,
      patients will be randomized to one of two groups, Liposome Bupivacaine or active control,
      CFNB group.

      266 mg Liposome Bupivacaine plus Bupivicaine HCL (150mg) will be administered via local joint
      infiltration around the knee joint prior to wound closure. In the control group a CFNB will
      be placed for 48hrs prior to surgery. Outcomes measured included pain at rest, movement and
      quadriceps muscle strength on the first and second postoperative day.

      It is hypothesized that Liposome Bupivacaine will provide effective pain control and improved
      preservation of quadriceps muscle strength, in comparison to CFNB.
