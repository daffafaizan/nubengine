      increase in hospital admissions for asthma in children occurring predictably in the third
      week of September every year.1 In 2000 we undertook a retrospective case-control study
      comparing the clinical characteristics of children using local emergency rooms for asthma in
      September, with those of children presenting during the non-epidemic months of July-August.
      Based on that pilot study of 169 children, we developed a larger prospective case-control
      study of clinical and biological characteristics of children recruited as they presented to
      an emergency room for asthma during September 2001. The control group for this study were
      children recruited from the community who had symptomatic asthma but did not have a September
      exacerbation requiring emergency room utilization. We identified the presence of rhinovirus
      in the majority of children attending an ER with acute asthma, and also found rhinovirus in a
      substantial proportion of the community based controls. We also found a highly significant
      difference in use of medications for asthma, with the ER cases being much less likely to be
      receiving adequate anti-inflammatory medication. In September 2004 we conducted a pilot
      randomized controlled blinded clinical trial of the efficacy of montelukast in reducing
      morbidity caused by asthma exacerbations associated with respiratory viral infections (RVI)
      in children aged 2 to 14. We found a highly significant reduction in reported symptom free
      days in the montelukast group. The current study is a randomized placebo-controlled trial of
      montelukast, during September 2005 to confirm the results of our pilot study and to examine
      the effectiveness of montelukast in reducing asthma morbidity during RVIs in different age
      and sex groups with a range of risk of exacerbations. We also wish to compare the
      effectiveness of montelukast to placebo in reducing asthma morbidity during RVIs between
      groups of children concurrently taking no or other classes of asthma control medications.
