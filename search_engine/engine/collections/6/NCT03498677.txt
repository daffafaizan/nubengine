      trials set with a nested study examining the impact of question order on prioritization of
      outcomes. Research reports different stakeholders groups may differ in how they value or
      prioritize research questions and outcomes and it is recommended that each group should be
      adequately represented.

      The Protocol Lab for Online Trials-Delphi (PLOT-D) study will use an online Delphi combined
      with participatory action research to inform the development of a multi-use protocol template
      for writing protocols for self-recruited online trials of interventional self-management. The
      Protocol lab will use the Delphi findings, along with earlier research to redesign a series
      of protocols for online randomized trials with the aim of providing support for citizens to
      work alongside researchers to build participatory health trials online.
