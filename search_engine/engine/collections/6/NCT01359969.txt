      study in pediatric patients from 2 up to and including 13 years of age, with a confirmed
      diagnosis of HAE. Patients were eligible for treatment with rhC1INH if they presented to the
      clinic within 5 hours of onset with an acute attack of at least moderate severity without
      signs of spontaneous regression. Patients received rhC1INH at a dose of 50 U/kg body weight
      up to a maximum of 4200 U. The reconstituted solution was administered as a slow intravenous
      (iv) injection over approximately 5 minutes. The patients remained in hospital and were
      closely monitored in the study center for at least 4 hours after study medication
      administration.
