        1. Selection of the patients (realized during the consultation of programming in the
           beginning of the SPA Therapy). They are 2 thermal doctors of "Neyrac-les-Bains" (1
           general practitioner with formation of thermal medicine and a rheumatologist) which
           include the eligible patients in this study during the visit of the beginning of SPA
           Therapy.

        2. They will put back to the patients the Inform Consent Form, the Form of non-opposition
           and the 1st questionnaire (J0). The nurse of the SPA Therapy will be at their disposal
           to help them to fill the questionnaire if need.

      An urn will be arranged in the entrance hall of Neyrac- les-Bains to get back the filled
      questionnaires (J0 and J21).

      Patients will follow the conventional SPA Therapy of 3 weeks without a specific changes or
      modification of the care provided.

      Feedback :

      Assessments conducted by the using of self - questionnaires:

        -  Delivered in the issue of the visit of inclusion and at the end of the Spa Therapy ;

        -  Sent by mail at 3 and 6 months

      The expectations and fears will be evaluated by means of individual interview or focus
      groups. To avoid the biases bound to the questionnaire, the patients questioned in
      qualitative are different from patients receiving the questionnaire (not over the same period
      of SPA Therapy).
