    
      This is a 5 arm randomized, double-blind, parallel group, single-center, placebo-controlled
      study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pregabalin-acetaminophen combination in the
      prevention and treatment of post-surgical dental pain in healthy patients.

      Subjects in every treatment arm will receive a dose 60 min prior to surgery. It is not
      required to receive a post-operative dose if patient does not feel pain at a scale of NRS≥ 5.
      Dose 2 will be given post-surgically when patients report at least moderate pain on the
      categorical scale and a score of ≥5 on 0-10 PI-NRS. Subsequent to dose 2, patients can
      request rescue analgesic at any time.
