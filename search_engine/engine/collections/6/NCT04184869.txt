    
      This is an open-label, extension protocol designed to allow patients to continue to receive
      belinostat treatment after they have completed the protocol-specified assessments and
      procedures in a Spectrum sponsored belinostat study and have not met the criteria for
      treatment discontinuation in those studies. This extension of belinostat treatment allowance
      is not a part of the primary efficacy assessments for those trials. The extension is intended
      to provide all possible benefits to patients who are having a positive response to belinostat
      and must be under the Investigator's care. The additional treatment is optional and
      voluntary.

      This protocol will be available for all patients who have completed the protocol-specified
      assessments and procedures in Spectrum sponsored belinostat studies. Patients can receive
      belinostat treatment according to the treatment schedule that is being administered at the
      time they complete participation in the original clinical study protocol or can be treated
      per the Investigator's standard of care. Doe modifications during treatment on this extension
      protocol will be in accordance with the U.S. package insert.

      Safety will continue to be followed during the extended belinostat treatment. Therapeutic
      benefits or efficacy will be followed to the extent that is evaluated according to the
      institution's standard of care.
