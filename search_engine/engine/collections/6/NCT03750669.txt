      given to the participants after randomization. Tumor size, recurrence-free survival, overall
      survival, drugs related side effects and other endpoints events were recorded and analyzed,
      to assess the sequential treatment with Nab-paclitaxel plus Gemcitabine and modified
      Folfirinox could or couldn't benefit the prognosis of resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
