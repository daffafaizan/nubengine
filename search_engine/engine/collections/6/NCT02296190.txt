      evaluate the effects of 4 different doses of MSP-2017 (Etripamil) in subjects with paroxysmal
      supraventricular tachycardia. It includes an up to 21-day Screening Period, a 1-day Treatment
      Visit, and either a Follow-up Visit or Early Termination Visit occurring 12 hours to 5 days
      after the Treatment Visit. Subjects will be randomized to yield at least 100 evaluable
      subjects distributed into 5 groups of at least 20 subjects each.
