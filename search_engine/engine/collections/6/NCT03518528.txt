      on the ideal management of the adequate endometrial preparation.

      Artificial preparation of endometrium is commonly used in assisted reproduction center
      because it is more easy to schedule.

      Estradiol could be administrate by oral, vaginal or transdermal, but no protocol seems to
      improve clinical pregnancy rates.

      To investigator's knowledge, transdermal estradiol has never been compare to vaginal
      administration before frozen-thawed embryo transfer.

      Because transdermal administration could improve satisfaction of patients and reduce duration
      of treatment (when compare to oral administration), the investigators conduct a prospective
      study to compare clinical pregnancy rate after transdermal or vaginal estradiol
      administration to prepare the endometrium before frozen-thawed embryo transfer.

      The investigator also evaluate side effects and patients satisfaction in both protocol.

      The patients choose if they prefer vaginal or transdermal protocol after receiving sufficient
      information during medical consultation.
