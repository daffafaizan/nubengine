      To determine the role of using Kinesiology tape on the prevention of elbow flexion tightness
      in infants with extended Erb's palsy.

      BACKGROUND:

      BACKGROUND Neglecting or even delay in Brachial plexus birth palsy management, may result in
      substantial and chronic impairment. Physiotherapy, microsurgical nerve reconstruction,
      secondary joint corrections, and muscle transpositions are employed to help the child
      maximize function in the affected upper extremity. Kinesiology taping can have an effect on
      muscle performance and support joint by improving proprioception, normalizing muscle tone,
      correct the inappropriate positions and stimulate skin receptors. The possible effect of
      kinesiotaping on muscle strength has been investigated by numerous researchers that have
      theorized that kinesiotaping facilitates an immediate increase in muscle strength by
      generating a concentric pull on the fascia.

      HYPOTHESES:

      There will be no role of Kinesiology tape on the prevention of elbow flexion tightness in
      infants with extended Erb's palsy.

      RESEARCH QUESTION:

      Is there a role of using Kinesiology tape in preventing elbow flexion tightness in infants
      with extended Erb's palsy?
