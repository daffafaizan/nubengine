      in Zambia's Eastern Province. Households that had been registered to receive ITNs were then
      randomized to one of five groups that received a CHW visit at different intervals. Group 1
      was visited 1-3 days after distribution, group 2 was visited 5-7 days after, group 3 was
      visited 10-12 days after, group 4 was visited 15-17 days after, and group 5 did not receive a
      hang-up visit. Groups 1-4 were categorized as having received a hang-up visit and group 5 was
      categorized as not having received a hang-up visit. All households in all five groups were
      visited at 7-11 weeks after the distribution and again at 5-6 months after the distribution
      to assess short- and medium-term ITN retention and usage.
