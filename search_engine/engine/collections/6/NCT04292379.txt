    
      The investigators will implement and evaluate an integrated, evidence-based bundle of
      family-centred, emergency mental health and addictions care. This care bundle will provide
      high value to families, matching resources and services to need while eliminating healthcare
      inefficiencies and closing care gaps. The bundle will introduce two well-established tools
      for healthcare providers to use in EDs, walk-in clinics, and urgent mental health care
      appointments. These tools are the Ask Suicide-Screening Questions (ASQ) and HEADS-ED, an
      assessment mnemonic (Home; Education & Employment; Activities & Peers; Drugs & Alcohol;
      Suicidality; Emotions & Behaviours; Discharge or Current Resources).

      The bundle will also introduce new processes to improve healthcare system efficiencies,
      navigation and transitions between healthcare sectors. For families who receive care in the
      ED, the investigators will remove the physician gatekeeper role so that children/youth who
      are screened as low-risk will be offered a follow-up appointment in an urgent mental health
      care clinic within 24-48 hours. Those who screen as high-risk will see a mental health
      specialist and undergo a HEADS-ED assessment. Families who follow up in the clinic will
      receive care that applies a Choice And Partnership Approach (CAPA). CAPA is a collaborative
      approach to healthcare, where healthcare providers work in partnership with children/youth
      and their parents to identify choices for care that best match individual needs and
      preferences.

      Study Goal: The investigators' goal is the right care, with the right people, at the right
      place and time.

      Study Design: To measure the bundle's impact, the investigators will use an interrupted time
      series (ITS) design.
