        -  Determine the efficacy of interferon alfa and thalidomide, in terms of time to disease
           progression, in patients with surgically resected high-risk soft tissue sarcoma or bone
           sarcoma.

        -  Determine the incidence of metastatic disease and overall survival in patients treated
           with this regimen.

        -  Determine the clinical and laboratory toxic effects and the tolerability of this regimen
           in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive interferon alfa subcutaneously three times a week on weeks 1-60 and
      oral thalidomide once daily on weeks 13-60 in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 6 weeks for at least 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-48 patients will be accrued for this study.
