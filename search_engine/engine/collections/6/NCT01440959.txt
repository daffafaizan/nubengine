      the development and proliferation of GIST, and in general FGFR has an important role in
      angiogenesis and tumor proliferation in many cancers. We assume that TKI258 can be also
      effective in patients with GIST. The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and
      activity of TKI258 given as salvage treatment for GIST after failure to standard imatinib and
      sunitinib.
