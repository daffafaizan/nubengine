    
      CTM-N2D-101 is a phase I dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety of CTM-N2D and the
      feasibility to produce CTM-N2D for three target dose levels between 3x10^8 - 3x10^9 per
      infusion will be tested. Four doses will be given at an interval of a week into subjects with
      relapsed or refractory solid tumors.

      A typical 3+3 design will be used to determine the safe regimen basing on the incidence of
      dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). The identified safe regimen will be used for further phase II
      studies for selected indications.
