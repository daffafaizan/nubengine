      made of calcium oxalate. Calcium and oxalate are present in the urine and can bind to each
      other, and form calcium oxalate kidney stones. Oxalate is absorbed in the gut from the food
      that is eaten and is removed from the body through urination. Gut bacteria is thought to play
      a role in decreasing oxalate absorption in the gut and its levels in the urine. With this
      research we hope to learn about differences in the bacteria that live in the gut of different
      groups of participants who are likely to form kidney stones, as well as healthy individuals.
      We will study healthy people with no history of kidney stones, people with a history of
      calcium oxalate (CaOx) kidney stones, people with a genetic disease called primary
      hyperoxaluria type1 (PH1) that increases their chances to form calcium oxalate kidney stones
      and, people with enteric hyperoxaluria (EH) a disease in which individuals have short bowels
      due to surgery which lead them to get calcium oxalate kidney stones.

      Our research questions are:

        1. How different is the gut bacteria between participants with the conditions that make
           them more likely to form kidney stones and healthy participants with no history of
           kidney stones?

        2. Is there any difference in the function of the individual bacteria, Oxalobacter
           formigenes known to reduce oxalate, between healthy participants with no history kidney
           stones and participants with PH1?
