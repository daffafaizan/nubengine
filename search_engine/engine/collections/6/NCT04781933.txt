      population. Currently, there are no established pharmacotherapies for NASH patients. The gut
      microbiota has a major contributing role in the development of NASH with leaky gut,
      inflammation, oxidative stress and impaired microbiota. Restoring the microbiota symbiosys
      could be a new way of resolution of NASH.

      The aim of this trial is to evaluate the efficacy of the Combo, association of probiotics
      (Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Bifidobacterium breve BR03, Lactobacillus plantarum) and
      Glutamine, Quercetin, Vitamin E, Curcumin, Silybin, Pectin by means of histological
      resolution of NASH without progression of fibrosis, after 52 weeks, in 60 NASH patients with
      mild to severe fibrosis.

      To confirm a histological diagnosis of NASH and proof efficacy of the Combo, a liver biopsy
      will be performed prior to screening as well as at the end of supplemental phase
