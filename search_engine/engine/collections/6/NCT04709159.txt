      To determine the effect of CFLU-TB on TB treatment success (treatment completion and cure
      rates) in patients with TB receiving care at three public health facilities in Uganda.

      Secondary Objectives

        1. To compare TB cure rates (six months) in patients with microbiologically diagnosed TB.

        2. To determine the effect of enhanced TB treatment support with CFLU-TB on 2- and 6-month
           retention in patients receiving TB treatment at Kisenyi Health Center IV.

        3. To assess views of care-providers towards the CFLU-TB.

        4. To assess the cost-effectiveness of the CFLU-TB intervention in TB care

        5. To determine and compare adherence rates between patients in the intervention arm and
           control arms.

        6. To compare treatment completion (six months) in patients clinically diagnosed with TB in
           the intervention and control arms.

        7. To compare knowledge about TB/HIV in patients enrolled in the intervention and control
           arms.

        8. To determine the effect of CFLU-TB on adherence to clinic appointments.

        9. To determine the level of usage of the CFLU-TB tool in patients and their care providers

       10. To determine rifampicin-resistance rates in the intervention and control arms.
