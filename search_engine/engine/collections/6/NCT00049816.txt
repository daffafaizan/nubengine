      functional status through reducing joint pain and inflammation and maintaining or restoring
      joint function. Exercise is an adjunct therapy in the clinical management of patients with
      osteoarthritis of the knee. However, it is not uniformly accepted. The central hypothesis of
      this work is that the Surgeon General's exercise guidelines can be successfully implemented
      as an effective nonsurgical option for treatment of patients with early stages of knee
      osteoarthritis.

      Patients with knee osteoarthritis will be randomized into a control group, a walking exercise
      group, and a stationary cycling exercise group. The individuals in the exercise groups will
      be required to exercise three times per week for one year using emerging public health
      recommendations for aerobic exercise in the adult and aging population. Patient outcome will
      be assessed using objective gait analysis measurements, knee radiographs to quantify joint
      space narrowing, magnetic resonance imaging, a general health questionnaire (SF-36), a
      disease/site specific questionnaire (WOMAC), and a visual-analog pain scale. All subjects
      will be studied at 0 and 52 weeks.
