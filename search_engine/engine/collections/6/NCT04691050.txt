      missing second premolars in which traditional root canal treatment with gutta-percha was
      contraindicated. Pulpectomy was performed in each tooth and the canals were filled with
      OrthoMTA. The clinical and radiological outcomes of the treatment were evaluated at 3, 6, 9,
      and 12 months. Fractal analysis was used to detect changes in the trabecular bone after the
      treatment. Repeated measures analysis of variance test and two independent t-tests were used
      to evaluate the data.
