        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of vinorelbine when administered in combination
           with temozolomide in patients with recurrent brain metastases (phase I accrual
           completed).

        -  Determine the safety and feasibility of this treatment regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the efficacy of this treatment regimen, in terms of objective radiographic
           response and overall and progression-free survival, in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of vinorelbine.

      Patients receive vinorelbine IV over 5-10 minutes on days 1 and 8 and oral temozolomide once
      daily on days 1-7 and 15-21. Courses repeat every 28 days for up to 1 year in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of vinorelbine until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, an additional 20-35
      patients will be treated at that dose level.

      Patients are followed every 3-4 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 3 patients will be accrued for the phase I portion of this
      study and 20-35 patients will be accrued for the phase II portion of this study within 2
      years.
