      taxane were compared with platinum and 5-Fluorouracil [31]. Additionally, weekly cisplatin
      regimens (30-40 mg/m2) with radiotherapy appear to be equally efficacious and better
      tolerated than standard high-dose cisplatin (100 mg/ m2) regimens with radiation therapy for
      locally advanced SCCHN [32] The investigators will thus attempt to reduce toxicity from
      induction chemotherapy with the use of docetaxel/cisplatin (or carboplatin) (TP) in place of
      our previously used standard regimen of cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (PF) and administer
      weekly cisplatin (or carboplatin) with radiation for those patients who are responders to
      induction therapy. Finally, Phase I/II testing of the small molecule inhibitor, AT-101, has
      recently been completed, and suggests activity in solid tumors when combined with cytotoxic
      agents. Since the investigators have achieved such high survival rates with our treatment
      selection approach in laryngeal cancer, our ultimate goal is to reduce the rate of salvage
      laryngectomy which should improve quality of life. The investigators hypothesize that
      specific inhibition of Bcl-2/Bcl-xL function can increase response rates to neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy and decrease the need for salvage laryngectomy. Hence, the investigators propose
      this study: the treatment of patients with advanced SCC of the larynx with one cycle of
      platinum plus docetaxel with AT-101, followed by chemoradiotherapy for those responding to
      this induction regimen and reserving total laryngectomy for those who are non-responders.
