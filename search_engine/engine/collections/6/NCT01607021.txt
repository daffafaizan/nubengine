      virus through vertical transmission, although parenteral routes of acquisition are also
      common. Affected children are usually asymptomatic and histological findings are mild with a
      low risk of progression, about 5% develop significant liver disease in childhood.

      The use of combination treatment with interferon-alpha and ribavirin were recommended in the
      treatment of chronic hepatitis C in children, SVR in children with genotype 1 ranged from 44%
      to 59%. SVR in children with genotype 2 and 3 was more than 90%. But both interferon and
      ribavirin have significant side effects which affect compliance, such as: repeated flu like
      symptoms, leukopenia and anemia, moderate weight loss, behavioural problems, thyroid
      dysfunction and transient deceleration of the growth rate. In addition, approximately 50% of
      children infected with genotype 1 do not respond to therapy.

      Recent work has highlighted that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) around the IL28B gene
      have been identified as strong predictors of spontaneous and treatment-induced HCV clearance
      in adults, especially Rs 12979860 and Rs 8099917. A recent article in Hepatology also
      reported that interleukin (IL)-28B C/C genotype in the child was associated with spontaneous
      clearance of hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1 infection. All this reports show that Genetic
      Variation in Interleukin-28B Locus is associated with the procession of CHC.

      The aim of this study was to study the association between genetic variation in IL-28B and
      the development of CHC in Chinese children, such as: HCV viral load, serum alanine
      aminotransferase, histological change and the response to the treatment with interferon-alpha
      and ribavirin.
