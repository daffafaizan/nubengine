      to rate their worst oral pain or pain score (0-10) over the previous week (see Appendix).
      Those answering with at least a score of "7" (1/10) and that meet all other eligibility
      requirements (see Section 3) will be eligible for enrollment. All patients will sign informed
      consent for study participation. Each study visit is anticipated to take approximately 45
      minutes.

      Treatment will be administered on an outpatient basis. Study medication will be prescribed by
      authorized study staff physicians at no expense for the patient.

      Subjects will be evaluated clinically at baseline before starting treatment and at the end of
      the four-week period, for a total of two visits. Comprehensive subjective and objective data
      will be collected and intraoral photographs will be obtained. Oral mucosal disease will be
      evaluated using both patient reported (questions/visual analog scales) and clinician assessed
      measures.

      Subjects will be prescribed compound dexamethasone 0.5mg/5ml solution in Mucoloxâ„¢ (ARM A) or
      dexamethasone 0.5mg/5ml solution only (ARM B). All subjects will also receive a prescription
      for fluconazole 200 mg tablets once-a-week as prophylactic antifungal therapy. Any subjects
      that are already taking an antifungal oral medication at the time of the study enrollment
      will continue their prescribed medication and will not need to take the additional weekly
      fluconazole dose. Subjects will return for evaluation after four weeks at which time the
      study end-points will be assessed.

      If there is worsening of oral lichen planus that requires initiation of new immunomodulatory
      medications (systemic or topical), patients will remain on treatment, but will be regarded as
      unevaluable for the primary endpoint.
