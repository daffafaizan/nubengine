      world. Interestingly, it has been recently revealed that, in addition to the cardiovascular
      dysfunction associated with high sodium intake-induced hypertension, individuals who have
      unaltered blood pressure after chronic high sodium intake, termed salt resistant, report
      similar reductions in cardiovascular function when compared to salt sensitive individuals.
      While the extent to which this high sodium intake negatively alters cardiovascular structure
      as well as function is currently being explored, little is known about how high sodium intake
      impacts vascular function and blood flow regulation during exercise. Therefore, this study
      will determine if alterations in sodium intake alter peripheral vascular function and
      exercise tolerance in young individuals. The investigators hypothesize that increases in
      sodium intake will reduce exercise-induced arterial dilation in response to shear and result
      in exercise intolerance, via impaired functional sympatholysis, at moderate-to-high exercise
      workloads. Furthermore, the investigators hypothesize that these changes in blood flow
      regulation and exercise tolerance in young individuals will be reversed following antioxidant
      supplementation, implicating the role of oxidative stress in this dysfunction.
