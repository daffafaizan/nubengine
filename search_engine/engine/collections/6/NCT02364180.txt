      pyridostigmine for the treatment of any medical condition and presenting at the
      investigators' outpatient clinics for follow up appointment. Subjects taking pyridostigmine
      for the treatment of myasthenia gravis will be excluded. Both adults and children older than
      12 years of age will be approached. Those subjects that agree to participate will be asked to
      sign an informed consent. For the participation of minors a parental (or guardian) consent
      and subject assent will be obtained. Those that participate will answer a few questions
      pertaining to their medical history and will then undergo electromyograph (CMAP) measurement
      with repetitive stimulation at 2 sites (ulnar nerve at the wrist and the accessory nerve in
      the neck). Evoked electromyogram will be recorded on a computer hard drive. Eight percent or
      greater decrement in the CMAP response on repetitive stimulation will be considered positive.
