      2050, which brings the deeper demand on the quality of life improvement. The psychological
      problems is an important factor affecting the quality of life. As reported, 73.6% of urban
      residents were with mental sub-health, indicating that psychological problem has grown into
      inevitable issues in hindering healthy development. The elderly, compared with the
      non-elderly, have unique social and biological characteristics, so psychological problem of
      the older population deserves special focus. Literatures have investigated aged people with
      depression or anxiety disorder, but somatic symptom in elderly have rarely been addressed.
      Somatic symptom disorder prevalence in elderly in European ranged from 0-13.5%. However,
      there is no research comparing the incidence of somatic symptom, anxiety and depression
      between elderly and non-elderly and revealing the prevalence of somatic symptom under
      Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) criteria.

      Investigators use Somatic Symptom Scale-China (SSS-CN) questionnaire to assess the presence
      and severity of the symptoms. Patient Heath Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety
      Disorder Screener (GAD-7) are used to evaluate depression and anxiety disorder respectively.
      The study aims to clarify the prevalence of somatic symptom, depression and anxiety disorders
      in China, to compare physical and psychological difference between the elderly and
      non-elderly and to explore risk factors for somatic symptom in the elderly.
