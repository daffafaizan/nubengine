      Subjects enrolled will participate in an observational setting for three months. During this
      time period, individuals will be encouraged, to maintain increased legume intake and explore
      new recipes that allow them to maintain a diverse menu of legume based foods. Fecal samples
      for microbiota analysis will be collected every month. Participants will record a weekly
      online questionnaire about legume intake and GI health as well as other health status
      updates. While participants will be encouraged to maintain regular intake of chickpeas
      throughout the long-term study, consumption of other legumes will be encouraged.
