      refractive errors with and without astigmatism. The hybrid contact lens design may provide
      greater visual acuity and comfort than other soft or rigid gas permeable (RGP) lenses
      currently available. The purpose of this study is to confirm the design of the SynergEyes A2
      lens by evaluating clinical performance and, if necessary, modify certain lens parameters in
      order to optimize lens performance. Objective and subjective parameters will be used to
      evaluate the lens.
