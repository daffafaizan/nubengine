      is one of the major concerns of current health care. There is evidence for the effectiveness
      of exercise therapy in patients with chronic low back pain. GPR is a physical therapy method
      developed in France by Philippe Emmanuel Souchard. Although this method is largely used as
      form of treatment in most countries, few studies showed its clinical effectiveness in chronic
      low back pain. This is the first randomized controlled trial, with assessor blind that
      evaluate the GPR effects in chronic low back pain. All outcome measurements are reliability,
      validated and sensitivity for statistical changes using the Visual Analogic Scale- VAS
      (0-10cm), Roland Morris Questionary, SF36 (Quality Life Questionary) and Beck Scale
      (Depression Symptoms).
