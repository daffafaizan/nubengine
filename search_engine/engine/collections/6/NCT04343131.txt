      patterns on glycemia in individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D).

      Three different isocaloric diets, namely, a Mediterranean style diet, a low-carbohydrate diet
      and a reference diet were provided to patients with T1D for three separate weeks, in a random
      order, and with 7-day washout periods in-between. Glycemia was assessed during each 7-day
      period using a continuous glucose monitoring system. Participants were recruited from the
      outpatient diabetes clinic of a University Hospital in Athens, Greece.

      The primary outcome was time spent in euglycaemic range (TIR: 70-140mg/dl) during the diet
      period. Secondary outcomes were: (a) time spent below euglycaemic range (TBR: <70mg/dl); (b)
      time spent above euglycaemic range (TAR: >140mg/dl); (c) glycaemic variability and (d)
      insulin needs.
