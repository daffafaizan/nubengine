      acidbase status and oxygenation. This procedure, which can be repeated depending on the
      clinical condition of patient, is however associated with a potentially painful experience
      for patients.

      The known anesthetic properties of cold can be an interesting alternative to evaluate in the
      reduction of pain induced during arterial puncture for gas analysis in critically il
      patients.
