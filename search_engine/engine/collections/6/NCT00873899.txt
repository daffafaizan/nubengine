      for routine device monitoring. Moreover, in case of clinical events, such as ICD shocks or
      alert notifications for changes in cardiac status or safety issues, they often visit the
      emergency department or the clinic for an unscheduled visit. These planned and unplanned
      visits create a great burden on healthcare providers. Internet-based remote device
      interrogation systems, allowing physician's remote access to patients' data, are being
      proposed for reducing routine and interim visits and for earlier detection and notification
      of alert conditions.
