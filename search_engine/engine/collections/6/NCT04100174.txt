      (35Gy/5) can be shown to be superior to standard care (whole-gland BT boost 15Gy to RT
      37.5Gy/15) in terms of urinary toxicity by having fewer patients experience a minimal
      important decline (MID) in urinary irritation/obstructive QoL as measured by ePRO (EPIC-CP)
      at 12 and 24 months post completion of therapy.
