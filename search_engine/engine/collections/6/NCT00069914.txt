      the generation of influenza-specific antibodies and influenza-specific B cell responses in
      HIV-infected adults. HIV-infected subjects will be enrolled to receive the influenza vaccine
      appropriate to the on-going USA influenza season (Oct-March). Laboratory studies (including
      influenza titers, influenza-specific B cell frequencies, CD4 counts, and HIV viral loads)
      will be obtained at baseline (day of vaccination), day 7, 28, and 54 post-vaccination.
      HIV-negative healthy volunteers will serve as controls. Although there are some risks to
      influenza vaccine, the CDC Advisory Committee on Immunizations recommends influenza
      vaccination for HIV-infected patients. The primary study risks are those of phlebotomy and
      the inconvenience of multiple visits. Subjects will be compensated for participation in the
      study. Total enrollment of the study is a maximum of 165 subjects (132 HIV-infected
      individuals and 33 HIV-negative controls).
