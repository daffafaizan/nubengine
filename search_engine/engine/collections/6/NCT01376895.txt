      acceptability of delivering a culturally and developmentally tailored HIV risk reduction
      intervention via the Internet in real-time that promotes risk reduction among black men who
      have sex with men and women (BMSMW). During the Developmental Phase, our activities will
      consist of completing development (finalizing sessions, completing the manuals) of a
      theoretically grounded, culturally based, individual intervention, Project POWER, to reduce
      risk of HIV acquisition and transmission among BMSMW.

      The investigators will then conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test the
      preliminary efficacy, acceptability, and feasibility of POWER compared to HEALTH. Using chain
      referral methods, the investigators will recruit 200 BMSMW (100 per arm) and assign them to 1
      of 2 conditions (POWER or HEALTH). Participants will complete an assessment battery delivered
      via ACASI at baseline, immediate post intervention and at 3 months post intervention. The
      investigators will also measure uptake of HIV and STI testing. Participants will also
      complete acceptability/feasibility assessments after the
