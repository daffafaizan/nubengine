      feasible and exceptionally well tolerated at doses up to 50 mg. Early results show activity

      metronomic chemotherapy. Recently, initial therapy of metastatic breast cancer with
      paclitaxel plus bevacizumab demonstrated prolonged progression-free survival, as compared
      with paclitaxel alone.
