      right-sided colon cancer. The right side of the colon was defined as the colon from cecum up
      to the proximal half of the transverse colon. The number of patients needs to get a 90% power
      is 250. Patients will be enrolled at five leading centers in South Korea. A complete
      information leaflet will give to the patients during the first consultation, which will
      correspond to the enrollment day. The preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative period
      will be in complete accordance with the usual care of the center. The baseline demographics
      and conditions, as well as the perioperative items and the postoperative occurrences, will be
      recorded through a prior designed case report form. The follow-up encompasses 13
      postoperative consultations: 1month, 3 months, after that every 3 months until 36 months.

      The primary outcome of this study is 3-year disease-free survival. Secondary outcome measures
      include 3-year overall survival, the incidence of surgical complications, completeness of
      mCME, and distribution of metastatic lymph nodes. Review of resected surgical specimens and
      the operative field after completion of lymph node dissection will be done based on
      photographs to assess the quality if surgery.
