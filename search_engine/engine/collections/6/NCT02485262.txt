      characteristics of HCV patients in the Inland Empire are different than the cohort enrolled
      in SOF trials. There is a need to determine if the community based outcomes at match the
      outcome reported in the clinical trials.

      Aim of the study

      To propectively evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of the SOF treatment regimens
      prescribed at the ARMC and compare them to outcomes reported in the clinical trials that were
      the basis for FDA approval.

      patients are ARMC who received one of the SOF based treatment regimens from December 20, 2013
      to December 19, 2014.

      Primary end Point is sustained virological response at 12 weeks (SVR 12) and secondary end
      point is compliance and safety. Safety and compliance will be determined based on symptoms
