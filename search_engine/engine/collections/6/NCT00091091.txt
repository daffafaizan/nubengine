        -  Determine the cumulative incidence and characterize the spectrum of selected adverse
           physiologic and psychosocial outcomes, using self-report and clinical evaluation, in
           patients previously treated for childhood Hodgkin's lymphoma.

        -  Compare the cumulative incidence and spectrum of self-reported adverse outcomes of these
           patients, using data collected at a comparable time period after diagnosis, with
           Hodgkin's lymphoma survivors from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS).

        -  Compare self-reported health-related outcomes with outcomes detected by clinical
           evaluation and medical record review of each group of patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a cohort, cross-sectional, multicenter study.

        -  Contemporary group: Patients complete a self-report of long-term outcomes questionnaire
           and a comprehensive psychosocial questionnaire. A medical record review is then
           performed. Patients then undergo a comprehensive risk-based clinical evaluation with
           specific examinations and studies based upon the Children's Oncology Group Late Effects
           Screening Guidelines and the patients' specific therapeutic exposures.

        -  Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS) group: Patients undergo a telephone interview and
           have medical records reviewed to validate select self-reported long-term outcomes.
           Patient replies from the baseline CCSS questionnaire (which was completed at certain
           timepoints after diagnosis) are reviewed for targeted long-term outcomes.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 1,000 patients will be accrued for this study.
