    
      Alcohol withdrawal syndrome AWS (Alcohol Withdrawal Syndrome), is defined as the appearance
      of two or more data of autonomic hyperactivity, nausea, hallucinations and seizures
      associated with cessation of alcohol consumption. For its evaluation, the CIWA-Ar (Clinical
      Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol) scale is used, which guides the treatment based
      on benzodiazepines but a disadvantage is the related adverse effects, for which other
      pharmacological strategies of sedation have been tried, among them Dexmedetomidine (DEX).

      OBJECTIVES:

      The investigators aimed to compare the DEX vs. Diazepam, for moderate disease, applying the
      CIWA-Ar scale, in participants with severe to moderate AWS (Alcohol Withdrawal Syndrome).

      MATERIALS:

      Prior authorization from the ethics committee of O'Horán Hospital, Yucatán, Mexico. No.
      Registration CEI-011-1-17, and signature of informed consent. A randomized clinical trial was
      carried out in the Adult Emergencies service during the period July 2017-July 2018. Forty
      participants with CIWA-Ar greater than 10 points participated. The administration of:

      A) Diazepam 5-20 mg IV. B) DEX 0.2-0.7 mcg / Kg / min., until the CIWA-Ar scale decreases to
      <10.

      The investigators are excluded minor patients, mild CIWA-Ar category, previous medication,
      participants with severe cranial encephalic trauma (TBI) or mechanical ventilation
      requirement, with chronic liver failure category C in the Child-Turcotte-Pugh classification.

      RESULTS

      The CIWA Ar scale average for admission was 23 points, the lowest of 10 points and the
      highest of 38 points. The average number of days consuming alcohol prior to hospital
      admission was 131.9, with the highest average in the group that used dexmedetomidine; the
      average number of days after having suspended the intake until hospital admission was 1.7
      days, being slightly higher in the group that used diazepam; the shortest time was 6 hours
      and the longest of a week without being related to the CIWA Ar score.

      The average duration of treatment with diazepam was 5.5 days (IC 95 = 6.6-3.8), The average
      duration of treatment with dexmedetomidine was 3.1 days (95% CI = 4.5-1.7) After applying t
      student a significant difference was found in the number of days in favor of dexmedetomidine
      (p = 0.0016)

      CONCLUSIONS

      The investigators found that DEX at conventional doses, for the treatment of moderate-severe
      alcohol withdrawal in terms of reducing the CIWA-Ar scale, in fewer days and with fewer
      adverse effects and complications.
