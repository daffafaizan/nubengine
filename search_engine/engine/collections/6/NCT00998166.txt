      disease for which no curative therapy is available. For these patients, platinum based
      doublet combination regimens have become standard of care due to increased survival rates
      over platinum therapy alone.

      In order to try to improve on the overall survival, clinicians have attempted to add a third
      cytotoxic agent to their standard regimen(s). Although this approach demonstrated an improved
      objective response, no additional benefit was noted in overall survival.

      Recent development and approval of new targeted chemotherapies during the past 10 years has
      prompted clinical trials to test the efficacy of newly FDA approved agents such as gefitinib,
      erlotinib, and bevacizumab in advanced NSCLC.

      Although gefitinib and erlotinib have both demonstrated clinical activity in refractory
      NSCLC, neither agent improved clinical outcome when added to standard 1st line platinum based
      chemotherapy. In contrast, a recently completed randomized Phase 3 trial investigating the
      addition of bevacizumab to 1st line paclitaxel plus carboplatin chemotherapy reported a 23%
      improvement in the median overall survival for the paclitaxel/carboplatin plus bevacizumab
      treatment arm (12.5m vs. 10.2m; p=0.007). It is therefore appealing to study a cisplatin
      combination with bevacizumab to determine if there is any additive benefit. Pemetrexed is an
      ideal agent to use in combination with cisplatin since it is well tolerated and efficacy is
      comparable to other cisplatin combinations. Patients will receive a maximum of 6 cycles.
      Those who complete 1 cycle will be evaluated for toxicity; more than 1 cycle, response.
