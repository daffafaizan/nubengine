      I. Efficacy of apalutamide in combination with abiraterone acetate + prednisone following
      docetaxel with ongoing androgen deprivation therapy in men with high risk metastatic
      castration sensitive disease.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Safety and tolerability of apalutamide in combination with abiraterone acetate +
      prednisone following docetaxel with ongoing androgen deprivation therapy.

      II. Time to event. III. Depth of prostate specific antigen (PSA) response.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Quality of life. II. Falls.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive apalutamide orally (PO) once daily (QD), abiraterone acetate PO QD, and
      prednisone PO QD. Cycles repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive androgen deprivation therapy per standard of
      care.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for up to 10
      years.
