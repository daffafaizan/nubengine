      dengue virus every year. Therefore, to understanding the immunogenicity and safety of TV005
      vaccine among people aged 50 to 70 years is important for whether TV005 can be introduced
      into Taiwan as a major intervention to control dengue. This trial is a phase II,
      double-blind, multicenter, and placebo-controlled one. The investigators plan to enroll 252
      subjects whose age are 50 to 70 years at four study sites. One single-dose TV005 vaccine or
      placebo will be given subcutaneously. After vaccination, detailed data of the subjective
      symptoms, physical examination, laboratory examination, and titer of neutralization antibody
      from all subjects will be recorded. After completion of the present trial, the investigators
      can clarify the immunogenicity and safety of TV005 among people aged 50 to 70 years.
