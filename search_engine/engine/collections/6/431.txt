4311. studies on intravenous transfusionof thymus cells andlymphnode cells.  iii. influence oftransfused thymus cellsand lymphnode cells on the bonemarrowin rabbits transfused with thymus cells andlymphnode cells the peripheral blood andbone marrow were studied.  the transfusionof thymus cells caused a peripherallymphocytosis and a diminution of lymphoidcells in the bone marrow of both youngand adult rabbits.  the transfusion of lymphnodecells resulted in a peripheral lympho-penia, and an initial increase and a subsequentdiminution of lymphoid cells in thebone marrow.  it is suggested that lymphoid cellsin the bone marrow may be lympho-cytes which are stored or discharged accordingto a variety of conditions.  further-more, thymus cells are thought to mobilizelymphocytes from the bone marrow tothe peripheral blood.
