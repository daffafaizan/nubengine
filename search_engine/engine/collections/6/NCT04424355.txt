      visualization are required.

      Investigators hypothesize that chest MRI could be a test for detecting pulmonary features of
      COVID-19. They consider using MRI to assess COVID-19 viral pneumonia. Absence of radiation
      exposure to patients is a clear advantage of MRI.

      This is a prospective, observational cohort study assessing patients with suspected COVID-19.
      It's primary goal is to determine the ability of multiparametric MRI to detect lung
      abnormalities - ground-glass opacity (GGO), consolidation, "crazy paving" pattern, pleuritis
      - in comparison to CT scan. In this study each patient with suspected pneumonia will
      sequentially undergo both chest CT and MRI during his/her visit. Scan protocols will be
      identical for each patient. Each participants completed an online questionnaire.
