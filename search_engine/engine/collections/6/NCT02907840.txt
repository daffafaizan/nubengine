      P-V curves and arterial blood gas analysis at every step of the protocol.

      Participants will be sedated and paralyzed, ventilated in volume-controlled with protective
      ventilation (tidal volume=6-8 mL/Kg of predicted body weight and respiratory rate set to
      obtain normal pH) then the protocol will follow 5 steps each lasting 20 minutes to obtain
      clinical stability:

        1. PEEP 5 centimeter of water (cmH2O)

        2. PEEP 10 cmH2O

        3. Recruitment maneuver followed by PEEP 15 cmH2O

        4. PEEP 10 cmH2O

        5. PEEP 5 cmH2O
