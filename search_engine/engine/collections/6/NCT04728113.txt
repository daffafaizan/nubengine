    
      Before the start of the study, medical oncologists and supportive care physicians from both
      the sites will attend Communication Skills Training (CST) workshops provided by an expert
      team in the field. The training sessions will focus on practicing the required communication
      skills needed in consultations.

      The randomization will assign patients, with a 1:2 ratio, to "Introduction of supportive care
      when medically needed" (Arm A: Control Group) or "Initial concomitant management by the
      oncologist and the supportive care team" (Arm B: Early Together Group).

      Selected and validated questionnaires will be filled at baseline, 6 and 12 months by the
      patients before the consultation, in the 2 groups.
