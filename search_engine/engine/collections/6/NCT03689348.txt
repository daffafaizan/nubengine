      mechanisms relevant to brain function; including those which would modulate cognition and
      stress. The current study aims to test this in a group of N=128 males and females between the
      ages of 35-65yrs before and after 28 days supplementation of placebo, 300-, 600- and 900mg of
      a wild green oat extract. The study is randomized (within x3 age categories also; 35-45,
      46-55, 56-65yrs), placebo controlled and counterballanced across parallel groups.
      Participants will first attend a training/screening session followed by x2 lab-based testing
      sessions, 28 days apart. In the lab-based sessions participants will complete baseline
      cognitive assessments; including whilst undergoing a stressful observed methodology (the
      observed multi-tasking stressor or 'OMS'). Here galvanic skin response and heart rate will be
      measured and before and after the OMS participants will provide a saliva sample which will be
      analysed for cortisol and alpha-amylase levels. This procedure will be repeated 120- and 240-
      minutes post-dose. Between the lab-based sessions participants will complete mood scales via
      a mobile phone application 'cognimapp'.
