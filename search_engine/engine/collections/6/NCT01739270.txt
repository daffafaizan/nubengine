      Single-injection blocks are effective, but time limited. Adding 4mg of dexamethasone to 0.5%
      levobupivacaine will significantly prolong duration of brachial plexus anesthesia and
      analgesia for fracture operations of upper extremity. This effect will result in less opioid
      use postoperatively.
