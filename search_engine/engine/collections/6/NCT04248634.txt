      by a colo-anal anastomosis with a protective ileostomy. The latter reduces the risk and
      severity of clinical anastomotic fistulas. However, the ileostomy is very little accepted by
      patients. It is associated with significant morbidity reaching up to 30% of patients, a
      deterioration in the quality of life and the need for a second surgery to restore digestive
      continuity. And specifically in low-income countries, ostomy bags are expensive and are not
      reimbursed, and therefore constitute a heavy burden for Moroccan patients.

      In order to overcome these drawbacks, delayed colo-anal anastomosis has been proposed as an
      alternative to direct colo-anal anastomosis with a protective ileostomy. This technique
      consists of externalizing the colon in the first stage by the transanal route, without
      creating an ileostomy, and waiting a week for the creation of the anastomosis. The
      theoretical advantage of this technique is to reduce the risk of anastomotic leaks and to
      avoid ileostomy. Several studies have shown encouraging results in the short and midterm, and
      it is listed among the technical options in the French recommendations for the management of
      rectal cancer.

      In this study, the investigators will retrospectively evaluate the short and midterm results
      of this technique.
