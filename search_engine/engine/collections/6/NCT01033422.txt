    
      This is a Phase 2, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study in
      adult males and females, aged 18 years and over, with a diagnosis of glaucoma or ocular
      hypertension.

      This trial will be performed in 2 segments. In Segment 1, subjects will be randomized to
      receive either CF101 1.0 mg, or matching placebo, given orally every 12 hours for 16 weeks.
      Segment 1 will enroll approximately 44 subjects, randomized in a 3:1 ratio to CF101 1.0 mg or
      to placebo. At the conclusion of Segment 1, a Data Review Committee (DRC) will review safety
      and efficacy data and advise on progression of the trial to Segment 2. Segment 2 will enroll
      up to approximately 44 subjects randomized in a 3:1 ratio to CF101 2.0 mg 3:1 ratio to
      receive with CF101 2.0 mg, or matching placebo, given orally every 12 hours for 16 weeks.

      At a Screening Visit (Visit 1, performed within 4 weeks prior to Baseline), subjects who
      provide written informed consent will have screening procedures performed, including complete
      medical, ophthalmologic, and medication histories; physical examination; vital signs and
      weight; electrocardiogram (ECG); ophthalmologic examination; tonometry; visual field (VF)
      assessment; corneal pachymetry; evaluation of inclusion and exclusion criteria; safety
      laboratory tests; serum pregnancy test for all females of child-bearing potential; and
      collection of concomitant medication information.

      Subjects who successfully qualify will be randomized at Baseline (Visit 2) to their assigned
      medication (CF101 or matching placebo) to be taken orally every 12 hours for 16 weeks.
      Subjects will return for assessments and a new supply of study medication at Weeks 2, 4, 8,
      12, and for final assessment and discharge at Week 16. A safety telephone call will be made
      at Week 18.
