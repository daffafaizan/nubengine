      of women and 15% of men, with highest prevalence among the elderly. Treatment of brittle
      nails involves restoration and maintenance of a normal degree of nail plate hydration by
      minimizing exposure to dehydrating chemicals and by use of moisturizers, such as
      alpha-hydroxy acids. Retinoids are vitamin A analogs that play a role in skin cell
      differentiation and proliferation. Tazarotene is a topical receptor-selective synthetic
      retinoid that normalizes epidermal differentiation and reduces the influx of inflammatory
      cells into the skin. In this single-center, open-label trial, subjects applied tazarotene to
      the nails twice daily for 24 weeks. Signs and symptoms were rated by the investigators and
      subjects during treatment and 12 weeks after discontinuation.
