    
      Patients with B-cell lymphomas who need the administration of rituximab are recruited. They
      undergo skin tests with rituximab before the first infusion of this medicine. In the case of
      a positive skin test result, the patient will receive the desensitization procedure; if the
      result of skin test is negative, the challenge test will be administered. Drug challenge test
      consists in administering the desired full dose of rituximab according to manufacturer
      instructions. Challenge is considered positive when it shows an objective HSR. The patient
      with a positive challenge test will receive the desensitization procedure; while the patient
      with a negative challenge test will be given standard rituximab infusion in the subsequent
      chemotherapies.

      Peripheral blood will be drawn from all the subjects during their initial infusion of
      rituximab. If the patient shows hypersensitive symptoms, the blood will be drawn one hour
      after the onset of reaction; while if the patient has no HSR in the whole infusion process,
      the blood will be drawn at the end of infusion and used as negative control. Levels of
      tryptase, specific immunoglobulin E to rituximab, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-Î± in the serum will be
      tested.
