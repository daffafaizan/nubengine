      least 3 months. For patients treated with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) alone, a dose
      reduction of 25-50% to a minimal dose that controls disease is recommended. The optimal
      approach to reducing treatment in patients with asthma treated with combination inhaled
      corticosteroids and long-acting beta agonists (ICS/LABA) is not clear. The American Lung
      Association Asthma Clinical Research Center (ALAACRC) is a network of 18 asthma research
      centers with the goal of performing clinical trials directly relevant to clinical practice.
      The question of the optimal way to de-escalate therapy in patients with asthma that is well
      controlled on fixed dose combination ICS/LABA is a key question for practitioners caring for
      patients with moderate to severe persistent asthma. We propose a 56 week multi-center,
      prospective, randomized, three-arm parallel group comparative effectiveness study comparing
      three approaches to care of patients with asthma well-controlled for three months on
      combination ICS/LABA: reduction of ICS dose and maintenance of LABA, initial discontinuation
      of LABA with continuation of ICS, and continuation of stable dose ICS/LABA. Our primary goal
      is to perform a pragmatic study that resembles clinical practice and determine the optimal
      treatment strategy that results in the lowest rate of treatment failure over 48 weeks of
      follow-up. Additional exploratory analyses include assessing risk factors for step-down
      failure, and to assess the duration of time that asthma control is maintained when therapy is
      de-escalated.
