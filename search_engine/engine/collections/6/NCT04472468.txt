      incidence as high as 21%. The occurrence of malignant pericardial effusion significantly
      impacts on patient's survival and quality of life. While pericardiocentesis provide effective
      relieve from life-threatening situation such as cardiac tamponade, recurrence of pericardial
      effusion after pericardiocentesis is common and occurs in as high as 31% of patients.
      Retrospective data has shown that prolonged pericardial drainage might reduce the recurrence
      rate but at the cost of increased risk of infection and prolonged hospital stay. Surgical
      pericardiotomy was used in the past but was not shown to reduce recurrence over prolonged
      pericardial drainage and is associated with a higher rate of complications. Surgical
      pericardial window creation via a mini-thoracotomy might be an effective treatment and can be
      considered in patient with pericardial tamponade. The safety and feasibility of Percutaneous
      Balloon pericardiotomy (PBP) has been first described 1993 and has been shown to be an
      alternative treatment for patient with malignant pericardial effusion. However, no data is
      available on the efficacy of PBP in reducing the recurrence of pericardial effusion, in
      comparison with standard pericardiocentesis with prolonged drainage. We aim to perform a
      single centre, randomized, prospective, open label controlled pragmatic trial to compare
      percutaneous balloon pericardiotomy (treatment) to standard pericardiocentesis with prolonged
      drainage (control) in preventing pericardial effusion recurrence in patients with malignant
      pericardial effusion.
