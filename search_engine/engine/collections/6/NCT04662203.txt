      Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) databank. All patients had hypertension in the absence
      of established cardiovascular disease, and were over the age of 65 years in 2007. Systolic
      blood pressure and frailty, measured using the electronic frailty index were recorded.
      Patients were followed up for ten years. Time to event analysis measured first ever major
      adverse cardiovascular or cerebrovascular event (MACCE), all-cause mortality and injurious
      falls. Adjustment was made for established cardiovascular risk factors.
