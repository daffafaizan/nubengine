      different intraoral devices have been used. These include intermaxillary class II elastics,
      which retract the upper and protract the lower arch, generating extrusive forces at the
      anchorage sites. Its upper distalizing action is exerted to the canine bracket and
      transmitted through the posterior teeth where the upper molar does not receive a direct
      force. The sliding jig is an auxiliary addition that exerts force to the molar by an elastic
      hanged in a jig between the lateral and the canine in class II; such mechanism decreases the
      vertical adverse effects of the elastics wearing while directing the distalizing force to the
      molar.

      A randomized, unblinded, clinical trial comparing 30 units of analysis (hemi arches) in which
      were placed sliding jig or stand alone elastics were perform.
