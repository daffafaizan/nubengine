      controversial. There is no randomized comparison of a dose-dense NACT (TP or TIP-schedule)
      followed by hysterectomy and LNE (investigational Arm A) versus primary chemo-radiation
      (standard arm B). Primary endpoint is the DFS at 5 years, secondary endpoints local control
      at 5 years, OS at 5 years, QOL, questionnaires on sexual activity/QOL.
