      movements. Limited hand functionality is a major negative outcome after stroke, negatively
      affecting patients' recovery and independence, with major impact on rehabilitation.However,
      standard motor rehabilitation outcome is often suboptimal, because insufficient or
      non-specific treatment is provided. Robotic hand mobilization and functiona electrical
      stimulation grasp rehabilitation each improve motor capabilities in grasp impaired patients,
      but they do so by different mechanisms.

      Robotic hand mobilization achieves grasp rehabilitation by providing passive mobilization of
      the affected limb if the subject does not react to the designed task.

      Functional electrical stimulation achieves grasp rehabilitation by inducing localized muscle
      contraction, that is by providing an electrical field able to stimulate both sensory afferent
      pathways and lower motor neurons in the targeted volume.
