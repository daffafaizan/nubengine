    
      Sjögren's syndrome (SS) is a rare chronic systemic autoimmune disease characterized by
      destruction of the exocrine glands, including the salivary glands leading to hyposiala. The
      lack of saliva exposes the patient to dental caries, and dental wear although this has rarely
      been described in Sjögren's patients. Moreover, these patients seem to have more inflammation
      and gingival recession, but not clinical attachment loss, although this has not been clearly
      identified in the literature.

      The present research focuses on the characterization of tooth wear and gingival recession
      prevalence in patients with Sjögren syndrome. A correlation of this parameters with salivary
      parameters (Xerostomia Inventory to assess the dryness, unstimulated salivary rate,
      stimulated salivary rate, pH and buffer capacity) will be assessed.

      The salivary samples will be kept in a biological collection within the URP2496 for later
      cross-sectional research purposes to identify salivary changes associated with increased risk
      of dental wear, dental caries, periodontal wear or periodontal inflammation (biological
      collection CB-SJO).

      This is a descriptive, prospective, open-label, non-interventional, single-center study with
      collection of salivary samples (CB-SJO) from a sample of patients with Sjögren's disease as
      part of the patient's routine care.

      Patients will be recruited in the oral medicine department of the AP-HP Charles Foix hospital
      (Ivry/seine).

      The time-line of the research is consistent with the usual patient management in oral
      medicine department. As Sjogren is a rare disease, we plan an inclusion period of 36 months.
      There is no specific follow-up due to the research.
