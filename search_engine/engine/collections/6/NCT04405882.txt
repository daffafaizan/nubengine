      treatment of cornea ectasia performed with transepithelial topographic guided laser
      simultaneous Central Corneal Remodeling (CCR) and Cross-linking (CXL).

      Methods In this retrospective study 8 eyes of 8 patients (mean age 31.50Â±14.73 years)
      affected by cornea ectasia underwent simultaneous CCR and CXL. Preoperative and 6 month
      postoperative uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVC) and distance corrected visual acuity
      (DCVA) were measured using the Efficacy and Safety index. Objective and subjective quality of
      vision were evaluated preoperatively and 6 months postoperatively using corneal morphological
      irregularity index (CMI), National Eye Institute Visual Function NEI-VFQ25 and NEI-VFQ39
      questionnaires.
