    
      This is a single arm prospective trial in patients with newly-diagnosed advanced renal cell
      cancer (RCC) who were scheduled for sunitinib therapy and utilized an extensive panel of
      quantitative metrics on baseline and interim FDG PET/CT to evaluate the predictive utility of
      each of these measurements.

      The objectives were to evaluate the FDG PET/CT measurement parameters for prediction of
      prognosis after sunitinib therapy in patients with RCC using histopathologic (post-therapy
      nephrectomy) or clinical follow-up for validation.
