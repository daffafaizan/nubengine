      quantitative and qualitative composition as Copaxone速, with regard to active substance and
      excipients and is presented in the same dosage form (pre-filled syringe containing a solution
      for injection). Introduction of GTR is anticipated to have a price lowering effect and will
      give doctors and patients more choice in the pharmaceutical armamentarium for MS.

      This trial consists of two parts:

      Part 1 is a multi-country, multi-centre, randomized, double-blind, active and
      placebo-controlled, equivalence trial comparing the efficacy and safety and tolerability of
      GTR versus Copaxone速 in subjects with RRMS. Eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to
      receive daily 20 mg GTR (Synthon BV), 20 mg Copaxone速 (TEVA) or placebo for a period of 9
      months.

      In Part 2, the trial continues as an open-label uncontrolled trial to evaluate efficacy and
      safety of long-term treatment with GTR. Subjects completing the 9-month double-blind period
      will be treated with open-label 20 mg daily GTR for another 15 months.
