      one-on-one cognitive training program on memory, visual and auditory processing, processing
      speed, reasoning, attention, and General Intellectual Ability (GIA) score for students ages
      8-14. In Phase 1, participants will be randomly assigned to either an experimental group to
      complete 60 hours of one-on-one cognitive training or to a wait-list control group. In Phase
      2, the wait-list control group will complete the intervention using an alternative delivery
      model: 50% clinician delivered and 50% digital delivery.
