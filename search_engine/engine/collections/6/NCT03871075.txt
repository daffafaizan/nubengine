      unwilling to exercise. Therefore, in people with PAD, the investigators will determine
      whether intermittent pneumatic compression augments the benefits of exercise and whether
      intermittent pneumatic compression alone improves walking performance compared to sham
      control. The investigators will conduct a randomized trial (2 x 2 factorial design) of 230
      PAD participants randomized to one of four groups: Group A: intermittent pneumatic
      compression + exercise; Group B: intermittent pneumatic compression+ "no exercise" control;
      Group C: sham control + exercise; and Group D: sham control + "no exercise" control. The
      intermittent pneumatic compression and sham interventions will be delivered for six months.
      The primary outcome is change in six-minute walk distance at 6-month follow-up. In secondary
      aims, the investigators will determine whether the benefits of intermittent pneumatic
      compression persist even after intermittent pneumatic compression is discontinued and
      delineate mechanisms by which intermittent pneumatic compression affects walking performance,
      by measuring changes in MRI-measured calf muscle perfusion and physical activity. The
      investigators will determine whether intermittent pneumatic compression improves systemic
      endothelial function, by measuring changes in brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD).
