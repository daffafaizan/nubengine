      doses (application durations), and will receive either NGX-4010 patch (high-concentration
      capsaicin) or matching control (low-concentration capsaicin).

      Participants who complete the study evaluations for 12 weeks will have the option of
      receiving up to 3 additional open-label re-treatments over 1 year.
