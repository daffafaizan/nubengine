      (R-GemOx) achieved high efficacy with a low toxicity profile in relapsed and refractory
      DLBCL. This regimen might be considered a putative treatment option for elderly patients. To
      our knowledge, the efficacy and safety of R-GemOx when given as first-line therapy in elderly
      patients with DLBCL remains unknown. The investigators therefore developed a two-weekly
      regimen of rituximab combined with GemOx regimen as first line treatment in elderly DLBCL and
      investigate its efficacy and safety.
