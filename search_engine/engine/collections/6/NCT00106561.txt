      leak, the worse the damage and the more likely the patient will lose their kidney function
      long term. Interventions that lower protein leak make the kidneys last longer.

      There are 2 groups of medications, both blood pressure tablets, the ACEI (angiotensin
      converting enzyme inhibitors) and ATRB (angiotensin receptor blockers) which have shown to
      reduce the amount of protein leaking from the kidney and as a result lengthen the life of the
      kidney. There has also been evidence that using these 2 tablets in combination is better than
      using either one alone. In spite of these tablets, there still remain some patients that
      continue to leak protein in the urine.

      Recently there has been evidence that the tablet spironolactone, which is a fluid tablet,
      also reduces protein leakage from the kidney. In this study we look at various combinations
      of these tablets to see which works best to lower protein leakage from the kidney.

      Patients are divided into 4 groups. Each group will receive the tablet ramipril (an ACEI). In
      group 1, patients will be on ramipril and 2 blank tablets, group 2 will be on ramipril,
      irbesartan (an ATRB) and a blank tablet, group 3 will be on ramipril, spironolactone and a
      blank tablet and group 4 will be on ramipril, irbesartan and spironolactone. Protein leakage
      is measured at the beginning and after 3 months of treatment.
