      epidural drug action. Most studies have focused on the inter-related triad of dose,
      concentration and volume.

      We compare three groups: group A: 10ml of 0.5% bupivacaine; group B: 10ml of 0.25%
      bupivacaine and group C: 40ml of 0.0625% bupivacaine. When comparing these groups, groups A &
      B have the same volume of epidural drug, and groups B & C have the same total dose.

      In particular this study compares different methods of assessing the sympathetic block
      (causing vasodilatation). These methods include skin temperature changes, hemodynamic changes
      and photoplethysmography.
