      promotion and coordination between the social and health sectors, for 6 months, through the
      use of information and communication technology (ICT) tools that operate as an interface for
      the integrated care model. The study subjects are chronic patients with health and social
      conditions that are susceptible to be treated in a collaborative and coordinated way in the
      field of primary health care. A sample size of 141 patients was estimated. Questionnaires
      will be used at baseline and at 6, 9 and 12 months after the beginning of the study for the
      evaluation of quality of life, treatment adherence, medical service and caregiver overload.
      The principal variable is the quality of life. For statistical analysis, comparisons of means
      and proportions at different time points will be performed. One discussion group will be
      performed with the aim of improving the care model according to professionals' opinions. A
      thematic content analysis will be carried out.
