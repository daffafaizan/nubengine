      Crohn's disease can affect any part of the digestive tract, from mouth to anus, and
      inflammation can be present in all layers of the intestinal wall. Ulcerous Colitis is
      primarily located in the inner layer of the colonic bowel wall.

      In the pediatric population, current diagnostic strategies involve blood tests, fecal
      sampling (calprotectin), magnetic resonans (MRI) scan and both upper and lower endoscopies.
      In this population endoscopy requires general anesthesia and involves the risk of bowel wall
      perforation.

      A known method of identifying inflammation is by Positron Emission Tomography (PET). In this
      procedure a radioactively labelled sugar molecule is injected into the blood stream via a
      venous catheter. The inflammatory cells take op relatively more of the sugar, compared to
      normal cells, and the cells are visible on the scan. Until now the anatomic localization of
      the inflammation has been poor but recently is has become possible to combine the MRI scan
      with PET resulting in excellent localization, with minimal radiation exposure (corresponding
      to 1 year background radiation in Denmark).

      To make diagnosis and identification of inflammation flares during treatment safer for
      children and adolescents we aim to investigate whether PET/MRI is accurate in diagnosing IBD
      in children and adolescents and in diagnosing flares in children with Crohn's disease.
