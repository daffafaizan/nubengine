    
      Salvage Peanut Oral Immunotherapy Study is a single-arm, open label trial of peanut flour
      oral immunotherapy (OIT) administered for 6 months followed by introduction of dietary peanut
      for an additional 6 months.

      The peanut OIT phase will involve approximately 3 months of dose escalation up to a
      maintenance dose of 300 mg peanut protein. This is followed by 3 months of daily maintenance
      dosing with 300 mg of peanut protein. Patients are then transitioned to the dietary peanut
      phase ingesting common foods containing approximately 300 mg of peanut protein daily.

      Safety will be assessed during both peanut OIT and dietary peanut phases with adverse events
      recorded including gastrointestinal side effects. They will also be monitored for any
      anaphylaxis or injectable epinephrine administration. Data regarding compliance with peanut
      OIT will be collected as well.
