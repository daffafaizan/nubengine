      populations, but the mechanisms of increased susceptibility to atrial fibrillation are still
      unknown. In this study, the investigators look to further examine genetic and medical
      co-morbidity influence of atrial fibrillation duration and response to medications. In
      Specific Aim 1, the investigators propose the creation of a Veterans Affairs AF Biorepository
      (VAAFBio), which is a resource that will collect and store clinical, demographic, blood and
      DNA samples from patients with atrial fibrillation to aide this study and future studies of
      this type in the VA population. In Specific Aim 2, the investigators will examine common
      genetic polymorphisms in veteran patients with atrial fibrillation and examine
      gene-environment interactions with risk factors for atrial fibrillation.

      Patients will be identified through the VA inpatient and outpatient clinic, and will be
      approached for inclusion in the study. The target enrollment for the research and
      biorepository is 600 participants. A detailed family history, medical background, study
      questionnaires and a blood sample will then be obtained by the principal investigator or a
      research coordinator, following written informed consent under a protocol approved by the
      Jesse Brown VA Institutional Review Board. Once enough samples are collected, coded DNA
      samples will be sent out to analyze for linkage to known/candidate loci for AF.
