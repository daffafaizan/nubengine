    
      ATN 114 is a cross-sectional substudy of ATN 106. In addition to sharing data collected in
      ATN 106, an oral rinse sample along with the subject's self reported history and medical
      chart abstraction of HPV vaccination status and medical chart abstraction of a history of
      oral condylomata, oral dysplasia and oral tumor viruses will be collected in ATN 114.

      Recruitment is expected to last approximately one year, similar to the same timeframe for ATN
      106. Enrollment may be terminated earlier at the discretion of the ATN Executive Committee
      and/or the ATN 114 protocol team should ATN 106 also terminate enrollment early. Individuals
      who have agreed to participate in ATN 106 may be simultaneously approached at any clinic
      visit, or, for community-based sites, contacted directly for participation in ATN 114. Site
      staff may also contact individuals via phone, e-mail, or any other agreed-upon methods of
      communication. Site staff should try as much as possible to incorporate the study visit into
      a regularly scheduled clinic visit.
