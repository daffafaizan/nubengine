    
      This trial is designed as a prospective, multi-center, observational study of "all-comers"
      eligible adult subjects presenting to participating Emergency Departments (EDs) with symptoms
      suggestive of ACS and/or myocardial ischemia. Subjects presenting with symptoms suggestive of
      ACS will be screened and approached for consent for study enrollment by trained personnel.

      After obtaining written informed consent, subjects will have up to 4 blood samples collected
      for cTnI testing using the Meritas Troponin I test and Meritas point-of-care (POC) Analyzer.
      Blood draws and testing will occur at 4 intervals over 24 hours.
