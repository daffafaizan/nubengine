      recurrent fluorouracil refractory adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum treated with
      irinotecan and cyclosporine. II. Determine antitumor activity, safety, tolerance, and
      toxicity of this combination treatment in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive cyclosporine IV over 6 hours and
      irinotecan IV over 90 minutes weekly for 4 weeks. Courses repeat every 6 weeks. Patients
      receive at least 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-45 patients will be accrued for this study over 14 months.
