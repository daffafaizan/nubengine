    
      To evaluate the effect of CG on standing static balance in patients with EDS, this study is a
      pilot study, carried out according to a cross-over scheme of type AB/BA.

      Each patient will benefit from 2 posturological evaluations, namely without CG (treatment A)
      and with CG (treatment B). Patients will be randomly assigned to 2 groups: the AB or BA
      sequence will be randomized for each patient.

      For each evaluation, a measurement with eyes open and eyes closed will be performed.

      A clinical balance assessment by the Berg test will be performed for each of the conditions.
