      wound device as compared to standard of care to prevent or eliminate infection in torso and
      extremity wounds. Patients 18-85 years of age admitted for treatment of open wound(s) will be
      screened for inclusion criteria and asked to consent to participate in the randomized study.
      The first 10 patients will be treated with the PWD + gentamicin and will serve as a safety
      subset. Baseline measurement of serum antibiotic concentraion will be taken prior to PWD
      placement and one day after. Following the safety subset, 50 patients will be randomized to
      standard of care or to a single application of the PWD + gentamicin. Baseline assessments
      will be completed on day 0, including screening, pre-procedure wound evaluation, imaging,
      assessments, and specimen collection. Follow-up assessments will be completed and data
      gathered at days 1,2,3 and 4. All data collected of the study participants will be used to
      evaluate the PWD delivery of antibiotic.
