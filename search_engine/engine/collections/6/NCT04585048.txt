      a clinical psychologist, using a semi-structured interview (ADIS), designed to diagnose the
      child and to determine the level of symptom severity. The parents who are identified as the
      main-caregiving, complete questionnaires assessing the child's levels of SM symptoms and
      social anxiety (SMQ, SASC), the parents' levels of social anxiety (LSAS, SPIN) and depression

      baseline, and 24 weeks from baseline. participants of the waiting list group will commence
      treatment following the 24 weeks waiting period.
