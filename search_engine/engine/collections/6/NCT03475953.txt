    
      This is a multicenter, prospective open-labeled phase Ib trial based on a dose escalation
      study design (3+3 traditional design) assessing three dose levels of Regorafenib given in
      combination with Avelumab (no dose escalation for Avelumab) in patients with advanced
      digestive solid tumors followed by independent phase II trials to evaluate the association of
      Regorafenib at the RP2D with Avelumab in 10 cohorts of advanced or metastatic tumors :

        -  Cohort A: Colorectal cancer not MSI-H or MMR-deficient

        -  Cohort B: GIST

        -  Cohort C: Oesophageal or gastric carcinoma

        -  Cohort D: Biliary tract cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma

        -  Cohort E: Soft-tissue sarcoma (STS)

        -  Cohort F: Radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer (RR-DTC)

        -  Cohort G: Neuroendocrine gastroenteropancreatic tumors (GEP-NETs)

        -  Cohort H: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)

        -  Cohort I: Solid tumors (including soft-tissue sarcoma) with immune signature (TLS+).

      In addition, to evaluate in a phase II trial, the association of a low-dose of regorafenib
      (80mg/day) with avelumab :

      - Cohort A': colorectal not MSI-H or MMR-deficient (low dose)
