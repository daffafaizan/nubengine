      will undergo a six-week course of radiotherapy with concurrent chemotherapy (temozolomide).
      Between three and seven weeks after completing radiotherapy/chemotherapy, patients will
      undergo leukapheresis to collect white blood cells. These cells will be grown into dendritic
      cells, and cultured with tumor cells from the individual patient. Vaccinations will be given
      every two weeks for a total of three vaccinations. Four weeks after the third vaccination
      patients will resume chemotherapy for one year or until disease progression.
