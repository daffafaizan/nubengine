      solution in the population of cardiovascular (CVD) patients who were discharged from the
      hospital. The objectives include two parts:

      Objective 1: Assess the feasibilities of using the solution by means of questionnaire.

      Objective 2: Evaluate the impacts of the solution in the secondary prevention of Coronary
      Artery Disease (CAD).

      Primary outcome: Compliance of coronary disease secondary prevention at 12 months.

      Secondary outcome: Compliance of coronary disease secondary prevention at 6 months.
      Self-management behavior evaluation at the 6 and 12 months. Medication compliance at 6 and 12
      months assessed by self-reporting questionnaire. Control rates of risk factors at the 6 and
      12 months (serum LDL-C, blood pressure, fasting serum glucose); quality of life at the 6 and
      12 months (EQ-5D, Seattle angina questionnaire); MACE (Major Adverse Cardiac Event) within 12
      months (death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, hospitalization for cardiac
      reason, unplanned coronary revascularization).

      The study will be a two arm, randomized control study. The intervention group will use an
      application installed on a Pad besides standard outpatient follow up, while the control group
      will receive standard outpatient follow up.
