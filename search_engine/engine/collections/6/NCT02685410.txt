      Develop an online social network game for HIV/STI risk reduction and prevention by conducting
      a first set of focus groups with a total of 25 participants (5 focus groups with 5
      participants each) in order to better understand preferences for online social network and
      gaming platforms, characteristics and design.

      These collected data, established theoretical constructs, and the literature will be
      harnessed to develop a conceptual model for HIV/STI risk reduction and prevention in this
      specific population of women.

      From the data collected and the new conceptual model, an intervention manual will be created
      that will incorporate a culturally and socially-tailored online social network game
      intervention paper prototype and design manual. In an iterative fashion, a second series of
      focus groups will be conducted (5 groups with 5 participants each for a total of 25
      participants) to refine the intervention.

      To pilot test the prototype intervention we will determine, in a pre-post design: (a) the
      intervention's acceptability and feasibility based on self-report data on the game experience
      and (b) preliminary evidence of the efficacy of the intervention collecting data on 1)
      HIV/STI knowledge 2) intentions/attitudes regarding condom use and HIV/STI partner testing 3)
      self-efficacy to insist on condom use and HIV/STI partner testing 4) self-efficacy and
      beliefs related to sexual risk behaviors, 4) perceived social norms, and 5) behaviors related
      to condom use and partner HIV/STI testing.

      The focus of this registration record will be the participants and collected outcomes used to
      assess the prototype of the social network game. Assessments will be conducted at baseline, 2
      weeks after playing the game and at 4 weeks post follow up.
