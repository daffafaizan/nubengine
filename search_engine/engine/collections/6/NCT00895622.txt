      Primary

        -  To estimate the rates of progression-free survival at 3 years in patients with low-risk
           meningioma undergoing observation and in patients with intermediate- or high-risk
           meningioma undergoing radiotherapy.

      Secondary

        -  To study the concordance, or lack thereof, between central and parent institution
           histopathologic diagnosis, grading, and subtyping.

        -  To estimate the rates of overall survival at 3 years in these patients.

        -  To estimate the incidence rates of acute and late adverse events â‰¥ grade 2 in patients
           with intermediate- or high-risk meningioma undergoing radiotherapy.

        -  To evaluate MRI imaging predictors by central neuroradiology review at diagnosis, at any
           failure, and at 3 years.

        -  To evaluate adherence to protocol-specific target and normal tissue radiotherapy
           parameters.

      This is a multicenter study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 groups according to risk.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3-6 months for 3 years
      and then annually for 10 years.
