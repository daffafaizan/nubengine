      Phase One: A 10-week school competition using pedometers and a range of non-financial
      incentives e.g. t-shirts, pens, badges etc. (April - June 2015).

      Phase Two: End of school competition but participants will still keep the pedometers. We will
      set them various challenges over the summer to keep active (July - Oct 2015).

      Phase Three: Removal of all extrinsically motivation factors. Focus on PA maintenance.
