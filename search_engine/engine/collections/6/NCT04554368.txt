      anterior stroke. Patients were classified as having one of three grades according to the
      presence of contrast filling within the occluded vascular territory. Grade 0 was normal or
      less contrast filling in affected hemisphere, grade 1 and 2 were small and medium-large area
      without contrast filling, respectively. The Youden index was used to determine the optimum no
      contrast filling area cutoff for defining grade 1 and 2. The score was subsequently validated
      in a different population of 208 patients and compared with three established scores.
