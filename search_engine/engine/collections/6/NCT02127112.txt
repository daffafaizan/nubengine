      after flap reflection. The examiner will be blinded to the treatment and will not have access
      to information indicating treatment assignment. The examiner will never see the patient
      between the time of grafting and complete healing at 4 months. The surgical procedure will
      consist of the reflection of a split-thickness flap to expose the alveolar ridge. Following
      complete exposure of the surgical site, vertical measurements will be taken with the acrylic
      occlusal stent in place, and horizontal measurements with a specially designed digital
      caliper. After initial surgical measurements, numerous cortical perforations will be
      performed with a round bur in the area of the augmentation. The control group will receive a
      block graft and bone screw for stabilization, with voids being filled by the Optecure+CCC®.
      The test group therapy will include graft with the Optecure+CCC® and the use of Bone Pin® for
      space maintenance. Horizontal dimension will be established by graft dimensions, bone screws,
      or bone pins when necessary, for each planned implant area. Longer span edentulous spaces
      will be divided into individual sites as follows: 5 mm from natural teeth to future
      mid-implant sites and 7 mm between two future mid-implant sites. The bone pins and bone
      blocks with bone screws will be placed to allow enough exposure for augmentation to achieve 9
      mm horizontal width available for implant placement. Vertical and horizontal measurements
      will again be taken with the acrylic occlusal stent and calipers prior to flap closure. An
      resorbable membrane will cover both test and control groups. A monofilament suture material
      will be used. The surgical procedures will be documented with clinical photographs.
