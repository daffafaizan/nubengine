      I. To evaluate the efficacy of the second-generation antihistamine, loratadine, as
      prophylaxis for filgrastim (i.e., Neupogen, Zarxio) induced bone pain during stem cell
      mobilization in multiple myeloma patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To examine the frequency and quantity of supportive analgesic medications needed in
      addition to loratadine or placebo for filgrastim induced bone pain.

      II. To identify risk factors associated with developing filgrastim induced bone pain.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 cohorts.

      COHORT I: Beginning 5 days before the first dose of standard of care filgrastim, patients
      receive loratadine orally (PO) once daily (QD). Treatment continues until 5 days after
      completion of stem cell mobilization in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      COHORT II: Beginning 5 days before the first dose of standard of care filgrastim, patients
      receive placebo PO QD. Treatment continues until 5 days after completion of stem cell
      mobilization in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
