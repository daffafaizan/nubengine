      osteoporosis treatment. As many osteoporotic patients are older, many patients are under the
      deterioration of the renal function. In addition, several drugs might have the potential for
      kidney damage. But the relationship between osteoporosis drugs and kidney damage is unclear.

      The main objective of this study is to reveal relationship between osteoporosis drugs and
      kidney damage.
