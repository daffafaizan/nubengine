      acute ischaemic stroke are able to recall information given before providing informed consent
      to intravenous thrombolysis after the end of treatment. Patients with acute ischaemic stroke
      will be compared to a group of relatives who witnessed the informed consent procedure of a
      relative with acute ischaemic stroke, stroke patients who were not treated with intravenous
      thrombolysis and patients without an ischaemic stroke but similiar risk factors (admitted to
      the Departement of Cardiology and Pneumology, Charit√©, Campus Benjamin Franklin, Berlin,
      Germany).
