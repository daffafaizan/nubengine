      evidence-based structure for eliciting and documenting vital information about preferences
      for patient driven care of their serious illness. It is designed to help open the door for
      patients, families, and clinicians to talk and reflect on end-of-life issues in an ongoing
      way. The hypothesis of the Serious Illness Care Program is that adherence to the conversation
      guide portion, the SIGC, will enhance patient understanding and allow control over their own
      decisions, relieve burdens of decision-making on family members, and help patients achieve a
      state of peace as they approach the end of life. For this protocol specifically, the
      investigators are testing a pilot intervention of a quality improvement project; the
      investigators plan to train clinicians and assess the feasibility and impact of the Serious
      Illness Care Program, which includes patient identification, clinician training, "triggering"
      of clinicians to conduct the SICG conversation, and documentation, in the iCMP at the Brigham
      and Women's Hospital.
