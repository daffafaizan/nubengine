      acetylcholine receptors (β2-nAChR) by nicotine both at baseline and following administration
      of a nicotine vaccine. The number of brain β2-nAChR and the amount of nicotine occupancy both
      before and after vaccination will be measured using the nicotinic agonist [123I]5-IA-85380
      ([123I]5-IA) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). [123I]5-IA will be
      administered using the bolus plus constant infusion paradigm to smokers abstinent for 4-9
      days (time period necessary for nicotine and pharmacological active metabolites to clear from
      brain). Three baseline SPECT images will be obtained after equilibrium has been reached (~6
      hours into the [123I]5-IA infusion). Then, IV nicotine will be administered (0.5-1.5 mg/70 kg
      will be infused over 10 minutes). Following a series of 4 nicotine vaccine shots, the same
      procedure will be repeated for a second [123I]5-IA scan day. We hypothesize that occupancy of
      β2-nAChR will be significantly lower, and take longer to plateau, following nicotine vaccine
      administration.
