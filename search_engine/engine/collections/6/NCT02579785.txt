      post-abortion contraceptive uptake and continuation among menstrual regulation clients in the
      Sylhet, Chittagong and Dhaka regions of Bangladesh.

      The aim of the formative phase of the study is to develop an interactive two-way messaging
      service for post-MR clients. The messaging service will deliver information relating to the
      women's contraceptive method of choice as well as information about other modern
      contraceptive methods. This part of the study will focus on determining the modality,
      content, timing, language and acceptability of messaging services for post menstrual
      regulation clients.

      The aim of the RCT phase is to measure the effect of mHealth on uptake or switching to
      long-acting reversible contraceptives at the 4 month and 12 month follow ups. The
      investigators expect mHealth to have a positive effect on uptake and a negative effect on
      discontinuation rates of contraceptive users.
