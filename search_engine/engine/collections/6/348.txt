12083. generation of action potentials in single ranvier's nodes of isolatedfrog nerve fibres under the influence of nickel and cadmium ions (russian)by experimenting on single ranvier's nodes of frog isolated nerve fibres itwas shown that, along with a marked prolongation of the repolarizationphase of the action potential (ap), ni and cd ions also caused a rise ofthe critical membrane depolarization level and an increased ap amplitudewith somewhat reduced steepness of its ascending phase.  ni and cd ionsrestored the ap generation in the nodes of ranvier altered by a 0.01% procainesolution, by an excess of potassium ions 00mm/1. of kcl) or by slightmechanical injury during dissection.  it was only with a reduced naconcentration in the medium that the restoration of ap could be achieved.ni and cd ions considerably slowed down and weakened the cathodal rise of thecritical level and the ap reduction.  cysteine (10 -2 to 10 -3 m)eliminated all the effects of the mentioned ions.  a suggestion is made that bybinding the sh-groups of the nerve fibre proteins, nickel and cadmium reducethe rate of inactivation and the increase of potassium permeability indepolarization and also weaken the initial inactivation and the increase ofpotassium permeability in depolarization, as well as weaken the initialinactivation of the membrane (i-h), whenever this happened to be raised byprevious influences.
