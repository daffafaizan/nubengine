    
      This is a prospective randomized double blind trial of patients undergoing selective laser
      trabeculoplasty for primary open angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension. Enrolled patients
      are randomized to receive one drop of brimonidine 0.1% in one eye and one drop of
      apraclonidine 0.5% in the fellow eye. The trabecular meshwork in both eyes of each enrolled
      patient is treated 360 degrees at the same sitting. Intraocular pressure is measured in each
      eye one hour before applying the study medications and at one hour and one week after laser
      surgery.
