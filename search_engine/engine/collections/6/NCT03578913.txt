      due to its high success rate.

      Dental implants differ from natural teeth in transmission of functional loads to the bone,
      where natural teeth and their periodontal ligaments provide proprioception, early detection
      of occlusal loads and have a shock-absorbing function. Sensitivity and mobility of natural
      teeth cannot be duplicated in osseointegrated implants,1 therefore most of the forces are
      concentrated at the crest of the ridge leading to different living reaction including bone
      resorption and subsequent implant loss.

      Minimizing the occlusal loads on osseointegrated implants through selection of a new
      superstructure material that can absorb part of this excessive force could be believed to be
      a determining factor in the long-term success of an implant treatment program.

      Many restorative materials are used nowadays for construction of final restoration of implant
      supported superstructures including porcelain fused to metal (PFM), all ceramic, zirconia,
      hybrid ceramics, and polyetheretherketone (PEEK). PFM restorations are still considered as
      the gold standard because of their excellent biocompatibility, consistent esthetics, superior
      strength, and marginal adaptation. Recently, the use of new resilient superstructure material
      like PEEK-based restoration on implant prosthetics could modify the occlusal forces with
      subsequent cushioning during function.
