      methylprednisolone or placebo. Treatment is administered for 10 days. Primary
      antipneumocystis therapy with TMP/SMX or systemic pentamidine is selected by the individual
      investigator and given for 21 days. Patients are stratified at the time of randomization by
      the presence or absence of respiratory failure.
