    
      This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study will
      include subjects with persistent moderate to severe asthma who require inhaled
      corticosteroids and inhaled short-acting β2-agonists (SABAs). Subjects who pass screening at
      Visit 1 will enter a 2-3 week baseline period to confirm stable asthma symptoms and collect
      baseline data. Subjects will continue with ongoing prescribed treatment during this period,
      or as modified by the investigator based on clinical judgment. Subjects will use the SABA
      prescribed for them to alleviate asthma symptoms on an as needed basis throughout the study.
      If eligible, at Visit 2 subjects will be randomized to treatment with either IPL512,602 (20
      mg) daily or placebo in a 1:1 ratio. Randomization in each treatment group will be stratified
      into two subgroups: those receiving low to medium doses of inhaled corticosteroids (≤500 µg
      per day fluticasone or equivalent) and those receiving high doses of inhaled corticosteroids
      (>500 µg per day fluticasone or equivalent). During the 8-week treatment period, subjects
      will return to the clinic after 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks of treatment (Visits 3-7). Adverse
      event data will be collected for 14 days following the last dose administration (Visit 8).
