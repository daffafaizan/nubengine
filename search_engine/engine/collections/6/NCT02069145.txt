    
      Depending on emerging safety data from the Phase 1a study 54F28-001 with continuing dose
      escalation, additional higher dose levels of OMP-54F28 may be evaluated in this study.
      Alternative dosing schedules of OMP-54F28 may be explored based on emerging nonclinical and
      clinical data for safety, PD, PK and efficacy. The starting dose for a new dosing schedule
      will be chosen to result in an AUC equivalent to the highest dose level that cleared on the
      previously studied dosing schedule. No dose escalation of OMP-54F28 will be allowed within a
      dose cohort. Sorafenib 400 mg will be given orally twice daily (PO BID). Sorafenib dosing
      schedules with a total daily dose <800 mg (e.g. Sorafenib 400 mg once daily) may be evaluated
      in this study depending on emerging safety data from this study.
