      effects of nicotine. One study showed that nicotine eliminates some of the beneficial effects
      of the nicotine patch in reducing withdrawal symptoms. The purpose of this study was to
      examine the effects of cotinine. The results generally showed no effects on
      self-administration of cigarettes, although higher serum nicotine levels were observed on the
      highest doses of cotinine compared to placebo or lower doses of cotinine.
