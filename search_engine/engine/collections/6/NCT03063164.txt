      study. This includes a slit lamp examination of the front of the eye and a dilated
      fundoscopic examination of the back of the eye. If there is any pathology noted that would
      exclude the patient from the study, then the investigator will inform the patient and make an
      appropriate referral. Patients deemed appropriate for the study after a comprehensive
      examination including computerized videokeratography can be enrolled. Patients will undergo
      bilateral simultaneous eye surgery. Which eye is treated with the Intralase IFS 150 and which
      eye is treated with VisuMax will be randomized so there is a 50% chance for either eye to
      receive one treatment. Patients will be seen on the day of surgery, post op day one, one
      month, three months, six months and one year. Patients will receive topical antibiotics in
      each eye for one week following the procedure. Patients will receive pred forte 1% ophthalmic
      drops for one week after treatment. Patients will also receive vigamox ophthalmic drops for
      four days after treatment. All of this is within the usual and customary standard of care for
      the treatment of patients undergoing LASIK surgery.
