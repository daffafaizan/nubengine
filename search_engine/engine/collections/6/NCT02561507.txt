      Surgery News" newsletter published by the American College of Surgeons. Surgeons of all
      specialties will be invited to participate. No identifiers will be maintained with survey
      responses. In addition to the substantive questions below, typical demographic data will be
      obtained including participants' duration of practice, specialty, gender, state, etc.

      The survey will include questions intended to characterize current practice surrounding the
      decision to continue or withhold aspirin in the perioperative period. Other questions will
      focus on surgeons' knowledge of national medical/surgical organizations that have published
      guidelines on the perioperative use of aspirin. Finally, other survey questions will
      characterize surgeons' knowledge of the platelet rebound effect.
