      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and working memory - a key function of DLPFC - in
      patients with mild AD. The investigators will use a novel non-invasive brain stimulation
      approach, Paired Associative Stimulation (PAS). PAS simulates in humans the induction of
      long-term potentiation (LTP), a prototype of synaptic neuroplasticity. PAS involves the
      repetitive pairing of electrical stimulation of the median nerve with - 25 ms later -
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the contralateral DLPFC. As such, these two
      stimulations arrive simultaneously in the DLPFC and result in potentiation of TMS induced
      cortical evoked potential, analogous to in vitro LTP.

      Specific Aim 1: To compare LTP in the DLPFC among patients with mild AD and healthy subjects.

      Specific Aim 2: To assess the effect of a 2-week course of PAS (rPAS) as applied to the left
      DLPFC on LTP and performance on working memory in patients with mild AD in comparison with a
      2-week course of PAS control condition (PAS-C, described below) (rPAS-C).
