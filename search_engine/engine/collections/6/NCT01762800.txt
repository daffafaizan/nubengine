      now well established, effective treatments for COPD and are frequently co-prescribed
      (hereinafter TRIPLE therapy). The addition of ADOAIR to tiotropium improves lung function and
      quality of life and may further reduce exacerbations. GOLD 2011 thus recommends TRIPLE
      therapy as the second choice of COPD treatment strategy. However, the criteria for switching
      from each individual treatment to TRIPLE therapy are not clearly shown so far.

      This study will be conducted in Japanese subjects with COPD and will assess whether the GOLD
      2011 strategy is effective in medical practice in Japan.

      Objective(s) The objective of the study is to assess the control of COPD using a symptom and
      exacerbation risk based treatment strategy based on GOLD 2011.
