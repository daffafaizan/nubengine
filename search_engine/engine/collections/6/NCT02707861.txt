      administration of IV ibalizumab for patients completing a prior ibalizumab clinical trial
      (TaiMed-sponsored or Investigator-Sponsored). Patients will continue to receive IV infusions
      of ibalizumab at the dosage assigned in the previous study - either 800 mg once every two
      weeks, or 2000 mg once every four weeks.

      Cohort 2 will provide IV ibalizumab, 800 mg once every two weeks, for qualifying patients
      with multi-drug resistant HIV-1 and limited treatment options who have never previously
      received ibalizumab.

      Participants may continue in this study for 48 weeks, or until ibalizumab becomes
      commercially available, whichever occurs first.
