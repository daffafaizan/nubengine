      laparoscopic assisted surgery for colon cancer. Patients will randomized into one of two
      groups. The intervention group will receive combined regional and general anesthesia during
      surgery. Postoperative pain treatment will be based on regional anesthesia techniques. The
      Control group will receive general anesthesia during surgery. Postoperative pain treatment
      will be based primarily on opioids. After surgery, patients will be followed daily during
      their hospital stay. Patients will be contacted by telephone every 6 months for five years.
      Quality of life questionnaires will be administered at these follow ups.
