      current optimal treatment is unknown. Evidence supporting the effectiveness of the use of
      Inferior Vena Caval Filters is lacking. This study will compare the two standard of care
      treatment options: anticoagulation with or without an inferior vena cava filter. The
      anticoagulation medication chosen will be Arixtra and it will be given once a day as an
      injection. Patients will be called at various intervals to monitor their signs and symptoms
      of new thromboembolisms. Patients will be equally randomized to receive either Arixtra with
      or without placement of an Inferior Vena Cava (IVC) filter. Fifty three patients are expected
      to be enrolled in each arm. Patients will be monitored for 90 days after study enrollment.
      Monitoring will include telephone calls and physician visits and repeat radiologists if the
      patient is symptomatic of a Deep Vein thrombosis (DVT). This will also include completion of
      a quality of life questionnaire.
