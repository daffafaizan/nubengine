      patient-reported outcomes. This study will also evaluate the feasibility of using Fitbit
      activity monitors in a cancer population to capture objective activity data. The study will
      be recruiting patients with advanced cancer diagnoses (stage 3 or 4) and will be referred by
      the treating oncologist. This is an exploratory study that will follow patients with stage
      3-4 cancer for a period of 15 days. Subjects will be provided with a Fitbt Charge HR速
      activity monitor. They will be requested to wear the Fitbit Charge HR速 at all times, except
      for while bathing or performing other activities where the activity monitor can become
      submerged in water. Subjects will be asked to wear the Fitbit Charge HR速 for two weeks. They
      will be seen in the clinic at baseline, at the end of week 1 (day 8) and at end of 2 weeks
      (day 15) for physical exam, evaluation of performance status by both treating oncologist and
      practice nurse using standardized scales and administration of PROMIS速 questionnaires.
      Patients will be followed up to 6 months after the last clinic visit for adverse events,
      hospitalization and survival. Thirty subjects will be enrolled in this study.
