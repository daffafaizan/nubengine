      effects between groups at 1 month endpoint. Also post-procedural pain and need for
      painkillers are monitored. Compliance and reasons for non-compliance is recorded in
      compression group.

      Second endpoint is to assess mid-term (6 months) success of truncal vein occlusion as well as
      changes in Aberdeen score between groups compared to pre-operative stage.

      Study design is non-inferiority trial where in 5% margin occlusion of truncal vein is
      expected to be equal in two groups at 6 six months. Power analysis showed need for 85
      patients per group and taking into account possible dropouts anticipated n = 200.
