      vaginal estrogen in the postpartum period. Dyspareunia and vaginal/perineal pain are
      well-known sequelae after vaginal delivery. However, the contribution of postpartum vaginal
      atrophy to these issues is largely unknown. Although the relationship between lactation,
      relative estrogen deprivation, and vulvovaginal atrophy has been established, there is a
      paucity of data regarding on the prevalence of vulvovaginal atrophy symptoms in the
      postpartum period. Additionally, although the benefits of vaginal estrogen in postmenopausal
      atrophy are well-established, the benefits in the postpartum period are unknown.
