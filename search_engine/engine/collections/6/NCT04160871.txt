      levels of suffering, anxiety, stress, burden and helplessness. The treatment program with the
      most empirical support is "Family Connections". It is one of the first programs specifically
      designed to help relatives of patients with BPD. The program is an adaptation of multiple
      strategies of Dialectical Behavioral Therapy. It consists of 12 sessions with an approximate
      duration of two hours each. The results of these studies and their subsequent replications
      showed an improvement in family attitudes and perceived burden. The investigators have
      translated and adapted the program so that it could be applied to the Spanish population. The
      aim of the present study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the adaptation of "Family
      connections" in Spanish population through a controlled clinical trial. The first hypothesis
      of the study is that "Family Connections" will be more effective (significant reduction in
      the primary outcome variables), compared with a Treatment As Usual (TAU), in the posttest
      time and in the follow-ups of 3 and 6 months. In addition, a second hypothesis is that
      "Family Connections" will be more efficient (fewer abandonments, better opinion on the part
      of the patients) than TAU.
