    
      Overview of Study:

        -  Children and their parent will be scheduled to come to the University of Washington
           School of Nursing Sleep Laboratory for overnight polysomnography, and to complete
           multi-sleep latency tests and a battery of neurobehavioral performance tests the next
           day at a convenient time and day.

        -  Children will be asked to complete a sleep, symptoms (pain, fatigue), behavior, and day
           to day activity surveys, and the parent who accompanies the child to the laboratory,
           will be asked to complete surveys assessing demographics, child's usual sleep, behavior,
           school performance, health status, and family functioning.

        -  Children will also be asked to spit in a container and urinate in a container upon
           awakening in the morning after their sleep study.

      Primary Aims of the Study:

        1. Compare indices of sleep disturbances, risk factors, and type of sleep disordered
           breathing(primary snoring, upper airway resistance syndrome, obstructive sleep apnea) in
           Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) to age, sex matched control children.

        2. Compare scores on neurobehavioral tests and daytime sleepiness; and to describe
           associations between indices of sleep disturbances on neurobehavioral performance and
           daytime sleepiness in JIA to age, sex matched control children.

      Secondary Objectives:

      1. Describe and compare parent report of child's sleep habits, fatigue, behavior, school
      performance, day-to-day activity, and family functioning in children with JIA to age, sex
      matched control children.
