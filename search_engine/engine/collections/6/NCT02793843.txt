      2017. The sealed envelope technique will be used to randomly allocate females scheduled for
      elective cesarean section into two groups. After obtaining informed consent, all eligible
      patients will receive spinal anesthesia. The first group will receive 4 mg intravenous (IV)
      ondansetron with 2 ml saline while the other group will receive 4 mg IV ondansetron plus 8 mg
      (2 ml) dexamethasone.
