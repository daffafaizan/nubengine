      colon samples and ran on the two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE). The proteins on 2-DE
      were visualized by the silver stain, and then gel maps were scanned and analyzed with the
      Image Master 2D Elite. The obvious abnormal protein spots were identified by the mass
      spectrometry. Western blot 、 immunohistochemistry 、 mRNA and miRNA were also performed for
      further verification of the proteins.
