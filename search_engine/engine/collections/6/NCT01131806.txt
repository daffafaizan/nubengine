      health care resources worldwide. It is characterized by chronic progressive symptoms, airflow
      obstruction, and impaired health status, which is worse in those who have frequent, acute
      episodes of symptom exacerbation. Treatment for COPD is focused on minimizing risk factors,
      improving symptoms, and preventing exacerbations.

      Pulmonary inflammation is the key factor in COPD. Inhaled long-acting Î²2 agonists (LABA)
      improve airflow obstruction, control of symptoms, and health status in patients with COPD
      over 3 to 4 months. Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are currently the most popular
      anti-inflammatory medications for use in symptomatic patients with COPD. Previous large
      scaled randomized control study discovered long-term use of ICS didn't modified annual
      decline of lung function in COPD patients, but may reduce the frequency of exacerbations,
      especially when combined with an LABA.

      Combination treatment with ICS and LABA has been widely used for patients with COPD and
      attains an improved control of symptoms and lung function, with no greater risk of
      side-effects than that of treatment with either component alone. Combined ICS/LABA will
      result in better treatment effects that are superior to those associated with either drug
      alone. However, the treatment efficacy between high and medium dose of inhaled corticosteroid
      in combination of LABA is still unknown. The aim of the current study is to investigate the
      treatment efficacy with high and medium dose of fluticasone in combination with salmeterol in
      COPD patients.
