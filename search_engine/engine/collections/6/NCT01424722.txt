    
      This is a prospective, non-randomized, multicenter, pivotal IDE study. The intent of this
      study is to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the ST Monitoring Feature in the
      Fortify® ST, Fortify Assura® ST, and Ellipse® ST family of devices, as well as any future St
      Jude Medical devices with the same ST Monitoring Feature capabilities. Effectiveness of the
      device will be evaluated by analyzing the sensitivity of the ST Monitoring Feature to detect
      clinical events. In addition, safety of the ST Monitoring Feature will be evaluated by
      demonstrating a low percentage of patients with false positive events.
