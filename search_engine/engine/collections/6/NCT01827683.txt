      two groups (test and control) to receive the HBOT at the beginning of the trial or 2 months
      afterwards. The control group will receive its treatment after the elapsed two months.

      This study will be a prospective, randomized cross over study. After signing a written
      informed consent, all patients will be invited to a 2 hour examination, including pain
      sensitivity examination and a series of questionnaires. In addition, prior to the beginning
      of the treatment all patients will have chest X-ray, neurological examination, cognitive
      evaluation and brain metabolism evaluation (SPECT scan). A similar evaluation will be done
      after the 8 weeks, test versus control time period, and another evaluation will be held after
      16 weeks. The HBOT procedure will be performed in the hyperbaric chamber at Assaf Harofeh
      Medical Center, Israel.

      The following HBOT protocol will be applied for the treated group: 8-week, 5 times a week
      administration of 100% O2 for 90 minutes at a pressure of 2 ATA. After 8 weeks the control
      group, that did not received HBOT, will receive the same HBOT protocols.

      At baseline, after 2 months and after 4 months all patients will undergo complete neurologic
      and pain evaluation and brain SPECT scan (total of 3 evaluation and scan per patient).
