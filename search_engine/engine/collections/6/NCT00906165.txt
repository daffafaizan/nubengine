      total study duration for each patient should be 24 months.

      Straumann Bone Level Ø 4.1 mm SLActive implants will be placed for single tooth replacement,
      followed by either immediate provisional prosthetic loading or no provisionalised. The final
      prosthetic loading is made at 16 weeks after implant loading. The implant length will be
      selected according to the clinical indication of the site based on previous radiographic
      evaluation.

      In total 11 visits per patient are scheduled in this study. Bone level changes, implant
      success and survival rate, soft tissue changes, aesthetic outcome and adverse events (AEs)
      will be assessed.

      The study devices are CE- (Conformité Européenne, meaning European Conformity) marked
      products.

      One center in the United Kingdom will participate.
