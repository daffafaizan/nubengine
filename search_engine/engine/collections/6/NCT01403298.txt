      education program that focuses on general health risk behaviors related to HIV/AIDS, smoking,
      diet and exercise or one that focuses on family-based HIV/AIDS education through safe
      decision-making and control of one's emotions as well as parent-child interactions that are
      associated with dysregulated affect, subsequent parenting deficits and adolescent HIV risk
      behaviors.
