      subjects with DSM-5 trichotillomania (TTM) or skin picking disorder (SPD).

      The hypothesis to be tested is that memantine will be more effective and well tolerated in
      adults with trichotillomania or skin picking disorder compared to placebo. The proposed study
      will provide needed data on the treatment of a disabling disorder where there are not any
      current treatments options.

      This will be one of few studies assessing the use of pharmacotherapy for the treatment of TTM
      and SPD in adults. Assessing the efficacy and safety of memantine will help inform clinicians
      about additional treatment options for adults suffering from this disorder.
