      FGFR1/3 to inhibit angiogenesis. The phase II trial in advanced RCC (previous cytokine
      therapy in 25 % of patients) yielded good clinical benefits (response rate 34.6%; disease
      control 79.8%) with durable activity (progression-free to near 1 year) and acceptable
      toxicity. The randomized phase III trial in advanced RCC are ongoing and interim analysis
      revealed prolonged progression-free survival in pazopanib group compared with placebo group.
      Pazopanib is an active multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor needed to broaden it new
      indications to treat cancers. VEGF-C and FGF pathways are also important in the angiogenesis,
      metastasis, invasion, and cancer stem cell renewal in HNSCC. Pazopanib can also inhibit these
      two pathways and might offer much more suppression on tumor angiogenesis and growth in HNSCC
      compared with sunitinib. Common side effects of pazopanib are grade I to II diarrhea,
      hypertension, hair color change, and nausea, which are all manageable. Because of the
      advantageous activity against VEGF-C and FGF pathways and favorable toxicity profile
      comparing with sunitinib, we plan this phase II trial of pazopanib in cisplatin-refractory
      recurrent or metastatic HNSCC.

      Serum inflammation markers, like IL-6 (esp. in inflammation- mediated cancers, like virus-
      related hepatocellular carcinoma and HNSCC), and host/tumor VEGF/VEGFR2 polymorphism
      attracted much attention in tumor angiogenesis dependence and response prediction of
      anti-angiogenesis treatments, in addition to previously described sVEGFR2 and circulating
      endothelial progenitors(CEP) in the phase II trial of RCC. We will study serum
      IL-6/VEGF/sVEGFR2/CEP and host/tumor VEGF/VEGFR2 polymorphism for prognosis and response
      correlation.
