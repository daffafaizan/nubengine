      Respiratory disease will be will be connected simultaneously to CardiacSense watch and
      Capnograph for a duration of at least 30 minutes and up to 24 hours in order to collect data
      for the purpose of developing a wearable system for monitoring of Respiratory Rate (RR) by
      the CardiacSense watch.

      The CardiacSense1 is a wrist worn device designed to detect atrial fibrillation.
      CardiacSense1 senses the radial artery inflation and deflation and together with a PPG
      sensors give an ultimate performance that is superior to PPG only.
