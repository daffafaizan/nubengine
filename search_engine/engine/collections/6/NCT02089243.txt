      seizures after trials of two or three antiepileptic drugs are unlikely to become seizure-free
      with further attempts at resection. Such patients may experience poor quality of life and
      functional outcomes from continuing seizures and the adverse effects associated with further
      attempts at resection. Vagus nerve stimulation is a minimally invasive treatment for epilepsy
      with well-established effectiveness as an adjunctive treatment for partial seizures
      refractory to resection, but there are no vagus nerve stimulation is a minimally invasive
      treatment for epilepsy with well-established effectiveness as an adjunctive treatment for
      partial seizures refractory to resection, but there are no controlled randomized clinical
      trials comparing the effectiveness of Vagus Nerve Stimulation therapy with resection in such
      patients.
