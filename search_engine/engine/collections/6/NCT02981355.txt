      microfracture, which is conducted by penetrating the subchondral bone below the lesion. This
      procedure creates a natural healing response as a result of the bleeding and clotting caused
      by the microfracture, restoring the lesion. BST-CarGel (Piramal Life Sciences,
      Bio-Orthopaedic Division), a liquid chitosan-containing polymer scaffolding, has been
      developed as an intra-articular injectable scaffold to aid in the stabilization of the blood
      clot created by microfracture. BST-CarGel does not interfere with the normal clotting
      process; however, it enables a prolonged healing time due to the increased stabilization of
      the clot within the lesion and the inhibition of clot retraction.

      The RECORD trial is a multi-centre, randomized, controlled trial to assess the impact of the
      BST-CarGel scaffold and microfracture versus microfracture alone on short term clinical
      benefit as measured by loaded knee pain (single leg squat) on a visual analogue scale (3-6
      months), mid-long term clinical benefit as measured by the same loaded knee pain (single leg
      squat) (9, 12, and 24 months) and Tegner Activity Score (TAS), International Knee
      Documentation Committee (IKDC), and Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis (KOOS) at 3, 6, 9, 12 and
      24 months post-operatively. Approximately 158 participants with full-thickness grade III and
      IV cartilage lesions will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive one of the two treatments
      during an arthroscopic procedure and will be followed for up to 24 months to collect
      outcomes.
