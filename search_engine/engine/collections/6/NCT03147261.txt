    
      Objectives: 1) Apply a comprehensive therapeutic nutrition intervention program for
      monitoring the Mediterranean Diet (DM) slightly hypocaloric along with increased physical
      activity in children with central obesity 7-16 years). 2) Measure the effectiveness of this
      program by assessing changes in body composition, lifestyle and biological and molecular
      parameters (genetic and epigenetic).

      Methodology: test randomized, longitudinal, controlled, two-year intervention field comparing
      a sample of 120 subjects from 7 to 16 years with central obesity, the effect of two
      interventions: a) intensive on lifestyle with a reduced calorie DM , physical activity and
      behavioral therapy, b) non-intensive with healthy diet recommendations following the usual
      pediatric advice. At 2, 6, 12 and 24 months after follow up changes will be assessed: a) the
      HOMA index, body fat, and the cardiovascular risk factors, b) diet, sleep patterns, physical
      exercise using questionnaires and accelerometers (intervention group), and c) the quality of
      life. genetic and epigenetic markers will be evaluated by genotyping SNPs genes related to
      RI; and the analysis of: a) DNA methylation in genes related to insulin resistance, b)
      expression of microRNAs and target genes related to insulin resistance and c) measure the
      length of telomeres. The therapeutic program will consist of individual sessions and group
      workshops for the patient and the family.
