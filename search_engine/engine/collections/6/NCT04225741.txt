      among gynecological cancers. One in every four women with cancer in the world has breast
      cancer. The International Cancer Agency reported that there were around 2,088,849 new cases
      and 626,679 deaths due to breast cancer worldwide in 2018. The incidence of breast cancer is
      higher in developed countries than in developing countries, but the numbers of deaths due to
      breast cancer are lower in developed countries than in developing countries.

      It is known that breast self-examination, clinical breast examination and mammography play an
      important role in making an early diagnosis of breast cancer. The uptake rate for mammography
      performed on a regular basis is low because this is an expensive method, considering that not
      all individuals have health insurance and public funding is inadequate, especially in
      developing countries. Hence, breast self-examination (which has no cost) and clinical breast
      examination (which only has low cost) remain important diagnostic methods. Moreover, during
      clinical breast examination, healthcare professionals have the opportunity to advise on
      breast cancer, risk factors, prevention methods and screening methods.
