      post-stroke. IC is a well studied, well tolerated intervention which has been shown to
      improve regional blood flow, motor neuron excitability and muscle function in multiple
      patient groups and in young, healthy subjects. Because IC targets three physiological systems
      which are all affected by stroke, the investigators hypothesize that repeated bouts of IC
      will result in improved motor function of the paretic leg.
