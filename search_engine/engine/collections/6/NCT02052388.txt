    
      This is a randomized, multi-center, double-blind study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      three regimens of brilacidin compared to an active control, daptomycin, in subjects with
      ABSSSI. Subjects must have infections that warrant intravenous therapy but may be treated as
      either inpatients or outpatients.

      Eligible subjects will be randomized to one of 4 treatment groups in a 1:1:1:1 ratio.
      Subjects randomized to brilacidin will receive either a single intravenous infusion (0.6
      mg/kg or 0.8 mg/kg) followed by six days of once daily placebo, or a three day regimen (0.6
      mg/kg on Day 1 followed by 0.3 mg/kg on Days 2 and 3) followed by 4 days of once daily
      placebo. Subjects randomized to daptomycin will receive 7 days of treatment. Subjects will be
      assessed for both clinical and microbiologic efficacy 48-72 hours after the first dose of
      study drug. After an assessment at Day 7-8, subjects will be again be evaluated for efficacy
      at Day 10-14 and via a phone contact at Day 21-28.

      Approximately 200 subjects randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive one of the three
      brilacidin regimens or daptomycin will be evaluable. The primary efficacy outcome, early
      clinical response 48-72 hours after the first dose of study drug, will be determined in the
      Intent-to treat (ITT) population. Additional efficacy and safety analyses will be performed.
