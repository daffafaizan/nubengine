      injuries reported in all sports.Chronic ankle instability (CAI) is characterized by life-long
      persistent symptoms in 40% of people with recurrent LAB sprain.

      It has been reported that there is a change in sensorimotor function in the activity of
      individuals with CAI, and they are more dependent on visual information in balance parameters
      on one leg.While the somatosensory input was clinically feasible; The obstruction of the
      visual input has been limited in two ways, the eyes being fully open or fully
      enclosed.However, this changing dynamic has provided a means for the prevention of visual
      input during more sporty maneuvers, to directly reach compensatory neuroplastic sequelae
      after injury and to function in a functional way to train the neuromuscular system.This
      technological innovation makes this possible by reducing the visual input without completely
      eliminating it.This innovation, called stroboscopic goggles technology, provides a mechanism
      to disrupt to any degree between eyes closed and open in the visual system.

      Stroboscopic vision, characterized by intermittent vision obstruction, can be a clinical tool
      that allows clinicians to study sensory feedback in a progressive manner without fully seeing
      visual information. So use stroboscopic goggles to prevent visual information, you can
      improve the functionality by emphasizing the somatosensor information.In particular, visual
      manipulations can significantly influence the healthy adult electrocortical dynamics and
      balance control by triggering the contradiction between visual adult, vestibular and
      proprioceptive inputs.

      The aim of this study, which was planned for this purpose, will be to evaluate the effects of
      neuromuscular exercises performed on stroboscopic environment on equilibrium, neural feedback
      and running mechanics.
