      the limitations of conventional laparoscopy in the performance of complex mini-invasive
      procedures. The study is designed to explore the clinical outcomes of the robotic distal
      gastrectomy by comparing short- and long-term outcomes including financial cost of robotic
      and laparoscopic distal gastrectomy in the treatment of gastric adenocarcinoma （cT1-4a, N-/+,
      M0）.
