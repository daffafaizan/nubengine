      about half of extremely preterm infants. The incidence of BPD has increased over time. It is
      most commonly defined as oxygen dependence at 36 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA).

      Infants with BPD face more than doubled odds of death after 36 weeks PMA or disability at 5
      years compared to preterm infants without BPD. BPD is associated with abnormal lung function
      throughout childhood and significantly increases health care costs. Cognitive and respiratory
      outcomes are closely linked throughout the life course; thus, optimal long--term management
      of BPD during infancy may ultimately improve cognitive outcomes of this high--risk
      population.

      Supplemental oxygen is a lifesaving therapy for premature infants; yet, there is limited
      evidence about the safety or efficacy of using supplemental oxygen to target higher versus
      lower oxygen saturations in infants with established BPD.

      Infants between the ages of 34-44 weeks post-menstrual age with moderate or severe BPD will
      be randomly assigned to higher or lower oxygen saturation target ranges. The study
      intervention will begin in the hospital and will continue at home until 6 months corrected
      age. When infants are discharged with supplemental oxygen, this will be titrated according to
      a study algorithm in order to ensure that the target saturations are maintained throughout
      the study period.
