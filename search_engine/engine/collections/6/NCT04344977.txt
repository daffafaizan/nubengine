    
      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus
      named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and causes substantial
      morbidity and mortality. There is currently no vaccine to prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2
      or therapeutic agent to treat COVID-19. The objective of this protocol is the identification
      of eligible donors and collection of anti-SARSCoV-2 immune plasma from convalescent survivors
      of COVID-19 illness.

      Potential subjects will be screened for eligibility to participate in plasma donations and
      their blood measured for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Enrolled subjects will receive a baseline
      physical and laboratory examination. Subjects with high SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody
      titers who meet standard blood bank criteria for plasma donation will then be scheduled for
      plasma collection sessions. Following testing of the collected plasma for potential
      pathogens, this plasma may be used and/or converted into an intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)
      preparation for further study.
