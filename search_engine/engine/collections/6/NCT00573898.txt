      inclusion and exclusion criteria will be conducted by each site's coordinator within 48 hours
      of initiation of daptomycin therapy. Subjects receiving daptomycin 6mg/kg (total body weight)
      once daily for a suspected/documented infection, as deemed necessary by the treating
      clinician will be screened for inclusion in the current study. Dialysate, ultrafiltrate, and
      blood flow rate utilized during the CVVHDF procedure will be determined by clinicians at
      discretion to optimize stability of patients.

      Daptomycin samples will be obtained around the third dose in an attempt to achieve
      approximate steady-state concentrations. Pre- and post-filter blood samples will be collected
      simultaneously with dialysate and ultrafiltrate specimens at multiple time points. Protein
      binding will be assessed by filtration of the serum samples at the peak drug concentration
      time points.
