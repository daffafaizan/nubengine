      anticoagulation (AC) is the standard of care and thrombolysis is recommended for those at a
      higher mortality risk. Catheter-directed therapies, mainly standard catheter-directed
      thrombolysis (CDT) and ultrasound-accelerated thrombolysis (USAT), have been introduced as
      new, more effective, and safer treatment modalities. USAT is a modification of standard
      catheter thrombolysis, utilizing a system of local ultrasound to dissociate the fibrin matrix
      of the thrombus, allowing deeper penetration of lytics. However, there is limited data
      comparing the two treatments. More rapid clearance of pulmonary thrombus by USAT compared to
      standard CDT may prove to be more effective regarding clinical outcomes and cost (e.g. via
      reduced length of ICU and hospital stay). Alternatively, if thrombus clearance is similar,
      the cost of USAT may exceed the cost of CDT (equipment and disposables), without offering any
      potential advantage.

      This controlled, randomized study seeks to determine if ultrasound acceleration adds any
      benefits in the outcomes and costs of catheter-directed thrombolysis for patients with acute
      submassive PE. The treatment with CDT or USAT are standard of care for submassive PE and
      participants will be randomized to receive one treatment or the other. Participants will have
      follow up visits at 3 months and 12 months post procedure. All the procedures, tests, and
      follow up visits are according to current standard of care.
