      undergo multiple imaging exams in the diagnosis and surveillance of the disease. CT has been
      shown to have excellent results for detecting active inflammation. In the United States MR
      has lagged behind CT in utilization for imaging the small bowel. An advantage of MR over CT
      is the lack of radiation exposure to the patient. A new oral contrast agent is available that
      provides good distension of the small bowel and allows improved identification of active
      inflammation. The purpose of this study is to compare the accuracy of MR to CT using this new
      oral contrast agent and to assess exam quality.
