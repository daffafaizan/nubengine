      tolerability was demonstrated in the Phase I trial. A cohort may be enrolled at 301 mg/m2, if
      226 mg/m2 is well tolerated. The dose determined from the Phase Ib portion of the study will
      then be evaluated in the Phase II portion.

      This design will permit evaluation of a true positive or negative response while limiting
      over exposure of patients to the study drug. If this regimen does offer a positive response,
      its reduced toxicity and potentially greater efficacy may yield better outcomes for patients
      requiring second-line therapy for UGI cancer.

      Following completion of the Phase Ib part of the present trial, the dose recommended for use
      in the Phase II part is 170 mg/m2 MBP-426.
