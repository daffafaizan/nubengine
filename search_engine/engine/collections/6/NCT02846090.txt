      huge increase . This is because of the increase the geriatric population in the community and
      advanced medical care. Surgical correction, as a treatment, solves this problem greatly
      especially with the modern surgical techniques .

      Peribulbar block reduced the admission discharge time and reduced the burden on both the
      patients and the medical team. On the other hand, it carries the risk of increased
      intraocular pressure (IOP). Which, subsequently, limit its usage in glaucoma surgery .

      Dexmedetomidine, as an alpha 2 agonist, has a well established role in decreasing intraocular
      pressure (IOP). This effect has been shown at a histological level and clinical level . It
      has been tested in many studies before as an additive to local anaesthetic to augment the
      effect of the block and to achieve an accepted level of patient sedation (**). Many routes
      have been tested such as intravenous infusion, intramuscular injection and topically with the
      local anaesthesia . There is a debate about the best route and the optimum dose that can
      achieve the desired clinical effect with the least side effects.

      There is no study, till now, has examined the effect of Dexmedetomidine in a diseased eye
      with pathology that leads to increased IOP. This study states the hypothesis that
      Dexmedetomidine locally as an additive to local anaesthesia in different doses, not only will
      increase the duration of the block or achieve some level of sedation, but also can reduce the
      IOP in this diseased eye to a level that will help the surgical conditions and improve the
      surgical outcome.
