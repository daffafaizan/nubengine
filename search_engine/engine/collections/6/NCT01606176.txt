    
      Patients with Multiple Sclerosis or other defect of neurological function with a qualifying
      symptom of chronic refractory pain, entered a seven day baseline period, followed by a 21 day
      randomised, double blind, parallel group comparison of GW-1000-02 with placebo, self-titrated
      to symptom resolution or maximum tolerated dose. The ability of the cannabis based medicine
      extract to relieve chronic refractory pain was assessed by the change from baseline in pain
      score using Box Scale-11 (BS-11) scores recorded in the patients' daily diary.
