      metastatic breast cancer who has received standard anti-HER2 directed therapy in the
      metastatic setting in Chinese patients. Subjects should have received treatment with at least

      Eligible subjects will receive margetuximab plus chemotherapy. The dosage and administering
      of margetuximab is 15 mg/kg IV Q3W. Investigators selected one of three backbone chemotherapy
