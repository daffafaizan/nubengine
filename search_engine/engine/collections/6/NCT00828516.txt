        -  To test the acupuncture and moxibustion treatment strategies to obtain a first measure
           of response for the approach(es) used in patients with breast cancer or head, neck, and
           throat cancer undergoing standard treatment for secondary lymphedema.

        -  To assess whether this treatment is an acceptable intervention to cancer patients with
           secondary lymphedema and to their health care professionals.

        -  To disseminate the data to begin to build the evidence base for using this treatment in
           the management of lymphedema.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo acupuncture and moxibustion therapy once weekly for 7 treatment
      (Series 1). After completion of therapy, patients may choose to continue treatment for an
      additional 6 treatments (Series 2).

      Patients complete a set of 4 questionnaires (i.e., sociodemographic, Short-Form-36, Positive
      and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS), and Measure Yourself Medical Outcome Profile (MYMOP)) at
      the first treatment and then periodically during study. Patients also complete a series of
      follow-up questionnaires designed to elicit feedback about their acupuncture experience.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 1 and 3 months.
