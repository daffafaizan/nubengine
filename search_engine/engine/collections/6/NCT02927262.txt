      complete and a decision not to proceed with transplantation is made or a suitable donor could
      not be identified. Subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive gilteritinib or
      placebo. Subjects will enter the screening period up to 14 days prior to the start of
      treatment. Subjects will be administered treatment over continuous 28-day cycles.
      Gilteritinib or placebo will be given daily for up to 2 years. After treatment
      discontinuation, subjects will have a 30-day follow-up visit for safety, after which the
      subjects will enter the long-term follow up period for collection of subsequent AML
      treatment, remission status, and survival (cause of death and date of death). Subjects will
      be contacted every 3 months until final database lock. Study drug will not be provided during
      the follow-up period.
