      cell carcinoma of the head and neck. However, only a small percentage of patients experience
      long-term control, necessitating new therapeutic strategies. Recently, it was shown
      preclinically and in breast tumors that abemaciclib stimulates production of type III
      interferons and hence enhances tumor antigen presentation. Abemaciclib also suppressed the
      proliferation of regulatory T cells. These events promote cytotoxic T-cell-mediated clearance
      of tumor cells, which is further enhanced by the addition of immune checkpoint blockade.
      Based on these data, a phase II trial in patients with metastatic or recurrent head and neck
      cancer who are eligible for immunotherapy is proposed to investigate the combination of
      abemaciclib with pembrolizumab. Tumor & blood analysis for interferon gamma signature will be
      explored as possible biomarkers.
