      thyroid function finally declined to hypothyroidism.

      There was no medical treatment recommended for patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis, but
      currently at euthyroid state. Levothyroxine replacement therapy starts if patients become
      hypothyroid state.

      Hashimoto's thyroiditis is a T-cell mediated autoimmune thyroid disease. The major
      auto-antigens include thyroid peroxidase (TPO) and thyroglobulin. Anti-TPO antibodies induce
      antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and cause destruction of thyroid
      tissues.

      Antimalarial agents like hydroxychloroquine have several pharmacologic effects which may be
      involved in the treatment of rheumatic diseases, but the role of each is not known. These
      include interaction with sulphydryl groups, interference with enzyme activity (including
      phospholipase, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide hydrogen-cytochrome C reductase,
      cholinesterase, proteases and hydrolases), DNA binding, stabilisation of lysosome membranes,
      inhibition of prostaglandin formation, inhibition of polymorphonuclear cell chemotaxis and
      phagocytosis.

      This study is to investigate the treatment effect of hydroxychloroquine on autoantibodies and
      disease progression of Hashimoto's thyroiditis.
