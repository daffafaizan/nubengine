      time-restricted administration in ICU. Continuous feeding is the most popular feeding
      schedule because of its less nursing burden and reducing the aspiration prevalence
      theoretically. However, previous studies demonstrated that there was no complications
      (diarrhea, distension, Ventilator associated pneumonia-VAP incidence, and so on) difference
      between these two feeding schedule. So in the nutrition guideline (A.S.P.E.N guideline),
      there was no recommendation about the feeding schedule. However, time-restricted feeding is
      more physical than continuous feeding. In ICU, the disorder of protein synthesis is a
      universal problem and is associated with ICU acquired weakness. In some animal researches,
      time-restricted feeding was proved to have a greater stimulatory effect on protein synthesis
      than continuous feeding.

      Besides of light, time-restricted feeding can adjust the biological rhythms. It is known that
      biological clocks could affect energy metabolism, emotion and so on. In the "zi wu liu zhu"
      theory of traditional chinese medicine, feeding time should be at 7:00-9:00, 11:00-13:00 and
      17:00-19:00. So researchers designed the study to compare the time-restricted feeding
      according to traditional chinese medicine and continuous feeding effect(especially protein
      synthesis) on ICU patients.
