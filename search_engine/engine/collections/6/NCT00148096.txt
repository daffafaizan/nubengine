      trigger associated with asthma, thriving in the humid microclimate favoured by modern
      housing. Could this be redressed by investment in improved ventilation in local housing? In a
      pilot study in North Lanarkshire Council housing stock, we demonstrated that dust mite
      avoidance, in combination with installation of domestic mechanical heat recovery ventilation
      (MHRV), could inhibit the re-colonisation of house dust mites by reduction of indoor air
      humidity. In this second phase, a double blind randomized placebo- controlled trial will test
      the resultant effect on asthma. It will be complete in November 2006. 140 patients with
      asthma and house dust mite allergy are being recruited and all will have new bedding,
      mattress covers and carpets cleaned. All will have MHRV units installed in their home, but
      only half will be activated, before 12 months of environmental and clinical monitoring. The
      primary endpoint is morning peak flow rate. Secondary endpoints include symptom scores,
      spirometry, rates of exacerbations, quality-of-life, and economic evaluations. Demonstration
      that well ventilated, energy efficient dwellings improve the respiratory health of patients
      with allergic asthma could be of considerable importance in helping the NHS cope with the
      commonest chronic disease in Scotland.
