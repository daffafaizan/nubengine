      TBI is lacking. Reports about the usefulness of rSO2 are contradictory as regards its
      technical reliability and clinical value. Continuous time-domain analysis comparing rSO2,
      PbtO2 and CPP has never been carried out and the correlation among these variables remains
      largely unknown. A significant association between rSO2 and these clinically important
      variables would suggest that cerebral oximetry provides relevant data signifying that rSO2
      might be a useful tool assessing cerebral oxygenation in selected patients with TBI.
