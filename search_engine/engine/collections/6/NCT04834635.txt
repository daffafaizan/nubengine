      primary surgical treatment for morbid obesity.

      The aim study is to compare primary outcome as weight loss after total wrapping of the fundus
      of the gastric excluded part (FundoRing) and non - wrapping (non - banded) standard method of
      laparoscopic one anastomosis gastric bypass and measure secondary outcome: bile reflux in the
      esophagus and GERD symptoms.

      Methods: Adult participants (n=100) are randomly allocated to one of two groups:

      Experimental surgical bariatric procedure in the first (A) group: patients (n=50) undergo the
      laparoscopic one anastomosis gastric bypass with the total wrapping of the fundus of gastric
      excluded part and suture cruroplasty if present hiatal hernia (FundoRingOAGB group); Active
      comparator surgical bariatric procedure in the second (B) group: patients (n=50) undergo the
      laparoscopic one anastomosis gastric bypass and with only suture cruroplasty if present
      hiatal hernia (OAGB group). All patients are then followed up 12, 24, 36 months after surgery
      where record the changing body mass index and and measure secondary outcome: bile reflux in
      the esophagus and GERD symptoms.
