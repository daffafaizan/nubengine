      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability and to determine maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of
      the combination of sapanisertib (TAK-228) with metformin in patients with advanced cancers
      refractory to standard therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the clinical tumor response of this combination. II. To characterize the
      pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of metformin and TAK-228.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study.

      Patients receive metformin orally (PO) 1-3 times daily on days 1-42 and sapanisertib PO daily
      on days 15-42 of cycle 1. Patients then receive metformin PO daily and sapanisertib PO daily
      on days 1-28 of cycle 2 and beyond. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up within 30 days.
