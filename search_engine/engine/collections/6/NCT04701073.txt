    
      This is a controlled study, with randomization of the patients, which aims at evaluating the
      benefit and interest of wearing a new generation lumbar belt, in patients suffering from
      non-specific low back pain. This trial is also designed to provide quality of life data and
      to assess the medico-economic interest of wearing such a lumbar belt.

      This is an interventional study with low risks and constraints that does not deviate from the
      local standard of care for enrolled patients. No invasive examination or procedure is
      performed; as such, there will be no additional risks for participating patients.

      203 patients will be followed during 12 weeks in up to 20 investigational sites Patients
      meeting all eligibility criteria will be included in the study and randomized into one of the
      two following groups on a 1: 1 ratio.

        -  Control group "usual care": promotion of physical activity and taking usual medicines
           for pain relief

        -  Intervention group: wearing the LombaStab belt in addition to usual care (promotion of
           physical activity and taking usual medicines for pain relief).

      Three visits will be performed:

        -  Inclusion visit - baseline D0 - V0

        -  Follow-up visit at week 4 (+/- 5 days) - V1

        -  Follow-up visit at week 12 (+/- 5 days) - V2

      At inclusion visit, after verification of the eligibility criteria, data regarding patients
      will be collected: demographic data, low back pain history, medical and surgical history,
      concomitant medications.

      At each visit will be performed:

        -  physical examinations and score assessment by the investigator: ODI score,
           finger-to-floor distance test, Schober Mac Rae test

        -  medical interview with patient in order to collect the following information:
           description of pain, drug consumption, duration of sick leave and resumption of activity
           at work, use of medical resources (consultations and complementary).

        -  reporting of all AEs and device deficiencies

      Patients will be asked to complete on-line questionnaires, following visits and each week.
