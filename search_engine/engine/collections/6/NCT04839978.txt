      populations, and disproportionately burdened American Indian populations. Therefore, the
      Cherokee Nation (CN) and Emory University public health scientists have designed an opioid
      prevention trial to be conducted in at-risk rural communities in the CN (in northeast
      Oklahoma) with primarily White and American Indian adolescents and young adults. The goal of
      this study is to implement and evaluate a theory-based, integrated multi-level community
      intervention designed to prevent the onset and escalation of opioid and other drug misuse.
      The researchers propose a cluster randomized trial building directly on the success of their
      most recent previous trial, which demonstrated that the intervention effectively reduced
      alcohol and other drug use among American Indian and other youth living within the CN. Two
      distinct intervention approaches-community organizing as implemented in the established
      Communities Mobilizing for Change and Action (CMCA) intervention protocol, and universal
      school-based brief intervention and referral as implemented in the established Connect
      intervention protocol -will be expanded and integrated to further enhance effects in
      preventing and reducing opioid misuse. The CMCA and Connect interventions were originally
      designed to target adolescent alcohol use, but nevertheless showed significant beneficial
      effects on use of other drugs, including prescription drug misuse. The proposed study will:
      (1) further improve the design of the interventions with increased focus on opioids, (2) test
      the expanded, integrated versions in a cluster randomized trial, and (3) design and test new
      systems for sustained implementation within existing structures of the Cherokee Nation.
      Building upon the extant prevention science evidence, this study will respond to a gap in
      evidence concerning opioid misuse prevention among at-risk adolescents transitioning to young
      adulthood among American Indian and other rural youth.
