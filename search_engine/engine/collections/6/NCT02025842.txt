      particularly patients with liver cirrhosis. Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is one of the most
      frequent underlying causes of HCC. Several studies have demonstrated that variations in the
      hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotype have different effects on HCC. HBV genotypes C and D had
      lower responses to interferon-based therapy and higher frequencies of basal core promoter
      mutations than genotypes A and B.For this reason, HBV genotypes C and D seem to lead to more
      severe liver disease, including cirrhosis, compared with the other HBV genotypes. Because
      liver cirrhosis is one of the strongest HCC risk factors in CHB patients, antiviral therapy
      may prevent the development of liver complications such as HCC. The aim of this study is to
      evaluate the impact of liver fibrosis and other variables, such as age, sex, virological
      response (VR), and resistance to nucleoside/nucleotide analogue (NUC) therapy, in a
      population of genotype D HBeAg-negative CHB patients treated with long-term NUC therapy.
