      rapid recovery with minimal side effects. Opioids are commonly used analgesics during ESWL.
      Fentanyl is a potent synthetic narcotic, which has rapid onset and a short duration of
      action, it offers an acceptable analgesia during ESWL but has a noticeable respiratory
      depression.

      Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is a method in which low voltage
      electrical impulses transmit through electrodes attached to the skin over a painful area. It
      is usually used to relieve a variety of painful conditions. A TENS unit contains electrical
      signal generator, a battery in addition to a set of electrodes. The TENS is small,
      programmable and the generator can deliver stimuli with different current intensities, pulse
      rates and pulse width.

      The mechanism of analgesia by TENS has been explained by many theories. the gate control
      theory by Melzack and Wall, stated that "when an electrical current is applied to a painful
      area, transmission of pain through small diameter fibers is inhibited by the activity of the
      large diameter, fast-conducting proprioceptive sensory fibers, closing the gate to the pain
      perception to the brain". Another mechanism suggested is activation of descending inhibitory
      pathway, via release of endogenous opioids.
