      may develop over time and is, therefore, especially important in longterm PD. However, the
      study on UFF is very limited so far, there are still lack of biomarker for early detection
      and intervention of UFF.

      Proteomics uses a rapidly evolving group of technologies to identify, quantify, and
      characterize a global set of proteins. It is characterized by high-throughput, high
      specificity and high-sensitivity. Therefore, proteomics has become a major focus of recent
      medical research.

      This study will examine the peritoneal tissue, serum and dialysate proteins of continuous
      ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients with different types of peritoneal solute
      transport by differential proteomics techniques. Correlation analysis will be used for the
      relationship between clinical data and the differential proteins, as well as verification of
      the differential proteins in the peritoneal tissue, serum and dialysate of patients with UFF.
      This study will be performed to identify the molecular difference between different types of
      peritoneal solute transport and explore biomarker for early detection as well as early
      intervention of peritoneal ultrafiltration failure.
