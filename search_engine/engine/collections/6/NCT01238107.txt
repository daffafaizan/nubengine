      accompanying a wide range of serious illnesses, for which there are currently no widely
      approved therapeutic agents. Cachexia is defined as weight loss, associated with a chronic
      underlying disease, of at least 5% in 12 months or less. It is associated with fatigue, loss
      of muscle strength, a low fat free index and neurohormonal and biochemical abnormalities.

      Cancer cachexia occurs in about a third of all patients with cancer and has been estimated to
      be the direct cause of death in up to 20% of all cancer related deaths. As with other solid
      tumours, colorectal cancer (CRC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have relatively high
      incidences of cachexia, approximately 28% and 34% respectively.Through its combined
      pharmacological actions, MT-102 has a multi-functional effect upon three potential
      pharmacological targets, each of which is relevant for cancer cachexia
