      as part of a standard order set. The current default IV fluid order is 125mL/hr of 5%
      dextrose, either in normal saline or lactated ringers.

      Any patient delivering for the first time presenting to labor and delivery in active labor
      will be screened. If they meet inclusion requirements they will be offered enrollment.

      Subjects will be blindly randomized to receive one of three different types of IV fluids:

        1. 5% dextrose Normal saline (Normal saline plus 5g/dl of glucose) at 125 mL/hr (the
           current LBMMC default inpatient IV order set)

        2. Normal saline (a solution containing sodium and chloride) at 250 mL/hr

        3. 2.5% dextrose Normal saline at 125 mL/hr

             -  Management of labor will be at the discretion of the attending physician(s).

             -  Maternal outcomes to be measured include: 1) total amount of IV fluids
                administered, 2) length of labor, 3) epidural use, 4) oxytocin use, 5) mode of
                delivery, 6) development of maternal infections or other morbidity such as
                postpartum hemorrhage.

             -  Neonatal outcomes to be measured include: 1) birth weight, 2) Apgar scores, 3)
                hospital course (nursery placement and length of stay), 4) need for treatment of
                jaundice.
