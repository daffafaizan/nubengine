    
      The purpose of this study was to describe the outcomes of Home Based Older Persons
      Upstreaming Physical Therapy (HOP-UP-PT) program participants and then to compare these
      outcomes to non-participants. 144 participants (n=72 per group) will be randomized to either
      an experimental group (EG) or a control group (CG). Six Michigan senior centers will refer
      adults â‰¥ 65 years who were at-risk for functional decline or falls. Licensed physical
      therapists will deliver physical, environmental, and health interventions within their
      approved scope of practice to the EG during nine encounters (six in-person, three
      telerehabilitation) delivered over seven months. The CG participants are told to continue
      their usual physical activity routines during the same timeframe. Baseline and re-assessments
      are conducted at 0-, 3-, and 7-months for both the EG and CG. Descriptions and comparisons
      from each assessment encounter will be analyzed.
