      adults, and account for a substantial portion of patient morbidity and healthcare
      expenditures. Great effort has been put forth to discover effective treatments for AF/FL.
      Promising results of catheter ablation suggest that AF/FL may be eliminated in a majority of
      patients. For example, data from numerous laboratories shows that up to 85 percent of
      patients with the paroxysmal form of AF may be free of recurrences and off anti-arrhythmic
      drugs at one year follow-up.
