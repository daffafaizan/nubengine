      test, functional capacity, respiratory muscle strength and endurance, pain and cognitive
      status was assessed and recorded.

      Pulmonary function testing (PFT), mouth pressure measurement (MIP- maximal inspiratory
      pressure and MEP- maximal expiratory pressure), respiratory muscle endurance test, six minute
      walk test (6MWT) and pain threshold and tolerance test were used. In addition to
      physiological measurements, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scale was used to
      evaluate cognitive status, the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) was used
