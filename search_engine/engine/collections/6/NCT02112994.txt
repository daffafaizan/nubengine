      of sebelipase alfa in a more broad population of LAL-D participants than previously studied.
      Such participants may have been excluded from enrollment in other studies of LAL-D because of
      age, disease progression, previous treatment by hematopoietic stem cell or liver
      transplantation, less common disease manifestations, or disease characteristics that would
      preclude participation in a placebo-controlled study. This open-label study included infants
      >8 months, children, and adults. At least 4 participants in the study were to be between the
      age of 2 and 4 years. Eligible participants received sebelipase alfa at a dose of 1
      milligram/kilogram (mg/kg) every other week (qow).
