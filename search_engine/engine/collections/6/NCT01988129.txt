      implementation of a Comprehensive Firefighter Fatigue Management Program will:

        1. improve the mean total sleep, alertness and cognitive performance of firefighters;

        2. improve firefighter safety, as determined by:

             1. decreased rates of motor vehicle crashes;

             2. decreased on-the-job injuries;

        3. improve firefighter performance, as determined by decreased response time;

        4. improve firefighters' health, as determined by:

             1. diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders

             2. improved general health indices

             3. decreased number of 'sick' days

        5. improve firefighters' and families' job satisfaction and ability to cope with extended
           work hours.
