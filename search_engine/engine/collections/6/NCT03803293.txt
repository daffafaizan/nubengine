      can be coupled to electronic medical records (EMRs) for use in healthcare.The focus of this
      study is on pharmacogenomics, given the role of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) as major causes
      of morbidity and mortality, the increasing number of recognized variants included in FDA
      labels as mediators of both efficacy and toxicity, and the relative lack of stigma attached
      to carriers of variants in "pharmacogenes". Preemptive sequencing of patients interrogates
      large numbers of PGx variants and integrates clinically actionable results in a patient's
      electronic health record (EHR) for use by clinicians at the point-of-care. It is unknown,
      however, whether integration of preemptive PGx data into the EHR will significantly improve
      patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs. Therefore, the Right Drug, Right Dose, Right
      Time Using Genomic Data to Individualize Treatment Protocol (RIGHT Protocol) study was
      designed to recruit a large group of patients for preemptive PGx testing, to develop the EHR
      infrastructure to deliver clinical decision support in real time, and to study the effects of
      integrating preemptive PGx testing into clinical practice on patient outcomes.
