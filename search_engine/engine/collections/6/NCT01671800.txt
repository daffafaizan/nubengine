      fitted prostheses. This excessive sweating causes inadequate fitting and function of the
      prosthesis as well as discomfort.

      The treatment modality and techniques used are based upon a successful prior open-labeled
      pilot study done by this research group investigating the effect of Botulinum Toxin A (BOTOX)
      on residual limb hyperhidrosis, which demonstrated significant decreases in sweating in
      amputees with residual limb hyperhidrosis treated with BOTOX.

      Each subject will undergo baseline testing consisting of 15 minutes of walking on a treadmill
      (or using a handcycle) at light exertion (11 on the Berg scale). They will report the effect
      of sweating on their prosthesis fit and function over the past month, and the amount of sweat
      produced in the 15 minutes will be measured via gravimetric assessment. At the end of the
      baseline session, subjects receive either the drug or placebo by injection into the residual
      limb area they identify as being the most troublesome for sweating. Subjects return for a
      1-month follow-up session where the questionnaire, walking test, and sweat collection are
      re-administered. At the one-month follow-up session, subjects who received the placebo and
      felt it was not successful in decreasing their sweating are given the opportunity to
      cross-over into the drug arm of the trial.
