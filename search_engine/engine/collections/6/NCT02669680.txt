      function due to a precipitating event on top of an underlying chronic liver disease. As
      therapeutic options are limited the mortality rate lies between 40 and 80% at 3 months. The
      granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) mobilized stem- as well as immune cells and
      improved liver function in preclinical trials. G-CSF treatment reduced the rate of infectious
      complications and significantly improved patientsÂ´ survival in acute on chronic liver
      failure, shown recently in small randomised studies. Thus, G-CSF is a promising treatment
      option that needs to be evaluated in a multi-centre controlled trial. The GRAFT trial will
      randomise patients with ACLF between standard of care with and without G-CSF. All
      participants will be followed for 12 months in order to evaluate safety and efficacy of
      G-CSF. If successful, the GRAFT trial has the potential to change clinical practice in acute
      on chronic liver failure.
