      I. To examine how the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI) modified for use with adolescents
      (adolescent version) performs in adolescent patients who have various cancer types, who have
      undergone various treatments, and who have varying levels of symptom burden.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore the feasibility of various methods for collecting MDASI (adolescent version)
      data (for example, paper-and-pencil forms, face-to-face and telephone interviews, electronic
      data capture methods such as electronic tablets or automated telephone systems.

      II. To evaluate the MDASI (adolescent version) as an estimate of functional status and
      quality of life in adolescent cancer patients.

      OUTLINE:

      Part 1: Patients complete the MDASI questionnaire and then complete a cognitive debriefing
      interview regarding its comprehensibility, the acceptability of each item, and whether any
      important symptoms are missing from the questionnaire.

      Part 2: Patients complete the MDASI questionnaire twice (1-7 days apart). Approximately 1
      week after beginning standard of care treatment, patients complete the MDASI questionnaire at
      4 additional time points, each 1 week apart. Patients may also complete a cognitive
      debriefing interview regarding its comprehensibility, the acceptability of each item, and
      whether any important symptoms are missing from the questionnaire.
