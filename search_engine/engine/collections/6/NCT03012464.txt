    
      Full clinical assessment of the patients will be conducted by history taking querying the
      type and duration of symptoms, associated medical conditions, history of previous surgery for
      rectal prolapse, and presence of fecal incontinence which will be graded by Wexner continence
      score. In addition, patients will undergo thorough general and local examination to determine
      the type of rectal prolapse (internal or external) and the condition of the anal sphincters
      and pelvic floor muscles.

      Functional assessment of the anorectal region will be done by anal manometry to measure the
      resting and squeeze anal pressures, rectal sensation and compliance; endorectal
      ultrasonography to assess the integrity of the anal sphincters; and pudendal nerve terminal
      motor latency (PNTML) to exclude pudendal neuropathy.

      Random biopsies (2-4 in number) will be taken from the pelvic floor muscles, external anal
      sphincter, and the lateral supportive ligaments of the rectum during surgical treatment of
      rectal prolapse whether via the abdominal or perineal approach. Tissue samples will be
      preserved in formalin solution and will be sent for histopathological examination. Tissue
      samples will be subjected to immunohistochemistry to calculate the ratio between collagen
      type I and type III, and to reveal any myopathic or degenerative changes. Additionally,
      schistosomal affection of the pelvic floor muscles will be detected by immunohistochemistry
      examination for the ova of schistosomal mansoni.
