      proliferative capacity and ability to reconstitute tumors when transplanted into nude or SCID
      mice.

      Recently, cancer stem cells have been identified as a small population of tumor cells which
      possess the stem cell properties in that their self-renewal pathway is highly deregulated.
      This deregulation seems to be the prerequisite for the development of cancer.
