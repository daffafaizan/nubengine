      drinks on the market, and there are differences in the ingredients included. Previous studies
      have tried to evaluate the safety of energy drinks and have demonstrated a signal for some
      electrocardiographic (ECG) and hemodynamic effects. However, product related differences need
      further exploration. This study is designed to assess the effects of 2 different energy drink
      products on heart rhythm and blood pressure in healthy subjects.
