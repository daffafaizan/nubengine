      on the effect of dry needling on hamstring extensibility or functional performance measures
      among asymptomatic individuals with hamstring muscle tightness. The investigator wants to
      assess if individuals with tight hamstring muscles who receive dry needling in addition to a
      standard stretching exercise program, exhibit reduced hamstring tightness and improved
      functional performance compared to individuals with tight hamstrings who receive either sham
      dry needling or no needling (blunt needle) in addition to a standard stretching program.
