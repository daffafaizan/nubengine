      on the thickness of plantar fascia measured by ultrasonographic examination among patients
      with chronic plantar fascitis. Two different dosage of ESWT will be applied, and the outcome
      will be followed 3 and 6 months after the treatment. The change of plantar fascia thickness
      will be correlated with clinical improvement, including the pain improvement, foot function,
      and quality of life at follow up.
