        1. To evaluate clinically the periodontal healing with Porous variant of Bioactive Glass
           placed in the intra bony defects at an interval of 6 months.

        2. To evaluate clinically the periodontal healing with Non Porous variant of Bioactive
           Glass placed in the intra bony defects at an interval of 6 months.

        3. To evaluate the radiographic changes in the intra bony defect grafted with Porous
           variant of Bioactive Glass at baseline and an interval of 6 months.

        4. To evaluate the radiographic changes in the intra bony defect grafted with Non Porous
           variant of Bioactive Glass at baseline and an interval of 6 months.

        5. To compare clinically soft tissue healing for sites grafted with Porous variant of
           Bioactive Glass and sites grafted with Non Porous variant of Bioactive Glass in the
           treatment of periodontal intra bony defects at an interval of 6 months.

        6. To compare the radiographic changes for sites grafted with Porous variant and sites
           grafted with Non Porous of Bioactive Glass in the treatment of periodontal intra bony
           defects at an interval of 6 months.
