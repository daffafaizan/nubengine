      (Nulojix速) in preventing antibodies from forming in people with a failing kidney transplant.
      Kidney transplant patients take immunosuppression medicines to prevent kidney rejection. When
      a kidney transplant begins to fail, the immunosuppression medicines are slowly weaned. Once
      dialysis is started, the immunosuppressant medicines are usually stopped. After
      immunosuppression is stopped, some people form antibodies. Antibodies are proteins that the
      immune system makes to protect against harmful foreign substances like bacteria, viruses, or
      foreign tissues, like a transplant. High levels of antibodies can make it harder to find a
      kidney donor for that person.

      Participants will be randomized into one of the two treatment groups. One group will continue
      taking their current immunosuppression medicines. The people in the treatment group will be
      switched to belatacept (Nulojix速). Belatacept (Nulojix速) is an immunosuppression medicine
      that is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the FDA) to prevent rejection in
      kidney transplant. Participants will stop taking calcineurin inhibitors (either cyclosporine
      or tacrolimus) or sirolimus but will keep taking other immunosuppression medicines like
      Cellcept (MMF) or azathioprine (Imuran) and prednisone. These medicines will be slowly weaned
      and will be stopped if the participant has to start dialysis. Participants will continue
      taking belatacept (Nulojix速), even while on dialysis.

      The study team will test both groups to see how many people in each group develop antibodies.
