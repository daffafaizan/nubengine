      oxygen saturation are used to monitor the hemodynamic function and tissue perfusion in
      surgical patients. Though none of the methods are directly monitoring changes in the
      metabolism of the tissue. Arterial blood gas analysis is used as the golden standard for the
      detection of metabolic disturbances before, during and after surgery. Disadvantages of the
      method are 1) the fact that the technique is invasive to the patient, 2) that the method
      measures the "total gas" (each tissue's contribution to the blood gas in the total
      circulating blood) and 3) that the methods only provide a snapshot of the patient's blood gas
      status. Transcutaneous monitoring can be used as a continuous monitoring of the underlying
      tissue's carbon dioxide and oxygen levels in patients. The method is already used in neonates
      as a surrogate for the arterial blood gas analysis. Reduced tissue oxygenation due to
      inadequate perfusion, will initiate an anaerobic tissue metabolism resulting in low oxygen
      levels and high carbon dioxide levels. The transcutaneous monitoring can therefore
      potentially be used to detect tissue hypoxia and become a direct measurement of the
      underlying tissue metabolism.
