      risk of AC in patient with anal AIN3 lesions are available, nor french recommendations about
      screening and treatment of anal AIN3 lesions.

      Objective : Evaluation of the AC incidence in patient with anal AIN3 lesions, and factors
      associated with this AC.

      Population : Patients with a diagnosis of anal AIN3 lesion will be included and followed for
      3 years. Patients with past history of AC won't be included.

      Study design : Retrospective cohort study will be conducted from 2000 using diagnostic codes
      of anal AIN3 lesion in histo-pathology departments. Then a prospective cohort study will be
      conducted with new diagnoses of anal AIN3 lesion.

      Outcome : The main outcome is histology proven AC. AC identification can be done either by
      using diagnostic codes of AC in histo-pathology departments (for retrospective cases), or
      prospectively.

      Statistics : The incidence rate of AC will be calculated. Factors associated with AC will be
      estimated using a multivariate Cox regression model.

      Number of patients : 1000 Number of centers : 35 Length of follow-up: 3 years at least Length
      of study : 3 years of inclusion and 3 years of follow-up at least"
