      of pay for performance metrics. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Hospital
      Inpatient Value-Based Purchasing Program implemented value-based incentive payments that link
      Medicare reimbursements to patient satisfaction and physician surveys completed by patients.1
      There is a paucity of data in the orthopaedic literature assessing patient satisfaction,
      especially regarding patients with orthopaedic trauma. Surprisingly, up to 90% of medical
      inpatients are unable to correctly name their treating physician when asked to identify the
      physician in charge of his or her care at the time of discharge.2-4 The orthopaedic trauma
      patient population is even more challenging due to traumatic injuries warranting inpatient
      surgery in the acute setting as opposed to elective surgeries or medical admissions.
      Admissions from the emergency department have been associated with a decreased ability of
      patients to identify their treating physician. 3 Furthermore, the acuity of these injuries
      does not always permit patients and surgeons to establish a strong patient-physician
      relationship before the surgery. Patient-physician communication is integral to improving
      clinical relationships and improving patient satisfaction.5,6 Surgeons exhibit a tendency to
      focus on operative quality and outcomes, whereas patients place greater value on the
      surgeon-patient interaction.7,8 Establishing rapport and a strong patient-physician
      relationship in the acute trauma setting is challenging but being able to recognize the name
      and face of the attending orthopaedic surgeon is a critical step in the communication chain.
      The presence of attending physician photographs in patient rooms has been associated with a
      significant improvement in the ability to correctly identify the attending physician and is
      associated with improved patient satisfaction.4,9 The purpose of this prospective quality
      improvement study was to evaluate the impact of a simple intervention aimed to increase
      patient recognition of the attending orthopaedic trauma surgeon and improve patient
      satisfaction with the overall quality of care delivered by the attending surgeon during the
      inpatient stay. Patients randomized to intervention group received an attending biosketch
      card, whereas patients randomized to the control group did not receive a card. Our hypothesis
      was that the patients in the intervention group (received attending biosketch card) would
      have higher patient satisfaction scores regarding the overall care provided by his or her
      attending orthopaedic trauma surgeon.
