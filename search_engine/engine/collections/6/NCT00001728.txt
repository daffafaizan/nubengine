      the skeleton. The bone at these sites is rapidly resorbed and replaced by abnormal fibrous
      tissue and mechanically abnormal bone. PFD may occur alone or as part of the McCune-Albright
      Syndrome (MAS), a syndrome originally defined by the triad of PFD, cafe-au-lait pigmentation
      of the skin, and precocious puberty. The bony lesions are frequently disfiguring and painful,
      and depending on the location of the lesion, they can cause significant morbidity. Lesions in
      weight-bearing bones can lead to disabling fractures, while lesions in the skull can lead to
      compression of vital structures such as cranial nerves.

      Currently there are no clearly-defined systemic therapies for this bone disease. Small,
      uncontrolled trials using the second generation bisphosphonate, pamidronate, suggest that
      bisphosphonates may be effective. This study is a phase 2, controlled, double blinded trial
      of the third generation oral bisphosphonate, alendronate for the treatment of fibrous
      dysplasia. We propose to show that treatment with alendronate will improve bone quality,
      decrease bone pain, decrease fractures, and, if the patient is referred to the companion bone
      grafting protocol, will allow for the regeneration of better quality bone.
