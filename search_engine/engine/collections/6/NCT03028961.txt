      marrow transplant (BMT) recipients receiving the Stanford Letter versus the traditional
      advance directive (AD) through a prospective, pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate differences in patient preference for choice to prolong life following
      completion of the ACP tool in each group.

      II. To assess uncertainty with decision making regarding end of life care following
      completion of the ACP tool in each group.

      III. To explore patient understanding of and satisfaction with the ACP tool in each group.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I (INTERVENTION): Patients listen to a dialogue on the purpose of ACP. Patients receive
      a paper copy and online web link to the Stanford Letter and complete and return the form by
      the day of BMT. After completion of the Stanford Letter, patients undergo a semi-structured,
      research staff-led interview to evaluate personal perceptions of uncertainty with end-of-life
      decisions, understanding of the ACP form received, and satisfaction with the ACP form.

      GROUP II (CONTROL): Patients listen to a dialogue on the purpose of ACP. Patients receive a
      paper copy and online web link to the California (CA) Advance Health Care Directive Form and
      complete and return the form by the day of BMT. After completion of the CA Advance Health
      Care Directive Form, patients undergo interview as in Group I.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up periodically.
