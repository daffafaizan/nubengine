    
      For the phase I study, this is a prospective open-label phase I trial based on a dose
      escalating study design assessing two dose level of JX-594 when associated to metronomic
      cyclophosphamide.

      For the phase II study, two distincts treatment strategies will be evaluated.

      First, treatment by JX-594 and metronomic cyclophosphamide:

        -  stratum soft-tissue sarcoma, this is a monocenter, randomized non comparative phase II
           clinical trial. This phase II trial was based on an optimal 2-stage Simon's design.
           Randomization 2:1 with 2 patients randomized in experimental arm n°1 (association of
           metronomic cyclophosphamide and JX-594) and 1 patient randomized in control arm n°2
           (treatment by metronomic cyclophosphamide alone).

        -  stratum breast cancer, this is a monocenter, one-arm phase II clinical trial, based on
           two-stage optimal Simon's design (association of metronomic cyclophosphamide and
           JX-594).

      Second, treatment by Avelumab, intratumoral JX-594 and metronomic cyclophosphamide:

        -  stratum soft-tissue sarcoma, this is a monocenter, single arm phase II clinical trial
           based on an optimal 2-stage Simon's design.

        -  stratum breast cancer, this is a monocenter, one-arm phase II clinical trial, based on
           two-stage optimal Simon's design).
