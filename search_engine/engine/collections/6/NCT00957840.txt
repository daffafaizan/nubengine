      ultrasounds to evaluate progression of ventricular dilatation (standard of care). After the
      infant is enrolled in this study, Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) and Amplitude integrated
      Electroencephalogram (aEEG) will be performed 1-2 times per week. After Omaya reservoir
      insertion, ventricular dimensions, based on weekly (standard of care) cranial ultrasounds,
      will determine frequency of CSF removal. NIRS and aEEG will continue 1-2 times per week to
      coincide with CSF removal. In addition, 1-2 times per week aliquots of CSF will be stored for
      evaluation of biomarkers. We will evaluate the impact of IVH and PHVD over time on cerebral
      oxygenation (NIRS) and cortical electrical activity (aEGG) starting at the time of
      identification of IVH and correlate these measurements to ventricular dimensions. If an Omaya
      reservoir is required to control PHVD, we will use ventricular dimensions to guide the
      frequency of CSF removal and continue to evaluate brain status by measuring cerebral
      oxygenation (NIRS) and cortical electrical activity (aEGG).
