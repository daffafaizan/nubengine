    
      This is a study of infusional doxorubicin, vincristine, and etoposide in combination with
      daily oral mitotane in patients with adrenocortical cancer. Although mitotane has been used
      extensively in adrenocortical cancer and has documented single agent activity, only limited
      experience is available in the use of mitotane in combination with chemotherapy. In this
      trial the primary reason for using mitotane is an attempt to enhance therapeutic efficacy,
      based on its documented in-vitro activity as an antagonist of P-glycoprotein. The goal of
      this study is to determine the efficacy of this therapy by treating patients who are
      considered candidates for surgical resection at presentation or following a response to
      therapy. Following chemotherapy, patients deemed surgical candidates can undergo surgical
      resection with evaluation of response. Patients responding to chemotherapy will resume the
      combination treatment after surgery. Patients who do not respond will be maintained on single
      agent mitotane until it is deemed ineffective.
