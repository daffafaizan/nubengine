      I. Determine the feasibility of doxorubicin and cisplatin followed by whole abdominal
      radiotherapy in patients with stage III or IV endometrial cancer.

      II. Determine the acute and chronic toxic effects, in particular, severe and life-threatening
      gastrointestinal, hepatic, and hematologic toxic effects, of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive doxorubicin IV and cisplatin IV on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks
      for 3 courses. Patients then undergo whole abdominal radiotherapy 5 days a week for 4-6
      weeks.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 21-53 patients will be accrued for this study within 3.5 years.
