      dissection required to perform a total hip arthroplasty. Proponents of these procedures feel
      that it is associated with less perioperative blood loss, less pain and an accelerated
      recovery while critics have raised concerns that the more limited exposure may negatively
      impact component position and increase the risk of perioperative complications. Among less
      invasive surgical techniques, two of the different approaches utilized include a
      "mini-incision" posterior approach which aims to limit the amount of dissection associated
      with a standard posterior approach to the hip and a 2-incision technique which seeks to
      further limit soft tissue disruption by taking advantage of intermuscular planes and the use
      of fluoroscopic guidance.

      While the mini-posterior approach utilizes an abbreviated exposure which is familiar to most
      surgeons, the 2-incision approach is a more novel approach and critics of this approach feel
      that its technically demanding nature may be associated with a higher risk of complications
      and component malposition. Proponents of the 2-incision approach feel that this approach is
      less invasive, more muscle sparing and leads to substantial improvements in patient
      rehabilitation and recovery with potential longer-term benefits in terms of improved
      function. The goal of this project is to compare the use of a mini-incision posterior
      approach and the 2-incision approach in primary total hip arthroplasty via a prospective
      randomized trial.
