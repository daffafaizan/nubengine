    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Assess the safety and tolerability (maximum tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxicity)
           of samarium Sm 153 lexidronam pentasodium and bortezomib in patients with relapsed or
           refractory multiple myeloma.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the response rate (combined complete response, partial response, and minimal
           response) in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the time to response and the time to progression of disease in patients
           treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the progression-free survival and overall survival of patients treated with
           this regimen.

        -  Assess the antitumor effects of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation study of samarium Sm 153 lexidronam
      pentasodium.

      Patients receive bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 and samarium Sm 153
      lexidronam pentasodium IV on day 3. Treatment repeats every 8 weeks for up to 4 courses in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of samarium Sm 153 lexidronam pentasodium
      until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose
      preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. The MTD of
      samarium Sm 153 lexidronam pentasodium is determined with 2 different doses of bortezomib.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 36 patients will be accrued for this study.
