      an involuntary loss of urine on physical exertion, sneezing, or coughing (1). It occurs
      primarily in multiparous women (2).

      The prevalence of UI among Egyptian women is high (55%). Aging, low educational level,
      menopause, higher parity (>3), vaginal delivery, and previous multiple abortions (>3) are
      significant risk factors for UI(3) Mid-urethral slings (TVT and TOT) are now the recognized
      worldwide standard of care for the surgical treatment of stress urinary incontinence(4) (5)
      Mid-Urethral Slings have a very high satisfaction rate (85-90 %) (4) (6), with durability of
      satisfaction recently demonstrated out to 5-years (79-85 %) as well as a modest 5-year
      treatment success (43-51 %) (4, 7) Burch colposuspension is a well-accepted technique for
      surgical management of stress urinary incontinence (SUI), especially when it is associated
      with urethral hypermobility. it first description in 1961 (8) (9) Originally performed as an
      open surgical procedure and then Over time, Burch colposuspension has been adapted for
      laparoscopy, it was long considered as the "gold standard" for the treatment of SUI before
      emergent of midurethral slings (9) The cure rates for laparoscopic colposuspention is as high
      as 68.9% to 88.0% whereas recurrence rates remain low, however, it has been reported that the
      cure rate of retropubic suspension techniques in general decreases steadily from 90% at 1
      year to about70% by 10 years postoperatively. After a decline, it seems to reach a plateau at
      65-70% at a 20 year follow-up (9) After the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a
      warning about the use of transvaginal meshes for pelvic organ prolapse (POP) in 2011, there
      has been much debate about the use of mesh in the MUS continence procedures. Concern is
      increasing that the use of transvaginal mesh devices to treat SUI and POP have exposed women
      to avoidable harms following complications such as infection, tissue extrusion, mesh exposure
      ,mesh shrinkage, and side effects such as severe pain, sexual dysfunction, and repeat
      surgical interventions (5).
