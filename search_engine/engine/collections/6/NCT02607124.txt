      suggests that over 70% of DIPG patient have an intact RB and 90% HGG patients have expression
      of RB, therefore CDK4/6 inhibition is a suitable target. Given the dismal prognosis for
      children with DIPG and HGG, it is appropriate to evaluate the long term feasibility and early
      efficacy of Ribociclib following radiation therapy in patients with RB+ tumors. The aim of
      the upfront biopsy molecular studies proposed is to identify subgroups of patients who will
      benefit from the use of checkpoint inhibitors in the setting of intact RB pathway. This study
      will play a major role in moving the field of DIPG/HGG research forward as the investigators
      intend to reveal feasibility of upfront stereotactic biopsy and specific pathway directed
      therapy following radiation therapy with the ultimate goal to add additional targeted therapy
      in combination with Ribociclib resulting in improving the outcome for patients diagnosed with
      these fatal tumors.

      The current proposal will be a novel pediatric study to obtain biopsy in DIPG prior to
      therapy and administer molecularly targeted therapy following radiation therapy in children
      with newly diagnosed DIPG and HGG. In this study, the investigators will assess the assess
      long-term feasibility and early efficacy of Ribociclib administered daily for 3 weeks and off
      one week every 28 days following radiation therapy for at least 6 courses and up to 12
      courses in patients with newly-diagnosed non-biopsied DIPG and RB+ biopsied DIPG and HGG.
      Moreover, the investigators will approach this devastating disease with a multi-disciplinary
      team and evaluate the quality of life and functional outcome resulting in effective
      interventions.
