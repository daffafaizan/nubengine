      placebo-controlled, parallel-group comparative study followed by an open-label extension
      study of E2020 in subjects with Down syndrome having regression and disabled ADL. A total of
      60 subjects will be randomized to one of three dosing groups (at 1:1:1) to receive 3 mg of
      E2020, 5 mg of E2020, or placebo for 24 weeks based on their total scores of Body
      Functionality Checklist, sex, and study site as the allocation factors. This study consists
      of Pre-randomization Phase (4 weeks), Double-blind Phase (28 weeks), and Extension Phase (24
      weeks). The Double-blind Phase includes a 24-week treatment period plus a 4-week transition
      period.
