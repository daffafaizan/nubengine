      variety of clinical and serological manifestations that may affect any organ. Vasculitis
      prevalence in SLE is reported to be between 11% and 36%. A diverse clinical spectrum, due to
      inflammatory involvement of vessels of all sizes, is present. Even though cutaneous lesions,
      representing small vessel involvement, are the most frequent, medium and large vessel
      vasculitis may present with visceral affection, with life-threatening manifestations such as
      mesenteric vasculitis, pulmonary hemorrhage, or mononeuritis multiplex, with detrimental
      consequences. Early recognition and an appropriate treatment are crucial. Recent studies have
      shown that vasculitis in patients with SLE may present different clinical forms based on the
      organ involved and the size of the affected vessel. It is noteworthy that the episodes of
      vasculitis are not always accompanied by high disease activity. Recent articles on this topic
      have focused on new treatments for the control of vascular disease, such as biological
      therapies such as Rituximab and Belimumab, among others.
