      trial of a formulation of AMZ001 once or twice daily versus placebo twice daily, including a
      single-blind treatment group with a commercial gel four times daily. Participants will be
      evaluated for osteoarthritis by X-ray images of the knees and one knee will be selected for
      treatment as the target knee. The study gel will be applied directly to that knee throughout
      the 4 weeks of the study.
