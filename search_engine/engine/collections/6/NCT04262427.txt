      clear cell renal cell carcinoma who have had previous treatment with immunotherapy and have
      experienced disease progression. Immunotherapies aim to boost the body's natural defences to
      fight cancer, however the tumour micro-environment may significantly impact how effective
      this approach will be at reducing cancer growth and spread. The CAPER trial aims to evaluate
      whether oral metronomic cyclophosphamide (50mg once daily) can alter the tumour environment
      and ultimately lead to responses to pembrolizumab in patients who have failed prior
      immunotherapy.

      Patients who join the study will initially take cyclophosphamide 50mg tablets once a day for
      21 days during the 'run-in period'. Following this, they will continue with cyclophosphamide
      50mg daily alongside intravenous pembrolizumab treatment administered once every 3 weeks.
      Patients will continue both treatments until the occurrence of either disease progression,
      unexpected toxicity, patient withdrawal, or completion of 24 months of treatment.

      Patients will undergo CT scanning to evaluate response every 9 weeks during trial treatment.

      Research biopsies will be taken at baseline (prior to treatment), after the 21 day run-in
      period on oral cyclophosphamide, and at the time of the first CT scan (week 9 on treatment).
      Patients will also have additional research blood samples collected at serial timepoints
      whilst on treatment. The biopsy and blood samples will allow evaluation of the changes
      induced by cyclophosphamide and pembrolizumab within the tumour microenvironment as well as
      changes in circulating factors such as cytokines.
