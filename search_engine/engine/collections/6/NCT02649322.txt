      femoral or sciatic nerve blocks. The use of the J-tip device for lidocaine introduction prior
      to femoral or sciatic blocks at Arnold Palmer Medical Center has been up to the discretion of
      the anesthesiologist. It has been anecdotally reported at our institution to have equal or
      better pain relief for the regional nerve blocks as needle introduction of lidocaine.

      This study seeks to evaluate the difference in pain from local anesthetic infiltration with
      J-tip needleless injection device compared to needle injection by use of Visual Analog
      Scales.

        -  To evaluate efficacy of femoral nerve block after J-tip device lidocaine injection post
           operatively by use of Visual Analog Scales.

        -  To assess patient and parent satisfaction with J-tip device use by satisfaction
           questionnaire.

        -  To assess changes in post operative pain medication amounts with J-tip device use.
