      intervention for assault-injured youth) for a group mentoring model.

      This pilot study is a randomized controlled trial in which assault-injured 12-14 year old
      youth recruited from the emergency department are randomly assigned to standard care or "A
      Fighting Chance" group mentoring that includes a violence prevention curriculum and parent
      sessions. Immediately post-intervention and again at six-month follow up, youth
      violence-related, mental health and educational outcomes using validated measures will be
      assessed.
