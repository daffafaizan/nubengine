      supplements can help reduce pain and also reduce the need for pain medications for some
      people. The investigators will ask about 100 people to participate. All of them will get a
      low-fat, vegan diet and a nutritional supplement (mixture of omega-3 oils and vitamin E or a
      placebo), although some will get the diet first, and others will get the supplement first.
      This order in which they will get the diet and the supplement will be determined randomly,
      that is, by chance (like the toss of a coin). The principal measure is pain as measured by
      Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and disease activity as measured by number of painful swollen and
      tender joints, respectively. The Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II)will be used to measure
      changes in mood. The study duration is 36 weeks.
