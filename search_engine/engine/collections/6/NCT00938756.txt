      Primary

        -  Evaluate the validity of determining CA 15-3 levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
           using automated immuno-enzymatic methods.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the sensitivity and specificity of these assays in assessing CA 15-3 in CSF.

        -  Assess favorability of intrathecal production of CA 15-3.

        -  Determine threshold interpretations of CA 15-3 levels in CSF.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Within 15 days of suspected meningeal involvement, blood and cerebrospinal fluid samples are
      collected. Samples are examined by immunoenzyme assays. Patients with suspected cases of
      carcinomatous meningitis undergo cerebrospinal MRI.
