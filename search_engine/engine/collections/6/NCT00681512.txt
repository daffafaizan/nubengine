      cancer, breast cancer and colon cancer combined. Presently, there are over 43 million current
      smokers and over 47 million ex-smokers living in the US. Due to the lag time between smoking
      and the development of cancer, there are significant numbers of ex-smokers and current
      smokers who may develop lung cancer compared to never smokers.

      Recent studies in animals have shown that berries, given as a dietary supplement, are highly
      effective against certain types of cancers. In a study involving mice with lung tumors, mice
      that had consumed a mixture of berries developed fewer tumors and had less tumor growth than
      mice that did not consume berries.

      The berries used in this study will consist of blueberries, black raspberries, or a mixture
      of both.
