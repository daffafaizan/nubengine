    
      In three surgical departments between 2007 and 2013, 72 pts with total mesorectal excision
      and coloanal or low colorectal anastomosis for rectal cancer were randomly assigned to
      closure of their protective ileostomy after 2 weeks (group A, 37 pts) or 12 weeks (group B,
      35 pts). One day before planned stoma closure, the coloanal/colorectal anastomosis was
      checked by palpation, contrast enema via ileostomy and, in case of hazards, by proctoscopy.
      Perioperative data was assessed prospectively using numeric values, visual analogue scales
      (VAS, 0 = lowest value, 100 = highest value) and QOL-index (GQLI, max. 144 points).
      Complications were recorded prospectively.
