      program, and who subsequently may or may not resume smoking spontaneously. Eligible subjects
      will be characterized at baseline with respect to their metabolic and CVD risk profiles, body
      fat composition and distribution. Subjects will then undergo an intensive 8-week smoking
      cessation program using bupropion plus cognitive behavioral counseling. Those who
      successfully abstain will be reassessed. Since most individuals who quit smoking will
      naturally resume smoking again over time, subjects will be assessed again after an additional
      4 months of follow-up when a subset of subjects will be expected to have naturally resumed
      smoking.
