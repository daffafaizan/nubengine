      (<1 month) taking or will soon (within 3 months) start taking study medications of interest
      thru their own physician.

      Prospective observational study participants are explained how persons can be cognitively
      normal but at high risk for developing clinical ALZ, and that this risk can be prospectively
      identified.

      They are advised that there is some rationale that medications they are or will soon be
      taking may have a protective effect in delaying the onset of ALZ, and that protective effect
      can be monitored.

      They are asked if they would like to participate in a protocol that monitors their
      prospective risk for developing ALZ short term, and whether certain of their prescribed
      medications may have a protective effect. Those who are accepting to be participants are then
      enrolled in the study.

      Enrollees are tested for risk factors for having pre-clinical ALZ. Individuals identified as
      being at risk at baseline are followed at 6 month intervals for a 24 month period using
      psychometric testing and functional neuroimaging. Their maintenance of cognitive stability or
      cognitive decline is monitored while under the care of their PMD and while taking medications
      of interest.
