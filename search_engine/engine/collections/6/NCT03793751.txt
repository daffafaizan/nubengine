    
      Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a common postoperative neurological
      complication in elderly. POCD is a subtle impairment of memory, concentration and information
      processing with clinical manifestations of delirium, anxiety, personality changes and
      impaired memory, which is associated with prolonged hospitalization, a reduced quality of
      life and an increase in morbidity and mortality. Dexmedetomidine is a highly selective Î±-2
      adrenergic receptor agonist with a dose-dependent sedative hypnotic effect. It has also been
      reported that dexmedetomidine has a potential role in preventing POCD due to its
      neuroprotective effects both in vitro and in vivo.

      Till date very few studies have analysed the impact of dexmedetomidine on early POCD. Even in
      the few available studies compared assessment of POCD using the Mini-Mental State Examination
      (MMSE) scores and found that MMSE have lower sensitivity for identifying Cognitive
      Dysfunction as compared to Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). The study would analyze the
      impact of Intraoperative Dexmedetomidine infusion on early Postoperative Cognitive
      Dysfunction (POCD) in geriatric patients above 60 years undergoing hip surgery under spinal
      anesthesia.

      So this study will aim to identify the impact of Intraoperative dexmedetomidine infusion on
      POCD assessed by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) in geriatric patients above 60
      years undergoing hip surgery under spinal anaesthesia.
