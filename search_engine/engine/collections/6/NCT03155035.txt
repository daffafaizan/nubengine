      year old school age children will be enrolled after parental consent. The calculated total
      sample size is n= 258. Subjects will be visited at home by researcher and background
      information, risk factor presence and baseline measurements of weight, Mid Upper Arm
      Circumference (MUAC) and tricep skinfold thickness (TSF) will be measured. The intervention
      arm will be administered a single dose of chewable Albendazole 400 mg and the placebo arm
      will receive 400 mg chewable calcium tablets. The weight, MUAC and TSF will be measured again
      after 8 weeks to determine the change if any. The selection of locality and allocation of
      intervention will be done using simple random sampling and computer generated random numbers.
