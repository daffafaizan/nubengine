      national shortage of cardiologists and of doctors in Kenya however further compounds the
      problem of insufficient staff for emergency care and of any capacity building efforts. To
      achieve the goals of Sustainable Development Goal Number 3 (SDG-3) and realise the
      government's vision of universal healthcare for all, alternatives to the human resource
      challenge are key. Modifying the Scope of Practice of Kenyan nurses is one possible solution.
      Task-shifting traditionally cardiologist roles such as focused cardiac ultrasound (FoCUS)
      could shorten the time it takes to make a diagnosis in patients with cardiorespiratory
      failure of likely cardiac origin, making prolonged turnaround times in our public facilities
      a thing of the past. Our overarching aim is to harness the power of nurses doing FoCUS. The
      central hypothesis of this work is that in patients with cardiorespiratory failure, a
      nurse-led FoCUS-guided service would shorten time to diagnosis, supporting interventions and
      improving outcomes among the critically ill. Insight into potential barriers and enablers for
      the implementation of a nurse-performed FoCUS service in Kenya is crucial for the success of
      such a service redesign.
