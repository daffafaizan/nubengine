    
      A maximal and minimal diameter of inferior caval vein will be measured by transthoracic
      echocardiography in critically ill patients on mechanical ventilation hospitalised in the
      intensive care unit from four different views:

        1. Subcostal view on the inferior caval vein in the long axis,

        2. subcostal view on the inferior caval vein in the short axis,

        3. right lateral view on the inferior caval vein in the long axis,

        4. right lateral view on the inferior caval vein in the short axis.

      Comparison between the results of measurements in the subcostal view in the long axis and
      other views will be performed.
