      ways: using a goniometer and using the clinicCompanionâ„¢. Both tools are designed to measure
      the degree of movement subjects are able to do. Researchers will take 12 measurements on each
      arm for each device, for a total of 24 measurements per device. That is a total of 48
      measurements for both devices.
