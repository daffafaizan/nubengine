        -  determine if an experimental feedback intervention increases control over the region of
           interest (the amygdala) more than a control feedback intervention in which participants
           receive feedback that is unassociated with their PTSD symptoms.

        -  determine if an experimental feedback intervention results in clinical improvements in
           PTSD symptoms relative to a control feedback intervention, and examine whether these
           improvements correlate with improved control over the amygdala.

        -  determine if an experimental feedback intervention results in changes in resting state
           connectivity to the amygdala, and whether these changes correlate with symptom
           improvement and an improved ability to regulate the amygdala.
