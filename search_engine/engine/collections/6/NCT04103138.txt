      brain electrical activity during changing states of consciousness during general anesthesia.

      At present, monitoring of the brain under anaesthesia is not routinely employed. Since every
      patient is different and the way their brain response to anaesthetic drugs is different, it
      is important to adjust the patients' anaesthetic depth according to their brains' response,
      rather than only relying on routine cardiorespiratory parameters. This is important
      particularly for children, whose physiological responses and electroencephalographic
      recordings (EEG) differ from that of adults.

      200 children under 16 years undergoing routine sevoflurane general anaesthesia will be
      randomized to either EEG-guided anaesthesia or routine care. The investigators will compare
      the anaesthetic requirements, the patient state index, number of episodes of burst
      suppression and the incidence and severity of emergence delrium between the two groups.
