      clinical study. Six parameters were evaluated in each position; subcutaneous tissue (ST),
      skin to spinous process (S-SP), transverse diameters of bilateral paraspinal muscles (left
      paraspinal muscle [LPM] and right paraspinal muscle [RPM]), interspinous gap opening (ISGO),
      mean of bilateral paraspinal muscles (MPM). The change of every measurement recorded via
      ultrasonography (USG) according to the positioning techniques were also calculated. The
      calculations are explained briefly in primary outcomes (including the change of SCF-LDF in
      ST, S-SP, LPM, RPM, MPM, ISGO). Stretcher comfort (SC), position comfort (PC), lumbar comfort
      (LC), and abdominal comfort (AC) were evaluated by the participants with the 7-point
      Numerical Rating Scale (NRS).
