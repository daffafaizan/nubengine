      exacerbates organ failure, whereas volume overload results in pulmonary edema. In this
      setting, the use of noninvasive hemodynamic monitoring is associated with reduced mortality.

      Point-of-care lung ultrasonography is used in many critical care settings as the initial
      diagnostic imaging study for patients with respiratory symptoms. It is highly sensitive for
      the diagnosis of pulmonary edema which may occur even without cardiomyopathy or heart
      failure.

      The IVC is a highly compliant vessel that changes its diam¬eter in parallel with changes in
      blood volume and central venous pressure. Measurement of IVC diameter and col¬lapsibility
      index using ultrasound through a subcostal approach has been investigated in patients of
      various settings. The IVC-CI imaging technique may be used to assess the volume status in
      healthy parturients undergoing routine cesarean delivery as well as in high-risk parturients
      as preeclampsia.

      Cerebral edema is predominantly vasogenic and may be related to the failure of cerebral
      autoregulation with subsequent hyperperfusion, blood-brain barrier disruption, and
      endothelial cell dysfunction. Ultrasonographic measurements of the optic nerve sheath
      diameter (ONSD) correlate with signs of raised ICP.
