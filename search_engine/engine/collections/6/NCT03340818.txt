    
      A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to determine the efficacy of intradiscal
      injection of bone marrow concentrate on discogenic low back pain. The treatment will be a
      single injection of autologous bone marrow concentrate into suspected painful disc(s) based
      upon either prior discography or combination of imaging and exclusion of other anatomic
      structural sources of pain. The placebo treatment will be an intramuscular injection of
      normal saline directly dorsal to the transverse process at each suspected level. Outcomes
      will be measured using VAS and ODI. The primary outcome will be the percentage of patients in
      the treatment group vs control group at 6 months post-procedure, categorized as a clinical
      success defined by at least 50% relief of pain. Secondary outcomes will be comparison of
      success rates at 3 and 12 months, percentage of patients in the two groups with greater than
      30% improvement in ODI at 3, 6 and 12 months, Global perceived index at 3, 6, 12 months.
      Medication log and adjunctive treatments will be recorded and analyzed.
