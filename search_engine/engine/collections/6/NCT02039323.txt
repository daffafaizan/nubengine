    
      Participants: Six premenopausal healthy volunteer women between 18-49 years of age with an
      intact uterus and cervix.

      Procedures (methods): Subjects will be given a single dose of two oral antiretrovirals
      (maraviroc 600mg/tenofovir 600 mg). Subjects will be monitored and assessed for adverse
      events post-dose. Subjects will be sent home and asked to return in 24 hours. 24 hours
      post-dose, two vaginal and two cervical biopsies will be obtained. These biopsies will then
      be placed in an ex-vivo culture system and exposed to HIV. Viral RNA will be measured over
      two days to determine whether the tissues were protected from infection. A final visit for
      safety will be conducted 7-14 days post-enrollment.
