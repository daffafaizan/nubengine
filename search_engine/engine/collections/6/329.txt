766. a lipid-mobilizing substance in the serum of pregnant wo-men, of probable placental origina substance capable of inducing free fattyacid (ffa) release was found in the seraof 12 from 13 pregnant women.  the ratepididymal fat pad was used for bioassay.this substance circulates in late pregnancyand disappears within 5 days post partum.it is present in crude placental extracts andis removed by their deproteination.  itis nondialyzable.  application of pituitaryextraction procedure to placentae yieldedactive fractions where pituitary growthhormone is usually found.  in accordance withthese facts a hypothesis concerning a partof metabolic changes occurring during preg-nancy was pronounced as follows.  thedescribed substance diminishes maternal glu-cose consumption through the elevation ofplasma free fatty acids, or by direct in-hibition of glucose uptake, or both.  thispermits a preferential shunting of glucoseto the fetus.  at the same time, increasedplasma free fatty acid levels would serveas the alternative maternal energy substrate.elevated maternal insulin levels duringlate pregnancy stabilize the degree of maternallipid mobilization.  the contrainsulinproperties of a substance capable of mobilizingfree fatty acids and inhibiting mater-nal glucose utilization would pose a diabetogenicchallenge, and in the face of com-promised maternal insulin reserves, provokeovert or worsen existing diabetesmellitus.
