      analgesics to children in a painless and minimally distressing manner, especially in
      comparison to traditional means of intravenous (IV) or intramuscular (IM) administration,
      which require a painful and distressing needle stick.

      Ketorolac is an analgesic that is commonly administered to children, and can be given by the
      IN route, in addition to the IV and IM routes. However, the pharmacokinetics of intranasal
      ketorolac when administered in children has only been described in a limited fashion. The
      administration of IN ketorolac in children, using the proprietary SPRIX device, which
      atomizes a fixed amount of ketorolac, produces serum concentrations of ketorolac that are
      associated with analgesia. However, the concentrations of ketorolac achieved using a mucosal
      atomization device (MAD) has not yet been evaluated in children presenting to the emergency
      department. The MAD is a plastic device that attaches to the top of a syringe (see figure).
      The MAD is much more commonly used for atomizing medications; allows a variable dosage to be
      administered; and has been shown to be a means of effectively delivering other analgesics and
      sedatives intranasally.

      The purpose of this study is to assess the pharmacokinetics of IN ketorolac when using a MAD
      to deliver the medication in children presenting to the emergency department. We will
      determine the maximum serum concentration achieved (Cmax), time to maximum serum
      concentration achieved (Tmax), and bioavailability (compared to IV ketorolac) when ketorolac
      is administered intranasally using a MAD.
