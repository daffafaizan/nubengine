      approximately every 2 weeks. Subjects may be monitored for up to a year, after which they
      will be discontinued from the study. If subjects are found to be naturally entrained to the
      24-hour day, they will be monitored longitudinally for changes. Subjects will be discontinued
      after their monitoring period is over or after an entrained status has been confirmed. While
      no specific time commitment is required, we hope most subjects will participant for 4 months
      - 2 years.
