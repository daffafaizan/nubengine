      Morbid Obesity Unit of the Vall Hebron University Hospital, including patients that have
      previously undergone RYGB at our site and were diagnosed with PHH. The control group
      comprises of healthy normoweight persons matched by age, most of them family members of
      patients included in the study. The OGTT is performed as follows: a solution of 100g glucose
      was administered at 8am after 10 hours of fasting. Plasma glucose and serum insulin are
      measured at minute -5, +30, +60, +120, +180 after the ingestion of the glucose solution. A
      first OGTT is performed in basal conditions. The control group only will perform the basal
      OGTT. A value of plasma glucose below 50mg/dl at 60-180 minutes after the administration of
      the glucose solution is considered positive for PHH. The patients that additionally present a
      value of plasma glucose>200mg/dl during the OGTT will be selected for continuing in the study
      and will be prescribed canagliflozin 300mg orally daily, during 2 weeks. After 2 weeks of
      canagliflozin treatment, a new OGTT will be performed and, in the patients that sign the
      additional inform consent, the pancreatic catheterism will be realized.
