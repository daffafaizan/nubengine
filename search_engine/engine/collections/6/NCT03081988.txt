             -  Analysis of prediction factors for concomitant chemo-radiotherapy in locally
                advanced and advanced esophageal cancer from 2005 to 2015

           Study Group

             1. non responder

             2. CR but recurrence

             3. CR and survival loner than 2 years

        2. Prospective case-control study: RNA sequencing & miRNA microarray

             -  naive esophageal cancer patients who have a plan to receive concomitant
                chemo-radiotherapy --> acquirement of tissue, blood, clinical information -->
                isolation of RNA, DNA, serum database of clinical & demographic information

      study group

        1. non-responder (N=14)

        2. Complete Remission (N=14)

           For considering the drop rate, 2-fold screening

           ***Analysis of mRNA sequencing / miRNA sequencing**** first analysis of RNA sequencing:
           bioinformatician second analysis of RNA sequencing: principle investigator

           3) Experimental set for qPCR (esophageal tissue) study group

             1. non-responder (N=40)

             2. complete remission (N=40)

           4) TMA for screened exon gene

           5) validation set for qPCR (esophageal tissue) new esophageal cancer set

             1. non-responder (N=30)

             2. complete remission (N=30)

           6) follow-up of circulating miRNA in blood (baseline blood & post-CCRT blood 3M, 6M,
           12M)

           7) Prediction model for CCRT response in esophageal Cancer based on clinical and
           molecular factors

           Test several combination models

             1. gene + gene combination,

             2. gene + clinical information combination,

             3. gene + gene + clinical information combination

           8) Validate the prediction model.

           9) primary organoid culture and prediction of chemoradiotherapy response
