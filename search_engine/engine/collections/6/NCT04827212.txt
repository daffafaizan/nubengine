      free-living physical activity and sedentary behaviors in adults >60 y and improves health
      outcomes. Forty-six sedentary office-working adults >60 y with a BMI >25 kg/m2 will be
      randomized to a control and intervention group. Both groups will undergo a 16-week supervised
      training program involving supervised training sessions 45-60 min, twice a week. The
      intervention group will additionally receive the two-way communication-based Companion meta
      intervention. Two-way communication during weeks 1 to 4, will focus on gathering information
      on the adult's motivations, preferences, habits, contexts, and usual behavior patterns to
      build typical individual behavior models. The model will be used to develop an adaptive
      physical active and sedentary behavior intervention prescription. Primary outcomes from Aim 1
      and exploratory outcomes from Aim 2 will be measured at baseline and then after 16 and 24
      weeks.
