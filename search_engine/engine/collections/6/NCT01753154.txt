      The mesothelial cell mass assessed by Cancer Antigen 125 is affected by the use of the type
      of PD solution in APD patients using sleepâ€¢safe. Treating patients with the PD solution
      balance leads to not more than 1 litre difference in hydration in comparison to the
      conventional PD solution which is considered as clinically not relevant regarding blood
      pressure.
