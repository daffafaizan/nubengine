      life, severity of anxiety and depression, status of lactose intolerance and treatment
      satisfaction of current Chinese Medicine (CM) regimens of outpatients with FGIDs. Afterwards,
      the investigators will explore the potential relationship between CM patterns and FGIDs'
      subtypes based on collected information. It is estimated that 4,632 outpatients from 18
      centers across China will be recruited. Various demographic and disease-related information
      will be documented, including name, gender, age, education level, marital status, job
      category, disease course, medical consultation experience, current CM regimens and rationale,
      and treatment satisfaction. Patients will also complete a series of scales, containing, Rome
      IV Diagnostic Questionnaire, Patient-Reported Outcome (PRO) scale, the 36-Item Short Form
      Survey (SF-36), Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA), Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD), lactose food
      frequency questionnaire (Lactose FFQ) and CM pattern scale. The primary outcome will be the
      symptom characteristics of outpatients with FGIDs. Secondary outcomes include population
      characteristics of FGID patients (quality of life, emotional status, lactose intolerance
      status, and satisfaction level of CM interventions), and potential association between CM
      patterns and FGIDs' subtypes.
