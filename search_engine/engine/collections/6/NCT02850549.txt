      with neck pain, with therapists specifically trained to implement a treatment based
      classification and matched interventions system. This study consisted of two phases to
      determine whether implementing a classification changed patient outcomes. In phase one,
      baseline data was obtained while physical therapists continued with their current neck pain
      evaluation and intervention approaches. The second phase involved educating the therapists in
      the neck classification system with the matched interventions. Pain and function outcomes
      were analyzed for 2 phases. The overall goal was to prospectively determine if the
      implementation of this classification system with matched interventions could enhance patient
      outcomes.
