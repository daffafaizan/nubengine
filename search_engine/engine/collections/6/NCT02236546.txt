      I. To correlate treatment-induced changes in FDG uptake with changes in tumor size and
      progression-free survival (PFS) in patients receiving therapy for advanced melanoma.

      II. To correlate treatment-induced changes in FDG uptake with changes in the activity and/or
      expression of available molecular biomarkers from patients receiving therapy for advanced
      melanoma.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo FDG-PET/CT up to 2 weeks prior to first dose of therapy, after completion of
      the first treatment course (day 21), and after completion of the fourth treatment course (day
      84).
