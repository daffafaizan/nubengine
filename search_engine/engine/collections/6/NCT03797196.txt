      induction will be applied. Additionally, the standard therapy consisting of prednisolone,
      mycophenolic acid and tacrolimus once-daily (Envarsus®), or the comparator in which
      mycophenolic acid will be replaced by everolimus combined with strongly reduced levels of
      tacrolimus once-daily (Envarsus®). When not tolerated,tacrolimus may be replaced by
      ciclosporin. The hypothesis is that reduced calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) exposure in
      combination with everolimus will lead to improved allograft function, a reduced incidence of
      complications and improved quality of life.

      This study will consist of two strata: Stratum A: Elderly recipients (≥65 years) of kidneys
      from elderly deceased donors (≥65 years) within the Eurotransplant Senior Program. Stratum B:
      Elderly recipients (≥65 years) of kidneys from living donors (all ages) or deceased donors
      (<65 years). The primary endpoint will be "successful transplantation" which is defined as
      survival with a functioning allograft with a minimum estimated GFR of 30 ml/min per 1.73 m2
      in stratum A and 45 ml/min per 1.73 m2 in stratum B, after 2 years.

      The study will be performed by the Dutch transplant centers and the Dutch Kidney Patient
      Organization (NVN) will participate.
