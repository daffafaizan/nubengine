      Patient outcomes (perceptions of healthcare professional communication style, treatment
      self-regulation and adherence to activity reduction) will be collected first during a
      control/usual care period. Healthcare professionals will then receive the theory-based
      motivation communication training programme. Subsequently a new group of patients will be
      recruited as the intervention group and the same outcome measures collected. Control group
      outcomes will be compared to intervention group outcomes. Interviews will be conducted with
      healthcare professionals and patients to assess acceptability of the intervention.
