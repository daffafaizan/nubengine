    
      The study is divided into 2 parts where Part A is a Phase I safety/proof of concept study of
      small scars pre-abdominoplasty, and Part B is a Phase IIa study of post-abdominoplasty scars.

      In Part A of the study, subjects will have their abdominoplasty site mapped to accommodate a
      series of excisions depending on pannus size. All excisions to be treated with SLI-F06 will
      be on one side of the mapped area (i.e., left side or right side) and vehicle treated
      excisions will be on the other side of the mapped area. At time of abdominoplasty the
      excision site will be harvested and processed.

      In Part B of the study, subjects who complete Part A will be randomly assigned to receive
      injections of SLI-F06 along one half (left or right) of the abdominoplasty incision and
      control injections along the other half. The subject will undergo routine wound care and will
      attend study follow-up visits following abdominoplasty. The entire incision will be treated
      post-operatively in precisely the same manner.

      Duration of study-approximately 15 months.
