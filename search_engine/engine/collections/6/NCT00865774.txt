      screening by: (a) comparing the effectiveness of two new, shorter screening tools for risky
      drinking patterns with the longer screening tool in current use; (b) assessing the outcomes
      of two different brief counseling interventions (BIs) with trauma patients screened to have
      risky drinking behaviors; and (c) examining the impact of the implementation of this new
      policy in a Level I Trauma Center.

      The Specific Aims will be accomplished by:

        1. Screening patients who are admitted to the Trauma Center, and conducting BIs for all who
           screen positive;

        2. Collecting formative qualitative data regarding participants' perceptions of benefits of
           drunken states, their individual risks, and perceived healthier alternatives;

        3. Collecting quantitative data (injury severity score and hospital length of stay) and
           correlating these data with patient demographics and responses on the different
           screening methods;

        4. Collecting follow-up data by telephone on self-reported alcohol use and trauma
           recidivism, using an interviewer-administered assessment;

        5. Collecting data on trauma recidivism from ED data, publicly available records, and
           patient self-report at 6-month telephone follow-up;

        6. Surveying trauma staff and physicians at three intervals regarding the process of
           implementing the new ACS policy, any perceived difficulties, and the perceived impact
