    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      -Evaluate the pathologic complete response (path CR) rate in participants with esophageal and
      gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma when trifluridine and tipiracil hydrochloride
      (trifluridine/tipiracil [TAS-102]) and oxaliplatin are used as induction chemotherapy prior
      to surgical resection.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        -  Evaluate the 2-year disease-free survival (DFS) and the 2-year overall survival (OS)

        -  To determinate the safety and tolerability of induction chemotherapy with
           trifluridine/tipiracil (TAS 102) and oxaliplatin followed by standard chemoradiation and
           surgery

        -  Evaluate the metabolic response to induction chemotherapy with TAS 102 and oxaliplatin
           in participants with esophageal and gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma prior
           to standard chemoradiation and surgical resection

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      -Correlate cell-free deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) levels with disease recurrence and metabolic
      response on positron emission tomography (PET) computed tomography (CT).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive oxaliplatin intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on day 1 and trifluridine and
      tipiracil hydrochloride orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 14
      days for 3 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients
      then undergo standard of care chemoradiation therapy followed by surgery.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3-6 months for years 1-2,
      every 6-12 months for years 3-5, and then annually thereafter.
