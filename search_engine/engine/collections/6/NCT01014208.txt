      the efficacy of rituximab combined with salvage chemotherapy in the second-line setting has
      decreased and there is a need for new therapies in patients progressing or relapsing after
      first-line rituximab-based therapy. Replacement of rituximab with ofatumumab in the
      second-line setting, following progression/relapse after first-line rituximab-containing
      regimens, offers the potential to overcome relative or complete rituximab resistance and thus
      improve response rates, the ability to proceed to consolidative HDT/ASCT, and overall
      survival.
