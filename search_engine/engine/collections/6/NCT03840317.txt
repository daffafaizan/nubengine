      the FMC63 mouse hybridoma, a portion of the human CD137（4-1BB） molecule, and the
      intracellular component of the human CD3ζ molecule. Autologous T cells will be gene
      engineered with the CAR gene using a lentivirus vector. Compared to Senl_1904A, Senl_1904B
      has a higher and more stable transfection efficiency and secretes lower levels of cytokines
      in functional assays, thus having the potential to significantly reduce the incidence of
      serious adverse events while ensuring the same complete response rate. Prior to T cell
      infusion, the patients will be subjected to preconditioning treatment. After T cell infusion,
      the patients will be evaluated for one month after infusion for adverse reactions and
      efficacy.
