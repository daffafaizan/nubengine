        -  To test whether the response rate (CR, CRi, or PR) in patients with purine
           analog-refractory, B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) after treatment with the
           combination of bendamustine hydrochloride and rituximab is sufficiently high to warrant
           further investigation.

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of bendamustine hydrochloride and rituximab in
           patients with B-cell CLL who are refractory to treatment with a purine-nucleoside
           analog-containing regimen.

        -  To investigate, in a preliminary manner, the prognostic effects of pre-treatment
           cytogenetic abnormalities identified by conventional cytogenetics and by FISH analyses
           on response to treatment in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive rituximab IV on day 1 and bendamustine IV over 30 minutes on days 1-2.
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. In course 1 only, patients also receive rituximab IV on day 2.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for 2 years.
