      once during pregnancy. After delivery, placental examination will be performed.

      In unselected MCDA twins, the investigators will assess the relationship between unequal
      placental sharing and the risk of fetal or neonatal loss. The investigators will also
      establish whether umbilical vein measurements or MRI can be used to predict placental
      sharing.

      In cases complicated by twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS), the investigators will look
      at the association between unequal placental sharing and intrauterine fetal demise after
      laser surgery.

      In cases complicated by selective intra-uterine growth restriction (sIUGR), the the
      relationship between unequal placental sharing and the risk of fetal or neonatal loss and
      birth prior to 34 weeks will be assessed.

      Furthermore, data on neurological outcome at 2 years of age in all cohorts will be collected.
