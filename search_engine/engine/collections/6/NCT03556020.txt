      incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs) as well as changes from baseline in vital
      signs, laboratory parameters, ECGs and their relationship to pemziviptadil (PB1046). The
      primary efficacy objective will be assessed by investigating the change in PVR derived from
      right heart catheterization (RHC). Secondary efficacy objectives will be assessed by
      investigating the impact of pemziviptadil (PB1046) on change from baseline in 6 minute walk
      distance (6MWD) test and NT-proBNP, a prognostic biomarker for PAH, in the two groups
      (comparing the MTD and MED groups) at the end of the treatment period. In addition, the
      effect of pemziviptadil (PB1046) on other cardiopulmonary hemodynamic parameters (e.g. CI,
      mPAP, mRAP, wedge pressure and SvO2) as measured by RHC will be assessed. Changes in BDI,
      HRQoL, and NYHA/WHO (New York Heart Association/World Health Organization) FC will also be
      assessed.

      An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will periodically assess safety, efficacy
      and biomarker data to independently assess the overall safety profile of pemziviptadil
      (PB1046), to help adjudicate potential dose-limiting toxicities, and to monitor the overall
      benefit risk profile of pemziviptadil (PB1046) during the study. The DSMB will review the
      safety and tolerability data after the first 10 subjects while recruitment is ongoing.
