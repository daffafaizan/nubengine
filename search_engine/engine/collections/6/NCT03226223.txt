      the treatment efficacy of Naltrexone (NTX) in treating alcohol abuse, increasing the
      treatment efficacy by over 2-fold among G-allele carriers (AG/GG). The proposed application
      would be the first to investigate the moderating effect of this genotype in the efficacy of
      NTX to treat stimulant abuse. More specifically, the study team proposes to investigate the
      interaction between NTX and intranasal (IN) methamphetamine (30mg/70kg). Participants who
      meet DSM criteria for mild-to-severe stimulant use disorder (N=up to 70) will complete 4
      testing sessions where drug effects are tested following pretreatment with NTX (0, 50 mg).
      Naltrexone pretreatment effects upon the abuse liability of IN methamphetamine will be
      assessed using self-report measurements of positive subjective effects and drug
      self-administration. Medication effects on these validated predictors of abuse potential will
      be compared between A118G A allele homozygotes (AA) and G-allele carriers (AG/GG; an
      anticipated 25% of the total sample), in order to assess genetic moderation of treatment
      outcome.
