      Previous reports suggest that topiramate could be useful in reducing impulsivity in
      pathological gambling and other impulse control disorders, as well as craving in substance
      addictions. The goal of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of topiramate
      combined with brief cognitive restructuring in treating compulsive buying, compared with just
      cognitive restructuring treatment+placebo.
