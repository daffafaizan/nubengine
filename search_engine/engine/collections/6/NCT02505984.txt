      infant health. An estimated 600,000 American women suffer from PPD annually, making it one of
      the most frequent complications of pregnancy. Available secondary preventive interventions
      are often ineffective, which calls for identifying novel means for prevention. Impaired
      mother-infant bonding is a hallmark of PPD. Depressed mothers may have difficulties
      developing maternal feelings and providing sensitive care. In turn, impaired bonding may
      worsen mother's depression. Conventional pharmacotherapy does not help with bonding
      impairment.

      This study will attempt to fill in the current gap in effective preventive interventions for
      pregnant mothers at risk. Evidence in postpartum mothers indicates that high peripartum OXT
      levels are associated with enhanced maternal behavior and low levels with depression. Data
      also indicates that in depressed mothers, OXT levels may decrease during the first days
      following childbirth rather than increase as is the norm. Therefore, the investigators will
      test the therapeutic effects of OXT in women at risk for PPD. It is hypothesized that
      administration of IN-OXT (total daily dose 48 IU) over the course of four days from as early
      as day one postpartum in comparison to placebo will 1) enhance mother-infant bonding, 2)
      reduce depressive and anxiety symptoms at 5 days postpartum, and 3) facilitate child
      development.
