        -  To establish the maximum tolerated dose of CyberKnife® hypofractionated stereotactic
           radiosurgery in patients with medically inoperable, stage I or II non-small cell lung
           cancer.

        -  To establish the relationship between positron emission tomography (PET) response and
           local control and survival using fludeoxyglucose F 18 PET/CT imaging before treatment
           and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after treatment.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo placement of 3 gold fiducial markers by CT-guidance or
      bronchoscopy. Patients then undergo CyberKnife® hypofractionated stereotactic radiosurgery
      over 45-120 minutes twice weekly for 2 weeks.

      Patients undergo fludeoxyglucose F 18 PET/CT scan at baseline and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months
      after completion of treatment.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 4 years.
