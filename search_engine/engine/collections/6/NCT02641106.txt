      cloud-based administration, we hypothesize that VDOT can be expanded to provide higher
      treatment completion rates at a lower cost than in-person DOT for LTBI treatment using 3HP.
      We propose a randomized controlled trial to address the following specific aims:

      Aim 1: To determine whether LTBI treatment completion and adherence are greater for patients
      treated with 3HP administered via VDOT versus in-person DOT, and to identify patient factors
      associated with these outcomes; Aim 2: To compare acceptability of treatment by patients on
      VDOT versus in-person DOT, and identify factors associated with differences in acceptability;
      Aim 3: To calculate the cost-effectiveness of VDOT compared to in-person DOT for
      administering 3HP.

      To address the study aims we will conduct a randomized controlled trial in which TB contacts
      and refugees in San Diego who are prescribed 3HP for LTBI treatment by their physician will
      be randomly assigned to be monitored for adherence via either VDOT or in-person DOT (Figure
      2). Approximately 100 patients per year over three years (n=155/arm) will be recruited
      through the San Diego County TB Control and Refugee Health Program (TCRHP) clinics for the
      trial. Patients assigned to VDOT will be given a smartphone with service and taught to send
      videos of themselves taking each weekly medication dose; patients in the in-person DOT arm
      will visit the clinic each week to be observed by a healthcare worker taking their LTBI
      medication. Medication adherence will be monitored for all participants until they have taken
      all 12 doses or 16 weeks (limit recommended by the CDC to complete treatment), to compare
      treatment adherence rates and patient acceptance across trial arms. Participants will
      complete brief (20 minute) baseline and follow-up assessment interviews to obtain information
      about potential confounders and effect modifiers of adherence and patient acceptance
      regarding their treatment administration method. Cost-benefit analyses will also be conducted
      to assist in developing policies around the use of VDOT for 3HP. Since participants will be
      recruited after they have been prescribed 3HP by their healthcare provider and all patient
      care will be continued through their provider, no medications will be prescribed or treatment
      decisions made this study.
