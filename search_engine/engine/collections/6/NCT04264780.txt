      more, will be invited to participate. Two groups will be compared: patients who are younger
      than 50 years of age vs patients who are older than 50 years of age.

      The aim of the study is to improve preoperative information to future epilepsy surgery
      patients, to aid medical personnel (doctors, psychologists) in the selection of patients for
      surgery, and to improve knowledge of need for long term follow-up and rehabilitation.
