    
      Prospective Randomized Blind Clinical Trial

      Sixty-four eyes of 64 patients with primary nasal pterygium have been operated by two
      surgeons (E. G-H, A. N-C). All patients are randomized to undergo Mini-SLET or
      limbal-conjunctival autograft transplantation as an adjuvant therapy after pterygium
      excision.

      Four eyes were treated with Mini-SLET(group 1), and 26 eyes have been operated with
      conjunctival autograft (group 2). Patients will be followed up at 1 day, 1 week, 1, 3, 6, 9
      and 12 months postoperation. The main outcome measurement was a recurrence rate after
      surgery.
