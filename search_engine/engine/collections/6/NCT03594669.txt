      intervention for collegiate soccer players. The hypothesis is that measures of sensorimotor
      control will improve and injury incidence rate will decrease after participation in an
      intervention aimed at restoration/refinement of sensorimotor control. This study will be
      conducted as a 1-arm intervention with pre- and post-participation measurement of
      sensorimotor control and completion of an exercise intervention. Statistical analyses will be
      completed to determine within group change pre-to post-intervention and injury risk by
      comparing injury rate in 2018 to injury rate of a historical control.
