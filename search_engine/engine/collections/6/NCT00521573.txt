      improve oxidative stress and hence the possibility to improve endothelium-dependent coronary
      vasomotion, which is a powerful surrogate for clinical prognosis. Coronary atherosclerosis is
      promoted by impaired endothelial function and increased platelet activation. High oxidative
      stress and reduced antioxidant defenses play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of
      atherosclerosis, in particular in transplanted hearts. The aim of the present study is to
      investigate whether the ingestion of a flavonoid-rich dark chocolate compared to
      flavonoid-free placebo chocolate will improve coronary vasomotion in heart transplanted
      patients.
