      known. A large initial bolus dose of streptokinase (SK) might accelerate fibrinolysis and
      restore valve function more rapidly.

      This is a prospective, randomized trial comparing 2 fibrinolytic protocols in a first episode
      of PVT. In the rapid fibrinolytic protocol (RFP) 1.5 MU of SK is given over 1 hour, followed
      if required by a 0.1 MU/h infusion. In the standard protocol (SP) 0.25 MU is given over 30
      minutes, followed by an infusion of 0.1 MU/h. Serial echocardiography and fluoroscopy will be
      done to monitor therapy. The primary end point is the occurrence of a complete clinical
      response (CCR, complete hemodynamic response without any major complication). 58 patients are
      required in each arm for detecting a 30% difference with 80% power at Î±=0.05.
