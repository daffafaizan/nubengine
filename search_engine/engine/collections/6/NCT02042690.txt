      rate of standard-risk adult patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia(ALL) is only 25%-55%
      when they receive chemotherapy alone. The survival rate can be further improved uo to 50%-75%
      when they receive HLA-matched HSCT However, the chance of finding a HLA-matched donor is low,
      especially in China. Alternative donor such as halpo-identical related donor might be an
      choice.

      Our retrospective analysis showed about 59% overall survival could be achieved when
      standard-risk adult ALL patients received halpo-identical HSCT.Therefore, we start this
      randomization controlled trial to compare the efficacy of haplo-identical HSCT with
      chemotherapy for adult(age:18-39 years old) ALL patients in CR1.
