      diagnostic methods and medical treatment of the condition, and furthermore on the short term
      prognosis in terms of mortality and complications. Very few studies investigate how every day
      life is affected in patients struck by a pulmonary embolism, although many patients display
      worries and concerns about their physical, emotional and social well-being after discharge.
      For the time being, no rehabilitation options are available for these patients in Denmark.

      Methods and materials: 140 patients medically treated for pulmonary embolism will be
      recruited from 6 different hospitals. After inclusion the patients will be randomly allocated
      to either the control group, receiving usual care, or the intervention group, receiving an
      8-week home-based exercise programme in addition to usual care. At the time of inclusion,
      after 2 months and after 6 months, the patients' physical capacity is measured using the
      Incremental Shuttle Walk test.

      Furthermore the patients' complete a questionnaire on quality of life (EQ-5D and Pulmonary
      Embolism Quality of Life Questionnaire), self-reported sick leave and use of psychoactive
      drugs. All follow-up measurements and visits take place at the hospital from which the
      patient was discharged.

      Expected outcome and perspective: The investigators expect that the home-based exercise
      programme will improve the overall treatment outcome for the patients in the intervention
      group. The study will furthermore contribute significantly to the limited knowledge about the
      optimal rehabilitation for this group of patients, and may thereby form the basis of future
      recommendations in this field.
