      Crohn's patients who have had an ileal bowel resection. This population is at high risk for
      calcium oxalate kidney stones, a direct consequence of extensive gut malabsorption and
      enteric hyperoxaluria. The benefit of providing oral calcium in this patient population (as a
      means to reduce intestinal oxalate absorption) is known, however, there are no appropriate
      targets for calcium dosing, which is presently performed empirically or not at all. Our goal
      is to establish simple, safe and practical guidelines for calcium supplementation.
