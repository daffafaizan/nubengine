      thyroid gland. This is considered the most common autoimmune disorder, and the most common
      endocrine disorder. Psychological trauma has been suggested as a possible factor in the
      pathogenesis and development of autoimmune diseases. Although a diversity of
      psychotherapeutic interventions have been studied in adults with autoimmune diseases, there
      is a lack of psychological research and randomized controlled trials in the field of the
      Hashimoto disease. This study is designed to be a clinical trial with two arms: one
      experimental and one control group. The experimental group receives IOPT and the control
      group is a waiting list. 70 out-patients with Hashimoto disease will be randomly assigned to
      the two groups. The investigators hypothesize that the therapeutic gains will be more
      significant in the experimental condition than in the control groups at the completion of the
      therapy and that this will be maintained at the 3-month follow-up.The IOPT group undergoes 10
      group modules of IOPT once at two weeks.The sessions will be conducted by clinicians or
      psychotherapists specialized in IOPT. If therapy is efficient on the autoimmune disorder,
      participants in the control group will be reallocated to IOPT after the experimental
      treatment will come to an end.
