      problematic what might result in a permanent lower weight. A short period high quality food
      supplementation could improve weight gain after an infection.

      A complete high quality food will be tested, but also micronutrients alone as there is no
      information on what children with an infection exactly need as a supplement.

      Children aged 6-59 months presenting with diarrhoea, malaria or lower respiratory tract
      infection (LRTI) are provided for 2 weeks with

        -  RUTF supplement (PlumpynutÂ®) of 500 kcal/day

        -  Multi-micronutrient powder (MNP)

        -  Placebo to MNP

      The followup period is 6 months. Anthropometric indicators and morbidity are assessed
      monthly. Participants are invited to attend the study clinic if any signs of disease are
      noticed.
