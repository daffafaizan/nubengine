      swimmers. SIPE is characterized by acute onset of dyspnea and cough, excessive sputum and
      occasionally hemoptysis when swimming in open water. The condition usually resolves
      spontaneously within 48 hours, but may result in serious illness and require emergency care.
      Case reports describe acute treatment with oxygen alone or in combination with diuretics,
      beta-agonist-inhalation or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Evidence for optimal
      treatment strategy is lacking. This study intends to determine whether oxygen alone or
      applied together with CPAP leads to improvement of oxygen saturation and recovery of
      patients. The aim is to treat patients on site without involving hospital care. We study a
      large cohort of approximately 12 000 swimmers during Vansbrosimningen, Sweden's biggest
      annual open water event with a yearly incidence of SIPE about 0,3%.

      Adult patients clinically diagnosed with SIPE are randomly assigned in 2 groups receiving
      treatment during 20 minutes: (1) oxygen 10l/min or (2) oxygen 10l/min and CPAP 7,5 cm H2O.
      Assessment with outcome measures is taken 10 minutes after treatment. Primary endpoint:
      oxygen saturation (%) by pulse oxymetry.
