      Association (NYHA) class II-IV and systolic dysfunction (left ventricular ejection fraction
      less than 0.45) are investigated before discharge and than randomized to the nurse monitored
      management program or to standard care. Examinations are performed at 0, 6, 12, and 18
      months, and include clinical signs and symptoms, quality of life, biochemical assessment,
      echocardiography and drugs used. The study will be completed when all patients have passed
