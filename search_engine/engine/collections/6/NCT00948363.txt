      blood pressure in a clinical significant manner compared to controls. The mechanism for the
      blood pressure reducing effect of kiwi or the responsible components are not elucidated.
      However, plasma lutein levels and antioxidant capacity measured by the ferric reducing
      antioxidant power was increased in the kiwi group. Moreover, gene expression was also altered
      by the increased intake of kiwi.
