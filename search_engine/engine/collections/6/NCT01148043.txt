      resulting in pain, stiffness and loss of hand function. At present, there is no option to
      prevent the onset or the progression of hand osteoarthritis (OA). It is believed that
      inflammation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of OA and that anti-inflammatory
      drugs might be an effective treatment for OA. Anti-malarial agents like chloroquine and
      hydroxychloroquine are potential anti-inflammatory drugs and hydroxychloroquine has already
      proven to be an effective suppressor of inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis. Several
      previous studies with hydroxychloroquine in hand OA also showed a possible effect on pain and
      inflammation, but these studies were mostly retrospective with a small number of patients.
      This is the first prospective, randomised, placebo-controlled study to determine the effect
      of hydroxychloroquine in hand osteoarthritis.
