a study on the direction of inscription of the vectorcardiographict-loop in left and right ventricular hypertrophy .(1) frank lead vectorcardiogram was recorded in 30 normal persons andin 323 cases with hypertension and acquired and congenital heart diseasethe t-loop was classified into 8 types according to the directions ofinscription in 3 planar projections . frequently observed types wereexamined with the direction of the maximal t vector .(2) in majority of normal cases, the t-loop was inscribedcounterclockwise in horizontal and clockwise in sagittal planes .(3) in left ventricular hypertrophy, abnormal inscription of thet-loop was observed with abnormal rightward and superior deviation ofits maximal vector and the t-loop oriented more than 120 in horizontalplane was usually accompanied by abnormal inscription . percentage ofabnormal inscription was higher in cases with cardiac complaints .(4) in right ventricular hypertrophy, directional change of the t-loopwas relatively small but changes in inscription of it were common . thet-loop was always inscribed abnormally in cases with abnormalinscription of the qrs-loop .(5) the concept of the polar vector was found to be valuable instudying the inscription and the direction of the t-loop . significanceof changes in inscription of the t-loop was discussed .
