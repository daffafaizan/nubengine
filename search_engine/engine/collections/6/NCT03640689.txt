    
      The single main research question for this trial is as follows: in adult patients with venous
      ulceration and great saphenous vein incompetence; does iliac vein assessment with IVUS and
      stenting of significant occlusive disease in addition to superficial great saphenous venous
      ablation and compression compared to superficial venous ablation and compression alone offer
      improved ulcer healing rates at three months following treatment?

      Primary Objective To determine whether superficial venous ablation plus early iliac vein
      interrogation plus endovascular stenting in the presence of significant occlusive disease
      results in improved venous ulcer healing compared to superficial venous ablation plus
      compression therapy alone.

      Secondary Objectives

      1. To determine the relative performance of duplex ultrasound compared to IVUS for the
      prediction of NIVLs 3. To determine the rate of primary or recurrent ulceration up to five
      years following intervention 4. To assess patient quality of life in the short and medium
      term following each mode of intervention
