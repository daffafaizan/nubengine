      Chronic Fatigue Syndrome/ Myalgic Encephalopathy (CFS/ME) (Fluge and Mella, BMC Neurol,
      2009). Subsequently, we published a small randomized and double-blind phase II study using
      rituximab induction two infusions two weeks apart (Fluge et al, Plos One, 2011).

      We have completed an open label phase II study with 29 patients using rituximab induction and
      maintenance treatment (six rituximab infusions over 15 months, with follow-up for three
      years, unpublished).

      We hypothesize that a subgroup of patients with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome/ Myalgic
      Encephalopathy (CFS/ME) have a chronically activated immune system involving B-lymphocytes,
      possibly a variant of an autoimmune disease, and that patients may benefit from B-cell
      depletion therapy.

      Three substudies will be performed:

      Endothelial function: assessment of Flow-Mediated Dilation and skin microcirculation at
      baseline and repeated during the time interval 17-21 months.

      Cardiopulmonary exercise test for two following days: assessment at baseline and repeated
      during the time interval 17-21 months.

      Gastrointestinal function: assessment at baseline and repeated during the time interval 17-21
      months.
