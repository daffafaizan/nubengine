      mobile application in combination with hearing devices under real life conditions with
      experienced hearing aid users. The enduser should be able to adjust their hearing aid
      settings by App.

      The app allows the user to change e.g. the loudness of the hearing aids and to create hearing
      scenarios by themselves. The users also shall be able to accept a conferecene call, which
      they will receive from the investigator via App.

      This will be a clinical investigation which will be conducted mono centric at Sonova AG
      Headquarters based in St√§fa (Switzerland).
