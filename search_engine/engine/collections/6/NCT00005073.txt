      asymptomatic recurrent prostate cancer treated with zoledronate vs placebo at different time
      points. II. Compare the time to first skeletal related events (pathological fractures,
      surgery to prevent or treat pathological fractures, spinal cord compression, and radiotherapy
      to bone) and skeletal morbidity rate in patients treated with these 2 regimens. III. Assess
      quality of life and pain in these patients treated with these 2 regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, open label, multicenter
      study. Patients are stratified by prior local treatment (noncurative vs curative) and time
      interval between surgical castration or initiation of LHRH agonists and trial entry (less
      than 1 year vs 1-2 years vs greater than 2 years). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2
      treatment arms: Arm I: Patients receive zoledronate IV over 15 minutes on day 1. Arm II:
      Patients receive placebo IV over 15 minutes on day 1. Both arms: Treatment repeats every 4
      weeks in the absence of documented bone metastasis, disease progression, or unacceptable
      toxicity. All patients with documented bone metastases receive zoledronate as in arm I
      through year 4. All patients receive oral calcium and oral vitamin D daily. Patients who
      received LHRH agonists instead of surgical castration prior to study continue LHRH agonist
      therapy during study. Quality of life and pain are assessed before each treatment. Patients
      are followed every 6 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 500 patients (250 per arm) will be accrued for this study.
