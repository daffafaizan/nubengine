      catheter for a continuous peripheral nerve block, injecting the initial local anesthetic
      bolus via the insertion needle results in a faster-onset sensory block than injecting the
      initial bolus via the perineural catheter. The study results will help define the optimal
      local anesthetic bolus introduction technique-needle versus catheter-for peripheral nerve
      blocks when placing a perineural catheter.
