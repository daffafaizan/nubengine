      ability to disseminate those treatments. There is a particular need to find innovative ways
      to disseminate key principles of empirically supported psychotherapy in primary care
      settings. Narrative communication is an alternative way to disseminate psychotherapy behavior
      change principles. Narrative communication refers to "storytelling" -real people talking
      about their struggles and successful ways of coping. An advantage of narrative communication
      is that it can be easily distributed (by video) and may reach people who do not have access
      to other technologies or who experience barriers to traditional psychotherapy. We propose
      that key principles of a type of cognitive-behavioral therapy (Acceptance and Commitment
      Therapy, or ACT) can be readily disseminated through a video storytelling intervention. ACT
      is an empirically supported therapy for depression. Together with a video production firm
      with a record of working in healthcare and developing documentary-style videos, we will
      produce a storytelling video intervention (sTVi).

      Our aim is to conduct a small open trial (n = 10) of antidepressant medication treatment as
      usual + sTVi. Assessments will occur at baseline and 4 weeks (post-treatment). We will
      examine the feasibility and acceptability of sTVi (e.g., uptake and completion of sTVi,
      engagement with videos, and understanding of key ACT principles) and of this research design.
      We will examine treatment effects (within relevant confidence intervals) on outcomes (e.g.,
      depression severity). We will examine change in potential mechanisms, i.e., ACT-consistent
      coping strategies derived from key ACT principles.
