      On the basis of Inokuchi criteria, the injuries were divided between neck and body fractures,
      which were classified according to Hawkins and Sneppen, respectively. The patients included
      were divided into two groups in relation to fracture location and complexity. Radiographic
      assessment focused on reduction quality, bone healing, Hawkins sign and osteoarthritis
      development. For clinical evaluation, clinical-functional scores (AOFAS Ankle-Hindfoot Score;
      MFS; FFI-17; SF-36) and VAS were determined, and statistical analysis was performed.
