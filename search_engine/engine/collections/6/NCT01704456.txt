      The purpose of this study is to determine whether an 8-session MBCT intervention for PVD is
      no worse than an 8-session CBT intervention for improving women's pain intensity and reducing
      their sexual distress, catastrophizing and hypervigilance towards pain. The investigators
      will also examine whether pain improvements at follow-up are mediated by changes in
      self-compassion and mindfulness (in the MBCT arm only) and moderated by pre-treatment
      credibility, personality, and anxiety sensitivity.

      HYPOTHESES:

        1. At follow-up (4 weeks, 6 months and 12 months post-treatment), women in the MBCT arm
           will experience a greater decline (vs. pre-treatment) in vestibular pain intensity
           compared to women in the CBT arm.

        2. At follow-up (4 weeks, 6 months and 12 months post-treatment), women in the MBCT arm
           will experience a greater decline (vs. pre-treatment) in sex-related distress, pain
           catastrophizing, hypervigilance, and self-reported pain during intercourse/other
           penetrative sex compared to women in the CBT arm.

        3. The investigators hypothesize that improvements in pain intensity during vestibular
           touch will be mediated by changes in self-compassion and mindfulness in the MBCT arm
           only at 6 and 12 months follow-up.

        4. The investigators hypothesize that pre-treatment credibility, personality, and anxiety
           sensitivity will significantly moderate improvements in pain intensity during vestibular
           touch at 6 and 12 months follow-up.

        5. The investigators hypothesize improvements in both arms on the "Patient Global
           Impression of Change Scale" and significantly greater improvements in the MBCT arm
           relative to the CBT arm at follow-up (4 weeks, 6 months and 12 months post-treatment).
