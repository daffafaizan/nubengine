      percentages of ventricular pacing, which causes ventricular desynchronization and has been
      linked to an increased risk of atrial fibrillation in patients with sinus-node disease.

      Patients with sinus-node disease and intact atrioventricular conduction are randomly assigned
      to receive conventional dual-chamber pacing or dual-chamber minimal ventricular pacing with
      the use of new Medtronic pacemaker features designed to promote atrioventricular conduction,
      preserve ventricular conduction, and prevent ventricular desynchronization. The primary end
      point was time to persistent atrial fibrillation.
