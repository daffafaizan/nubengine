      of the endothelin system may thereby protect against airway narrowing. Two receptors exist
      for endothelin 1, Endothelin A & B. Both can be blocked by Bosentan, and the A receptor by
      ambrisentan. Both medications are currently in use for the treatment of pulmonary arterial
      hypertension. The investigators will endeavour to examine the potential role of endothelin 1
      in the development of airway narrowing in asthma through blockade of the endothelin receptors
      A&B through the use of bosentan and ambrisentan.
