      economically productive age group (age 15 to 59) in low and middle income countries. The
      Africa region currently has some of the world's highest traffic injury rates, with vulnerable
      road users, including motorcycle riders, bearing a disproportionate share of the injury
      burden.

      Motorcycles are a rapidly growing form of transport in Africa, both for personal and
      commercial transportation. Conspicuity measures-factors that increase a motorcycle rider's
      visibility-for the prevention of motorcycle crash have been previously studied and found to
      be associated with a decreased risk of crash.

      Motorcycle taxi drivers are a particularly high risk population for motorcycle crash as they
      operate a motorcycle for several hours a day. Reflective, fluorescent safety vests are a
      common article worn by motorcycle drivers in some locations; however, penetration of such
      clothing in Moshi is currently low. This study aims to increase use of reflective vests among
      commercial motorcycle drivers. We will test whether provision of a free reflective,
      fluorescent vest increases use of reflective, fluorescent clothing compared to education
      about wearing reflective, fluorescent clothing alone.
