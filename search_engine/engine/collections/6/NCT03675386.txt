      and potential implementation of the TPSP across Ontario. The investigators will use three
      approaches to create a comprehensive evidence-base that can be used to guide future policy
      and programs related to the management of surgical patients with complex pain and chronic
      opioid use. In the first phase, a multicenter randomized controlled trial will be conducted
      in 6 hospital sites to evaluate the effectiveness and potential implementation of TPSP across
      Ontario. The aim is to recruit a total of 210 patients who are currently taking opioids and
      also undergoing a surgical intervention. The randomized controlled trial will determine the
      effectiveness of the TPSP at weaning patients completely off opioids while still managing
      pain after one year. Secondly, an economic and healthcare utilization analysis of the program
      via linkage to provincial administrative databases will be carried out to understand the
      impact the TPSP program has on the healthcare system as a whole. Lastly, a qualitative study
      will be conducted on both the treatment and control groups. The investigators hope to capture
      further insight to understand patients and providers experiences of the TPSP intervention.
