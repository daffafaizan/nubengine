      endemic for Viral Hemorrhagic Fever (VHF): Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) or Lassa
      Fever. Unfortunately, beyond supportive care, there is no approved therapy for treating
      either infection. Previous studies with intravenous (IV) Ribavirin have shown IV Ribavirin as
      a promising treatment for both infections. This study will provide experience in U.S.
      Department of Defense associated treatment facilities in the use of IV Ribavirin for the
      experimental treatment of viral hemorrhagic fevers primarily among U.S. Service personnel
      deployed to disease-endemic areas.

      The rationale for conducting the study is a) to allow the DoD to gain experience in treating
      VHF b) to offer this experimental but promising therapy to patients with probable or
      suspected VHF c) to collect safety data while obtaining experience using Ribavirin.
