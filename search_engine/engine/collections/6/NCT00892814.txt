      fractions, 2.67 Gy per fraction. The primary endpoint in the trial is late radiation
      morbidity evaluated as fibrosis, secondary endpoints are other types of late morbidity, rate
      of local recurrence and an attempt to establish a genetic risk profile for development of
      late radiation morbidity.

      The hypothesis is that women operated with breast conservation for a breast carcinoma with
      low risk of local recurrence can be offered partial breast irradiation without risking more
      late radiation morbidity compared to whole breast irradiation.
