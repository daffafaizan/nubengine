    
      In this study, patients with SLE will be followed for ~ 5 years. Regular recordings of the
      data needed to score LLDAS (disease activity and treatment domains, see Franklyn L et al, Ann
      Rheum Dis 2016) will be collected, as well as annual recording of lupus-related damage using
      the SLICC_ACR Damage Index (SDI) and quality of life using the Short Form 36 version 2
      (SF36v2).

      At conclusion of primary data collection, the associate of LLDAS attainment, or sustained
      attainment, with protection from organ damage accrual will be ascertained.
