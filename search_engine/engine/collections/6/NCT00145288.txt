      elevated male hormone levels. Females with hirsutism are often overweight and have metabolism
      disturbances as insulin resistance and impaired glucose tolerance.

      The previous studies showed that patients with hirsutism (especially them with polycystic
      ovarian syndrome (PCOS)) have an increased risk to develop type 2 diabetes mellitus on the
      background of insulin resistance / hyperinsulinemia: 30-35 % of females with PCOS had
      impaired glucose tolerance and 5-10 % of them diabetes (1, 2, 3, 4). Hyperinsulinemia
      increases the risk to develop dyslipidemia and cardiovascular diseases (5, 6, 7, 8, 9).

      A previous study in our department who included 340 females with hirsutism (210 with
      idiopathic hirsutism and 134 with PCOS) showed that 6.6% of them had diabetes and 55% insulin
      resistance (10).

      There were only few long-term follow up studies of patients with hirsutism concerning their
      risk to develop diabetes. As far as we now, such studies on patients with idiopathic
      hirsutism are not available until now.

      Hirsutism is been treated with low dose oral contraceptives, which are suppressing androgen
      production. This treatment can also influence the risk to develop diabetes and atheromatosis.
      The previous studies showed that the low dose oral contraceptives had modest influence on the
      lipid profiles and carbohydrate metabolism in patients with hirsutism, but increased the risk
      to develop coronary disease (11).

      Aim

        -  To study and quantify, in patients with hirsutime, the risk to develop type 2 diabetes
           on the background of insulin resistance / decreased glucose tolerance and atheromatosis
           on the background of insulin resistance / hypercholesterolemia.

        -  To clarify the effect of P-pills on patients hair growth and metabolism.

      Design The patients who had previously included in the study between1997 - 2000 (231) will be
      contacted in order to be followed. We will estimate the grad of excess hair growth, the
      hormonal and metabolism profiles.

      Inclusion criteria The patients which had been included in the previous study between 1997 -
      2000, oral glucose tolerance test included.

      Exclusion criteria Pregnancy.

      Investigations

      Anamnesis: previous treatment, pregnancy / in-utero fertilisation history, family
      predisposition to diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.

      Clinical examination: Ferriman-Gallwey score, body mass index (BMI), waist / hip ratio (WHR),
      blood pressure.

      Blood analyses:

        -  Metabolism profile (oral glucose tolerance test, lipid profile);

        -  Hormonal profile (androgen and oestrogen levels, prolactin, FH, FSH).

      The ethic aspects

      We want to evaluate the effect of the treatment and how the risk factors are influenced by
      the treatment.

      All the patients will receive both oral and written information about the study. It will be
      emphasised at participation is voluntary and the informed consent can be retracted at any
      time and this will not influence the treatment of them.The trial is validated by the local
      ethics committee.

      The project will be carried on The Endocrinology Department, Odense University Hospital,
      Denmark, which will supply technical assistance. Blood analyses will be founded by private
      founds.
