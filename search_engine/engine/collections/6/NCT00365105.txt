      Primary

        -  Compare the efficacy of zoledronate, vitamin D, and calcium with or without strontium
           chloride Sr 89 or samarium Sm 153 lexidronam pentasodium, in terms of preventing or
           delaying the time to development of malignant skeletal-related events (SREs) (defined as
           a pathological bone fracture, spinal cord compression, surgery to bone, or radiation to
           bone) in patients with bone metastases secondary to prostate, lung, or breast cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the rate of SREs at 1 year in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare overall survival of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the effect of these regimens on pain control in these patients.

        -  Evaluate resource utilization and cost effectiveness of these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to primary disease site (prostate vs breast vs lung) and number of bone metastases
      (â‰¤ 2 vs > 2). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      Quality of life and pain are assessed at baseline and then at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months from
      start of protocol treatment.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 6 months.
