      photoreceptor function across the retina in healthy volunteers and participants with retinal
      disease.

      Study Population: Up to 120 healthy volunteers and 250 participants, age five or older, with
      retinal disease.

      Design: This single-center, observational, case-control study will be comprised of three
      related Aims that assess rod and cone function with the recently released commercial Medmont
      Dark Adapted Chromatic (DAC) perimeter and/or a commercial Cambridge Research Systems
      computer monitor (Display++) specialized for displaying stimuli at low light intensities. For
      Aim 1 the normal ranges will be established for dark-adapted retinal sensitivities to blue
      and red stimuli of the DAC perimeter, and for radial frequency (RF) hyperacuity on the
      Display++ monitor. For Aim 2, the normal range will be established for describing the
      kinetics of dark adaptation following bleaching of retinal rhodopsin for the DAC perimeter.
      For Aim 3, local changes in rod and cone photoreceptor function across the retina in
      participants with retinal disease will be examined from measurement of the kinetics of dark
      adaptation, dark-adapted retinal sensitivity to the DAC blue and red stimuli, and/or RF
      hyperacuity on the Display++ monitor.

      Outcome Measures: The primary outcome for this study is to establish normal ranges for A) the
      kinetics of dark adaptation (time), B) dark adapted retinal sensitivity (dB) for the Medmont
      DAC blue and red stimuli, and C) RF hyperacuity on the Display++ monitor. The secondary
      outcomes will be to examine changes in the kinetics of dark adaptation, dark adapted retinal
      sensitivity, and scotopic and photopic RF hyperacuity in participants with retinal disease.
