      generates an improvement in balance and strengthens the muscles, it is ideal for
      rehabilitation exercises and balance conditioning. However, these platforms do not provide
      quantitative data on exercises performed on it. And the force platform that provide this
      quantitative data is static, offering no difficulty in maintaining balance. In this way, a
      sensor board wobble board was developed using a conventional wobble board with a plate
      attached to it, between the plate and the platform are eight strain gauges sensors that are
      activated according to the position of the force applied on the platform, the values of the
      sensors are collected by software that demonstrates the point of greatest pressure on the
      disk and its displacement during the exercises, with this data it is possible to determine
      the stability of the user and observe their behavior during the exercises.
