      identification of carriers of communicable diseases and ii) adjustment of protection against
      vaccine-preventable infections to European standards. While universal vaccination is supposed
      to ensure the intended degree of protection, targeted vaccination on the basis of previous
      assessment of the immune status (seropositivity) was repeatedly shown to be a cost-efficient
      alternative. Currently, the broad use of immune status assessment prior to targeted
      vaccination is impeded by the necessity to apply separate seropositivity detection assays for
      each individual condition. This drawback can be overcome by the introduction of a
      comprehensive diagnostic tool permitting simultaneous assessment of seropositivity for
      several vaccine-preventable infections.

      The objective of the present study consists in compilation of an array of sera from

        -  subjects with known history of immunization against vaccine-preventable infections for
           which vaccines are routinely available (measles, mumps, rubella, varicella, tetanus,
           pertussis, poliomyelitis, diphtheria, meningococcal infection) and

        -  new migrants/refugees without reliable vaccination records and undefined immune status
           to be subsequently used for the validation of a multi-pronged diagnostic tool for
           seropositivity detection
