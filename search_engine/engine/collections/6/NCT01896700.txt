      in 24 subjects with MS and imbalance. The subjects will be randomly assigned to receive
      either an escalating does of methylphenidate, 20mg, 40mg or 60mg, divided into two doses each
      day, or matched placebo for 2 weeks at each dose. If a subject does not tolerate dose
      escalation they will be instructed to discontinue use of the drug. The maximum safely
      tolerated dose for each subject will be noted. Changes from baseline in subject's walking
      speed, balance, vestibular function, cognitive function, and fatigue will be assessed at each
      dose.
