    
      Laryngeal Tube Suction Disposable, LTS-D (VBM Medizintechnik GmbH , Sulz, Germany) and
      Supreme Laryngeal Mask Airway, SLMA (Intavent Orthofix, Maidenhead, UK) are second
      generation, single-use, supraglottic airway devices( SADs), with added gastric access, for
      use in spontaneously and mechanically ventilated patients undergoing general anesthesia.

      The effectiveness of the LTS-D and the SLMA has been well established; however, the
      oropharyngeal seal pressure of both devices in different head/neck positions and the
      performance of these devices using positive pressure ventilation have not been evaluated.
      Changing the head/neck position can alter the sealing capabilities of the SAD.

      To the investigators best knowledge there are no studies comparing the oropharyngeal seal
      pressure in different head and neck position when using these devices.
