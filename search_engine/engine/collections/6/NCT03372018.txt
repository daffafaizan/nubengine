      intervention to prevent diabetes in people with elevated mental health symptoms (EMS) and
      prediabetes. This study focuses on Latinos, a demographic group at particularly high risk for
      these related conditions. Experience from the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), and related
      translational studies, suggests that the evidence-based DPP lifestyle intervention is less
      effective among depressed individuals. The proposed Promotora Intervention for Metabolic and
      Mental Health (PRIME2) will be the first adaptation of the DPP lifestyle intervention to
      simultaneously address mental health and prediabetes in a program delivered by promotoras, or
      community health workers.
