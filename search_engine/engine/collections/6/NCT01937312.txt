      Screening Visit and two Eligibility Visits, during which subjects washed out of all other
      intraocular pressure (IOP)-lowering medications and dosed with TRAVATAN Z®, XALATAN®, or
      LUMIGAN®, 1 drop instilled in each eye once daily for 28 days. Subjects who met all
      inclusion/exclusion criteria were randomized at the second Eligibility Visit. The Treatment
      Phase consisted of two on-therapy visits (Week 2 and Week 6).
