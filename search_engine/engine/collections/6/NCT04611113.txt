      (ONS) in combination with counseling further favours the maintenance of nutrition status, the
      recovery of quality of life and, more importantly, improves the practicability of CT-RT. This
      effect would be substantially attributable to the increase in protein-energy intake
      associated with ONS use, but also to the possible "nutraceutical" action of omega-3 fatty
      acids. Therefore, modulation of the inflammatory response could play a role during cancer
      treatments. In this context, there is an already-known high-calorie-high-protein nutritional
      blend, enriched in immunonutrients (arginine, nucleotides and omega-3 fatty acids), which
      could also have an application in this type of patients. This mixture has proven effective in
      reducing the risk of post-operative complications (e.g. infections, fistulas, etc.) and the
      length of stay of patients undergoing major cancer surgery (abdominal and head and neck
      regions). Nevertheless, in oncology, there is a growing therapeutic interest in the
      modulation of inflammation and immunosuppression at the tumour microenvironment level.
