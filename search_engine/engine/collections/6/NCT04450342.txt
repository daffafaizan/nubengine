      treatment of fullthickness tears of the rotator cuff (large or massive â‰¥3 cm in AP or ML
      according to Cofield classification). The subjects meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria
      specified in the protocol will receive either ARCR augmented with REGENETEN or ARCR alone.
      Subjects enrolled into the revision repair subject group will receive ARCR augmented with
      REGENTEN. The clinical follow-up evaluation will be performed preoperatively (Baseline), 2
      weeks, 6 weeks, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after surgery, respectively using subjective outcome
      measures, objective measures of movement and an MRI scan to assess the integrity of the
      repair and assess the retear rate. Health economic data will also be collected.
