      syndrome with massive necrosis of liver cells, and liver transplantation is the only
      available therapeutic option for patients suffering with this condition. However, lack of
      donors, surgical complications, rejection, and high cost are serious problems. Since current
      therapeutic options for LF that is usually with extremely poor prognosis are still limited,
      recent studies indicate that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), due to their function in immune
      modulation and liver-damage repair, are of great therapeutic potential for this disease.
      Previous study showed that bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) replace
      hepatocytes in injured liver, and effectively rescue experimental liver failure and
      contribute to liver regeneration.The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and
      initial efficacy of human umbilical cord MSC (UC-MSCs) treatment for patients with LF. In
      this study, MSCs were isolated from umbilical cord and generated in appropriate growth
      medium. 50 LF patients with LF received i.v. transfusion of 0.5-1.0Ã—106 cells/kg of MSCs as
      the treated group and other 20 LF patients with LF were transfused with placebo without MSCs
      as control group. All 70 of them received the routine management for liver failure. During
      the 2-year follow up, the evaluation of safty and efficacy will be undergone to help to
      establish innovative cell-based therapies for the treatment of diseases.
