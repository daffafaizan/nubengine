      accessing the small bowel (i.e. requiring upper endoscopy) and the relative paucity of
      bacteria in this area (secondary to luminal flow and bactericidal bile acids/gastric acid),
      the small bowel microbiota is infrequently evaluated in any studies of this nature. The small
      bowel microbiota continues to remain an unexplored area of the gastrointestinal tract.
      Characterization of the microbial community and its function is the first step in determining
      how it potentially affects health and disease.
