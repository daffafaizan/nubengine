      childhood overweight intervention program based on the Chronic Care Model in the primary care
      setting, 2) to explore the efficacy of this intervention in improving the weight status of
      children, 3) to examine the acceptability and feasibility of the approach among primary care
      providers and parents. Clinic providers and study personnel will be trained in the use of
      brief motivational interviewing (brief MI) for the visits and phone calls. The American
      Academy of Pediatrics 15-Minute Obesity Prevention Protocol will be used for individual
      visits while the NIH We Can! curriculum and materials will be used for group visits. Parents
      in the control group will receive the We Can! Parent Handbook and usual care. The
      intervention is designed to facilitate efficient communication of advice about behavior
      change, nutrition, and physical activity to parents. Partnership of primary care providers
      with parents and use of brief intervention techniques and group visits can be a practical
      approach. If proven to be effective, this approach can serve as an exportable model to other
      primary care practices and will reach a large proportion of the population and have
      far-reaching effects.
