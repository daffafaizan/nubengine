      outcomes associated with child exposure to early adversity and trauma. Despite these
      promising advances, however, the majority of children served in publicly funded mental health
      systems do not receive evidence-based programs (EBPs). To address this research-to-practice
      gap, several large-scale, system-driven implementation efforts of multiple trauma EBPs have
      been launched over the last decade, including in the states of California and Arkansas.
      Though these system-driven initiatives often increase EBP delivery in community settings
      following the initial implementation push, long-term sustainment of EBP delivery is low.
      Workforce risk factors, such as provider burnout leading to turnover, have been identified as
      contributing to the poor long-term sustainment of trauma EBPs. Therefore, an important step
      to consider in supporting the longterm sustainment of child trauma EBPs is to develop
      implementation strategies that target provider burnout and organizational climate factors
      associated with decreased provider retention. This study will develop and pilot a package of
      implementation strategies, "Supporting Providers & Preventing the Overwhelming of Resources
      in Trauma Systems" (SUPPORTS), aimed increasing the sustained delivery of trauma EBPs by
      addressing the factors associated with provider retention related to burnout. The development
      of SUPPORTS will be informed by a needs assessment conducted with programs involved with the
      multiple-EBP implementation efforts in California and Arkansas. A small randomized controlled
      pilot will then be conducted in California.
