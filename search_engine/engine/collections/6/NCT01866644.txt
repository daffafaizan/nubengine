      transplant, by administering it in the perfusion liquid, at the time of extraction of the
      liver of the donor to improve the damage caused by ischemia / reperfusion. The dose is 400 mg
      in the portal perfusion liquid.

      The study included all considered valid and perfused livers. Patients are randomized to
      contain no drug or n-acetylcysteine by randomization. Then analyzed using blood tests and in
      the receiver and daily during the first seven days post-transplant hepatic dysfunction
      parameters, in order to objectify if liver function improves after administration of the
      antioxidant (n-acetylcysteine ). Safety assessments were performed with intraoperative
      monitoring anesthetic depth, postoperative parameters of liver and kidney function and graft
      pathologic examination after perfusion.
