    
      This study employs two computerized programs: TARA (the treatment program), and a set of
      ordinary computer games (the active control program). Participants will be asked to use their
      assigned program (treatment or active control) for one hour per session, for four-five
      sessions per week, over 8-10 weeks (40 total sessions). Several elements of flexibility are
      allowed in the schedule to accommodate the challenges that people with ASD can face.
