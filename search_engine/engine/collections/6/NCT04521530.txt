      implant procedure nowadays according to literature and research. In response to patients'
      demands not only implants are immediately placed but also immediately loaded within 72 hours
      reducing the time for prosthetic loading and also improving bone formation according to some
      studies. The debate in modern implant dentistry is whether to immediately load the implants
      in functional occlusion or non-functional occlusion and which will improve the
      osseointegration and reduce crestal bone loss.

      Implants of the BioInfinity system were placed in 16 subjects divided into two groups.

      Group (A): 8 patients with missing posterior mandibular teeth whom will be rehabilitated with
      immediate functionally loaded implants.

      Group (B): 8 patients with missing posterior mandibular teeth in whom immediate
      non-functionally loaded implants were used.

      The two groups were evaluated at baseline, immediately after implant placement and 4 months
      postoperative to evaluate crestal bone level and quantitative radiographic bone density using
      CBCT.
