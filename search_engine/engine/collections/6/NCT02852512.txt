      include conditions such as urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse (POP). POP is
      estimated to affect 30% of women aged 50- 89 years, and the lifetime risk of requiring
      surgery is 11%. Open abdominal sacrocolpopexy is the established gold standard procedure and
      is indicated when there is prolapse of the anterior and/or apical vaginal wall compartments.
      Laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy (LSCP) has not been widely adopted as it demands skill and
      motivation and it is associated with a long learning curve. So the hypothesis is that
      robot-assisted laparoscopic approach for sacrocolpopexy (RALSCP) could be an alternative to a
      pure laparoscopic technique.

      In the study design 62 patients will be randomly enrolled (31 in the laparoscopic arm and 31
      in the robotic assisted one). The primary outcome will be the anatomic one, secondary
      outcomes will be functional in terms of storage or voiding dysfunctions, sexual dysfunctions,
      bowel dysfunctions, QoL, post operative complications.

      For continuous variables will be used the Mann-Withney test, for categorical data will be
      used McNemar test and X2 test.
