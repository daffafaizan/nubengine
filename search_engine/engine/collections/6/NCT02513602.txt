    
      The primary purpose of this study is the evaluation of the effects of the kidney transplant
      on the periimplant bone density by the comparison with the density of healthy patients. The
      secondary purpose is obtaining clinical, histological and radiographic data to evaluate the
      effect of systemic conditions and its rebound on the insertion of fixtures.

      Evaluation criteria

        1. Control group: evaluation of the periimplant bone density (1 mm) next to the implant
           virtually planned using the CT editing software on the cone beam CT acquired in a
           retrospective sample of patients already treated with the insertion of a fixture in the
           molar or premolar edentulous site

        2. Test group: periodontal evaluation with plaque index, bleeding on probing index and
           probing 1 month before operation.

        3. Test group: evaluation of periimplant bone density (1 mm) in the fixture
           virtual-projected zone (the implant will be inserted there) with the CT acquisition and
           editing software.

        4. Test group: evaluation of the implant stability after their insertion (primary
           stability) using the Resonance Frequence Analysis. ISQ (Implant Stability Quotient)
           value is expressed in 4 numbers (mesial, distal, buccal, lingual), average values of
           three measures acquired in each side.

        5. Test group: evaluation of the implant stability immediately after the insertion
           calculating the insertional torque value (ITV) with an implant motor.

        6. Test group: evaluation of the periimplant bone using an endoral periapical radiograph
           with Rinn device immediately after the operation.

        7. Test group: histomorphological examination of the bone core sample made by a trephine
           resulted from the implant site preparation
