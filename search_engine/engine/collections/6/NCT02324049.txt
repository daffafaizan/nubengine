    
      This study was designed as a 3-part study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of IV
      administration of SBC-103. Participants enrolled in Part A (0.3, 1.0, or 3.0 milligrams [mg]
      per kilogram [kg] of SBC-103 administered every other week [QOW] for 24 consecutive weeks).
      Participants who completed Part A were eligible for Part B (an increase to 1.0 or 3.0 mg/kg
      QOW). Participants who completed Part B were eligible for Part C (5.0 and/or 10.0 mg/kg to
      continue through Week156; no participants received both 5.0 and 10.0 mg/kg). Due to the early
      termination of the SBC-103 development program, including this study, all participants
      withdrew from Part C at the sponsor's decision. As a result of the early termination of this
      program, this report provides only safety data.
