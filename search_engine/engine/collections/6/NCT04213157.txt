      ischemia were included in the study. The patients were allocated into two groups according to
      the tumor size; T1a (≤ 40 mm, n=215), T1b (41-70 mm, n=77). Demographics features, clinical
      tumor characteristics, intraoperative and postoperative outcomes were analyzed. A negative
      surgical margin, warm ischemia time (WIT) < 20 min and no postoperative complications
      (Clavien-Dindo ≥ grade 3) were accepted to achieve the trifecta outcomes. Pentafecta has
      defined as trifecta criteria plus >90% preservation of estimated glomerular filtration rate
      (eGFR) and no stage upgrade of chronic kidney disease 12 months after LPN. Univariable and
      multivariable analysis were used to identify factors predicting trifecta and pentafecta
      achievement.
