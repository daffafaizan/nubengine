    
      Stroke, also called cerebrovascular disease, is a sudden-onset neurological disorder that
      causes a regional or general dysfunction in the brain due to vascular causes. Dysphagia, one
      of the common complications of stroke, is associated with increased morbidity and
      mortality.The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical evaluation of swallowing in
      stroke patients and to determine the factors affecting the severity and prognosis of
      dysphagia in patients with dysphagia.Fifty-five patients with acute stroke and dysphagia who
      were admitted to Ankara City Hospital Neurology Clinic and diagnosed with stroke by neurology
      and who did not meet the exclusion criteria will be included in this study. When the patients
      are admitted to the neurology clinic and will be discharged, they will be evaluated three
      times, in the first month after discharge. Clinical evaluations will be made by the
      responsible investigator in the examination room. Patients will be evaluated with a bedside
      swallowing screening test. Patients will be divided into 3 groups as mild, moderate and
      severe dysphagia according to the test. The patients will be evaluated while they are in the
      neurology clinic and 1 month after the treatment is given.
