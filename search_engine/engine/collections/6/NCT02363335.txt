    
      Objectives and Specific Aims:

      We plan to investigate whether phosphodiesterases are involved in the regulation of
      glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) secretion from L cells in humans. We hypothesize that: (1)
      phosphodiesterase-4D (PDE4D) inhibitor (roflumilast) enhance GLP-1 secretion from L cells;
      (2) PDE4D inhibitor (roflumilast) and DPP4 inhibitor (sitagliptin) have synergistic effect on
      increasing the amount of circulating active GLP-1.

      Experimental Design and Methods:

      Twenty healthy adults, age 21-55, will be recruited for this study. This is a randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over study. Each subject will serve as his/her own
      control and each person will have four different study visits spaced about 3 weeks apart.
      During each visit, they will receive one of the following medications (oral route) in random
      order:

        1. Roflumilast (Daliresp) 500 mcg + Placebo

        2. Sitagliptin (Januvia) 100 mg + Placebo

        3. Roflumilast (Daliresp) 500 mcg + Sitagliptin (Januvia) 100 mg

        4. Placebo

      A 10-hr mixed-meal test will be administered 1 hour after the medications and frequent
      blood-samplings will be done over 10 hours.

      Medical Relevance and Expected Outcome:

      Preliminary clinical data have shown that phosphodiesterase inhibitors improved glycemic
      control in type 2 diabetes, and pre-clinical animal data have shown that phosphodiesterase
      inhibitors enhanced GLP-1 secretion from L cells. The application of novel, pre-clinical
      findings to an understanding of human biology and pathobiology is of fundamental and critical
      importance. This study will give us a better understanding of the regulators of GLP-1
      secretion in humans, and this new understanding may lead to new treatments for type 2
      diabetes.
