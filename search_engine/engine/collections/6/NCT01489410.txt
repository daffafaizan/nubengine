    
      This is a randomized prospective study with two arms, Drug-Eluting Beads with doxorubicin
      (DEB) and lipiodol ethanol mixture (LEM), with the goal to show non-inferiority of LEM, which
      if true will facilitate a simple alternative to DEBs. Patients will be randomized to one arm
      of the study and will remain in that arm if they need to have more embolization in the
      future. Both of the mentioned methods (DEB and LEM) fall within the standard of care.
