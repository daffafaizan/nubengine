      cancer patients' fatigue, and also between an objective measure of sleep continuity, [i.e.,
      actigraphy and polysomnography (PSG)] and self-reported fatigue. Chemotherapy disrupts normal
      sleep patterns, and fatigue, in the later stages of chemotherapy, may occur as a result of
      disturbed nocturnal sleep continuity. However, the causes of chemotherapy-related fatigue
      remain unknown, and whether or not abnormal sleep architecture contributes to this
      debilitating effect has yet to be explored. We believe that fatigue experienced by many
      cancer patients receiving chemotherapy is due, at least in part, to changes in delta activity
      [i.e., restorative sleep during the non-rapid eye movement (NREM) cycles of sleep]. A finding
      that slow wave sleep abnormalities play a significant role in fatigue would prompt further
      confirmatory studies and support controlled intervention studies.

      Comparisons: In a clinical trial of individuals with cancer prior to, during, and after
      completion of chemotherapy, we will identify and compare specific chemotherapy-related
      changes in sleep stages/architecture that may relate to an increase in fatigue. These changes
      will be measured by actigraphy, PSG, and patient self-reporting techniques (e.g., sleep
      diaries, questionnaires).

      The primary objective is to:

        -  examine the role of delta sleep in the development of chemotherapy-induced fatigue in
           cancer patients

      Secondary objectives are to:

        -  characterize the involvement of other elements of sleep architecture [e.g., rapid eye
           movement (REM) sleep] and changes in sleep continuity relating to the development of
           chemotherapy-induced fatigue in cancer patients

        -  examine the role of sleep architecture in the persistence of chemotherapy-induced
           fatigue

        -  examine (in post hoc analyses) the relationship of various physical symptoms and patient
           variables that may be related to fatigue (e.g., pain, hot flashes, anxiety, hemoglobin,
           menopausal status, sleep continuity, and QOL) and to each other, both during and
           following chemotherapy.

      Answers to these questions will provide information that will be helpful in developing
      potential targets for interventions to reduce fatigue.
