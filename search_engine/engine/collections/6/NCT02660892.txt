      current study we will use a new and modern technique, the indicator amino acid oxidation
      technique (IAAO), to determine threonine requirements in children.

      This technique is a newer technique which involves the consumption of protein shakes composed
      of specific amounts of threonine mixed with a stable isotope tracer. The oxidation of this
      isotope will be measured in urine and breath to determine a breakpoint (requirement) of
      threonine.

      Determining the requirement for threonine, as well as the availability of threonine from
      various food products will help us to develop better food recommendations for children.

      Research Method This study will be carried out in a repeated measures design. Participants
      will be recruited and screened for eligibility. Six participants will be brought in for 6
      testing visits with reference amino acid, where they will be randomized to a level of
      threonine intake. A further 3 visits will be carried out during which participants will be
      randomized to a level of threonine consumption derived from alternative proteins (casein,
      soy, peas) which is at a threshold below the requirement for threonine to determine
      availability.
