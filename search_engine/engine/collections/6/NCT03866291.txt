      salmonella, shigella, yersinia or campylobacter are also cultured selectively for ESBL.

      All patients are contacted by mail with the results. ESBL-positive patients are invited to
      submit further faecal cultures and blood samples during one year follow up time, to
      investigate how long the patient is colonized with ESBL.
