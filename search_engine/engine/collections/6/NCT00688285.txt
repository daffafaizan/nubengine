      care physicians (PCP) without the help of a kidney specialist. Many of these patients fail to
      achieve targeted outcomes and late referral to a nephrologist has been associated with an
      increased risk of death. Automated computerized clinical reminders have been shown to improve
      physician compliance with recommended guidelines in other settings.

      Aims: To determine if clinical reminders can help PCPs decrease the rate of late referrals,
      improve urine albumin checks in CKD patients

      Design: prospective randomized controlled, single-blinded study with additional historical
      control

      Methods: Two 20-minute teaching sessions aimed at all GIM PCPs in the UPMC clinic followed by
      randomization of the eligible GIM providers to receive automated clinical reminders (CR) for
      their CKD stage 3b-5 patients versus routine care.

      Outcomes: Using a database search, individuals with an eGFR<45ml/min/1.73m2 (not seen by a
      nephrologist) will have data collected on: PCP referral to a nephrologist, urinary albumin
      (or protein) quantification in the past year, PCP recognition of patients with eGFR<45ml/min,
      ACE/ARB usage.
