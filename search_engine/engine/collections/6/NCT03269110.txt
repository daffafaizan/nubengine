      high dose folic acid supplementation in pregnancy on the prevention of preeclampsia in a
      randomized controlled trial (RCT) design.

      The primary objective of the FACT 4 Child study is to examine the effect of maternal folic
      acid supplementation in pregnancy on the risk of social impairments, as well as executive
      function, emotional and behavioural problems associated with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD)
      and other developmental disorders, and death in offspring aged 4-6 y of mothers recruited to
      the CIHR funded FACT.

      The effect of folic acid supplementation throughout pregnancy may potentially have an impact
      on both the mother and her offspring, which highlights the importance and relevance of this
      study to the management of women with preeclampsia. Results of this study will allow care
      providers to have the evidence of potential effects of high dose folic acid that can then be
      discussed; allowing women to make an informed choice about their management and care.
