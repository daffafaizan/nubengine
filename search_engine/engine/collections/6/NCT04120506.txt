      following tests will be performed:

        -  Complete Blood Count (CBC)

        -  Routine serum biochemistry including liver function tests (LFTs)

        -  Plasma biomarker lyso Gb-1

        -  Height & weight & calculation of BMI

        -  Physical examination and medical history elicited including concomitant medications

        -  Ultrasound for spleen and liver volumes

      In addition, the following tests will be performed at 12, 24 and 36 months:

        -  Echocardiography

        -  Electrocardiogram (ECG)

        -  Urinalysis

        -  HRQoL questionnaire (TBD)

      At each home visit, the following assessments will be performed by the study nurse:

      Queries regarding AEs and changes in clinically relevant Gaucher parameters as described by
      the patient (e.g., bone pain), inter-current illnesses, etc.

      Patients will be required to complete the End-of-study visit, including the final infusion at
      10', at SZMC. This final visit will include in addition to the usual safety and efficacy
      assessments and routine tests, (mentioned above) also, DEXA and anti-drug antibodies.

      In addition, we would perform a 4th PK measurement at end of the extension period.
