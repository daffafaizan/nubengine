      nonsubmerged implants with thin (<3 mm) and thick (>3 mm) soft tissue over 1.5 year after
      implant placement. All submerged and nonsubmerged implants were randomly placed as
      split-mouth. Clinical periodontal parameters were recorded. Crestal bone levels were analyzed
      from the day of implants inserted to 1.5 year after prosthetic loading on digitally
      standardized radiographs. Non-parametric test were used for statistically analysis.
