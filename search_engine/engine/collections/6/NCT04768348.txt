    
      Phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) deficiency is a rare disease caused by an inborn error of
      metabolism. If left untreated, PAH deficiency results in progressive, irreversible
      neurological impairment during infancy and early childhood.

      This study is designed to collect information about important PKU-related symptoms and tests
      to characterize the natural history of PKU due to PAH deficiency in a selected sample of
      adults. No new investigational treatment will be administered to participating patients.
