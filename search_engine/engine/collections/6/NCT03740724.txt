      to severe localized scleroderma (morphea). The first component is FCX-013, an autologous
      genetically modified human dermal fibroblast (GM-HDFs) cell product that is genetically
      modified with a lentiviral vector (LV) to express human matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP1).
      MMP1 is also known as interstitial collagenase or fibroblast collagenase and is an enzyme
      that under normal physiological conditions breaks down the extracellular matrix.
      Specifically, MMP1 breaks down interstitial collagens, types I, II and III. In addition, the
      FCX-013 cells are also transduced with genetic constructs that encode the RheoSwitch
      Therapeutic System® (RTS®) an inducible promotor system that in the presence of a small
      molecule activator ligand controls expression of the MMP1 gene. The RTS® is activated to
      express MMP1 by the oral administration of the small molecule component. The purpose of this
      open-label single arm Phase 1/2 study is to investigate the safety and effectiveness of
      FCX-013 plus veledimex.
