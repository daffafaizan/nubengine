      Following the consent process, subjects will be randomly assigned to a treatment arm
      (anesthetic or placebo group). Baseline data will be collected prior surgical implantation of
      the pain pump delivery system. Both study and control groups will be able to receive
      supplemental medication for breakthrough pain as determined by the surgeon. Post-operative
      data will be collected up to three weeks following surgery.
