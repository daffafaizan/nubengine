      liver blood flow or with the enzymatic metabolic capacity. Results will be based on a
      population pharmacokinetic modeling analysis performed in NONMEM program. The investigators
      will first account for the effect of different measured size scalars on volumes and
      clearances and then they will search for plausible covariates (liver blood flow, enzymatic
      capacity, degree of hepatic steatosis, etc) on dexmedetomidine metabolic clearance. A
      pharmacokinetic model capable of characterizing clearance changes in the obese using more
      plausible biological covariates will be tried to be defined.
