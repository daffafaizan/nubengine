      urine in healthy individuals. It is synthesized in the thick ascending limb of Henle (TALH)
      and the early distal convoluted tubule. Its biologic function is still obscure; however, some
      experimental studies indicated that it might serve as an important urinary defense factor
      against bacterial colonization and stone formation.

      There are controversial publications on the frequencies of urinary tract infections and
      nephrolithiasis in patients with mutations of uromodulin gene. Deposition of mutated
      uromodulin in the urinary system may lead to tubular cell dysfunction and apoptosis. These
      alterations may subsequently cause tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis . Moreover, the
      release of abnormal uromodulin after apoptosis through basolateral secretion may elicit an
      immune response which may give rise to an immune-mediated tubulointerstitial nephritis .

      Uromodulin can activate the other components of the immune system and may modulate the
      inflammatory and immune responses through different mechanisms .

      Experimental studies yielded that uromodulin negative mice displayed splenomegaly with
      infiltration of white pulp by macrophages and increased levels of TNF-Î± and interleukin-1 .
      Rheumatoid arthritis is a systemic autoimmune condition that may eventually result in the
      joint damage, disability and premature mortality.
