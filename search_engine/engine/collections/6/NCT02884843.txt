    
      The intubating Laryngeal Tube Suction-Disposable (iLTS-D) (VBM Medizintechnik, Sulz, Germany)
      is a new updated version of the Laryngeal Tube-Suction Disposable (LTS-D).

      It has a ventilator channel with a 13.5mm internal diameter, which enables the passage of an
      Endotracheal Tube (ETT) either blindly or with fibreoptic guidance. Similarly to the LTS-D,
      the iLTS-D also has a separate channel for gastric tubes placement up to a size of 18 Fr.

      The current randomized study was designed to assess the success rate of blind and fibreoptic
      endotracheal intubation using iLTS-D, in comparison with the Ambu® AuraGain™ in adult
      patients under general anesthesia.
