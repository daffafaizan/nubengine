      enrolled colon cancer patients would be divided into the intervention group (CME group) and
      control group (D2 radical operation group).

      The postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy is determined by the pathological results. For
      patients of stage Ⅲ and patients of stage Ⅱ with unfavorable histologic features, six months
      of adjuvant chemotherapy of XELOX or fluorouracil-based regimen are recommended.

      The postoperative examination should be performed every four months in the first two years
      and every six months in the following three years, to exclude local recurrence and distant
      metastasis.

      Our study is expected to last five years, of which two years for recruiting patients, three
      years for follow-up.
