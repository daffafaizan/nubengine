    
      The study objective is to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the J-Plasma system for use
      in dermal skin resurfacing.

      This is a multi-center, single arm, evaluator-blind prospective study of 55 study subjects
      who are seeking a procedure to reduce the appearance of wrinkles and rhytides at up to 5
      investigational centers in the United States.

      Study subjects that meet study eligibility criteria and have provided informed consent will
      be enrolled in the study. During the procedure, the investigators will use J-Plasma on
      applicable facial zones to reduce wrinkles and rhytides.

      Study subjects will be followed immediately following the procedure, at 10 days, 1, 3, and 6
      months post-procedure for study assessments.

      Study enrollment is expected to occur over 3-6 months. Imaging and study assessments will
      continue through 6 months post-procedure. Total study duration is expected to be
      approximately 9-12 months.

      Primary study endpoints will be assessed at 3 months following the procedure.
