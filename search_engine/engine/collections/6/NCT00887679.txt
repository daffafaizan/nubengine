      general population. Approximately 25%-40% of HIV-infected patients have anxiety disorders;
      Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Panic disorder and post-traumatic Stress Disorder being the
      most frequent. Non-adherence to anti-retroviral medications is commonly seen in patients with
      HIV with GAD.The role of specific selective serotonin reuptake (SSRIs) in the treatment of
      HIV-patients with GAD is unclear. Escitalopram has been used in the treatment of GAD in the
      general population. It has been shown to be safe in HIV-patients with a tolerable side-effect
      profile. However, whether it can improve GAD in HIV-infected patients has not yet been
      investigated.
