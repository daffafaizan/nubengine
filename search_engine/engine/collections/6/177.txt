effect of parathyroid and other human tumors and tissues on boneresorption in tissue culture .mouse calvaria were grown in tissue culture in combination with singleor multiple fragments of a variety of human tumors and glandular tissuesto determine their capacity to enhance bone resorption . singlefragments of parathyroid adenoma tissue consistently enhanced resorptionin both the frontal and the parietal bones . except for one squamous--cell carcinoma of the lung which had some activity all other tissuestested as single fragments had no enhancing effect . on the other hand,all human tissues enhanced resorption when multiple fragments wereplaced in a halo around the calvarium, suggesting the presence of lesseramounts of resorption-enhancing factors in other human tissues .
