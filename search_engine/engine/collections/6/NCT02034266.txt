      that has been observed in individuals with type 1 diabetes Nerves supply signals to all
      structures in the body and take signals back to the spinal cord and brain. Both small and
      large nerve fibres can be affected in disease states, such as diabetes. Since defects of
      small nerve fibre activity have important consequences (painful symptoms, erectile
      dysfunction, cardiac rhythm disturbances, bladder and gastrointestinal dysfunction), it is
      important to determine new ways to maintain their function to help individuals maintain a
      high quality of life.

      Until now, researchers have only tested the effect of omega-3 supplementation in animals with
      diabetes and have found this nutrient to lessen nerve damage while maintaining the function
      of nerves. However, there has not been any research on the use of omega-3s on nerve structure
      and function in humans with type 1 diabetes.

      Current standard of care for type 1 diabetes is to manage glycemic control and any painful
      symptoms through medication. The use of omega-3 supplements for prevent or limit nerve damage
      in diabetes is not within the current standard of care. In this study omega-3 supplementation
      is experimental and has been approved by Health Canada for use in this study.
