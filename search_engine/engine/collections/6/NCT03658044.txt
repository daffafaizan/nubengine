      recruited from participating hospitals and randomized to either "prescribed participation" or
      just receiving information about the platform but with no prescription.

      All patients are also receiving standard care. After treatment all patients will receive
      information about the platform and the aim with the platform. A short demonstration of the
      platform will also be provided. The platform will contain general information on "Life after
      cancer treatment". It will be a forum to discuss with fellow-patients, both experienced and
      newly treated and it is also possible to address questions to health professionals. After the
      demonstration an information about the study will be given and patients will be asked to
      participate. If accepted a consent form will be presented and signed by the patients. All
      patients will be given an alias - a username, to be used at the platform which gives the
      patients confidentiality. However, as this is a research project they will be informed that
      their clinical data will be extracted from their patient charts. The alias will in a separate
      file be connected with their personal identification number. The patients randomized to
      intervention (prescribed participation) will be offered to contact a research nurse or
      researcher if they have any practical questions regarding the use of the platform. All
      patients will be asked to answer a questionnaire at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months after
      surgery. Patients will be answering the questionnaires electronically on the platform or in a
      paper version sent by ordinary mail.
