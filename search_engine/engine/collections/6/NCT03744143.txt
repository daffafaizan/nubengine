      approach.

      The results of the surgical treatment confirm its validity with regard to the reduction of
      dyspareunia in the short to medium term but show less efficacy in the long follow-up. The
      long-term impact of surgery on sexual function may be influenced by multiple factors, such as
      recurrence of symptomatic or anatomical disease, preservation of autonomic nerve fibers
      responsible for the arousal and genital sensitivity and residual vaginal length. These
      factors are potentially dependent on the surgical approach performed to treat vaginal
      endometriosis.

      Particular importance as a surgical step assumes the closing phase of the vaginal defect that
      can be performed through a transverse or longitudinal suture. The longitudinal suture could
      guarantee, theoretically, a greater residual vaginal length and a better sexual function in
      the postoperative period than the vaginal closure by transversal suture, as demonstrated in
      previous studies about the suture techniques of vaginal cuff after hysterectomy.

      Up to date, there are no studies comparing surgical, clinical and functional outcomes of the
      vaginal suture neither the two surgical approaches (laparoscopic or vaginal) for vaginal
      endometriosis eradication.
