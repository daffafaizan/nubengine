      Primary

        -  Evaluate disease-free survival at 2 years in patients with poor prognosis squamous cell
           carcinoma of the head and neck treated with chemoradiotherapy and cetuximab after
           complete surgical resection.

      Secondary

        -  Evaluate quality of life.

        -  Evaluate tolerability.

        -  Evaluate overall survival.

        -  Analyze germinal polymorphisms.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive cetuximab IV on day 1. Treatment with cetuximab repeats every week for up to
      8 courses. Patients also receive cisplatin IV on day 8. Treatment with cisplatin repeats
      every 3 weeks for up to 3 courses. Patients undergo concurrent radiotherapy 5 times a week
      for 7 weeks beginning on day 8.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 1 month and then every 3 months
      for 2 years.
