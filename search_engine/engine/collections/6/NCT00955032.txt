      domains: behavioral (lack of effort and productivity, dependence on others for structuring
      daily activities), cognitive (loss of interest in new experiences, lack of concern for one's
      problems) and affective (flattened affect and lack of response to positive or negative
      events). Apathy has been consistently attributed to functional disturbance of neural systems
      involving mesial frontal and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), an area with reciprocal
      connections with limbic, frontal cortices and the basal ganglia.

      Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a noninvasive tool used to manipulate
      activity in specific brain neural circuits through the skull and, in turn, induce short-term
      (milliseconds) and long-term (minutes to hours) changes in behavior. The duration of effect
      depends on the stimulation mode. Several studies have now demonstrated that rTMS may
      facilitate or modulate behavior beyond the actual stimulation. rTMS of the mid-dorsolateral
      frontal cortex (MDLFC) has been used to treat depression presumably because of its modulatory
      effect on the fronto-cingulate system (MDLFC and the ACC circuitry). Studies have shown that
      rTMS of the left MDLFC modulates the blood flow response in the ACC. We therefore hypothesize
      that high-frequency rTMS of the left MDLFC will also improve apathy in PD.
