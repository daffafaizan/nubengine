    
      Patients (n=220) presenting to the University of Minnesota Endodontic clinic, with moderate
      to severe pain from toothache requiring root canal treatment ,will be invited to participate
      in the study. The endodontic treatment is NOT part of the research. Patients will complete
      pain evaluation forms and take 2 doses of prescribed medication. Normally after a root canal
      procedure, patients will be suggested to take over-the-counter ibuprofen if needed, or
      prescribed an analgesic if they are having severe pain. We will be randomizing patients in
      double blind manner to receive regular or long acting local anesthesia and post-op
      medications (placebo or 1 of 3 analgesics), with the patient evaluating their pain before
      starting root canal (pre-treatment pain), after root canal, after analgesics and during the
      following day.
