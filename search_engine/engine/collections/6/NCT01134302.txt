      associated with the reconstruction of the aortic arch during the initial Norwood procedure as
      a neonate. In the last few years, a new management strategy (the 'Hybrid' strategy) has been
      proposed which defers the aortic arch reconstruction to a second stage procedure at 4-6
      months of age.

      Proponents of the Hybrid strategy assert that the avoidance of cardiopulmonary bypass and
      circulatory arrest in the neonatal period will avoid neurologic injury in the critical
      neonatal period and thereby result in superior long-term neurologic outcomes.

      We are testing whether the Hybrid management strategy is associated with superior neurologic
      outcomes or not.
