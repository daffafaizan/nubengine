      animal models are associated with altered intestinal permeability; consequently, maintenance
      of the gastrointestinal barrier is an emerging area of interest. The purpose of this
      randomized, double-blind, controlled crossover study is to compare the difference between the
      change from baseline in gastroduodenal permeability after drinking a cranberry or control
      beverage for two weeks. Gastroduodenal permeability will be assessed following aspirin
      challenge by measuring urinary sucrose in the 0 to 5-hour urine collection after differential
      sugar probes are consumed. Urine will be collected for an additional 19 hours (24 hours
      total) to assess whole gut permeability. A 4-week washout period will separate the
      interventions. Stool and fasting blood and saliva samples will be obtained before and during
      the intervention periods to assess fecal microbial communities and markers of intestinal
      barrier, immune function and oxidative stress. It is anticipated that cranberry juice will
      selectively increase intestinal Akkermansia bacteria, reduce markers of inflammation and
      oxidative stress, increase mucosal immunity, and protect the gastroduodenal barrier from an
      aspirin challenge.
