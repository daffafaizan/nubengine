    
      This is an open-label, uncontrolled phase 1-2 study to evaluate the safety, tolerability,
      pharmacodynamic effects, and preliminary efficacy of ABX196 administered in combination with
      nivolumab in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. The study consists of 2 phases, a Dose
      Escalation Phase and an Expansion Phase. Nivolumab will be administered, consistent with the
      US prescribing information, as a 30-minute IV infusion on Days 1 and 15 of each 28-Day cycle.
      ABX196 will be administered as an IM injection 120 minutes (+/- 15 minutes) after the
      completion of the nivolumab infusion on Day 1 of every other 28-Day cycle (i.e., every 8
      weeks).
