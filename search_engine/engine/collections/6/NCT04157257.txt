      the first stage: 0-24 weeks as the core treatment period, 25-48 weeks as the extended
      treatment period. The second stage: 49-96 weeks is the extended treatment period. Stage 2:
      subjects in stage 1 group A and C were grouped into group E(QL-007 200 mg BID或XX mg +TDF 300
      mg QD), and subjects in group B and D were grouped into group F(QL-007 200 mg BID或XX mg +
      Entecavir 0.5 mg QD). Subjects in group E and F entered the second stage of treatment
      according to 200 mg BID. After the efficacy data of the original treatment clinical trial
      (protocol 201) determine the optimal dose of 007, all subjects entering the second phase will
      receive the optimal dose of 007 and continue treatment withTDF or Entecavir tablets (007
      XXmg+TDF or ETV) into the second phase 49-96 weeks of extended treatment.
