      children considered to be at high risk. In children younger than 5 years of age with
      intolerance to trimethoprim - sulfamethoxazole, parenteral pentamidine may be a successful
      alternative.

      Thirty-two children are randomized to one of two treatment arms. Patients receive pentamidine
      on either a biweekly or a monthly treatment schedule. Treatment continues until the last
      child enrolled has received at least 6 months of pentamidine. Patients are stratified
      according to age < 24 months or age >= 24 months. Steady-state pharmacokinetics will be
      examined in a subsample of 20 patients.
