      study by signing and dating an Informed Consent Form and the Health Insurance Portability and
      Accountability Act (HIPAA) Authorization for use of protected health information in research.

      The donor will produce a sample by placing a collection swab under his or her tongue until
      the indicator window turns blue. To ensure the validity of the sample, the donor may not eat,
      drink, or consume candy for ten minutes prior to the collection time.

      A second oral fluid sample will be obtained for the purpose of determining salivary pH at the
      time of collection. The donors will expel oral fluid into a small collection cup or spoon,
      and the collector will determine pH using specialized pH strips.

      Urine samples will be collected from donors in approved specimen cups according to protocols
      indicated by the New York State Department of Health guidelines. Blood samples will be
      collected by trained and certified medical professionals using appropriate collection tubes.

      Participating donors will also be requested to complete a questionnaire regarding information
      including age, weight, and medication information (including type of medication, dosage,
      dosing pattern, and time of last dose), and medical history (concerning known health issues).
