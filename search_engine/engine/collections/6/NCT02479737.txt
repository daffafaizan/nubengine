      to evacuate blood, blood clot, bloody fluid, and air accumulation within the operative site
      after closure of the surgical wound. This is a prospective multicenter observational
      post-market study with a retrospective component. The study is open to up to five (5) German
      sites enrolling a consecutive cohort of cardiac surgery patients.

      There are two conditions for participation in this registry. First, sites are required to
      enter into the study database anonymized matched historical data elements from a cohort of
      cardiac surgery patients done over the preceding 12 to 24-month period (Phase 0). These
      retrospective data elements will be used as baseline information for the purpose of
      comparative analyses with the prospective data sets. Second, sites that have not been using
      the PleuraFlow System before enrolling patients to this study are required to participate in
      a roll-in phase (Phase 1). The purposes of the roll-in phase are to allow the users at
      participating sites to familiarize themselves with the product use and with ACT, to implement
      Clinical Use Protocols provided by ClearFlow, Inc. to all commercial users as part of product
      training, and to demonstrate consistency and compliance with the clinical use protocols.
