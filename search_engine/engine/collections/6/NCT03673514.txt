      were performed on 50 patients between February 2011 and July 2013. Patients meeting the
      inclusion criteria underwent surgical treatment using the DAA or PA, according to a
      randomization process. Radiological analysis assessed implant position, limb lengthening, and
      potential implant related complications. X-rays were performed at subsequent follow-up visits
      and consisted of an antero-posterior (AP) pelvic X-ray and a lateral projection of the hip.
      Two independent observers, not involved with patients or surgeries, reviewed all
      postoperative radiographs independently.Two fellowship-trained surgeons in two separate
      hospitals performed all procedures. Both surgeons had previously performed over 100 cases
      with each approach, before initiating this study.

      Patients underwent either the posterior or direct anterior approach.
