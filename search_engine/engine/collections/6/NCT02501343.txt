      (NaHCO3) prior to a high acid load meal on glucose metabolism in non-diabetic men and women.

      This is a double-blind placebo-controlled randomised study with a crossover design.

      Study Procedures:

      Two (2) meal studies will be performed 1 to 2 weeks apart. Studies will include collecting
      fasting blood to assess circulating glucose, insulin, C-peptide, free fatty acids,
      glucagon-like peptide-1, acid/base markers, including electrolytes (EUC) and venous blood pH.
      Participants will then be either administered sodibic (1680 mg) or matching placebo and a
      standardised Western style/high acid load meal. Investigators and participants will be
      blinded to the intervention. Blood will be drawn every 15 min in the first hour and then
      every 30 min for 3 hours in total. Arterial stiffness and appetite score will be evaluated at
      ½ h intervals.

      Sample size: 30

      sample size calculation: To detect a difference in area under the curve (AUC) of venous blood
      pH with a paired crossover design, 32 individuals will be required with statistical power
      1-β>0.8 (allowing for drop-out).

      statistical considerations: Differences between AUC of outcome measures post sodium
      bicarbonate vs. placebo will be tested using paired t-tests. Two-way repeated measure ANOVA
      tests will be conducted to assess differences in the response to the meal with sodium
      bicarbonate vs. placebo.
