      randomized to participate in 16 sessions of either supportive-expressive therapy or
      emotion-focused therapy. The two treatments are theorized to differ in their main mechanism
      of change: supportive-expressive therapy places emphasis on insight as its main mechanism of
      change, and emotion-focused therapy places emphasis on emotional processing as its main
      mechanism of change. Both can serve as strength- or weakness-focused treatments, based on the
      patient's baseline levels of insight and emotional processing. Importantly, this study will
      employ multiple complementary methods, which will include session-by-session self-report
      questionnaires from both patient and therapist, as well as interdisciplinary measures based
      on hormonal and acoustic measures, cognitive tasks, clinician interviews, and behavioral
      coding systems to complement the self-report measures. In addition, prior the beginning of
      treatment patients will complete diaries via mobile survey application. The findings will
      contribute to the research on personalized mechanisms of change and can help clinicians focus
      on more efficient treatment delivery, adapted to given subpopulations of patients, according
      to their strengths and weaknesses. If a mechanism most likely to stimulate change for a
      subpopulation is identified, a corresponding treatment can be chosen that is most likely to
      activate that particular mechanism and by that improve the rate of patients' respondent to
      treatment.
