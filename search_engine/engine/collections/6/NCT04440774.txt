    
      This trial consists of 4 intervention arms according to the vaccination product: 1) ChAdOx1
      Chik, 2) ChAdOx1 Zika, 3) ChAdOx1 Chik and ChAdOx1 Zika as contralateral co-administration,
      and 4) placebo. There will be a total of 120 participants divided in ten study groups with 12
      participants per group (Table 5.1). Groups 1 to 3 will receive ChAdOx1 Chik + placebo
      administered contralaterally, Groups 4 to 6 will receive ChAdOx1 Zika + placebo administered
      contralaterally, and Groups 7 to 9 will receive both ChAdOx1 Chik and ChAdOx1 Zika
      administered contralaterally. Group 10 will receive placebo in both arms.

      Enrolment into this study will be implemented in a step-wise dose escalation manner.
      Participants will be first recruited into the vaccination groups at the lowest dose (Groups
      1, 4 and 7). It is only after completion of these low dose groups and upon satisfactory
      interim clinical safety reviews that participants will be enrolled into the mid dose groups
      (Groups 2, 5 and 8). Participants in the high dose groups (Groups 3, 6 and 9) will be
      enrolled last, after completion and interim clinical safety reviews from the mid dose groups.
      Participants allocated to the Placebo group (Group 10) will be evenly distributed across the
      dose escalation model.

      Randomisation procedures will be implemented accordingly, at a ratio of 3:3:3:1 for each of
      the four intervention arms.

      The study involves a total of 9 visits (screening inclusive) and follow up will be undertaken
      for 6 months after vaccination day
