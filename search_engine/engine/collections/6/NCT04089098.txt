      in critically ill patients with hemodynamic instability. The endogenous release of stress
      hormones, namely renin, vasopressin, norepinephrine and cortisol, may be variable in
      critically ill patients, which may have a modifying effect on the hemodynamic response.
      Passive leg raising (PLR), a validated, simple and dynamic test, is currently recommended for
      testing fluid responsiveness. The test might possibly be false negative under extreme
      dehydration or increased intra-abdominal pressure. This prospective observational study aims
      to compare PLR and MVC with 300 ml Ringer acetate solution administered as a bolus within 5
      minutes in critically medical patients with a hemodynamic instability. MVC will be carried
      out in every participant following PLR. Blood samples will be collected immediately before
      PLR for measurement of renin, copeptin A, cortisol and norepinephrine. These biomarkers will
      be compared with the Magnitude of fluid responsiveness. Additionally, renal resistive index
      will be assessed with ultrasound immediately before PLR and 1 and 24 hours after fluid
      challenge and the data compared with Initial serum cystatin C. Blood samples for measurement
      of angiopoietin-2, a marker of capillary leak, will be drawn immediately before PLR and the
      data will be correlated with the amount of fluid required for Initial resuscitation.
