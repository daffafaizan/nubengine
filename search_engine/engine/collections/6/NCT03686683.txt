      control subjects followed on AS. The study will enroll subjects being followed by AS and
      initially diagnosed within 12 months prior to Screening with either ISUP Grade Group 1 or 2
      adenocarcinoma of the prostate.

      The Screening Phase will begin at the completion of the informed consent process and
      continues until randomization. After Screening assessments are completed, eligible subjects
      will be randomized 2:1 to the sipuleucel-T arm or the control arm. Subjects randomized to
      sipuleucel-T arm will receive product as described in the sipuleucel-T approved label.

      Subjects will undergotheir first leukapheresis within 60 days of randomization.

      Subjects randomized to the control arm will be followed on AS. The Active Phase will begin at
      randomization and continues through completion of the end of Active Phase study visit (within
      30 days of Biopsy 2). Once a subject from either the sipuleucel-T or control arms completes
      the end of Active Phase visit, they will enter the Follow-up Phase and complete Follow-up
      Phase visits every 6 months starting from their last Active Phase visit. The Follow-up Phase
      visits end when the last subject enrolled completes Biopsy 2 and end of Active Phase visit or
      until the study is terminated by the sponsor.
