      A pilot study of warm versus cold perfusion and preservation was completed in 32 patients
      prior to the ongoing study. The findings of the pilot study showed 53 percent of patients had
      evidence of new neurologic disturbance at postoperative day four. Only the neurologic
      dysfunction could be correlated with warm versus cold perfusion (37.5 percent warm versus 75
      percent cold, P less than 0.05). The changes in neurologic function had abated or clearly
      improved by one month of follow-up, and the distinction in neurologic dysfunction grading was
      no longer apparent between the two groups.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      Patients were randomly assigned to cold, tepid, or warm blood cardioplegia, coinciding with
      normothermic, tepid, and hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass. All patients received a standard
      anesthetic protocol combining narcotic and inhalational anesthesia. Each patient entering the
      study had extensive clinical data collected prospectively incorporating most aspects of
      measurable determinants related to myocardial preservation. Additionally, neurologic tests
      were performed by a blinded neurologist and rated by an objective scoring system, the Mathew
      scale. The studies were performed preoperatively, on the third or fourth postoperative day,
      and at one month following surgery. Hematologic data were measured for fibrinolytic
      potential.
