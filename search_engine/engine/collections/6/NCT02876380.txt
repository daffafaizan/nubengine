      channelopathies, is challenging before birth. Recently, in a retrospective study it was
      reported that a gestational age dependent bradycardia allows a much higher recognition of
      genotype positive LQTS than the standard obstetrical gestational age independent definition
      of bradycardia (Mitchell 2012).

      However, the fetal heart rate in pregnancies with maternal or paternal LQTS diagnosed prior
      to the pregnancy has not been evaluated prospectively from the first trimester to birth. Nor
      is it known if the fetal heart rate /gestational age profile might be mutation specific. In
      addition, the use of fetal heart rate to successfully distinguish between LQTS and normal
      fetuses of pregnancies in which a parent has a known mutation has not been tested.

      The investigators believe that fetuses with an LQTS mutation born to families in which the
      mother or father has an LQTS mutation will have slower heart compared to fetuses, shown after
      birth not to have the family mutation. If the investigators hypothesis is correct, these
      findings could be applied to the general population of pregnant women to prospectively
      identify fetuses with LQTS and without a known family history. Since a fetal proband has been
      led to the identification of unsuspecting family members, prospectively identifying affected
      fetuses would increase ascertainment of life-threatening mutations in all ages (Cuneo 2013).
