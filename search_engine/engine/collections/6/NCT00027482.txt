      other pathogens in order to characterize protective responses that can prevent new infection
      in uninfected individuals, as well as define those responses that lead to successful control
      of viral replication in persons already infected with the pathogen. We wish to define the
      specific human immune responses to HIV infection, other pathogens and vaccines using human
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells, plasma, serum, urine, or oral secretions as a model.
