      pathologies such as a torn meniscus or a damaged anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). The
      severity of these lesions is graded using a scheme such as the International Cartilage
      Research Society (ICRS) classification system. Grade I lesions are often left untreated,
      while Grade IV lesions require dedicated surgical intervention. Grade II and III lesions are
      frequently treated when they are encountered arthroscopically.

      Currently, it is not known whether treatment of fibrillated articular cartilage is beneficial
      or whether one procedure is superior to another. Magnetic resonance imaging is the best
      technique currently available for non-invasive assessment of chondral lesions. The primary
      aim of the proposed study is to compare post-procedure MR imaging characteristics of
      fibrillated articular cartilage treated using one of the three standard of care measures: 1)
      Washing of the knee joint with saline solution to clear blood, fluid or loose tissue (also
      known as lavage); 2) Lavage in addition to mechanical shaver (a manual surgical tool used by
      the study doctor); and 3)Lavage in addition to the Paragon device (RF-based
      microdebridement), which may also be used with a mechanical (or manual) surgical tool. The
      secondary aim is to determine the association between imaging features and clinical outcomes.
