    
      Placenta previa (PP) is defined as the placenta overlying the endocervical os and grades
      according to the relationship and the distance between the lower placental edge and the
      internal os of the uterine cervix: low-lying previa, marginal previa, partial previa, and
      complete previa.

      Cesarean delivery and assisted reproductive technology are associated with an increased risk
      of placenta previa in subsequent pregnancies. Other risk factors for previa include previous
      spontaneous, elective pregnancy terminations, previous uterine surgery, increasing maternal
      age and maternal parity, multiple gestations, smoking, cocaine use, and prior previa.

      It is associated with numerous adverse maternal and fetal-neonatal complications, such as
      perinatal hemorrhage, preterm birth, blood transfusion, hysterectomy, maternal intensive care
      unit admission, disseminated intravascular coagulation, septicemia, thrombophlebitis, and
      even fetal-neonatal and maternal death.

      This is a 1:2 prospective, matched and hospital-based case-control study to investigate the
      characteristics, complications and perinatal outcomes in pregnant women with placenta previa.
      For each placenta previa women, the investigators selected two none-placenta previa pregnant
      women as control from the same department matched on the mode of delivery, using simple
      random selection when excess matches are available. The date of their admission is limited to
      two days.

      This hospital is a tertiary university-affiliated medical center with a stable number of
      approximately 12,000 deliveries per year. Placenta previa is diagnosed by experienced
      ultrasonologists based on a transabdominal ultrasonic finding of placental tissue covering
      the internal cervical os before delivery, and further confirmed by obstetricians at delivery.
