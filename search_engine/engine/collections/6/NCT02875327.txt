      diagnosed at an advance stage and less likely to receive recommended treatment than are
      patients with other types of health insurance. The objective of this project is to link
      persons included in the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) data to Medicaid
      enrollment information during the year before and after their cancer diagnosis. NCI is also
      seeking permission to create and maintain a file that crosswalks each patient's SEER case
      number to their Medicaid enrollment number. Information about Medicaid enrollment would be
      available by special request to all researchers who want to use SEER data to assess the
      impact of Medicaid enrollment on stage and treatment.
