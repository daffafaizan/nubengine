    
      Forty patients undergoing open elective gastrointestinal surgery, will be randomized to four
      groups of 10 each. The patients will be randomised to receive either preoperative (1) oral
      carbohydrate drinks (CHO) or (2) infusion of Dichloroacetate with oral carbohydrate drinks
      (3) exercise or (4) standard care.

      Since the interventions are qualitatively different and only the physiological mechanisms are
      being studied rather than the clinical outcomes, the study is not blinded and no placebo is
      used.

      Analysis for cytokines, insulin, glucagon levels will be performed at screening, during
      surgery and on the 2nd postoperative day. Muscle biopsies will be taken at the beginning and
      end of surgery, from rectus abdominus and vastus lateralis muscles for analysis of mRNA
      (IL-6, TNF-Î±, Akt1, IRS-1, FOXO1, MAFbx, MURF1 and PDK4) and protein (MafBx, FOXO1, PDK4)
      expression and muscle metabolites (glycogen, lactate, triglycerides and FFA). Oral Glucose
      Tolerance Test (GTT) to be performed at the screening visit and on the 2nd postoperative day
      using a standard protocol. The techniques to be employed to study the above will include
      RT-PCR, radioimmunoassay, spectophotometry, bioluminometry, Western blotting and ELISA.

      Primary outcome: The changes in indices of muscle insulin resistance and muscle protein
      breakdown at the beginning and at the end of surgery, in response to surgical stress.

      Secondary outcomes: (a) The expression of muscle metabolites, reflecting muscle protein
      turnover (b) Clinical Outcomes: Length of stay and incidence of postoperative complications.
