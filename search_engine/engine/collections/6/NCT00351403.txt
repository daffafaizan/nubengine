    
      Further objectives of this trial are:

      To record the tolerance of the therapy with Peginterferon alfa-2b plus Ribavirin over 72
      weeks inclusive the adverse reactions and the withdrawal rates.

      To evaluate the biochemical response to the treatment (ALT values during and after the
      therapy) in comparison to the virological response to the treatment.

      To evaluate the validity of the withdrawal rules of this trial at week 12 and 24 in
      comparison to the 2-log-rule and a qualitative detection of the HCV RNA at week 24 with a
      detection limit of 50 IU/ml.

      To evaluate the impact of the HCV RNA concentration before the therapy, and the HCV kinetic
      during the therapy on the response to the treatment in the different groups.

      To evaluate the impact of the serum concentration of Ribavirin on anaemia and the virological
      therapy response, as well as the dependence of the serum concentration of Ribavirin on the
      creatinine clearance in comparison to the body weight.
