      variables were the 16 week value minus the baseline value (post run-in). Last observation
      carried forward was used for missing values. The key comparisons are for two groups OATP1B1
      reduced carriers and on-carriers and their association with Cytokines and Lipids.
      Secondarily, we were interested in changes over the 16 weeks for the pooled sample,
      irrespective of genetics.
