      pain. Genicular nerve blocks and radiofrequency methods are performed usually for this
      reason. This procedure is performed with ultrasound and / or fluoroscopy, sterile staining
      and covering of painful knee to the middle of thigh and leg, localization of superomedial,
      superolateral, inferomedial genicular nerves are tested and then conventional radiofrequency
      is applied to all 3 nerve regions.Fifty patients who had total knee prosthesis for
      gonarthrosis in the Orthopedics and Traumatology Clinic at least 3 months postoperatively had
      knee pain (infection, mechanical causes and radicular pain) were included in the study.The
      VAS and WOMAC values recorded at the time of application and the VAS and WOMAC values
      recorded at the 1st week, 1st month and 3rd month after the procedure will be used to
      evaluate the effectiveness of the method.
