      sample in China, and randomly sample patients with HF as a primary diagnosis, and were
      admitted to hospital from January 1st, 2015 to December 31st, 2015. The sample size is
      estimated to be 10,000.

      The investigators will collect photocopies of the sampled medical records and centrally
      abstract detailed information, which included demographic characteristics, medical history,
      clinical features, diagnostic tests, in-hospital procedures, lab tests, treatments, and
      in-hospital outcomes. Data abstraction quality was monitored by random auditing of 5% of the
      medical records, with overall variable accuracy exceeding 98%.

      Analyses will examine patient characteristics, diagnostic testing patterns, in-hospital
      treatments, in-hospital outcomes, and variation in results across regions and hospitals.
      Practical guidelines, quality evaluative system, and risk model will be established based on
      the findings, to improve patient outcomes for HF in the future.
