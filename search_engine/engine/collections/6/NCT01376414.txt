      in emergency department (ED) patients with non-specific abdominal pain. The investigators
      plan to enroll 250 patients during the pilot stage of this study. This T2 translational trial
      aims to apply recommended guidelines for the investigation and management of NSAP and
      dyspepsia into the practical arena of ED clinical care. The "test-and-treat" approach to
      symptomatic H. pylori infection has been endorsed by the American Gastroenterological
      Association (AGA). Patients who test positive for H. pylori by UBT will be treated with
      clarithromycin-based triple medication therapy as recommended by the American College of
      Gastroenterology (ACG) at the discretion of the treating physician. The rationale is that
      successful identification of H. pylori in the ED and initiation of treatment may reduce
      future risk of gastritis, gastric lymphoma, and gastric cancer, and is cost-effective through
      reduction of future healthcare costs and symptom severity. Study subjects will be followed
      for medication compliance, resolution of symptoms, and ability to obtain outpatient
      follow-up. As part of this study, the investigators will be collecting important information
      on the ED evaluation of abdominal pain.
