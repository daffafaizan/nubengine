      Current recommendations for the use of anti-seizure prophylaxis are based upon a single
      institution study that has not been reproduced with other studies contradicting their
      conclusions. The proposed study will be a randomized prospective study at Loyola University
      Medical Center to assess the efficacy of anti-seizure prophylaxis in patients who have
      suffered traumatic brain injury (TBI). Patients with suspected TBI will undergo computed
      tomographic (CT) scan of the head. Following identification of TBI on CT scan, patients will
      be randomized to one of two study groups. Patients will be randomized to receive a seven-day
      course of anti-seizure prophylaxis with levetiracetam (UCB Pharma Inc.; Keppra) or randomized
      to a study group that will not receive anti-seizure prophylaxis. Patients will be consented
      prior to entry in the study. Patients will be followed for a total of seven days post injury
      for clinical signs of seizure activity. Additionally, patients will be assessed at one month
      post injury for clinical signs of seizure activity.
