      in regions where malaria is endemic. We have found that alpha thalassemia is common in
      Ashkenazim, whose countries of origin are in temperate climates.

      We are analyzing the alpha globin polymorphisms to determine the haplotypes of individuals of
      many ethnic groups and will compare to try to define the origin of thalassemia in these
      individuals of European extraction.
