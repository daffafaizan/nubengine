      participants. A total of 42 patients diagnosed with metastatic melanoma, referred to
      treatment with ICI will be enrolled in the study and examined prior to treatment with ICI
      (baseline), at nine weeks following baseline (T2), at 24 weeks following baseline (T3) and at
      36 weeks following baseline (T4). A total of 42 gender- and age- matched healthy controls
      will be included and assessed at similar time points. Assessments will include a battery of
      neuropsychological tests, questionnaires, blood samples, and Magnetic Resonance Imaging
      (MRI).

      The main objectives of the study are to investigate:

        1. Changes in cognitive functions over the course of treatment with ICIs.

        2. Possible associations between changes in cognitive function and immune markers during
           and following ICI treatment.

        3. Possible associations between changes in cognitive function and changes in brain
           morphology.

        4. Changes over time in other possible adverse effects of ICI treatment, including
           psychological distress, sleep disturbances, and fatigue.
