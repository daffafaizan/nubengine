      four period crossover design. At the screening visit, following provision of written informed
      consent, eligible participants will be provided with a washout toothpaste and toothbrush for
      use at home during the study and for at least 14 days prior to the first treatment visit.

      Participants will then be scheduled to attend the first of four treatment visits a minimum of
      14 days later. For each treatment visit, participants must abstain from oral hygiene for a
      period of 24 hours (+6hrs, -2hrs), immediately preceding the pre-brushing dental plaque
      evaluation. All the participants will undergo an oral soft tissue (OST) examination followed
      by disclosing and a dental plaque assessment.

      At the treatment visit 1 pre-brushing plaque assessment, those who develop a sufficient
      amount of plaque (Turesky mean score ≥ 2.00) will be randomized to study treatment.
      Participants will then brush once (1.5 grams [g] ± 0.05g of assigned toothpaste), under
      supervision of study staff for one timed minute, with one of the four test toothpastes after
      which re-disclosing and a post-brushing plaque assessment will be carried out. Participants
      will be allowed to brush with the washout paste following the post assessment plaque
      assessments.

      A minimum of three days washout period will follow each treatment period during which period
      Participants will brush with a commercial washout toothpaste. Participants will complete four
      treatment visits and will brush once with each of the four test toothpastes throughout the
      course of the study.
