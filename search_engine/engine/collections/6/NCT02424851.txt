      at diagnosis with renal dysfunction. Outcome is poor due to high early mortality, with 28% of
      newly diagnosed myeloma patients in myeloma trials with renal failure not surviving beyond
      100 days, compared with 10% overall.

      This study aims to establish:

        1. Whether proteosomal inhibition (bortezomib) or immunomodulatory (thalidomide) based
           therapy achieves threshold reduction of serum free light chains (sFLCs) in a significant
           majority of patients.

        2. Whether sFLC response to the first 2 cycles (early responder) predicts haematological
           and renal response to the next 2 cycles of therapy.

        3. An early time point for assessment of sFLC reduction as a biomarker for response.

      Participants will be stratified by age and chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage to receive
      either bortezomib, bendamustine and dexamethasone (BBD) or thalidomide, bendamustine and
      dexamethasone (BTD).
