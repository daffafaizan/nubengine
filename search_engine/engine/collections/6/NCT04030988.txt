      vitiligo, of which the autoimmune theory is the most accepted.

      The main targets of therapy are stabilization of the disease activity through
      immunosuppression, and repigmentation through stimulation of reservoir melanocytes
      proliferation and migration.

      Narrow band ultraviolet phototherapy (NB-UVB) remains the cornerstone treatment of vitiligo.
      NB-UVB can induce both immunosuppression and repigmentation. Several factors can modulate the
      efficacy of NB-UVB therapy in treatment of vitiligo cases, including patient's age, lesion
      site, duration of the disease, and duration of the therapy.

      The immunosuppressive function of NB-UVB was first detected in 1963 by Hanisko and Suskind,
      who observed that the contact hypersensitivity response in skin sensitized to
      dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB) was reduced if skin was previously exposed to suberythemal doses
      of UVB.

      Present evidence suggests that UVB suppress immune system through generation of T-suppressor
      cells, which inhibit the effector cells of Th1 type. It appears that UV-induced
      immunosuppression depresses the function of Th1 cells and enhances the activity of Th2 cells
      via cytokines such as Interleukin 10.

      It's expected that this immunsupression is lower in darker skin types, where increased basal
      melanin might act as a barrier. However, skin was previously divided to UVB-resistant and
      UVB-sensitive (UVB-R and UVB-S) based on the contact hypersensitivity testing, regardless of
      the skin type. Moreover, A study on NB-UVB phototherapy for psoriasis revealed that
      photoadaptation during NB-UVB therapy Is Independent of skin type.
