      treatment facilities in different US jurisdictions with high AIDS prevalence. These results
      will be used to refine the video and to increase its effectiveness among minority persons
      living with HIV infection. The beta-testing will consist of: 1) unobtrusive observations of
      waiting room patients for one day at each facility and 2) de-identified, existing patient
      medical data abstracted from each facility's electronic medical record (EMR) system to
      investigate outcomes relevant to HIV medication adherence and retention in care.
