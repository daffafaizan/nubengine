      is an increase in the amount of fat (such as cholesterol and triglycerides) in the blood.
      These increases can lead to heart disease and pancreatitis. Although the mechanism by which
      PIs cause hyperlipidemia is not clearly understood, there are medications to combat this side
      effect. The primary purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of
      escalating doses of atorvastatin, based on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)
      levels, in HIV-infected children receiving stable antiretroviral therapy.

      Participants were assigned to one of two groups based on age (10 to 14 years or 15 to 23
      years) and were treated for a maximum of 48 weeks. The first six participants enrolled in the
      study were in the 15 to 23 year old age group. Once safety data through week 8 on these 6
      participants was analyzed, the remaining participants were enrolled. All participants
      received atorvastatin in combination with a stable antiretroviral regimen. Each participant
      was followed independently according to a dose escalation algorithm for atorvastatin.
      Participants began dosing at 10 mg daily. If efficacy criteria were not met, dosing increased
      to 20 mg daily at week 8. Since dose escalations were done within subject, safety and
      efficacy rates were presented for the dose-escalation strategy overall and not for individual
      doses. Atorvastatin was provided by the study, but antiretrovirals were not.

      Study visits occurred at study entry and weeks 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, and 48. Safety labs were
      collected at all study visits. Blood collection for lipid measurements occurred at weeks 4,
      12, 24 and 48.
