      given in adjunction with standard HD-MTX chemotherapy as interventional group; standard
      HD-MTX is given with routine diet as control group. The primary endpoint is the safety of
      ketogenic diet in PCNSL patients receiving chemotherapy, secondary endpoints include rate of
      complete remission, remission time, rate of tumor relapse and overall survival.
