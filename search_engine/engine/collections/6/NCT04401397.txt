      unit setting, the findings could be applied to the surgical units' patients too, since they
      share common physiological and clinical characteristics. In the literature the effectiveness
      of "early mobilization" in the length of hospital stay and recovery of the patients operated
      for coronary artery bypass graft and heart valve replacement in the cardiac surgery setting,
      is unknown.

      The term "early mobilization" is not restricted to a time factor procedure but contains the
      provision of a customized dynamic set of physical therapy techniques which in studies are
      variably determined in terms of duration, intensity, frequency and content.

      The aim of the study is to determine the clinical effectiveness of the intensive early
      mobilization physical therapy intervention compared with standard care of physical therapy in
      the cardio-thoracic surgery clinic of Papageorgiou General Hospital of Thessaloniki.

      The present study will investigate the volume and extend of the expected physiological
      effects of "early mobilization" on the prevention of the clinical illness' detrimental
      sequelae and on the functional recovery promotion, hospital mortality and readmission rate of
      CABG, AVR and MVR patients. Consequently, it will investigate if the improved health outcomes
      may limit the number and intensity of complications and thus may speed up hospital discharge.
      In the first group of the experimental design, patients will be treated with an intensive
      early mobilization protocol and the patients of the second group will receive a standard care
      physical therapy treatment. Controlling for the detailed baseline characteristics that will
      be assessed during medical history at admission, potential bias will be limited from
      unmeasured confounders of the study.
