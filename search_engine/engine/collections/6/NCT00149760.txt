    
      Somatization disorder is a syndrome characterized by the presence of multiple medically
      unexplained physical symptoms. It often results in substantial functional impairment and the
      need for extensive medical treatment. Neither pharmacological nor psychosocial treatments for
      the disease have demonstrated clinical success. People with somatization disorder may benefit
      from a treatment that integrates emotion-centered strategies into cognitive behavioral
      therapy. The long-term effectiveness of this treatment has not been established, however.
      This study will examine the long-term effect of cognitive-affective behavior therapy on the
      physical symptoms, functioning, and health care utilization of people with somatization
      disorder.

      Participants in this open-label study will be randomly assigned to receive either
      cognitive-affective behavior therapy (CABT) or standard medical care that is augmented by a
      psychiatric consultation. Treatment will last 4 months. Assessments of somatic
      symptomatology, functional impairment, and health care costs will occur at screening,
      baseline (1 to 2 weeks after screening), and 4, 10, and 16 months after baseline. The visits
      at 10 and 16 months post-baseline will assess specifically the long-term efficacy of the
      treatment.
