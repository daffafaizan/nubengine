      in the vaginal microbiome and mucosal inflammation, which may increase risk for vaginal
      atrophy, urinary tract infections (UTI) and other genital tract infections. This study will
      determine whether use of vaginal estradiol for 12 weeks in menopausal women living with HIV
      with symptomatic vaginal atrophy will improve atrophy symptoms and the vaginal microbiome and
      reduce mucosal inflammation thereby improving vaginal health. This study will include 50
      participants randomized to treatment with a vaginal estradiol insert or no therapy for 12
      weeks and will have 4 study visits.
