      inhibiting drugs in addition to standard antibiotic TB therapy will improve the patients
      immune system and boost TB vaccine responses.

      The project will provide safety and immunogenicity data from a Norwegian phase 1 clinical
      trial of the therapeutic TB vaccine candidate H56:IC31 and the COX-2i etoricoxib given to TB
      patients together with standard TB antibiotics.

      The investigators will also perform exploratory in-depth studies of immune regulatory
      mechanisms and try to identify biomarkers for efficacy of treatment both in humans and in a
      parallel mouse model. These results may further optimize the therapeutic strategy and prepare
      for larger clinical trials and finally contribute to new treatment options for MDR-TB.

      Objectives:

        -  Study the safety and tolerability of etoricoxib given for 20 weeks (day 0-140) alone and
           in combination with the therapeutic TB vaccine H56:IC31 given as two immunizations at
           day 84 and day 140 in patients with active TB disease treated with conventional 26-week
           anti-TB chemotherapy.

        -  Study the immune effects of etoricoxib given for 20 weeks (day 0-140) on immune
           regulation and TB vaccine (H56:IC31) immunogenicity in patients with active TB disease
           treated with conventional 26-week anti-TB chemotherapy.
