    
      Patients with small cell lung cancer who have progressed after platinum-based first-line
      therapy will be enrolled in this study. Patients will receive irinotecan liposome injection
      at 70 mg/m^2 intravenously, over 90 min on Days 1 of every 14-day cycle until progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Imaging assessments will be conducted every three cycles to evaluate
      the preliminary efficacy of irinotecan liposome injection as second-line regimen in patients
      with SCLC.
