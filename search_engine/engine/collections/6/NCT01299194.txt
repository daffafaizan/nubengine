    
      BACKGROUND AND RATIONAL FOR STUDY Bronchiectasis is a chronic debilitating respiratory
      condition. Patients suffer daily cough, excess sputum production and recurrent chest
      infections because of inflamed and permanently damaged airways. It is a common with a
      Scottish incidence of 1 in 1,000 to 1 in 10,000. Over 600 patients in Edinburgh are monitored
      in secondary care. They frequently utilise primary and secondary care resources through
      consultations, A&E attendances and inpatient admissions. The economic burden is huge-
      hospital admissions alone for bronchiectasis cost NHS Lothian just over 1 million pounds
      alone last year.

      LIMITATIONS OF TREATMENT There are few evidence based long term treatments currently
      available. Long term antibiotics are a feasible option, but with the increasing problems of
      antimicrobial resistance and side effects, in particular Clostridium difficile and
      methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), there is an international drive to reduce
      antibiotic usage. There is an urgent need for novel non antibiotic treatments.

      Statins as a potential new non antibiotic treatment in bronchiectasis Excessive neutrophilic
      airways inflammation is the central feature of bronchiectasis. This paradoxically both
      promotes bacterial colonisation and perpetuates damage to the airways creating a vicious
      cycle of bacterial colonisation and inflammation.1-3

      Statins have been shown to have powerful anti-inflammatory effects.4-6 In animal models,
      statins can reduce neutrophil recruitment to the inflamed lung and reduce protease activity.7
      Statin treatment has been shown to reduce epithelial cell adherence and invasion by
      Streptococcus pneumoniae in-vitro suggesting a role for statins in preventing bacterial
      colonisation.8 In healthy controls exposed to lipopolysaccharide to induce acute lung
      inflammation, pre-treatment with simvastatin reduced neutrophil accumulation in the lung and
      inhibited production of myeloperoxidase, tumour necrosis factor-alpha, matrix
      metalloproteinases and C-reactive protein.9 There was also an increase in neutrophil
      apoptosis, suggesting that statins may aid the resolution of inflammation in the airway.10

      STUDY HYPOTHESIS We hypothesise that long term statin treatment will improve patients'
      symptoms through its anti-inflammatory effect. The beneficial effects on patient symptoms
      (cough, sputum volume, bacterial load, airway function, exercise tolerance, exacerbation
      frequency and health related quality of life) will be consequent on reduced neutrophilic
      airways inflammation.

      Planned study

        -  This is a randomised double blind placebo controlled cross over trial to assess the
           efficacy of atorvastatin therapy in patients with clinically significant bronchiectasis.

        -  No such study has previously been undertaken (PUBMED Search "statins" and
           "bronchiectasis" 18 March 2010- no relevant articles).

        -  This is a unique proof of principle study assessing a new non antibiotic treatment that
           could benefit all patients with clinically significant bronchiectasis, without the side
           effect profile of long term antibiotics.

        -  Following this proof of principle study, we aim to design a large multi-centred study
           assessing long term statins as a new treatment.
