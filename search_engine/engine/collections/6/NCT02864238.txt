      workers, bedside nurses, physical therapists, and mid-level providers developed the structure
      and key elements of the milestone pathway. The Vanderbilt University Informatics Team
      developed the electronic version of the consensus milestones. The pathway encompasses 17
      phases beginning with the pre-procedure evaluation and continuing through the perioperative
      period until the three-month follow-up post procedure. The nursing staff performed
      documentation of pathway stages during the index hospitalization, and the milestone stage was
      displayed on the door of the patient's room. The milestone stage was discussed on
      multi-disciplinary bedside rounds in the ICU, and if a patient could not progress to the next
      stage the nurse would document the reason for failure to progress.

      In this study, the investigators compared patients who underwent valve surgery with the
      milestone pathway in place, to patients who underwent valve surgery without the milestone
      pathway in place. Patients were adjusted according to baseline characteristics such as
      demographics, procedure, and proceduralist collected from the electronic medical record and
      Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) database.

      The investigators primary clinical outcome is mortality, and secondary clinical outcomes
      include the incidence of re-intubation within 48 hours, acute kidney injury as defined by
      Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcome (KDIGO) criteria, delirium, major adverse cardiac
      events (MACE), and infection rates for catheter and central line associated infections as
      well as sternal wound infection. In addition the investigators examined financial outcomes
      including variance in direct and total cost, and direct and total cost per patient.
