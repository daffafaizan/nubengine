      AP 12009 and standard chemotherapy (temozolomide, BCNU, CCNU) in adult patients with
      recurrent or refractory anaplastic astrocytoma (AA, WHO grade III) or secondary glioblastoma
      (GBM, WHO grade IV). AP 12009 (trabedersen) is a phosphorothioate antisense
      oligodeoxynucleotide specific for the mRNA of human Transforming Growth Factor beta 2
      (TGF-beta-2), which is applied intratumorally. The growth factor TGF-beta plays a key role in
      malignant progression of various tumors by inducing proliferation, invasion, metastasis,
      angiogenesis, and escape from immunosurveillance. In patients with high-grade glioma, the
      TGF-beta-2 overexpression is associated with disease stage, clinical prognosis, and the
      immunodeficient state of the patients. Main objective of the study is to determine survival
      (rate) and tumor response.

      Important note: Due to early trial termination, resulting in limited data availability, all
      analyses remain descriptive by nature, only. No conclusive endpoint analysis can be
      performed.
