      Primary

        -  Evaluate the feasibility of adjuvant carboplatin and docetaxel in patients with resected
           stage I, II, or IIIA non-small cell lung cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the survival patterns of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Assess the patterns of recurrence in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive carboplatin IV on day 1 and docetaxel IV on day 1. Treatment
      repeats every 3 weeks for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.
