      months of evolution. All were classified as incomplete injury class C or D according to the
      American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA). Each received training on a BWST for six weeks.
      Two measures of stance balance were performed during the training protocol. The first measure
      was made before entering the training protocol; the final measure was implemented once the
      gait training on BWST protocol was completed. For instrumented stance balance testing, small
      wireless inertial motion sensors (OPAL sensors, APDM Inc., Portland, OR) were placed on the
      subjects' waist. Subjects performed instrumented stance with their eyes opened (iSway).
      Outcome measures were recorded and automatically generated using Mobility Lab software (APDM
      Inc., Portland, OR). Measures included the root mean square of sway and jerk (normalized to
      the range of acceleration amplitude).
