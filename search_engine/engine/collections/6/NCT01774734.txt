      physiotherapy could be more effective to treat people with chronic neck pain

        -  The NSE is a simple equipment that is easy to learn and safe to apply as home-based
           program

        -  The NSE will apply to the patients in the NSE group for 6 weeks, and we will compare the
           target variables to see if it brings better improvement by correction of maladaptive
           habitual posture and daily postural muscle exercise
