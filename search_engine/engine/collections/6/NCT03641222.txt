      community acupuncture, also known as group acupuncture, is an emerging method of treating
      patients. Although the practice can vary, community acupuncture is performed in a group
      setting, typically with reclining chairs dispersed around a large room, and one practitioner
      treating up to six people per session.

      The outcomes of this this randomized controlled trial will allow the researchers to assess
      whether group acupuncture is a viable treatment option for people with cancer who are
      suffering from pain, especially those who are either resistant to or looking to avoid the
      side effects of opioids.

      Objectives Examine the efficacy of community acupuncture for alleviating cancer pain,
      fatigue, sleep disturbances and distress when compared to individual acupuncture.

      Evaluate the cost-effectiveness of community acupuncture compared to individual acupuncture.
