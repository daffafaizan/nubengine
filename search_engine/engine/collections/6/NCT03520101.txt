    
      This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized open-label trial including patients with
      surgical aortic bioprosthetic dysfunction in the presence of a small (≤23mm; inner diameter
      ≤21 mm) stented surgical valve. Following the Heart Team'S decision to proceed with a
      TAVI-ViV procedure, patients will be randomized to either receive an Edwards (SAPIEN XT or
      SAPIEN 3) valve or a CoreValve Evolut R or Evolut PRO system. New iterations of these valve
      models may also be included.
