    
      YF476 is a novel, potent and selective gastrin antagonist that inhibits basal and
      meal-stimulated gastric acid secretion, enhances gastric emptying of a liquid meal and
      increases lower oesophageal sphincter pressure in animals. In a placebo- and
      ranitidine-controlled, crossover study in healthy volunteers, single doses of 5, 25 and 100mg
      of YF476 increased gastric pH; the effect was dose-dependent in magnitude and duration and
      compared favourably with that of ranitidine 150mg. In a placebo- and omeprazole-controlled,
      parallel-group study in healthy volunteers, 25 and 100mg of YF476 twice daily for 7 days, did
      not significantly affect gastric pH unlike omeprazole 20mg daily for 7 days. YF476 and
      omeprazole both increased plasma gastrin concentrations. Single and repeated doses of YF476
      were well tolerated.
