      reinforcement learning (RL) supported motivational intervention delivered after an emergency
      department (ED) visit to participants with recent non-medical OA use who receive an OA in the
      ED or who are prescribed an OA at ED discharge, compared to enhanced usual care (EUC). In the
      intervention condition, IVR calls will ask participants to report information about their
      health and medications using their touch-tone phone, and based on their responses they may
      receive brief or extended motivational messages during the IVR call, or they may be assigned
      to receive a 20 minute motivational enhancement session with a study therapist over the
      phone. Because the most helpful intensity of intervention is unknown and likely to vary
      between patients, the project will use an artificial intelligence strategy called
      reinforcement learning (RL). The RL system will continuously "learn" from the success of
      prior actions in similar situations with similar patients in order to select the action most
      likely to reduce non-medical opioid use for each participant during each call.

      The proposed study will screen ~ 5,600 ED patients to enroll 600 ED participants in the
      randomized controlled trial (RCT). Participants will be randomized to the intervention
      condition (n=300) or to EUC (n=300). All participants will be re-assessed at 1, 3 and 6
      months post-ED visit for level of non-medical OA use and related outcomes. The RCT will be
      complemented by qualitative interviews to inform later implementation.
