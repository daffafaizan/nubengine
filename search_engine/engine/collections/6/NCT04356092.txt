      newly-developed, non-commercially available, color-coded software for the quantification of
      foot perfusion following infrapopliteal angioplasty for the treatment of CLI. In total, 7
      consecutive patients scheduled to undergo infrapopliteal endovascular treatment of CLI were
      enrolled. Perfusion Blood Volume (PBV), Mean Transit Time (MTT), and Perfusion Blood Flow
      (PBF) maps were extracted by analyzing Time-Intensity Curves and signal intensity on the
      perfused vessel mask. Mean values calculated from user-specified ROIs on perfusion maps were
      employed to evaluate the patient's pre- and post- endovascular treatment condition.
