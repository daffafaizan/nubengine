      persons a natural way of controlling Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) neuroprostheses
      for restoring arm and dexterous hand movements. The prospect of using BCI technology for
      restoring arm and hand movements for reaching and grasping is based on the hypothesis that in
      a paralyzed human, there is a repeatable and understandable relationship between recordable
      brain activity and specific aspects of imagined arm movements. Many previous studies have
      attempted to understand the relationships between brain activity and arm and hand movements
      in able-bodied monkeys. Little is known about these same relationships in humans, and
      specifically within the context of trying to control an FES arm and complex hand system. This
      study will recruit persons who already have BCI and FES systems implanted to take advantage
      of the possibility of recording high resolution brain activity in human participants. Thus,
      from this study, we aim to gain a better understanding of how brain signals are related to
      specific aspects of arm and complex hand movements in humans with paralysis. Additionally,
      this study will test novel implementations of complex hand movement restoration in Veterans
      and other persons with chronic hand and arm paralysis.
