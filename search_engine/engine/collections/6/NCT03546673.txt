      health, and quality of life) of this expressive writing intervention for Chinese-speaking
      breast cancer survivors. The study also explores the mechanism through which expressive
      writing confers health benefits and investigates who will benefit most from the expressive
      writing intervention. Chinese-speaking breast cancer survivors who have completed primary
      treatment will be randomly assigned to a control writing condition, a self-regulation
      condition, or an emotional disclosure writing condition. Health outcomes are assessed at
      baseline, and 1, 3, and 6 months follow-ups. Mixed qualitative-quantitative mixed methods are
      used to explore the effect of the intervention on health outcomes and explore the mechanisms
      that explain the benefits of this intervention.
