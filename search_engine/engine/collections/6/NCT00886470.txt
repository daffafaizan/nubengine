      partial-thickness burns. Two similar partial-thickness burn areas in a single patient will be
      selected. One burn will be randomly assigned to receive either test drug ST266 or normal
      saline in one of three treatment regimens.

      The three treatment arms will be:

        1. ST266 0.01 mL/cm2 every 7th day vs. normal saline 0.01 mL/cm2 every 7th day;

        2. ST266 0.01 mL/cm2 every 4th day vs. normal saline 0.01 mL/cm2 every 4th day; and

        3. ST266 0.01 mL/cm2 every other day vs. normal saline 0.01 mL/cm2 every other day.

      Two different preclinical studies of partial-thickness burns on guinea pigs have demonstrated
      accelerated epithelialization with topical treatment with ST266. Similarly, preclinical
      studies in Yorkshire pigs have demonstrated more rapid maturity of epithelialization and
      better quality healing of partial-thickness skin graft donor sites with ST266 treatment.

      In the preclinical studies, ST266 given in a dose of 0.01 mL/cm2 wound area appeared to
      saturate the wound adequately without excess and simultaneously improve healing. In
      preclinical toxicity studies, the dose of 0.01 mL/cm2 was shown to be safe.
