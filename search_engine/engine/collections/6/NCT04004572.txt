      transplantation can improve the prognosis of patients who have achieved remission after
      chemotherapy. The median survival time for patients who were not suitable for transplantation
      was about 1 year. Asparaginase is the backbone drug for the treatment of NK/T-cell lymphoma.
      PD-1 antibody is effective for relapsed/refractory NK/T-cell lymphoma. Our previous study
      found that anlotinib is active in relapsed/refractory NK/T Cell lymphoma. This study is aimed
      to investigate the efficacy and safety of Sintilimab, a PD-1 antibody approved in China, in
      combination with Pegaspargase and anlotinib in the treatment of stage IV NK/T-cell lymphoma
      patients unfit for high-dose chemotherapy.
