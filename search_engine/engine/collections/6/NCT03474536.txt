      associated with CLAD and graft loss. The most used assay for serum DSA detection is the
      Single Antigen LuminexÂ® (SAG), which provides a semi-quantitative fluorescence value, the
      MFI, used as a surrogate of DSA "strength". But MFI is not perfectly associated with CLAD
      development. We developed a method using SPR allowing the concentration, kinetics (ka, kd)
      and affinity parameters (KD) of anti-DQ DSA to be determined. These quantitative parameters
      could represent biomarkers finely associated with CLAD. The way this parameters evolve
      (stability, increase or decrease) with time could also impact on DSA pathogenicity. We will
      compare the quantitative parameters of de novo anti-HLA DQ DSA, determined at the time of
      their discovery, between recipients that developed a CLAD for the 2 years following DSA
      apparition, and those who did not. The association between quantitative parameters of DSA and
      graft loss, their evolution and its association with CLAD and graft loss, and their
      correlation with SAG MFI will be also evaluated.
