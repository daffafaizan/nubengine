      because it starts early in life and has a chronic progressive course, the impact of this
      disease on health resources and patient's life quality can be important. Because the
      characteritic signs of SPA, like radiological evidence of sacro-iliitis, appear late in time,
      the lag time between the onset first signs of SPA for the patient and the confirmed diagnosis
      can be very long (up to 8 years). Previous studies proved that patients who are affected by
      SPA are showing abnormal vascularization of peripheral enthesis more frequently than patients
      affected by other rheumatic diseases. Ultrasonography in B mode combined with power Doppler
      (PDUS) is a non invasive and highly sensitive toll which can detect enthesitis and abnormal
      vsacularization even for the patients who are not showing yet the evidence of SPA's
      symptomatology. Using PDUS as a early diagnosis tool could lead to the improvement of
      diagnostic procedures and therapeutic management of SpA and reduce the cost of diagnosis for
      patient and health insurances.
