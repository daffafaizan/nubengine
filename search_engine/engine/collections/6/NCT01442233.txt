      respond well to this treatment. In more than 40 % of MS patients experiencing relapses,
      residual disability accumulates in spite of steroid treatment and did not recover. Plasma
      exchanges (PE) are frequently used to treat the severe attacks of inflammatory demyelination
      in the central nervous system resistant to steroids (Tumani, 2008). This strategy has been
      evaluated so far only in few studies. Only one randomized controlled study has been performed
      (Weinshenker et al, 1999) including patients with very severe attacks of inflammatory
      demyelinating diseases of various origin (MS, acute transverse myelitis, acute disseminated
      encephalomyelitis, neuromyelitis optica), not improved after a treatment by steroids. A
      moderate or important improvement of incapacity was observed in 8 cases out of 19 (42.1%)
      after treatment by PE against 1 out of 17 (5.9%) after sham treatment. This study concerned
      only 12 patients having a relapse of MS. Based on this first controlled study and the
      experience of treatment of 42 MS patients in the department of Neurology of the University
      Hospital Pellegrin (CHU de Bordeaux) we designed a randomized controlled study of PE against
      sham PE in moderate to severe acute exacerbations of MS not responding to steroid treatment.

      The purpose is to compare plasma exchanges versus sham exchanges on residual disability in MS
      patients with a demyelinating inflammatory episode (MS or syndrome with high risk of MS)
      experiencing a disabling relapse not improved after steroid treatment. The primary end-point
      will be evaluated one month after start of therapy. Secondary endpoints include safety and
      evaluation of improvement at 3 and 6 months and evaluation of safety
