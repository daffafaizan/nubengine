    
      This is an Internet-based, five-branch randomized controlled intervention, enrolling 3,000
      adult MSM. The five branches include 1) a control condition receiving no intervention
      content, 2) a standard text-based prevention webpage, 3) an 8 minute dramatic video
      addressing sexual risk reduction within the context of alcohol use, 4) a 5 minute documentary
      video addressing HIV disclosure, HIV testing, and condom use with the sub-context of drug
      use, and 5) both videos. After completing the baseline survey, eligible participants who
      consent to participate in the intervention will be randomly assigned to the control condition
      or one of the four intervention conditions. The control condition will not include the
      delivery of any intervention content. All participants (branches 1-5) will be asked to
      complete a brief post-intervention survey (to measure intentions). All intervention
      participants will be invited to complete a final 60-day follow-up survey.
