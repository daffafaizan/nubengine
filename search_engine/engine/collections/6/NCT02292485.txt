      event at the Texas Academy of Family Physicians event will be asked to fill out an anonymous
      survey to better understand their readiness to implement lung cancer screening programs in
      their practice settings. The surveys will be administered to physicians attending the TAFP
      education events in Houston, Texas, October 17-19, 2014 and in Dallas, Texas, November 7-9,
      2014.
