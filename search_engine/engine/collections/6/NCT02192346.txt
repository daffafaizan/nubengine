      will be tested.

      The main clinical objectives of this phase I two-stage dose-escalation trial will be to
      characterize α-TEA related toxicity, determine the maximum tolerated dose, and
      pharmacokinetics of α-TEA in humans. Tumor response and exploratory immunological monitoring
      will also be performed. Specifically, we will determine the frequency of circulating
      peripheral T cell subset populations including CD4+, CD8+ T cells and their activation status
      (central memory, effector cells) and regulatory T cells (CD4/CD25/Foxp3). Exploratory
      monitoring to assess tumor apoptosis and serum cytokine levels will also be performed to gain
      additional insight on the influence of α-TEA on the immune response and tumor. An assessment
      of the immunoscore in patients with tumor amenable to biopsy will also provide
      hypothesis-generating data on the influence of α-TEA on the tumor microenvironment.
