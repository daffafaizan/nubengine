      HIV. Increasing caloric intake fails to consistently restore lean tissue patients with HIV
      associated weight loss. Megestrol acetate has been shown to stimulate appetite and weight
      gain in subjects with cancer and in those with HIV associated weight loss. However, the
      weight gained during treatment with megestrol acetate was predominantly or exclusively fat.
      An important factor is the preferential increase in body fat seen in both of these studies
      may have been due to hypogonadism that occurs as a result of treatment with megestrol
      acetate, a progestational agent. Hypogonadism is associated with an increase in body fat and
      a decrease in LBM. Concomitant testosterone replacement should substantially increase the
      amount of LBM accrued during megestrol acetate therapy. This study will determine whether
      anabolic potential can be realized when caloric intake is increased in the absence of
      concomitant hypogonadism.

      This is a 24 week study consisting of a 12 week double blind, randomized comparison Phase II
      trial of megestrol acetate and testosterone enanthate in combination versus megestrol acetate
      plus testosterone enanthate placebo in HIV associated wasting and a 12 week open label follow
      up of the combination therapy.
