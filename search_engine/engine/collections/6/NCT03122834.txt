      and pharmacogenomics. Although drug response variation in Heart Failure is likely
      multifactorial, pharmacogenetic variation may partially account for therapeutic failure
      contributing to the remaining high mortality in HF. Identifying novel gene variants affecting
      treatment response may reveal unrecognized pathways and new potential therapeutic targets.
      Few studies to date have attempted to assess the extent to which variation in drug response
      was exclusively due to genetic factors and therefore expounding the likely clinical benefit
      of using pharmacogenetics to guide HF therapy. One of the prerequisites to bridging this gap
      is to consider likely trial designs and criteria that will lead to a consensus upon using
      pharmacogenetics-based variants to guide therapy in clinical practice.

      Another area gaining momentum is tailoring medication in response to biomarker levels as
      there is considerable evidence for the relationship between remodeling and fibrosis markers
      levels and worse prognosis in those with HF. Moreover,investigation into the proteomics of HF
      may also reveal variation that can be used to guide HF therapy hand-in-hand with biomarkers
      and pharmacogenomics, which would facilitate bridging the gap of genotype and phenotype.
      Disparity between genotype and phenotype may also account for the inconsistent results with
      current SNPs, further appreciation of this relationship would be a significant step forward.
