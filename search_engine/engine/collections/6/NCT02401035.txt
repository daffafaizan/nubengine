    
      In hospitalized pediatric subjects, age 1 to 16 years who in the judgment of the investigator
      are candidates for acid suppression therapy, the following are the objectives of this trial:

      Primary Objectives To characterize the PK of single and multiple IV doses of pantoprazole in
      pediatric subjects aged 1 to less than 2 years old.

      To characterize the PK of single and multiple IV doses of pantoprazole in pediatric subjects
      aged 2 to 16 years old.

      Secondary Objectives To determine the safety, tolerability, and PK of single and multiple IV
      doses of pantoprazole in each of the independent age cohorts.

      To assess the CYP2C19 genotype in pediatric subjects receiving IV pantoprazole, to determine
      the presence of the gene for the major enzyme responsible for metabolism of pantoprazole.
