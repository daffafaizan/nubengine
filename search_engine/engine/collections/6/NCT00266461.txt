    
      This is a randomized, controlled, open-label study designed to evaluate the tolerability and
      efficacy of TU-100 for the treatment of POI in patients undergoing laparotomy for large bowel
      resection. It will be conducted at multiple centers in the United States. A total of 24
      patients will be enrolled in the study. Patient participation in the study will last for up
      to 32 days (from Screening to postoperative day 10 [POD 10] or until the time when a
      discharge order is written for the patient, whichever comes first), with follow-up safety
      assessments to occur 7 and 14 days after the last dose of study medication.
