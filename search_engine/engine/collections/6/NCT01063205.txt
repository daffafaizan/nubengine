      reinstatement of cocaine seeking behavior in rats (Baker et al 2002) and with reduced
      cue-induced craving in cocaine-dependent human volunteers (LaRowe et al 2006). We propose
      these aims to evaluate the potential of NAC as a treatment for methamphetamine (MA)
      dependence: Specific Aim 1: To determine the effects of treatment with NAC(placebo, 1800 and
      3600mg daily), compared to treatment with placebo, on cue- and MA-induced craving and MA
      subjective effects in non-treatment-seeking MA-dependent human volunteers. We hypothesize
      that treatment with NAC will reduce craving for MA reported following exposure to MA cues and
      will reduce craving and MA subjective effects reported following non-contingent
      administration of MA (0mg,9mg, and 30 mg, IV). Specific Aim 2: To determine the effects of
      treatment with NAC (placebo, 1800 and 3600mg daily), compared to treatment with placebo, on
      the reinforcing effects of MA by measuring MA self-administration in non-treatment-seeking
      MA-dependent human volunteers. We hypothesize that treatment with NAC will reduce the number
      of choices made for MA during choice sessions.
