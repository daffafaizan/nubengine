      (that is to say flat), 15 ° and 30 ° (the order of actions will be determined by
      randomization). The patient will remain 10 minutes in each of these positions and will also
      have a little extra blood sample of 1 ml (ie 9 samples). These measures will be carried out
      again the next day and then after five days to see if the results vary depending on the
      evolution of his condition.
