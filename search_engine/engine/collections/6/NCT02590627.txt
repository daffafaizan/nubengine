      Health and Social Welfare and therefore testing of new ACTs such as
      dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHA-PQ) is important because alternative drugs are urgently
      required. Meanwhile, NMCP is revising the guidelines for treatment of malaria in Tanzania and
      DHA-PQ has been earmarked as an alternative ACT to be used together with ALu. However,
      efficacy and safety data of DHA-PQ is missing since no studies have been done in Tanzania.
      Thus, a study is proposed to assess the efficacy and safety of DHA-PQ Vs ALu and provide
      important data which will enable the NMCP to make informed decisions; and possibly recommend
      DHA-PQ in the new Malaria treatment guidelines as the second line drug for the treatment of
      uncomplicated malaria in the country.
