      each cycle of treatment or at 3, 6, 9, 12 months, 3 years and 5 years' follow-up after ending
      the whole antitumoral course of treatment. A fully dedicated research nurse will play a vital
      role in ensuring that the study run smoothly and that all participants will be safe and fully
      informed. Questionnaires completion and quality of life assessment will initially be
      performed followed by the 6MWT. Participants blood pressure measurement, electrocardiogram
      and echocardiogram will be then taken >30 minutes after finishing the walking test. Blood
      sample extraction will be performed after echocardiography to finalize with cardiac magnetic
      resonance. A complete medical history, physical examination and evaluation of these
      examinations for each participant will be performed by a cardiologist at the cardio-oncology
      unit, where prevention and treatment protocols for cardiotoxicity will be applied and
      discussed in a multidisciplinary way with referral oncologists and hematologists before every
      cycle of treatment and after course of antitumoral ending follow-up.
