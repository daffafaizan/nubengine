      group with respect to the risk of having a major adverse cardiac event (MACE). Elevation of
      blood glucose is a common metabolic disorder among patients with acute myocardial infarction
      (AMI) and is associated with adverse prognosis. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is an
      incretin hormone that regulates plasma glucose. GLP-1 analogues have significant
      cardiovascular protective effects in patients with AMI. GLP-1 may have antioxidant and
      anti-inflammatory properties, and protect endothelial function. Studies in conscious,
      chronically instrumented dogs demonstrated that GLP-1 infusion increases insulin sensitivity
      and myocardial glucose uptake in postischemic contractile dysfunction and dilated
      cardiomyopathy. Liraglutide, a GLP-1 analogue, was reported to reduce cardiac rupture and
      infarct size and improve cardiac output in normal and diabetic mice. Continuous infusion of
      GLP-1 (1.5 pmol/kg/min) has been shown to improve functional recovery in patients with AMI
      complicated by decreased left ventricular function GLP-1 could protect against
      ischemia-reperfusion injury and improve cardiac function in patients with acute ST-segment
      elevation myocardial infarction. However, the effects of GLP-1 on NSTEMI patients remain
      unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of liraglutide on left ventricular
      function in patients with NSTEMI.
