      occlusion in the need of treatment.

      At baseline patients underwent an extensive ophthalmological examination (best-corrected
      visual acuity, OCT, OCT-angiography, fluorescein angiography, fundus photography). Besides
      that, systemic work-up (including 24h blood pressure measurement, electrocardiogram, and
      serological blood testing) is conducted.

      Patients underwent routine ME treatment including at least 4 monthly anti-VEGF injections, as
      first-line therapy. Further injections will be conducted if needed. Re-treatment criteria
      are: persistent intra- and/or subretinal fluid seen on SD-OCT, central subfield thickness >
      300 Âµm. Ophthalmological examination will be repeated at month 3, 6 and month 12. Systemic
      work-up will be repeated at month 6.

      Primary outcome is the correlation of systemic parameters with functional and anatomical
      response at month 6. Secondary outcome is the correlation of systemic parameters with
      functional and anatomical response at month 12.
