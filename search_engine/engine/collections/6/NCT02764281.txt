      non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) with relatively high incidence in China. L-asparaginase based
      chemotherapy improved overall response and prolonged the long-term survival for patients with
      stage IV. But the optimal treatment schedule has not been established. This study is designed
      with four cycles MEDA chemotherapy, followed by Auto-HSCT for stage IV patients with newly
      onset, relapsed or refractory diseases. The efficacy and safety of this protocol in the
      treatment of will be measured.
