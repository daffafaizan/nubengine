      cardiac surgery, mainly because of accelerated atherosclerosis and target-organ injury that
      predispose these patients to increased incidence of postoperative morbidity (such as but not
      limited to, postoperative adverse cardiac events, renal injury or stroke) and mortality.

      Over the past several years haptoglobin has been identified as a risk factor that predicts
      the development of cardiovascular complications in diabetics. There are 3 major haplotypes of
      haptoglobin: 1-1; 1-2 and 2-2. Several studies have demonstrated that diabetic individuals
      with the 2-2 genotype have up to 5 fold increased risk to develop cardiovascular
      complications as compared to diabetic patients with a non-2-2 haptoglobin genotype. There is
      no data in the literature that evaluated whether the haptoglobin 2-2 genotype is a risk
      factor for increased postoperative morbidity and/or mortality after cardiac surgery in
      patients with DM.

      Therefore, the aims of the study are to evaluate whether diabetic patients with the 2-2
      genotype are at increased risk for postoperative morbidity and/or mortality after cardiac
      surgery.

      Preliminary studies in diabetic patients demonstrated that those with haptoglobin 2-2
      genotype are at increased risk for cardiovascular complications of diabetes. Moreover, these
      patients were found to have increased in-hospital mortality after acute MI compared to
      diabetic individuals that do not have the 2-2 genotype, and they also suffer from increased
      incidence of post catheterization stent thrombosis compared to diabetics that do not have the
      2-2 genotype
