      functioning of patients. Major depression increases the probability of a later dementia
      diagnosis. By targeting cognitive processes in treatment, the investigators hope to both find
      a more effective means to manage major depression in older adults, but also demonstrate how
      top-down processes (e.g., Executive Control Network) may be driving depression and cognitive
      decline in older adults.

      The investigators are recruiting older adults with and without mild cognitive impairment. All
      subjects must have at least mild depressive symptoms to be eligible to participate. Subjects
      will be randomly assigned to one of two different interventions.

      Results of this study will help the investigators understand the mechanisms that contribute
      to depressed mood and cognitive change in older adults with late life depression.
