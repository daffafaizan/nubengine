      factor, and those with positive plasma EBV-DNA at the end of treatments are more likely to
      suffer from disease relapse. The investigators previously reported one-year progression free
      survival rate of 22.2% for patients with positive plasma EBV-DNA at the end of treatments.
      Recently, anti-PD-1 antibody has been shown to be highly effective in the treatment of
      NK/T-cell lymphoma. Thus, this study aims to evaluate the role of maintenance with anti-PD-1
      antibody for patients with positive plasma EBV-DNA at the end of treatments.
