      also a quiet and wide operative field. That's why anaesthesia plays a critical role in
      thoracoscopic surgery.

      General double-lumen endotracheal intubated anesthesia with one-lung ventilation, has been
      accepted mandatory for Video-Assisted Thoracic Surgery (VATS) although several adverse
      effects can derive from this type of anesthesia like intubation-related throat injury,
      ventilator-induced lung injury, arrhythmia and so on. The investigators hypothesize that VATS
      could be performed under the no-intubated thoracic epidural anesthesia (NTEA) to avoid
      general anesthesia related risks.

      Some cases have been reported to prove the safety and feasibility of NTEA in uncomplicated
      VATS. However, the comparison of NTEA and general anesthesia has been rarely investigated in
      such a larger magnitude number and such operation varieties. The investigators hypothesize
      NTEA could result in less inflammations, lower incidence of complications, less dosage of
      antibiotic, faster recovery eventually leading to a shorter hospital stay. For this reason,
      the investigators will undertaken a randomized trial comparing results of general VATS
      operations under NTEA versus those of a control group operated under general anesthesia with
      double-lumen endotracheal intubation.

      A total of 500 patients will be included. The study will be performed in the first affiliated
      hospital of Guangzhou Medical College.
