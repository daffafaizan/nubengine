    
      Open label, randomised, multicenter, superiority study for efficacy. Patients with
      histologically proven adenocarcinoma of the stomach or gastroesophageal junction without
      gross or microscopic evidence of residual disease after surgery with curative intent and
      fulfilling all the inclusion/exclusion criteria are eligible for this study.

      Allocation to treatment will be done centrally using a randomisation scheme and will be
      stratified by center and nodal involvement (N- vs. N+). Access to random system will be
      allowed by phone or via web.

      All included patients in both groups will received fixed period of 18 weeks of treatment
      unless unacceptable toxicity or disease relapse during treatment. After cessation of therapy,
      patients will have a follow-up period while not receiving further treatment. After relapse
      further chemotherapy is left to the investigator's judgement. When the last patient is
      randomised, follow-up will be truncated at the achievement of the required number of events.

      Time to progression and time to death are the main study outcomes. During the course of the
      trial, an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will advise the Steering
      Committee on efficacy and/or safety aspects of the study.
