      for brain ischemia, therefore is paramount to identify preoperatively possible markers of
      plaque instability. The study is aimed to investigate the possible role of lectin pathway -
      an alternative pathway of complement activation - in affecting stability of carotid
      atherosclerotic plaques and the possible correlations with clinical neurologic features.
      Study population will include 40 patients with internal carotid artery stenosis >=70%
      (assessed by echocolordoppler), symptomatic or asymptomatic, surgically treated by
      endoarterectomy. Removed plaques will be evaluated by histologic exam and immunofluorescence
      for ficolins 1-2-3 and Mannose Binding Lectin (MBL). Plasma samples will be used for ELISA
      test of lectin pathway complement activation.
