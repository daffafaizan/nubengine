    
      COPD is associated with high perioperative morbidity and mortality and PPC frequently occur
      in these patients. However, concepts for preoperative pulmonary risk assessment and the
      predictive value of routine preoperative exercise capacity, clinical assessment and pulmonary
      function tests are still poorly characterized.

      Objectives:

        -  To determine the incidence of the composite end point of PPC or all cause in-hospital
           mortality in patients with confirmed COPD (spirometry) and patients with clinical risk
           factors in whom spirometry disproved COPD.

        -  To determine the predictive value of exercise capacity, clinical assessment tests,
           pulmonary function tests and predictive scoring systems to predict the composite end
           point in these patients.

        -  To identify relevant risk factors and predictors associated with the composite end
           point.

      Methodology:

      Prospective single-centre observational study

      All patients receive a structured preoperative pulmonary risk assessment with:

        1. standardized clinical questionnaire

        2. COPD Assessment Test (CATâ„¢)

        3. exercise capacity (symptom-limited stair climbing)

        4. spirometry

        5. capillary blood gas Analysis

      Postoperative follow-up is planned between the 2nd and 5th day after extubation.
