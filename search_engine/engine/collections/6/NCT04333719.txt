      communication in a crucial moment of life for the patients is particularly challenging. This
      practice implies particular experiences for families and caregivers, often increased by the
      deepness of the sedation. In France, the Claeys-Leonetti law has added additional indications
      of deep sedation. The lack of data on the prevalence of this practice in palliative care
      complicates the implementation of research projects and the improvement of professionals
      skills. In existing literature, the proportions of patients thus sedated varied from 2.5 to
      14.5%. To our knowledge, no study on the prevalence of deep sedative practices in terminal
      diseases has been carried out in France. This observational study will help to better
      understand the real importance of this practice among each palliative care structures. They
      will also serve to build research projects on this theme supporting improvement of care for
      this population.

      In this study, the deep sedation is defined as a sedation directly inducing from the
      induction time a score of -4 or -5 at the Richmond vigilance scale (or a clinically
      equivalent state for the investigator) as defined by the French society of palliative care
      and accompanying.

      The day of inclusion, the investigator will collect the information about the structure of
      palliative care (type, team composition, number of patients with an on-going terminal
      disease), the characteristics of the sedated patient(s) (age, disease, treatments) and of the
      sedation (sedative molecules, assessment of vigilance, consents and decision-making process).
      In case of an on-going sedation previously initiated but still in progress the day of
      inclusion, the investigator will retrospectively collect the required data.
