      areas of gait and freezing. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) which passes weak
      direct current (DC) current through the skull and across the cortex has been done for many
      years with numerous effects described in healthy subjects and patients with mental illness.
      Recently, it has been shown by objective means, in controlled experiments, that this type of
      treatment has robust and lasting effects on the excitability of the motor cortex in healthy
      humans. We hypothesize that tDCS will have a beneficial effect on gait and freezing in
      medicated patients, and we propose to test this in a controlled trial. Specifically, we
      propose to look at the effect of 1-2 mA tDCS with anode position over the frontal poles
      and/or premotor and primary motor cortex, and cathode over mastoid process. Over a one-year
      period, we will enroll 42 adults with PD and evaluate the acute tDCS effects over a period of
      four weeks (eight tDCS sessions, nine visits). Additional ratings will be done at one and
      three months after the end of tDCS sessions. Symptoms will be evaluated with standard tests
      of motor function, including the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) and
      specific tests of gait and freezing. We will also look for cumulative, long-lasting effects
      over the three-month period.
