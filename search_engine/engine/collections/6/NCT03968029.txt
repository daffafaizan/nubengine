      meniscectomy was the first-line treatment. Many studies have shown a negative progress
      towards osteoarthritis after meniscus ablation. This approach has gradually changed to
      preserve this meniscal capital, making way for new treatments as sutures. However the
      vascular organization of the meniscus is crucial for its cure. The healing potential of
      lesions in the meniscus non-vascularised aera is considered insufficient, and are often
      treated by a partial meniscectomy, resulting in a high risk of osteoarthritis. It appears
      therefore necessary to develop new strategies, as meniscal wrapping, to preserve meniscus
      presenting this type of damage.
