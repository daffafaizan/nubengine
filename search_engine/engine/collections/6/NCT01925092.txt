      children with Cushing's disease. Since a child's body may absorb and use mifepristone in a
      different way than adults, it is important to have information about the amount of
      mifepristone to give children and what will happen to it. Mifepristone has been FDA approved
      for use only in adults with Cushing's syndrome, and it is important to learn if mifepristone
      improves the symptoms and signs of Cushing's disease in children. The study is limited to
      children with Cushing's syndrome due to a pituitary tumor (Cushing's disease) and will not
      enroll children with Cushing's syndrome due to other causes. The study will investigate how
      children's bodies absorb and process mifepristone, how it works in children and what effect
      it has on the use of sugar in the body, on the child's weight and on growth hormone. An
      important part of the study is to evaluate the side effects of mifepristone in children.
