      placebo given ultrasound-guided into the submandibular glands in subjects participating in
      the MESRIX trial. Study participants from the MESRIX trial will be invited for a clinical
      visit. The visit will include medical history, an ENT examination; measurements of the saliva
      production by sialometry, a Magnetic resonance imaging scan (MRI) and obtaining data on the
      patient-reported outcome with Xerostomia Questionnaire (XQ) and Visual-Analogue-Symptomatic
      scale (VAS). Subjects, who are not able or willing to attend a clinical visit, will be
      encouraged to fill out the Questionnaires online or on paper. If a study participant has
      deceased, information of the cause of death will be investigated in The Danish Register of
      Causes of Death
