        -  Determine whether there is a relationship between the pharmacokinetic characteristics of
           irinotecan and aging in patients with non-hematologic malignancies.

        -  Determine whether there is a relationship between the toxic effects of this drug and
           aging in these patients.

        -  Determine whether the relationship between genotype (UGT1A1, CYP3A, and other relevant
           genes) and phenotype (pharmacokinetics, toxicity) is affected by aging in these patients
           treated with this drug.

        -  Analyze data collected on the co-morbid conditions and concurrent medications in these
           patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to age (18 to 55 vs
      70 and over).

      Patients receive irinotecan IV over 90 minutes once weekly for 4 weeks. Treatment continues
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 140 patients (70 per stratum) will be accrued for this study
      within 3.5 years.
