843. reactions of seleno- and sulfoamino acids with hydroperoxidesreactions of methionine, cystine and their selenium analogues withhydrogen peroxide and organic peroxides have been studied.  methionine reactsmost rapidly with hydrogen peroxide but selenocystine causes the mostdecomposition; both react much more slowly with organic peroxides.  the resultssuggest that selenocystine may act as a biological antioxidant.
