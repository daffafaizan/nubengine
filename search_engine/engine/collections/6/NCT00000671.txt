      first episode of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) and in patients with advanced ARC.
      However, AZT therapy has been associated with significant toxicities. In addition, the
      effectiveness of AZT appears to decrease during the second and third years of therapy. For
      these reasons, the development of alternative therapy that would be at least as effective but
      less toxic is of great importance. The drug ddI is an antiviral agent that inhibits
      replication of HIV with less apparent toxicity than AZT. Studies indicate that ddI remains
      active in the body for at least 12 hours; thus benefits of ddI might be achieved with a low
      frequency of drug administration.

      Two dose levels of ddI, each adjusted depending on patient's weight at study entry, are
      compared with a variable dosage regimen of AZT (the dose which the patient is tolerating at
      the time of study entry). Randomization is stratified by baseline CD4 cell count (less than
      100 or 100-300) and Medical Center. This study continues for at least 12 months after the
      entry of the first subject. Patients randomized to AZT will receive orally. All patients
      randomized to AZT also receive a ddI placebo at 12 hour intervals. Patients randomized to ddI
      receive AZT placebo.
