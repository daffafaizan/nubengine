    
      Gym members register online to participate in a 28-day workout program. Upon registration,
      participants are assigned to one of two conditions (a condition that incentivizes planning or
      a condition that incentivizes workouts). Upon registration, participants are prompted to
      create a workout schedule and are given tips about how to create a workout habit. Over the
      28-day intervention period, participants receive text message reminders prior to their
      scheduled workouts and emails reminding them of their schedules. In both conditions,
      participants receive points every day that they go to the gym, which can be redeemed for a
      gift card after the intervention period. In the planning condition, participants can receive
      bonus points for responding to each of three text messages each week asking about their plans
      for going to the gym. In the output condition, participants receive bonus points for their
      first three workouts each week.
