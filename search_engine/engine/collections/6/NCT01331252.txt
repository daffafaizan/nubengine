      mortality in patients with severe tetanus who require a tracheostomy whether or not they are
      mechanically ventilated. We propose to investigate if the incidence of hospital-acquired
      pneumonia can be reduced by nursing tetanus patients semi-recumbent at 30o rather than supine
      as is the current practice.

      The aim of this study will be to assess the frequency of clinically suspected and
      microbiologically confirmed hospital acquired pneumonia in patients nursed in a
      semi-recumbent or supine body position. A secondary end-point will be the mortality in each
      group. Patients at risk of developing hospital acquired pneumonia (in hospital without
      developing pneumonia for more than two days) will be evaluated
