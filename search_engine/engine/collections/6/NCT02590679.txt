      to two balloon expandable systems, namely the Melody Valve (Medtronic Inc, Minneapolis, MN)
      and the Sapien valve (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA). Both valves have undergone clinical
      trials with good medium-term valve durability. Although both the Melody and the Sapien valves
      have been used in native outflow tracts with good success , limitations to the extended
      application of these valves have generally centered on the maximum diameter of the RVOT.
      Indeed in the majority of patients requiring pulmonary valve replacement (PVR), these balloon
      expandable systems are not large enough to maintain stable valve position within the dilated
      native RVOT.Therefore more recent efforts have concentrated on a self-expanding system to
      provide valve competence despite significant dilation of the native RVOT.

      Venus-P Valve (Venus Medtech, Shanghai, China) is the first self-expandable interventional
      Pulmonary Valve, which is composed of a Nitinol multilevel support frame with a tri-leaflet
      porcine pericardial tissue valve, and a 14-22 Fr delivery catheter. The purpose of the trial
      is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the Venus-P Valve for PPVI in patients pulmonary
      regurgitation and native RVOT after surgical repair of RVOT.
