      surgery is the cellular damage derived from the interruption of blood flood with reperfusion
      of the organ. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) has proved beneficial in several conditions involving
      oxidative damage. This study investigates the effects of NAC to reduce ischemia/reperfusion
      injury in liver resection performed under ischemic preconditioning and intermittent portal
      triad clamping.

      Methods: 46 ASA II-III patients scheduled to undergo liver resection where randomised to
      receive NAC (initial dose: 150 mg/Kg; and infusion of 50 mg/kg, from 30 minutes before the
      ischemia up to 60 minutes later to the reperfusion) or placebo in a phase IV clinical trial.
      Blood, hepatic and urinary markers were obtained at basal status and 1, 3 and 24 h post final
      reperfusion.
