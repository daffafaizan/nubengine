      intervention, Sister to Sister, on the smoking cessation in two Southeastern US metropolitan
      areas. Fourteen subsidized housing neighborhoods, eight in Charleston, SC and six in Augusta,
      GA, were pair matched based on size; with one neighborhood in each pair randomized to the
      intervention to ensure balanced recruitment between groups. Neighborhoods ranged in size from
      22 to 33 participants with a total sample size of 409 women; neighborhoods were chosen as the
      primary sampling unit to prevent contamination of the outcome within neighborhoods, with
      women in the neighborhoods as secondary sampling unit. All statistical analyses were
      conducted using SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) with statistical significance at an alpha
      level of 0.05. Comparison between groups at baseline used t-tests for continuous variables
      and chi-square tests for categorical variables. The primary outcome of interest was smoking
      status which was dichotomized (smoker/non-smoker) at the 6 and 12 month measurements. Smoking
      status was determined by cotinine levels in saliva with non-smokers defined as those with
      cotinine levels of 14 ng/mL or less.
