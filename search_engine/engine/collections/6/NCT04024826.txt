      follicular phase(EFP) and late follicular phase (LFP) when compared to early luteal phase
      (ELP) and late luteal phase (LLP). Given the lack of research in exercise and menstrual cycle
      - especially in resistance training - results are uncertain unless the investigators base
      their hypotheses only on the general physiological effects of sex hormones (without
      exercise). In this case, the investigators expect to see a reduced carbohydrate utilization
      and an increased utilization of fats in EFP and LFP. In addition, the intervention is focused
      on muscular endurance and, therefore, it is expected to see a higher reliance on aerobic
      pathways. It is expected that the effects of the intervention will be added to the effects of
      estrogens, with increasing fat oxidation when estrogen levels are higher. Lastly, a
      comparison of fat oxidation levels obtained on each sub-phase would reveal if there are
      differences in the magnitude of the effect of distinct concentrations of estrogen and
      progesterone.
