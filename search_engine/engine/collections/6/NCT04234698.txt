      diagnosed with NVAF in selected Health Maintenance Organizations (HMO) of Colombia. These
      patients will be identified from the drug claim database, whose index date of the study will
      be the first prescription with any of the oral anticoagulants, that is, they are patients
      with NVAF for the first time starting a therapy with any of the NOACs between January 1, 2013
      and June 30, 2018 and follow up period will be among January 2013 to July 2019, to ensure
      that the last patients can provide follow-up for one year. Patients will be required to have
      an NVAF diagnosis before or on the index date and health plan for 6 months pre-index date
      (baseline period). Colombia. The information will be used in the study comes exclusively form
