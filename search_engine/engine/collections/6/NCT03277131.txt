      bacteria are present in infected wounds over an 8 week period.

      DURAFIBER Ag is a commercially available absorbent, non-woven, silver-containing
      antimicrobial dressing for use on a variety of exuding wounds and is widely used in routine
      clinical practice within the UK.

      The primary outcome will be the quantitative reduction in bacterial load, based on a wound
      biopsy, from baseline to week 8. Secondary objectives will include the quantitative reduction
      in bacterial load, based on biopsy, from initial assessment to week 4, and the
      semi-quantitative reduction in bacterial load, based on swab analysis, from baseline to weeks
      4 and 8. Additionally dressing performance measures will be assessed as well as all adverse
      events and device deficiencies.

      In total 20 evaluable participants with an infected venous leg ulcer will be recruited into
      the trial. All participants will have their wound dressed using DURAFIBER Ag and will be
      followed-up for 8 weeks.
