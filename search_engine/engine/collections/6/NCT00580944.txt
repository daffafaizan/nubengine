      port wine stain blanching. The alexandrite and pulsed dye lasers are both approved by the
      Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of Port wine stain. However, the degree of
      port wine stain blanching seen following either alexandrite or pulsed dye lasers treatment
      remains variable and unpredictable. Treatment of port wine stains can use either alexandrite
      or pulsed dye alone and with the combined delivery of alexandrite and pulsed dye lasers
      pulses.
