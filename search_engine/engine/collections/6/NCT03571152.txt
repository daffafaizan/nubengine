      10% to 20%, with standard deviations of 5% to 10%.

      Statistical analysis plan The data collected will be entered into a database in Microsoft
      Excel, to be analyzed by the Epi Info statistical program. The qualitative variables will be
      analyzed by frequencies and percentages, the quantitative variables by arithmetic mean and
      standard deviation, some of them categorized for its interpretation. The bivariate analysis
      between two qualitative variables will be carried out using Fisher's exact test, the analysis
      between a qualitative variable and a quantitative one will be carried out through the
      Mann-Whitney U tests (non-normal distribution) and Student's t test (normal distribution).
      After the intervention, the level of practice and knowledge of the caregivers on the basic
      management of patients in the subacute phase of the stroke will generate a variable called
      "change of score", whose p-value should be less than 0.05.

      Plan for missing data Due to the characteristics of the intervention, the investigators do
      not expect much loss to follow up patients after recruitment. However, all missing data will
      be reported as such.
