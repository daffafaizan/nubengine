    
      The aim of this clinical study in adult ALL is to improve , by risk category, the overall
      disease-free survival in relation to the achievement of an early MRD negative status and
      following induction/consolidation with Peg-ASP, lineage-targeted methotrexate infusions and
      other disease-specific therapeutic elements, with or without the application of allogeneic or
      autologous SCT depending on risk class and MRD study results. A survey of severe infections
      occurring along the entire chemotherapy and stem cell transplant program and until 2 years
      from the achievement of CR will be performed with the aim to increase the knowledge of these
      complications and to evaluate their impact on the antileukemic program and on the long term
      outcome of the underlying malignancy. The prospective survey of severe infections will be
      performed as an ancillary observational objective of the present study.
