      family history of colorectal cancer is recognized as a risk factor for colorectal adenoma.
      However, the strength of this association is uncertain. Current guidelines for initiating
      screening colonoscopies in patients younger than 50 years of age who have a first relative
      history of colorectal cancer have proved controversial. The conflicting recommendations are
      partly attributable to the lack of data about the prevalence of CRC and adenomas among 30- to
      49-year-old individuals with a first relative history of colorectal cancer. This prospective
      study will quantify the prevalence of adenomas (any size) and advanced adenomas among 30- to
      49-year-old individuals undergoing their first screening colonoscopy because of a first
      relative history of colorectal cancer and compare the data with controls(asymptomatic
      subjects without a first relative history of colorectal cancer).
