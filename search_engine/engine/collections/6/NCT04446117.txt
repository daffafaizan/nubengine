      combination with atezolizumab versus a second NHT (abiraterone or enzalutamide) in subjects
      with mCRPC who have previously been treated with one, and only one, NHT (e.g. abiraterone,
      apalutamide, darolutamide, or enzalutamide) to treat metastatic castration-sensitive prostate
      cancer (mCSPC), non-metastatic CRPC (M0 CRPC), or mCRPC, and who have measurable extrapelvic
      disease. The multiple primary efficacy endpoints comparing the experimental arm and control
      arm are Duration of Progression Free Survival (PFS) per RECIST 1.1 by Blinded Independent
      Radiology Committee (BIRC) and Duration of Overall Survival (OS). The secondary efficacy
      endpoint is Objective Response Rate (ORR) per RECIST 1.1 per BIRC.
