      treatment groups: 1) the HVPG group and 2) the non-HVPG group. Treatment allocation is by
      block randomization with an equal number for both groups. The results are concealed in opaque
      envelopes.After randomization, patients will have a second chance to decide if they want to
      stay in the current group.Patients can switch to another group according to their will. If
      they are in the HVPG groupï¼Œthey will receive HVPG measurement before treatment. If they are
      in the non-HVPG group, they start treatment without HVPG measurement and receive endoscopic
      treatment plus Carvedilol.The mortality rate and rebleeding rate will be analyzed.
