      acute inflammatory response activation. The primary outcome of the study will be the response
      to treatment. A patient is considered responder in the absence of either moderate to severe
      oxygenation impairment or death, whichever occurs first, within 8 days from enrolment. The
      main secondary outcomes will include the responder rate and mortality at 15 days, the
      quantification of patients experiencing moderate to severe oxygenation impairment, rate of
      patients admitted to the intensive care unit, length of hospitalization, mortality at 28
      days, rate of re-admission, and adverse events. The duration of the study will be 28 days. In
      the proof of concept phase, 13 patients will be enrolled; if the responders will be at least
      4 patients without safety issues, Baricitinib will be considered for further studies.
