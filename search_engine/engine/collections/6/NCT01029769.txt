      either oral amisulpride 800 mg/day or olanzapine 20mg/day.

      Those participants who have not responded to treatment at two weeks (PANSS improvement <25%)
      will be randomised to a 6 week double blind flexible dose phase:

        1. Experimental intervention: switch to the other antipsychotic (oral olanzapine 5-20mg/d
           or oral amisulpride 200-800 mg/d)

        2. Control intervention: continuation with the same drug as in the first 2 weeks in
           flexible dose ranges as above for another six weeks Those participants who have
           responded at week 2 (â‰¥25% PANSS reduction) will continue on the same drug in flexible
           dose ranges as above Total duration of intervention per patient: 8 weeks
