      comparative studies. Their results are inconstant and the closure rate is estimated between
      15 and 100%, with a hazardous median healing time. This method is associated with frequent
      complications, such as spontaneous migrations, impactions or ulcerations responsible for
      potentially fatal hematemesis. The preliminary results of using OTSC clips (OVESCOÂ®) seem
      encouraging, but this technique requires external drainage to obtain a collection free from
      infection. A new approach is to perform an internal drainage of the peri-orificial collection
      by using double pigtail stents through the fistulous orifice and to direct the fistula
      closure from the outside to the inside. This endoscopic treatment, combined with nutritional
      support and initial antibiotic therapy, allows rapid weaning of external drainage and short
      healing times. CT and endoscopic evaluation are needed at the sixth week for stents removal
      in the event of a favorable evolution. In the opposite case, a second endoscopic treatment is
      performed. In case of unfavorable evolution, a radical surgical treatment, in the absence of
      endoscopic alternative, will be achieved.
