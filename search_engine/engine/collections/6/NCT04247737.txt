      been shown that a gluten free diet (GFD) often alleviates the clinical symptoms, an overlap
      between patients with IBS and non-celiac glutensensitivity is assumed. The study includes 25
      healthy individuals and 150 patients with IBS taking a six week GFD. Participants fill in
      questionnaires to determine clinical symptoms and psychological well being at the beginning
      and end of the dietary intervention. Patients with symptom relief under diet are further
      provoked in a double-blind placebo-controlled study with gluten or placebo containing bars
      for three weeks, separated by two weeks of washout to diagnosis of NCGS.

      In addition, peripheral mononuclear cells are isolated at the beginning and end of the diet
      and the stimulating potential of wheat gluten is analyzed.
