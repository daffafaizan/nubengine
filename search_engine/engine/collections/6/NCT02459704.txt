      Positioned Flap (SCPF) for the treatment of gingival recessions, with or without Enamel
      Matrix Derivative (EMD). Thirty patients will be selected, randomized and allocated in two
      groups: test group (SCPF + EMD) and control group (SCPF). The subjects will should present
      buccal Miller class I gingival recessions with height greater than or equal to 2.0 mm and
      less than to 4.0 mm in maxillary canines or premolars. Clinical parameters will be evaluated:
      gingival recession height (GRH), gingival recession width(GRW), clinical attachment level
      (CAL), probing depth (PD), height (HKT) and thickness (TKT) of keratinized tissue and
      papillas height (HP) and width(LP), as well as plaque and gingival index. These data will be
      collected at baseline and 180 days after surgery.
