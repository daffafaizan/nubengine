      is a potent and selective inhibitor of HBV DNA polymerase.

      Glycyrrhizin has been used for more than 30 years in the treatment of liver diseases in Asian
      countries, who can relieve necro-inflammatory and liver fibrosis or cirrhosis Recent study
      has shown that inflammation plays the important role in chronic HBV and fibrosis or cirrhosis
      disease progression, but antiviral therapy only may not reduce inflammation ideally. The
      addition of glycyrrhizin to entecavir in the treatment may slow disease progression in
      patients with chronic HBV and advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis.
