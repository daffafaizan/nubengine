      BACKGROUND: Statins are commonly prescribed in combination with therapeutic lifestyle
      changes, including exercise, to reduce cardiovascular disease risk in patients with the
      metabolic syndrome. Statin use has been linked to skeletal muscle myopathy and impaired
      mitochondrial function, but it is unclear whether statin use alters adaptations to exercise
      training.

      METHODS: We examined the effects of simvastatin on changes in cardiorespiratory fitness and
      skeletal muscle mitochondrial content in response to aerobic exercise training. Sedentary
      overweight or obese adults with at least 2 metabolic syndrome risk factors (defined according
      to National Cholesterol Education Panel Adult Treatment Panel III criteria) were randomized
      to 12 weeks of aerobic exercise training or to exercise in combination with simvastatin (40
      mg per day). The primary outcomes were cardiorespiratory fitness and skeletal muscle (vastus
      lateralis) mitochondrial content (citrate synthase enzyme activity).
