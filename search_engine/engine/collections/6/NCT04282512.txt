      will begin their first 15-day period with the consumption of St-Yorre mineral water.

      Group B will begin the first 15-day period by drinking tap water. After a washout period of
      15 days, each group alternates with a new period of 15 days of water consumption monitoring:
      tap water for group A and mineral water St-Yorre for group B.

      For each period salt intake and blood pressure are measured.Three-day food records are also
      performed for both 15-days periods.
