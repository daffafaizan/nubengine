      lithotripsy and excimer laser to modify calcified plaques.

      However there is no direct randomized comparison between these three tools in this scenario.

      The aim of this pilot randomized trial is to compare the safety and efficacy of these three
      techniques during PCI of moderate to severe calcified lesions.

      The primary endpoint will be the percentage of stent expansion measured with optical
      coherence tomography. Between secondary endpoints we will analyze the strategy success
      (defined as successful stent delivery and expansion with <20% residual stenosis and TIMI 3
      flow without crossover or stent failure) and presentation of clinical adverse at 1 year
      follow-up .
