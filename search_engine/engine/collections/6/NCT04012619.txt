      vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), fibroblast growth factor receptor
      (FGFR), platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) and c-Kit,8,9 has been approved as a
      third-line treatment for refractory advanced NSCLC by the China Food and Drug Administration
      (CFDA) on May 9, 2018.10 Previous study in phase II (ALTER0302) trial has shown a better
      progression-free survival (PFS) in advanced NSCLC patients treated with anlotinib compared
      those with the placebo (4.8 vs 1.2 months, P<0.0001).11 In phase III (ALTER0303) trial, both
      the overall survival (OS) and PFS of advanced NSCLC patients were observed to be
      significantly longer in the anlotinib group (median, 9.6 and 5.4 months) than the placebo
      group (median, 6.3 and 1.4 months).12 Moreover, anlotinib also displayed manageable toxicity,
      long circulation, and broad-spectrum antitumor potential.13,14 For the lack of recommended
      drugs with exactly therapeutic effect in the third-line treatment of SCC patients, it is
      worth to further analyze the efficacy and specifically clinical observation indicator of
      anlotinib in this subtype of NSCLC patients. In this dose exploration study, the primary
      objective is to establish the safety profile of anlotinib combined with AP in treatment-naive
      non-squamous NSCLC patients by identifying dose limiting toxicity (DLT), maximum tolerance
      dose (MTD), the recommended phase II dose, and schedule. Secondary objective includes the
      assessment of preliminary antitumor effect.
