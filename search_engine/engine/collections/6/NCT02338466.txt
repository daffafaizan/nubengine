    
      This is a Phase 2, multi-center, national, randomized, biomedical study comparing two
      therapeutic strategies in ischemic stroke associated with proximal middle cerebral artery
      occlusion.

      Patients will be included in two randomized arms and the new sequential treatment approach
      (rt-PA + tenecteplase) will be compared with the standard treatment (rt-PA alone).
