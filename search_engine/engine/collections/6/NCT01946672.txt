      this study, we evaluate the feasibility of identifying the lower-limb drainage nodes (LLDNs)
      during pelvic lymphadenectomy for gynaecological cancers using an isotopic detection
      technique with a preoperative radiopharmaceutical injection into both feet Secondary
      objectives are to map lower-limb drainage, to assess the diagnostic value of our mapping
      technique, and to determine the incidence of lymphedema. LLDN mapping may allow the
      preservation of LLDNs, thereby decreasing the risk of lower-limb lymphedema and improving
      quality of life.
