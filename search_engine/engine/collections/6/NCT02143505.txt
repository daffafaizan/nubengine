      cancers on the basis of the adenoma-carcinoma sequence. The effects of screening for
      colorectal adenomas and removing precancerous lesions on the prevention of colorectal cancer
      have been established. Because of the high recurrence rates of colorectal adenomas in
      patients who have undergone polypectomy, the potential chemopreventive agents that may reduce
      the risk of colorectal adenoma recurrence need to be investigated. Since laboratory and
      epidemiologic evidence suggests that calcium or vitamin D may help prevent colorectal
      adenomas, we conduct a randomized, placebo-controlled, prospective clinical trial to study
      the effect and safety of calcium plus vitamin D supplementation in prevention of colorectal
      adenomas recurrence.
