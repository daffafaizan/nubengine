      fever and/or rigors with laboratory indicator of inflammation as leucocytosis and elevated
      c-reactive protein level are considered as markers for CRBSI before blood culture results
      became available.

      Procalcitonin is a valid indicator of sepsis. In this study, Procalcitonin level will be
      measured in any patient with suspected CRBSI and correlation will be tested for proved CRBSI
      by blood cultures.
