      SBI 10 g BID compared to matching placebo for 12 weeks followed by a 12 week open-label
      extension SBI 10 g BID (EnteraGam) in the dietary management of mild to moderate Crohn's
      disease.

      The effect of SBI will be evaluated on Crohn's disease related symptoms and inflammation
      symptom control as measured by Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) scores and plasma and
      stool markers of inflammation. The patient's quality of life will also be assessed as an
      indicator of disease state.
