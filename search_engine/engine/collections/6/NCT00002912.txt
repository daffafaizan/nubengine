      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of PSC-833 in combination with mitoxantrone and
      etoposide in children with refractory or relapsed acute leukemia.

      II. Determine the effects of PSC-833 on mitoxantrone and etoposide pharmacokinetics.

      III. Quantify MDR1 gene expression and MDR1 P-glycoprotein expression and function in
      patient-derived leukemia cells.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of PSC-833.

      Patients undergo induction therapy consisting of etoposide IV and mitoxantrone IV on days
      1-5. Patients then receive PSC-833 IV over 124 hours beginning on day 2. A second course is
      administered no sooner than 21 days from the start of the first course if the marrow is
      hypocellular after the first course. Patients with persistent disease after 2 induction
      courses are removed from the study. Patients receive a total of 3 courses of
      etoposide/mitoxantrone. Patients who achieve complete remission after 1 induction course
      receive 2 courses of etoposide/mitoxantrone with PSC-833 as consolidation, beginning within 4
      weeks of attainment of complete remission. Patients who achieve complete remission after 2
      induction courses receive 1 course of etoposide/mitoxantrone with PSC-833 as consolidation.
      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of PSC-833 until the maximum tolerated dose
      is determined. Patients are followed every 6 months.
