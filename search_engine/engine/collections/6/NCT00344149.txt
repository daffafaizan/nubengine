      antigens leading to premature platelet destruction and persistent thrombocytopenia often
      resulting in bleeding.

      The goal of treatment is to raise the platelet count to a hemostatically safe level.

      Treatment with corticosteroids rarely results in durable responses, and most of the patients
      will ultimately require a second-line treatment. Splenectomy results in a high rate of
      sustained remissions. However, the procedure is invasive and is associated with considerable
      short and long term morbidity and mortality. Rituximab, a chimeric anti-CD20 antibody with a
      B-cell depleting effect, has recently emerged as a promising treatment for ITP.

      The study aims to determine whether early treatment with Rituximab can result in durable
      remissions, and consequently, avoidance of splenectomy in a clinical significant number of
      patients.

      The main objective of this study is to assess the rate of treatment failure (splenectomy or
      meeting criteria for splenectomy after week 12) at 1.5-year in a prospective, randomized,
      placebo-controlled, double-blind, multi-centre
