    
      Shenfu injection is a traditional Chinese medicine formulation containing ginseng (Panax;
      family: Araliaceae) and aconite (Radix aconiti lateralis preparata, Aconitum carmichaeli
      Debx; family: Ranunculaceae) with Ginsenosides and aconite alkaloids as the main active
      ingredients. Its quality is strictly controlled in compliance with the standard of the China
      Ministry of Public Health (official approval code: certification number Z20043117; No.
      110804, Ya'an, China). Animal studies have shown that Shenfu injection has protective effects
      against reperfusion injury through multiple pharmacologic effects, including scavenging free
      radicals, inhibiting inflammatory mediators, suppressing cell apoptosis, and inhibiting
      calcium overload. However, few data are available regarding its efficacy in humans. We aimed
      to determine whether perioperative use of Shenfu injection, as compared to placebo, might
      reduce infarct size in patients with STEMI undergoing primary PCI.
