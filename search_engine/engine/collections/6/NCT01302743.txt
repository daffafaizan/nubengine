      nutraceutical for the initial treatment of diabetes when compared to standard therapy of
      metformin 1000 mg (extended-release). This study will enroll 309 subjects type 2 diabetics
      (using American Diabetes Association criteria) on no hypoglycemic medications. Subjects will
      be randomized into one of three groups, group 1 will receive oral extended-release Metformin
      1000mg, group 2 will receive Cinnamon Bark 1000mg, group 3 will receive cinnulin PF 500mg.
      Subjects will be instructed to take their study pills once a day for 90 days.After 90 days of
      treatment, each subject will again have hemoglobin A1C, lipid panel, height, weight, blood
      pressure and waist circumference measured. Analysis described above using intention-to-treat
      principles for any missing data will be used (we will use the carry-forward method to impute
      missing data). Subjects will bring in any remaining medication to determine adherence rates
      to the study protocol.
