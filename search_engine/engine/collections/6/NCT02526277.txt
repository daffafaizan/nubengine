      restless legs syndrome, despite reports that massage, baths and vibrations can alleviate RLS
      symptoms. We would like to assess whether the MMF007 Foot Massager device and/or heat therapy
      is associated with improved severity of RLS symptoms.

      For this study the investigator will enroll 40 participants who have been diagnosed with
      restless legs syndrome, who will be followed over the course of four weeks and asked to
      complete two in person study visits. In the study the investigator is comparing the use of
      the MMF007 Foot Massager device and/ or heat therapy to a non treatment group to assess if
      the symptoms of RLS improve.
