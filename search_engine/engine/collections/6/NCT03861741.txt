      problem affecting an increasing number of people worldwide.

      In particular, a group of these conditions termed Non-Syndromic Aortic Diseases (NS-TAD), can
      develop without any obvious symptoms or external features which prevents early
      identification. Unfortunately, if not treated, the aorta may enlarge and lead to dissection,
      a life-threatening medical emergency. For this reason, the investigators believe it might be
      helpful to investigate relatives of patients undergoing surgery for thoracic aortic disease
      to understand if there are tests that could help identify and treat this condition at the
      right time.

      Therefore the investigators propose to conduct a feasibility study to identify the practical
      issues and challenges that would need to be overcome in order to perform a successful
      tailored genetic (by collecting a small blood sample) and imaging (with exams such as
      echocardiography and MRI) screening in such population of individuals.

      Moreover, all participants will receive two questionnaires to ask their opinion about the
      study and to measure their levels of anxiety and depression, to judge whether and how this
      study has affected their emotional status.

      The study will be carried out at the Department of Cardiovascular Sciences Glenfield
      Hospital, University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust.
