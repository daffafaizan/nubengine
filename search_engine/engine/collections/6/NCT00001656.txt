    
      The purpose of this protocol is to compare efficacy of clozapine and olanzapine in children
      and adolescents with schizophrenia and psychoses, as well as to learn about side effects of
      these medication in pediatric population. The underlying hypothesis is that clozapine has
      superior efficacy over olanzapine.

      Children and adolescents, ages 7 to 18 years, meeting DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia,
      schizoaffective disorder and psychotic disorder not otherwise specified, with onset of
      psychosis before their 13th birthday, who have not responded to at least two prior trials
      with typical or a typical neuroleptics, will be eligible to participate in a double-blind,
      parallel group, trial of olanzapine-clozapine.

      This study will be done in conjunction with the Screening protocol, which will include
      characterization by clinical phenomenology, eye tracking, MRI brain imaging, plasma
      biochemistry, and chromosomal analysis.

      This study will consist of the following phases 1) Tapering of psychotropic medications (1-4
      weeks, depending upon type and dosage). 2) Observation for up to 2 weeks drug free, in order
      to establish a baseline prior to starting medication trial. 3) An 8 week double-blind trial
      of either clozapine or olanzapine. Efficacy and tolerability of clozapine and olanzapine will
      be compared using specified criteria. 4) If desired improvement not achieved or trial is
      interrupted, an 8 week open trial of the second medication and 5) Discharge following
      medication optimization for up to 4 weeks, or as clinically appropriate. This protocol also
      includes a follow-up every 2 to 3 years for a period of 10 years.
