      science studies. Some studies have reported that oat (Î²-glucan) intake in patients with type
      2 diabetes may improve glycaemic control. Evidence is emerging that gut microbiota may play
      an important role in energy homeostasis and glucose metabolism. This RCT aims to test the
      hypothesis that DHA and/or oat intake may improve glycemic control in women with gestational
      diabetes mellitus (GDM), and may impact metabolic health in fetuses/infants as indicated by
      cord blood leptin level. Changes in microbiota may be linked to these effects.

      Growing evidence suggests that epigenetic changes may occur during fetal development in
      response to an adverse in utero environment, and this may "program" the risk of metabolic
      syndrome and type 2 diabetes in adulthood. GDM's offspring are programmed to be at
      substantially elevated risk of metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes in adulthood. We will
      explore whether the intervention may affect epigenetic profile in placental DNA in GDM.

      Pregnant women bearing a singleton fetus without any evidence of malformation and with a de
      novo diagnosis of GDM at 22-28 weeks of gestation will be randomized into four arms: DHA,
      oat, oat plus DHA, and placebo. We will collect maternal blood and stool specimens on
      recruitment and 8-weeks post-intervention, cord blood and placenta specimens at delivery. The
      primary outcomes are cord blood leptin concentration in the baby, and fasting blood glucose
      at the 8 weeks post-intervention in the mother.
