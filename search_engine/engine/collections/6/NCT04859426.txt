    
      DBPR108 is a potent dipeptidylpeptidase-4 inhibitor. The aim of this study is to evaluate the
      pharmacokinetics and safety of DBPR108 in subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment
      (HI) compared to the matched control subjects with normal hepatic function. This study
      consists of a screening period (Day -14 to Day -1), a baseline period (Day -1), a treatment
      period (Day 1 to Day 3), and a follow-up call on Day 6.

      Subjects will be enrolled in the following groups:

      (A) mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A, 5-6 points); (B) moderate hepatic impairment
      (Child-Pugh class B, 7-9 points); (C) control subjects with normal hepatic function will be
      matched with subjects with HI by weight, age, and sex.

      Approximately 8 subjects will be enrolled in each group.
