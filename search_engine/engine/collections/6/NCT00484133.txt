      between 30% and 70% for the past three decades with only a slight decrease in mortality rate.
      Standard treatment of septic shock is fluid resuscitation, followed by agents with
      vasopressor activity to correct hypotension in septic shock. The question rises whether
      vasopressors should be the first line of action in septic shock Opening and recruiting the
      microcirculation are expected to improve regional organ function and tissue distress in
      severe sepsis. Beside fluid resuscitation, vasodilatation, in this respect, enhances
      microcirculatory flow while vasoconstriction causes a reduction in microcirculatory flow. On
      the other hand, a minimal perfusion pressure should be present. Our aim is to asses the
      effects of two resuscitation protocols in severe sepsis: the "standard treatment" using
      predefined pressure goals versus a microcirculation guided therapy.
