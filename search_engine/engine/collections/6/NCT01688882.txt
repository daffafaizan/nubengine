    
      This study was planned to be divided into 2 distinct parts. Part 1 was a multicenter,
      randomized, placebo-controlled study evaluating the efficacy, safety, PK and PD of multiple,
      subcutaneous doses of QGE031 in the treatment of patients with BP with disease refractory to
      oral steroid treatment. Patients were treated with QGE031 or placebo in a 2:1 ratio.

      Part 2 of this study was planned to be a multi-center, open label, dose range finding study
      evaluating the efficacy, safety, PK and PD of multiple, subcutaneous doses of QGE031 in the
      treatment of patients with BP with disease refractory to oral steroid treatment.

      This study was stopped after Part 1 completed and was terminated because the predefined
      criteria of efficacy was not reached ( >50% better then placebo)
