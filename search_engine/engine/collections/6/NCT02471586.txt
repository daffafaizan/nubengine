    
      This is a prospective, post-market, international, multi-center, randomized clinical
      investigation in which the participants will be randomized in 1:1:1 ratio to undergo PCI with
      either OCT, IVUS, or Angiography guidance. The clinical investigation will be conducted at
      approximately 35 sites in the United States and outside the United States; approximately 25%
      of subjects will be enrolled in the United States.

      Patients in the IVUS and OCT groups patients will undergo baseline and post PCI imaging with
      their randomized modality. In addition, the Angiography group and IVUS groups will undergo a
      blinded post-PCI OCT run to allow comparison of OCT derived minimum stent area (MSA) in both
      groups.

      After hospital discharge, all patients will have clinical follow-up at 30 days, and 1 year.
