      endometriosis will be randomly allocated to one of two groups: 22 women will be assigned to
      use LNG-IUS and 22 to use GnRHa. The assessed variables will be D-dimers, fibrinogen,
      prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, coagulation factors (F) II, V, VII,
      VIII, IX, X, and XI, antithrombin (AT), protein C, free protein S, tissue plasminogen
      activator (t-PA), Î±2-antiplasmin, thrombin-antithrombin complex, and prothrombin fragment
      1+2. All variables will be assessed before treatment and six months after treatment onset.
