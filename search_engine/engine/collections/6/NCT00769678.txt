      the phrenic nerve reduces electrical mechanical activation time (EMAT) and improves left
      ventricular function. This study examines whether patients with severe heart failure, who
      require permanent biventricular pacing after heart surgery, may benefit from an additional
      permanent electrode that stimulates the diaphragm. Heart function is assessed by
      echocardiography and acoustic cardiography (Audicor, Inovise Medical Inc., Portland, USA).
