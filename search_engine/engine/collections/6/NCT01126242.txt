    
      This study is designed as a single blind prospective randomized controlled trial to evaluate
      the difference in functional outcome after treatment with tape versus semi-rigid versus
      lace-up ankle support (brace) for grade II and III acute lateral ankle ligament injuries. The
      patients will be randomly allocated into one of the three groups. Randomization will be
      performed by computer. Blinding of patients is not possible, but the observer will be blinded
      at eight weeks and six months.
