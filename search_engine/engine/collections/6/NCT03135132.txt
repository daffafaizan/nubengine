      overweight subjects consumed a LCD (approximately 300kcal/d deficit, n=47) or a
      weight-maintenance diet (control, n=50) were included for analyzing plasma samples and
      metabolites using an ultra-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry
      (UPLC-LTQ/Orbitrap MS).
