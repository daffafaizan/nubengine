      intervention and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational
      intervention to use for further studies. "Investigational" means that the intervention is
      being studied.

      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved radiation with chemotherapy as a
      treatment option for your disease.

      Currently, there are no established rules to avoid esophagitis in the treatment of lung
      cancer with radiation therapy. We have developed an IMRT-based technique, termed CEST, to
      reduce the radiation dose to the part of the esophagus that is located opposite to the tumor.
      The reason behind this approach is that a lower radiation dose causes less esophagus
      inflammation and irritation and, therefore, may preserve the swallowing function of the
      esophagus better. In our clinical experience, reducing the radiation dose to part of the
      esophagus in this fashion has shown the potential to dramatically decrease the likelihood of
      severe esophagitis in many though not all people with lung cancer. We therefore wish to
      analyze this technique further.

      There is no firm data to indicate that different chemotherapy regimens given at the same time
      of radiation therapy result in different rates of esophagitis. The Investigators will,
      therefore, allow any type of standard-of-care chemotherapy regimen at the discretion of the
      patient's medical oncologist.
