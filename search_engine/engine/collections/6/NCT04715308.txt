      over the last few decades. However, much emphasis has been placed on surgical and
      hospital-related outcomes. In recent years, there has been an increased focus on patient
      quality-of-life following major abdominopelvic surgery. However, there is a lack of updated
      evidence on how patients manage and perceive their stomas. Managing a stoma is a difficult
      task for patients and can adversely effect their quality-of-life. This study will investigate
      specifically the impact of managing a urostomy or ileal conduit. Patients will be contacted
      via an anonymized, opt-in SMS or email to answer a questionnaire, having previously been
      provided with a patient information leaflet. This will take approximately 5 minutes to
      complete and will be carried out just prior to and at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months
      post-operatively. All of this data will be collated and published as part of a wider
      investigation in to patient quality-of-life following major abdominal and pelvic surgery.
      This study will be carried out in 35 countries.
