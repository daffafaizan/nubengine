      Shanghai children's medical center recruit the outpatient respiratory infection cases into
      the group, 6 centers including Shanghai children's medical recruit children with
      community-acquired pneumonia in hospital into the group All of the above cases in the group
      relevant clinical datas are collected, and complete clinical follow-up.Pharyngeal swabs or
      sputum specimens collected during the study were sent to Shanghai children's medical center
      for the detection of MP and macrolidene drug resistance genes.

      Azithromycin was administered orally or intravenously to outpatients who tested positive for
      mycoplasma pneumoniae by colloidal gold method.Finally, MP infection rate of children with
      respiratory diseases including outpatient (common cold, acute bronchitis and cough after
      infection) and hospitalization (community-acquired pneumonia) was statistically observed.The
      detection rate of MP macrolides drug resistance gene was isolated from respiratory disease
      cases.Sensitivity and specificity of MP rapid detection method (antigen and antibody
      detection rapid colloidal gold method) for diagnosis of MP infection;Effectiveness of
      azithromycin in treatment of MRMP infection.
