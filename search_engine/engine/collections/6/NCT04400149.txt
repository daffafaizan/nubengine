      birth weight baby birth, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, and early pregnancy bleeding.
      In some cases, patients are supported by oral or vaginal progesterone treatments during
      pregnancy. We also measure the relationship between maternal serum progesterone by measuring
      the level of amnion progesterone; We aimed to analyze the effects on pregnancy outcomes by
      observing preterm birth, premature rupture of membranes, low birth weight, baby gender,
      maternal problems that may occur during pregnancy, fetal problems.
