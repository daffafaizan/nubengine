    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine the safety of sorafenib tosylate when given in combination with
           transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) comprising doxorubicin hydrochloride and
           mitomycin C in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.

      Secondary

        -  To estimate the time to progression (TTP) in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  To estimate the overall survival (OS) of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  To explore correlative relationships between measures of serum VEGF in the
           peri-procedure TACE period and changes with TACE and sorafenib tosylate as well as
           patient outcomes (TTP and OS).

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral sorafenib tosylate twice daily on days 1-14. Patients then undergo
      transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) comprising doxorubicin hydrochloride and mitomycin C
      on days 17-19*. Patients then receive oral sorafenib tosylate twice daily beginning after
      recovery from TACE and continuing in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      NOTE: *A second course of TACE may be administered within 8 weeks after the first TACE
      procedure.

      Blood samples may be collected periodically for biomarker and pharmacokinetic analysis.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3-4 weeks and then every 3
      months for up to 3 years.
