      (CVLs) and result in increased morbidity, mortality, and cost. Blood stream infections
      related to CVLs may be the result of migration of skin organisms along the catheter tract or
      introduction of organisms into the lumen of the catheter. The extraluminal route of infection
      appears to be most common early after catheter insertion while the frequency of infection
      acquired by the intraluminal route appears to increase the longer the catheter is in place.
      Meticulous attention to best practices for insertion and the subsequent care of the insertion
      site reduces infection by the extraluminal route. Adherence to good technique for entering
      the line may similarly reduce infection by the intraluminal route.

      Ethanol is an effective antimicrobial agent with activity against a broad spectrum of human
      pathogens; including the bacteria and fungi which most commonly infect CVLs. The mechanism of
      the antimicrobial activity of ethanol is attributed to the ability to denature proteins and
      induced resistance to the effect of ethanol has not been reported. These features suggest
      that ethanol-lock is a promising approach to the prevention of acquisition of central line
      associated blood stream infections by the intraluminal route.
