      cancer treated with platinum based chemotherapy to diminish the risk of subsequent
      cardiovascular events. A future randomised trial of statin therapy in these patients is under
      consideration and results from this study will inform its design.

      The information gained from this pilot study will guide the development of interventional
      pharmacological studies that are directed towards the most appropriate pathophysiological
      processes, at the most appropriate time and in the most appropriate patient groups treated
      with platinum based chemotherapy for testicular cancer.
