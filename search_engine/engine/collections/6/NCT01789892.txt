      I. To assess whether premedication with a corticosteroid may reduce false positive findings
      on fluorodeoxyglucose (fludeoxyglucose F 18 [FDG[) PET/computed tomography (CT) scans in lung
      cancer patients, by reducing radiotracer uptake in thoracic lymph nodes related to
      inflammation.

      OUTLINE:

      Within 1-14 days of undergoing standard FDG PET/CT scan, patients receive methylprednisolone
      intravenously (IV) and then undergo a second FDG PET/CT scan.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 2 years.
