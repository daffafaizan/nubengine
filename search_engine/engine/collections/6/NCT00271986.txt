      during the postoperative period until discharge. Subcutaneous microdialysis serve as control.
      Samples are collected every 4-hour. Samples will be analyzed continuously but the results
      will not be included in the clinical evaluation of the patient.

      Patients undergoing abdomino-perineal rectal resection will serve as a control group.

      A total of 50 patients will be included in this pilot study. The results of the peritoneal
      microdialyses will be compared with the clinical course in each patient. The results form the
      uncomplicated courses will be used to define the normal variations in peritoneal
      microdialysis. This will be compared to results from patients with various complications.

      The study is approved by the local scientific ethical committee No. ------
