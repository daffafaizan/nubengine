      diseases in the United States. High rates of rehospitalization and mortality and treatment
      costs have persisted for decades despite advances in care. Clinical guidelines recommend
      assessment of blood volume and clinical management to euvolemia or normal blood volume, but
      standard methods of diagnosing blood volume status have been shown to be unreliable. Blood
      Volume Analysis (Daxor BVA-100) is based on the gold standard indicator dilution technique.
      BVA has been used to quantify otherwise undiagnosed blood volume derangements and guide
      treatment in heart failure and other indications. Also, retrospective analyses have shown
      that care of heart failure patients guided by BVA is associated with improved rates of
      rehospitalization and mortality.

      The proposed study is a prospective, two-center, parallel design, interventional,
      single-blinded pilot study of the potential for BVA to positively impact the treatment
      decisions of ADHF clinicians.
