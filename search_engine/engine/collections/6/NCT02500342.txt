      Thyroid hormone is a key regulatory hormone for a range of physiological systems. An impaired
      function of the thyroid gland such as subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) can affect quality of
      life. Older adults with subclinical hypothyroidism often report non-specific symptoms such as
      tiredness. In addition, muscle symptoms such as cramps, weakness and myalgia are more common
      in SCH than in healthy controls. At present, evidence is lacking about the benefits of
      thyroxine replacement in the elderly with SCH, as no large randomized clinical trials (RCT)
      on the full range of relevant clinical outcomes, including tiredness have been performed.
      Moreover, there is continued uncertainty about the long-term impact on health related quality
      of life of thyroxine treatment for SCH.

      Objective

      To examine, within a large RCT of elderly participants with subclinical hypothyroidism (the
      TRUST trial), the impact of thyroxine therapy on the association between subclinical thyroid
      disease (SCTD) and the level of physical and mental fatigue.

      Methods

      The existing trial infrastructure (TRUST thyroid trial-Euresearch FP7, clinicaltrials.gov ID:
      NCT 01660126) will be utilized to collect information on the level of physical and mental
      fatigue by using the Pittsburgh Fatigability Scale at baseline and at 1 year from 220
      participants with persistent subclinical hypothyroidism randomized to either thyroxine or
      placebo.
