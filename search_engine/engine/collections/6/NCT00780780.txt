      patients will be randomized into two groups. All patients will have Early Treatment of
      Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) vision measured and OCT (OCT Stratus - Zeiss)in both eyes
      in following visits: Baseline, Week 4, 8, 12, 20 and 25. OCT measurements will include total
      macular volume, central foveal thickness, and average macular thickness. The patients will be
      evaluated during 25 weeks (7 visits). Parameters for clinical evaluation: visual acuity, IOP,
      biomicroscopy, fundus examination through dilated pupil and OCT.

      Group A: 20 patients will receive intravitreal triamcinolone injection Group B: 20 patients
      will receive intravitreal triamcinolone injection associated with nepafenac eye drops (1 gtt,
      tid) during 6 months.
