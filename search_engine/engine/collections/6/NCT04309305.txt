    
      The purpose of this research study is to assess whether using a wearable device, called the
      robotic exoskeleton (RE), can be helpful in improving recovery of walking in adults who have
      recently had a stroke. The study will compare the walking abilities of people who went
      through standard of care treatment after a stroke to those who used the robotic exoskeleton
      as part of their rehabilitation. This study will also look at the effects walking in the RE
      has on brain activity. The name of the robotic exoskeleton that is being used in this study
      is the EksoTM.
