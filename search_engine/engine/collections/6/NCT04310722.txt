    
      Based on the previous study, investigators plan to screen for CRKP, CRAB, CRPsA and MRSA
      isolates from ICU settings, medical workers and patients, and establish the CRKP, CRAB, CRPsA
      and MRSA genome and transcriptome database through next-generation sequencing. Under the
      guide of British bioinformatics and hospital-acquired infection control experts,
      investigators will build the transmission mechanism model of CRKP, CRAB, CRPsA and MRSA
      combined with the clinical data to reveal the route and rule of transmission. And the study
      will also demonstrate that the resistance mechanism and horizontal transfer mechanism of
      resistance genes of carbapenems and other main antimicrobial agents. Investigators will also
      set up alerting platform and new antibiotic susceptible system based on the genome and
      transcriptome. These results will provide scientific evidence to rational application of
      antimicrobial agents, reduction the prevalence of CRKP, CRAB, CRPsA and MRSA, improvement the
      prognosis of infections and development of new antimicrobial agents. Finally, to find the
      prevalence, risk factors, outcome and the rationality of the current therapy for these
      pathogens infections in China.
