      intravenous administration of lidocaine as a perioperative analgesic adjuvant, the quality of
      the evidence is low, since the studies carried out to date present small samples, great
      variability in the designs and different surgical techniques studied.

      More studies will be needed to help improve the grade and quality of evidence in the
      management of acute postoperative pain and its role in opioid sparing, an especially
      beneficial effect in tumor pathology For this reason, the investigators have designed a
      randomized, double-blind, phase IV clinical trial with two treatment arms, parallel groups,
      in which 96 patients who underwent liver and gastric cancer surgery through laparoscopic
      approach participated.

      This study will include 2 different population groups: patients undergoing liver cancer
      surgery and patients undergoing gastric cancer surgery
