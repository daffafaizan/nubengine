    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the response rate of the combination of pembrolizumab and recombinant EphB4-HSA
      fusion protein (sEphB4-HSA) as combination therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the biomarkers of response. II. Determine the unique toxicities of the
      combination of pembrolizumab and sEphB4-HSA.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 and recombinant
      EphB4-HSA fusion protein IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 3
      weeks for up to 24 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 12
      weeks.
