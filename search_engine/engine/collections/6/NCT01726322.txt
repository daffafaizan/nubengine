      residual ovarian reserve in women with breast cancer treated with chemotherapy. In addition,
      AMH might give an indication of the possible efficacy of GNRH agonists in fertility
      preservation and the effect on ovarian follicular reserve using different adjuvant
      chemotherapy regimens. Those likely to be offered GNRH agonists are younger women with no
      children and a wish to have some in the future. Older women who have completed their families
      are less likely to be offered a GNRH agonist.
