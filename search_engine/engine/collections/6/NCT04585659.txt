      in several neurological conditions; however, community-delivered qigong has never been
      assessed for people with multiple sclerosis (MS). We assessed the feasibility of community
      qigong classes for people with MS and explored outcomes of balance, gait, and quality of life
      (QOL).

      Twenty adults with MS were randomly assigned to 10 weeks of community qigong classes or
      wait-list control. Feasibility criteria included recruitment, retention, adherence, and
      ability to participate in qigong movements. Secondary outcome measures included physical
      tests of mobility, gait and balance, and participant-reported mobility, depression, anxiety,
      fatigue, and QOL.

      Because this is a small feasibility study, the data collected are meant to be
      hypothesis-generating. Any clinically meaningful trends toward improvement will justify
      further exploration of qigong for MS in a larger clinical trial.
