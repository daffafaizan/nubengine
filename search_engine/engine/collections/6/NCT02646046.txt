      participants were recruited from healthy adult (age > 18 years) laypersons who attended the
      BLS training courses provided by the BLS training class.

      The simulation scenario consists of witness of an out of hospital cardiac arrest and
      activation of the EMS system with the prepared cellular phone. Interventional method
      contained the immediate starting of the chest compression with one hand during the calling
      for help to the EMS via a cell phone with another hand.

      We compare the quality of CPR between the novel interventional method (start CPR during Call
      to EMS) and conventional method (First Call to EMS and then start CPR).
