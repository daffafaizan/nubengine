      population. In the immunocompetent population, PIV is usually self-limited, but can cause
      more severe disease including pneumonia and tracheobronchitis in adults, and croup and
      bronchiolitis in young children. DAS181, an inhaled sialidase, cleaves the binding site of
      PIV from respiratory mucosal cells limiting the ability of PIV to infect new cells. This may
      improve outcomes in patients with PIV infections.

      This exploratory randomized double-blind Phase 2 study will assess the safety and
      tolerability, and explore the efficacy of DAS181 versus placebo for the treatment of
      parainfluenza. Thirty eligible patients diagnosed with parainfluenza will be randomized in a
      2:1 allocation to receive either DAS181-F02 formulation (10 mg times 5 days) or placebo.
      Subjects will be followed on Study Days 0, 2, 4, 7, 10, 14, 28, 180, and 365 with a series of
      clinical, pulmonary function, functional status, virologic, and safety assessments.
