      parallel-group phase III study. Patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer
      who were candidates to receive standard of care first-line chemotherapy with docetaxel plus
      prednisone were randomized 2:1 into one of two arms: an investigational arm (DCVAC/PCa) and a
      control arm (placebo) in addition to chemotherapy (docetaxel plus prednisone).
