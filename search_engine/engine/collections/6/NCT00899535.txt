        -  To investigate the clinical relevance of conducting comprehensive molecular analyses on
           clinically annotated high-quality tumor biospecimens from patients with stage I or II,
           N0 or N1 (less than hilar) non-small cell lung cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Biological specimens are collected from participating clinical sites and analyzed by
      transcription profiling of RNA and microRNA; detection of DNA copy number changes and
      chromosomal rearrangements; epigenetic modifications analyses; and sequencing of genomic
      segments, genes, and regulatory regions to assess sequence variation. Clinical information
      associated with each specimen donor is also collected.
