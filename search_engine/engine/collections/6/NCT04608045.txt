    
      The expansion cohort of this study will be conducted at up to 3 study sites. It will be an
      open-label feasibility trial to characterize the pharmacologic activity of IV CPX-POM in
      bladder tumor tissues obtained from patients with MIBC (Stage â‰¥T2, N0-N1,M0) who will be
      scheduled for RC with bilateral (standard or extended) pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND).
      Approximately half of the patients enrolled will be cisplatin eligible and half will be
      chemotherapy eligible and scheduled to receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine +
      cisplatin. Neoadjuvant treatment with CPX-POM, whether alone or in combination with
      gemcitabine +cisplatin, will start within 8 weeks of transurethral resection of the bladder
      tumor (TURBT) that showed muscularis propria invasion.

      Approximately 12 patients will be enrolled. Patients who are cisplatin eligible will be
      treated with two 21-day treatment cycles of CPX-POM (Cycle 1, Days 1-5 treatment, rest days
      6-21; Cycle 2, Days 22-26 treatment, rest days 27-43) before a planned RC.
      Chemotherapy-eligible patients who are scheduled to receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy
      (gemcitabine + cisplatin in three 21-day treatment cycles) will be treated in addition with
      three 21-day treatment cycles of CPX-POM (Cycle 1, Days 1-5 treatment, rest days 6-21; Cycle
      2, Days 22-26 treatment, rest days 27-42; Cycle 3, Days 43-47, rest days 48-63), i.e.
      concurrently with the prescribed chemotherapy. The cisplatin + gemcitabine dosing regimen for
      chemotherapy-eligible patients in the Expansion Cohort will be administered per the
      institution's standard of care. After each infusion of CPX-POM, patients will remain in the
      clinic for at least a 1-hour observation period. On Day 1 of Cycle 1, single blood and clean
      catch urine samples will be collected prior to the first CPX-POM infusion.
