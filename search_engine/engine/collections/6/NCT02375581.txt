      having little chance to receive aggressive local therapy, including surgery or concurrent
      chemoradiotherapy. EGFR is overexposed in most of the cases. In this phase II trial, the
      efficacy and toxicity of EGFR tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (Icotinib) with concurrent
      radiotherapy will be investigated in this setting.
