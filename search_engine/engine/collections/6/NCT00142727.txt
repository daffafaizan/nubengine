      of the characteristics of the opioid being studied (e.g., whether it is an agonist, partial
      agonist, or antagonist; the dose administered; and the route of administration). Another
      important set of factors influencing the effects produced by opioids is the characteristics
      of the organism to which the opioid is being administered. One such characteristic is the
      level of physical dependence in individuals.

      Participants in this study will be maintained on different dose levels of an opioid agonist
      (methadone). The participant will be challenged with a prototypic opioid agonist, antagonist,
      and a mixed agonist-antagonist with partial agonist features in order to determine the
      effects that each has on the human body.
