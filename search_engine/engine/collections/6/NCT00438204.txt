      Primary

        -  Determine the efficacy of pemetrexed disodium, gemcitabine hydrochloride, and
           bevacizumab in chemotherapy-na√Øve patients with stage IIIB or IV nonsquamous cell
           non-small cell lung cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the response rate in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the time to treatment failure in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive pemetrexed disodium IV over 10 minutes, gemcitabine hydrochloride
      IV over 30 minutes, and bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every
      14 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients may then receive bevacizumab alone in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After the completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 6 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 42 patients will be accrued for this study.
