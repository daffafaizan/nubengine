      treatment of some diseases. It has been utilised in the treatment of some neoplasm, fungal
      and HPV infections. Investigators' study found that local hyperthermia at 44Â°C could cleared
      HPV in more than half of the patients with plantar warts. Investigators also note the fact
      that in patients with multiple lesions, the clearance of the target lesion is commonly
      followed by clearance of other distant lesions, a phenomenon suggesting that local
      hyperthermia could aid in establishing a specific immune response to eliminate HPV.So the
      purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of controllable infrared
      bioeffect system to treat cutaneous warts. This trial was designed into two groups, one was
      experimental group (thermal therapy group), the other one was control group (liquid nitrogen
      cryotherapy group). The ratio of participants was 1:1 in experiment group and control group.
      The main evaluation indicator was the recovery rate after 4 months of initial treatment.
