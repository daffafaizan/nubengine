      motor vehicle collision. A number of variables can influence the effects of cannabis on
      driving. For example, frequent users of cannabis have been shown to have different cognitive
      and physiological responses to cannabis as compared to occasional users. In addition, we know
      that younger drivers are more likely to be involved in motor vehicle collisions after alcohol
      use as compared to older users. The contribution of age and experience with cannabis on
      cannabis-mediated effects on driving have yet to be delineated in laboratory studies. The
      purpose of the present investigation will be to determine whether cannabis has different
      effects on driving in young, as compared to middle aged, drivers. Half of each age group will
      be occasional users of cannabis and the other half will be frequent users.

      Eligible participants will attend the laboratory for two test sessions; in one session they
      will smoke a cannabis cigarette and in the other they smoke a placebo cigarette. Participants
      will drive a driving simulator before and after smoking the cigarette. Blood for measurement
      of THC and metabolites will also be collected before smoking the cigarette and at a number of
      times after smoking. Subjective and cognitive tasks will be completed before and after
      smoking.

      It is hoped that the findings of this study will help to inform public perception and policy
      into the potential effects of cannabis on driving.
