    
      The CADence™ system is comprised of a digital stethoscope used to record cardiac (heart)
      sounds, with integrated sensor used to record electrical activity of the heart (ECG), a
      single-use patient booklet, and the CADence™ Software application. CADence™ Software is a
      clinical decision support tool for the noninvasive functional evaluation of patients
      presenting with chest pain and at least two coronary artery disease risk factors that is
      intended to aid a qualified clinician's analysis of normal/physiological and pathological
      heart murmurs and in ruling out significant coronary disease as a cause for these symptoms of
      cardiovascular disease, utilizing simultaneous recording of cardiac sounds and ECG.

      The purpose of this study is to assess the precision of the CADence site using multiple
      operators, cadence systems and clinical sites.
