    
      Part 1 is a dose-escalation phase with a 3+3 sequential-group design in which patients will
      receive a dosimetry dose followed by maximum of five 5-week cycles of treatment doses of
      intracerebroventricular 177Lu-DTPA-omburtamab.

      Part 2 is a cohort-expansion phase in which patients will receive a treatment at the
      recommended dose determined in Part 1, until confirmed LM progression, unacceptable toxicity,
      or for maximum of 5 cycles, whichever comes first; however, the total number of cycles will
      be determined based upon data from Part 1 (e.g., the dosimetry data) to minimize the risk of
      radiation necrosis and decreased neurological function End of treatment will take place
      within 5 weeks after the last cycle and thereafter the patients will be enter the follow-up
      period. The patients will be followed for up until one year after first dose (Part 1) and 2
      years after first dose (Part 2).
