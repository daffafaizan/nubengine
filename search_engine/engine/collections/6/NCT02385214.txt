      melanoma survival rates for patients treated with either a 1cm excision margin or 2cm margin
      for both intermediate & high risk melanomas. The study is designed to be able to prove or
      disprove that there is no difference in risk of the tumour recurring around the scar or
      anywhere else in the body between the two groups of patients. This study is designed to show
      that the risk of long-term pain associated with surgery can be halved. If the study shows no
      risk of the tumour recurrence then we will also be able to determine how much of an impact
      the narrower excision has on patients in terms of improved quality of life and reduced side
      effects from the surgery and melanoma disease. This trial will also evaluate and determine
      the economic impact of narrower excision margins on the health services and society in
      general.
