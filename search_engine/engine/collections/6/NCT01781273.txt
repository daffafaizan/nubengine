      drive. Current guidelines underline the limitations of existing instruments and the poor
      adaptability of batteries of neuropsychological tests assessing fitness to drive in both
      experimental and primary care settings. The investigators therefore developed MedDrive, a
      free, reliable, computer based measuring instrument capable of detecting effects of age and
      drugs on cognitive functions considered as essential for driving.

      Objectives: This study aims to test MedDrive responsiveness to different blood alcohol
      concentrations (BAC) and validate these measures against performances on a driving simulator.
      It also aims to measure MedDrive's reliability following repeated measures during the
      training phase, to compare MedDrive's performances in measuring effects of different BAC
      against the UFOV, and to model MedDrives measures to predict behaviour on the simulator.
      Finally, this study also includes a nested experimental study measuring effects of alcohol on
      attention.

      Methods: Using Widmark's formula, 16 healthy young drivers are given cranberry juice with
      different doses of ethanol to bring their BAC to 0 g/L, 0.5 g/L, 0.65 g/L, and 0.8 g/L. They
      are blinded to the presence of ethanol by inhaling vapors of ethanol just before drinking.
      BAC is maintained during the entire experiment by using a breathalyser and administrating
      drinks throughout the experiment. Three scenarios are planned on a driving simulator
      (StSoftware PvW-2010), a road tracking task, a car following task, and a car following task
      including dual tasking using peripheral vision.
