      still remains in the hands of a minority of surgeons. Splenic artery aneurysm (SAA) is an
      exception to the rule: an easy-to-reach position and relatively safe control favour the
      progressive diffusion of laparoscopic techniques.

      An increasing number of cases is managed by minimally invasive surgery originating a number
      of case reports and small series published in recent literature. These papers are unanimous
      in signalling the feasibility, safety and effectiveness of laparoscopic technique as well as
      its appreciation by patients -often young females- who harbour the disease. However,
      perplexities still remain concerning the real potential of laparoscopy in this specific
      field, in particular considering the spectrum of technical solutions to be performed, the
      splenectomy rate and the feasibility and results of reconstructive surgery.

      The low incidence of the disease justifies the low number of published laparoscopic series
      enrolling an adequate number of patients and, in particular, the absence of papers comparing
      open and laparoscopic techniques.

      This study reports the first prospective randomized comparison of the different surgical
      techniques.
