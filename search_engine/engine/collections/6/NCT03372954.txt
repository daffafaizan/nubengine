      left ventricular ejection fraction (LV EF), the left ventricular end-systolic and
      end-diastolic diameters and volumes (measured with magnetic resonance imaging) compared to
      standard heart failure therapy.

      Furthermore, it will be associated with improved exercise tolerance in the six-minute
      corridor walk test and an improvement in the life quality of patients without increasing the
      incidence of severe ventricular arrythmias.
