      Assiut University hospital, Assiut University, Egypt. The control population comprised 20
      healthy individuals with no liver infection. Patients will be subjected to a full history and
      thorough physical examination.The liver will be examined in all patients by local physical
      examination to detect possible abnormalities.The diagnosis of HCC cases include a combination
      of history, clinical examination ,radiological examination including ultrasound and triphasic
      computed tomography, Child-Pugh classification, and laboratory investigations including
      hepatitis C marker, irrespective of alpha-fetoprotein as it is positive in 30% of cases.

      Neither patients nor controls had a history of other malignancy.The diagnosis of liver
      cirrhosis is based on clinical features, laboratory tests, abdominal ultrasound.

      3-Exclusion criteria Exclude patients who had chronic hepatitis B virus infection by
      detecting HBsAg and core total, alcoholism, primary biliary cirrhosis, or autoimmune liver
      disease, decompensated liver cirrhosis on top of HCV .

      4- Participants All individuals are subjected to the following:-

        1. Full history taking including the history of taking antiviral drug,clinical examination,
           abdominal ultrasound.

        2. Laboratory tests including:

             -  Routine investigations: CBC,PT &PC,liver function tests.

             -  Specific investigations: AFP level, serum level of MMP-1,Determination of MMP-1
                gene polymorphism By PCR amplification followed by restriction Fragment length
                polymorphism (RFLP) and gel electrophoresis.
