      in persons that carry the genetic mutation causing HD, but who do not show any movement
      symptoms yet. In addition, the associated changes in brain structure and function will be
      studied. The aim is to perform the study with the same group of participants who participated
      in a recent study carried on by this research group, in which the functional brain changes
      associated with increased irritability were investigated. This will allow to relate emotion
      experience with emotion perception. The results of the study may provide a target to further
      develop therapeutic interventions and aid caregivers of preHD subjects.
