      bone marrow failure patients.

      We are particularly interested in identifying factors, which determine treatment response and
      outcome. Cytokines are biological mediators of the immune response. In a normal population
      there is considerable variation in the precise sequence of the genes which control cytokine
      production (Cytokine Gene Polymorphism or CGP). As a consequence individuals differ in the
      quality of the immune response they mount against self or foreign antigens. Since the bone
      marrow failure disorders aplastic anemia and myelodysplastic syndrome involve auto-immune
      suppression of marrow function, it is important to discover whether there are any recurrent
      patterns of cytokine production in these disorders which may contribute to the marrow
      failure. This can be done by studying the sequences of the genes that control cytokine
      production to find out whether there are any recurrent gene patterns in the diseases studied.
      In addition we need to understand why some patients fail to respond to immunosuppressive
      treatments. By comparing CGP in responders and non-responders we may be able to find patterns
      of cytokine production that are favorable or unfavorable for response. Better understanding
      of CGPs in marrow failure syndromes should make it possible to improve the outcome for
      patients who fail immune suppression by using drugs which block specific cytokines.

      None of these polymorphisms are associated with known clinical disease to be classifiable as
      a 'genetic defect'. All testing will be done on samples collected and stored for research
      purposes from consenting bone marrow failure subjects who have or will be participating on
      Hematology Branch research protocols.
