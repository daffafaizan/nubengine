      'tidal' breathing. A number of studies have reported the effects of conditions such as
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on tidal breathing patterns, and a previous
      study has shown that SLP is able to detect differences in ten tidal breathing patterns
      between healthy subjects and patients with COPD. In this present study, the investigators
      will aim to confirm the previous findings and also to examine the relationship between SLP
      tidal breathing parameters and traditional measurements of lung function measured by
      spirometry and body box plethysmograph. The correlation between SLP parameters with lung
      Function parameters measured by spirometry and body box plethysmography: forced expiratory
      volume in one second (FEV1); Forced vital capacity (FVC), FEV1/FVC (forced expiratory volume
      in one second/forced vital capacity); total lung capacity (TLC) and residual volume (RV).
      Trends in tidal breathing patterns between varying severities of COPD (based on the (Global
      initiative for lung disease (GOLD) grading system.
