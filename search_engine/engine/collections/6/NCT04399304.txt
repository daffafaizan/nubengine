      abnormalities can often be related. The load from the medial tibiofemoral joint increases
      significantly in varus alignment disorder and it plays an important role in the structural
      progression of knee osteoarthritis. Varus malalignment and patients with medial tibiofemoral
      disease comprise a common patient subset. The probability of progressing to severe disease is
      3 to 4 times higher in these patients compared to those with a neutral knee alignment.
      Although the long-term results of high tibial osteotomy are well documented, but data on
      bilateral simultaneous HTO are insufficient. In general, staged surgery is preferred in
      bilateral cases due to the difficult rehabilitation, healing of the osteotomy line, and
      complications related to surgery. Advances in post-surgical rehabilitation have been made due
      to increased confidence in stability due to improvements in the technology of plates.The
      advantages of an bilateral simulatneous HTO is single administration of anesthesia, total
      shortening of the hospitalization periof and reduced costs.
