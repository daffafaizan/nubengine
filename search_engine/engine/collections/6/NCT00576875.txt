      management/statistics are proposed to facilitate the conduct of these projects and to ensure
      integration at the conceptual, analytical and resource availability level, and flow to the
      various projects. Findings from the center should greatly enhance our understanding of the
      biology of depressive disorders and help improve the treatment of these disorders. In
      addition, the technological innovations developed in the context of this project are likely
      to be of major importance and relevant to other studies of brain function.
