      I. To assess late >= grade 3 gastrointestinal (GI) and/or genitourinary (GU) toxicity of
      interest with the hypofractionated regimen with proton beam therapy or intensity-modulated
      radiation therapy (IMRT) (late defined as 3 to 24 months after protocol radiation therapy
      [RT]).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Late grade >= 2 GI and/or GU toxicities of interest within 24 months after the protocol
      RT, using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (v)4.0.

      II. Acute grade >= 3 GI and/or GU toxicities of interest during and within 3 months after the
      protocol RT, using the CTCAE v4.0.

      III. Compare the rates of late >= grade 3 GI and/or GU toxicity between the 2 treatment
      schedules.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients undergo proton beam radiation therapy 5 days a week over 3 weeks.

      ARM II: Patients undergo IMRT 5 days a week over 5 weeks.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 3-6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54,
      and 60 months.
