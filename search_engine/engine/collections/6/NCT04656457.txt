      adjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer patients is not well known.

      Fatigue and decreased immunity have a negative impact on work, social relationships, mood,
      and daily activities and cause significant impairment in overall quality of life, Furthermore
      the need of this study is developed from the lack of information in the published studies
      about the effect of the treatment with chemotherapy among breast cancer patients on inducing
      fatigue and decreasing immunity and the effect of resistance and aerobic exercises on
      improving these changes.
