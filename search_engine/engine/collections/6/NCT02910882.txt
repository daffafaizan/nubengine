    
      This is a pilot trial evaluating the safety and potential efficacy of PEGylated Recombinant
      Human Hyaluronidase (PEGPH20) plus concurrent Gemcitabine and radiotherapy. Recognizing that
      PEGPH20 has not been previously delivered with radiotherapy but is unlikely to contribute to
      increased toxicities, this trial will have an abbreviated sequential dose escalation schema
      for the first three patients. PEGPH20 will be given twice per week for the first 28 days and
      then weekly for another 2 weeks during radiotherapy. Gemcitabine will be delivered weekly at
      the first day of radiotherapy and continued weekly, per published literature. Patients will
      remain on study for three months. The duration of active treatment with PEGPH20 and
      Gemcitabine plus radiotherapy will continue for 5-6 weeks. Efficacy outcome will occur 6-8
      weeks after the completion of radiotherapy.
