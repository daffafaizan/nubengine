      by advancing age, inactive behavior and sedentary lifestyle. Metabolism and immunity are
      entangled in their respective effects: the pathways of inflammation are involved in
      metabolism and the metabolic state plays a predominant role in immune function. Physical
      activity and calorie restriction are first-line, non-drug strategies recommended in reducing
      obesity and insulin resistance and then prevent type 2 diabetes. However, the impact of their
      combined effects on circulating immune cells or those residing in adipose tissue and skeletal
      muscle, remains insufficiently understood to allow a nutritional prescription (i.e., quality
      of nutritional intake and efficient doses of physical activity) favorable to preventive
      medical care, individualized, and effective. If the risk associated with an increase in
      visceral fat mass is linked to a change in the pro/anti-inflammatory status, it is essential
      to reduce this risk by acting on its cause, regardless of the weight loss. In a context of
      low-grade inflammation, these effects could lead to an anti-inflammatory profile of T cells,
      specifically regulatory T cells (Treg) whose metabolism is extremely "flexible" at the
      periphery and into visceral adipose tissue (directly involved in inflammation of obesity).

      ALA (Alpha-Lipoic Acid) is known to play a pivotal role in cellular redox status and energy
      metabolism by modulating inflammatory and metabolic signaling pathways such as those of
      NF-kB, JNK, PI3K/Akt, p38 MAPK, AMPK or PPARβ/δ. As ALA is a possible metabolic modulator, it
      would affect the metabolism of T cells. And therefore ALA could be a complementary measure to
      non-drug strategies by potentiating the correction of the inflammatory state linked to
      obesity.
