    
      Patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN)
      who had prior immune checkpoint inhibitor and platinum-based chemotherapy treatment will be
      randomized in a 2:1 ratio to monalizumab and cetuximab or placebo and cetuximab. Efficacy and
      safety assessments will be performed periodically from the time of enrollment and throughout
      the study. Patients in all arms will continue therapy until progression, unacceptable
      toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or another discontinuation criterion is met. All patients
      will be followed for survival after progression is confirmed.
