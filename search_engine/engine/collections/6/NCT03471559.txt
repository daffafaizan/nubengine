      a comparative bioavailability study will be conducted, comparing cannabidiol capsules
      (reference formulation) with an intranasal cannabidiol gel (test formulation), with the
      further aim to find an appropriate dosing of the new pharmaceutical preparation. The
      intranasal administration may also be suitable to reduce the high variability in the
      bioavailability of cannabidiol observed for the current oral administration.
