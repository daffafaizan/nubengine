      intervals to monitor the clearance of Candida infection from the bloodstream.

      Each T2 result will be compared to the companion blood culture result. The comparison will
      determine if the presence of antifungal therapy inhibits blood culture and leads to an
      incidence of blood culture false negative test results. The T2 result, which is not impacted
      by the presence of antifungal therapy, can show that the pathogen is still present for some
      additional period of time.
