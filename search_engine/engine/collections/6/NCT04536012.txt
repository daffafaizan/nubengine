      leads to functional limitation by causing leg pain with ambulation (intermittent
      claudication). Supervised exercise programs improve walking endurance in patients with
      intermittent claudication, but many patients are unable to travel to centers for treatment.
      In a recent trial, a home-based exercise program using wearable fitness trackers and
      telephone coaching failed to increase walking distance in patients with intermittent
      claudication, but this intervention did not leverage gamification or health behavior theory.
      Therefore, a randomized controlled trial was proposed comparing a gamification-enhanced
      home-based walking program with an attention control in patients with intermittent
      claudication. Patients in both arms will be provided with a wearable fitness tracker, wear
      the tracker for 2 weeks to establish a baseline daily step count and set a goal for step
      increase by the end of the 16-week study period. Patients in the attention control arm will
      receive daily text messages with a report of their previous day's step count. Patients in the
      gamification intervention arm will receive automated coaching via daily text messages and the
      intervention will also involve a precommittment pledge, slow ramp-up of step goals, weekly
      progression (or regression) through levels with loss-framing of points, and support from a
      family member or friend. After 16 weeks, change in daily step counts from baseline will be
      compared between study arms. Secondary behavioral phenotyping analyses will be undertaken to
      identify psychometric features associated with response to the gamification intervention.
