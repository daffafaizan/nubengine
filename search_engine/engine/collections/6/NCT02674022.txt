      and 30 mothers of non-ASD children of similar age, respectively labelled ASD-moms and
      non-ASD-moms. In Phase 1, the levels of certain folate-related and oxidative stress
      biomarkers (folate, vitamin B12, vitamin E, homocysteine, methylmalonic acid, urinary
      isoprostanes) and MTHFR mutation analysis will be measured in all the mothers. The
      investigators expect that approximately 40-50% of the ASD-mothers and approximately 5-10% of
      the non-ASD-mothers will have abnormal homocysteine levels. In Phase 2, for those mothers
      with abnormal homocysteine levels, the investigators will treat them with a standard prenatal
      supplement for 4 weeks, and re-measure their biomarkers. The investigators expect 75-100% of
      the non-ASD mothers to respond, but only 25-50% of the ASD-mothers to respond. In Phase 3,
      for those mothers who did not respond to the standard prenatal supplement, the investigators
      will treat them with an optimized prenatal supplement for 4 weeks and remeasure their
      biomarkers. The investigators expect that 75-100% of the mothers of both groups will respond
      to this improved prenatal supplement.
