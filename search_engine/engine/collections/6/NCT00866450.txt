      inflammation thereby increasing gut permeability and causing increased endotoxins and markers
      of systemic inflammation.

      This is a single blind crossover study. Subjects will be randomized to begin on either a WD
      or a PD for 30 + 3 days. Once that dietary intervention is complete, subjects will have a
      four (4) week wash-out period and then will be placed on the other dietary intervention for
      30 + 3 days. The following study measures are performed during both the dietary intervention
      study periods. All the baseline tests will be repeated at the end of each dietary
      intervention period.
