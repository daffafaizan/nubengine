      Study Organization:Single-center in China. Endocrinology and metabolism department of 6th
      affiliated hospital of Shanghai Jiaotong university Study Population: Type 2 diabetes
      inadequately controlled by premix-insulin therapy,40 patients per arm(acarbose add on/
      metformin add on) both acarbose and metformin are widely used with premix-insulin in clinical
      practice, for the better glucose control and lower hypoglycemia incident.

      Acarbose delay the absorption of digested carbohydrates from the small intestine and thus
      lower both postprandial glucose and insulin levels which sequently improve glucose
      fluctuation Metformin improve the insulin resistance reduce the gluconeogenesis, glucose
      output and thus lower the fasting glucose
