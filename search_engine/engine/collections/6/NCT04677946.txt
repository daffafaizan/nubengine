      energy metabolism, but is not clear if linoleic acid consumption can influence sleep quality.

      The investigators plan to test the central hypothesis and accomplish the overall objective of
      this research by pursuing the following specific aims

      Aim 1) To determine the effect of healthy cookies made with linoleic acid-rich oil on
      measures of sleep quality and sleep architecture in overweight adults

      Aim 2) To determine the effect on plasma fatty acid composition and markers of circadian
      rhythm in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) after four and eight weeks of consuming
      one healthy cookie per day

      Aim 3) To measure the effect of healthy cookies made with LA-oil on change of lipidomic
      profiles of plasma and PBMC after four and eight weeks of consumption

      Aim 4) To determine the feasibility of adherence to consuming 1 healthy cookie per day in
      place of snack for eight weeks
