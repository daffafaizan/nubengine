      food consumption for 6 days, and impacts on food preferences and intakes will be assessed at
      baseline and after 1 week. Preferences for sweet and non-sweet foods will be assessed during
      two taste tests at each assessment time, where six different foods will be rated. Sweet and
      non-sweet food consumption will also be measured at two meals at each assessment time -
      breakfast and lunch. Identical buffet meals composed of sweet and non-sweet foods suitable
      for consumption at breakfast and lunch will be provided ad-libitum.
