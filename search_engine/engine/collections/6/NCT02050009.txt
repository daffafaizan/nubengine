      I. To determine the duration of response to metformin (metformin hydrochloride), carboplatin
      and paclitaxel followed by maintenance with metformin as compared to the primary duration of
      remission in within patient controls.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the in situ effects of metformin on lethal-7 (let-7) expression as determined by
      in situ hybridization. (Phase Ia) II. To determine the feasibility of using a core biopsy to
      perform ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing. (Phase Ia) III. To determine epigenomic effects of
      metformin via RNA-sequencing (Seq). (Phase Ia) IV. To determine the biologic effects of
      metformin through evaluation of pre and post metformin tumor samples for phosphorylated (p)
      adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK), v-myc myelocytomatosis viral
      oncogene homolog (avian) (myc), mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and phosphorylated
      v-akt Murine Thymoma Viral Oncogene Homolog 1 (pAKT). (Phase Ia) V. To assess safety and
      tolerability of metformin and carboplatin and paclitaxel in patients with platinum sensitive
      recurrent ovarian cancer. (Phase Ib)

      OUTLINE:

      Phase Ia: Patients receive metformin hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-7
      and twice daily (BID) on days 8-21.

      Phase Ib: Patients receive metformin hydrochloride BID on days 1-21, paclitaxel intravenously
      (IV) over 3 hours on day 1, and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats
      every 21 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 12 weeks.
