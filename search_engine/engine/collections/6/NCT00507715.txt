      number of patients develop motor complications, including, fluctuations and dyscinesia after
      some years of treatment.

      The origin of the fluctuations is not well established, but it could be attributed, al least
      partially, a pharmacokinetics factors. So that, it could improve the answer and reduce the
      adverse reaction if we reach more stable levels of L-dopa in the circulation. The first
      experimental studies in animals showed that Plantago ovata husk has an influence in the
      pharmacokinetics parameters of L-dopa, obtaining more stable levels.
