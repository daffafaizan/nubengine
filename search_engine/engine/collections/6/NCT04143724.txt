    
      This is a Phase 2a study to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of luspatercept in
      pediatric subjects who require regular red blood cell (RBC) transfusions due to β-thalassemia
      and to determine the recommended dose (RD) to be used in the planned confirmatory pediatric
      study.

      The primary endpoints are the determination of the RD and the development of a PK model that
      describes the PK exposure data of luspatercept and associated variability.

      The secondary endpoints include change in RBC transfusion burden, change in hemoglobin
      levels, safety, frequency of antidrug antibodies and its effect on safety and
      Exposure-response relationships for measures of activities and toxicity.

      The study will consist of the following periods:

        -  Screening/Run-in Period

        -  Treatment Period

        -  Posttreatment Follow-up Period

        -  Long-term Treatment and Follow-up Period

      Subject screening procedures will occur during the Screening/Run-in Period, within 12 weeks
      prior to the start of study treatment. Subjects who meet the study eligibility criteria will
      be enrolled into the Treatment Period.

      Patients enrolled into the study should have β-thalassaemia (including Hemoglobin
      E/β-thalassaemia) with ≥ 4 RBC transfusions in the 24 weeks prior to enrollment with no
      transfusion-free period ≥ 42 days during that period.

      Subjects in all planned dose escalation cohorts will receive luspatercept, administered as a
      subcutaneous (SC) injection, every 3 weeks (21 days) for up to 4 cycles (84 days) in the
      Treatment Period. Dose delay(s) and dose reduction(s) may be required for individual
      subjects.

      Each dose escalation cohort will consist of up to 6 subjects. Subjects will be treated at one
      of 2 dose levels, 0.75 mg/kg or 1.0 mg/kg, and enrollment will be sequential in descending
      order of age:

        -  Cohort 1: 12 to < 18 years: Luspatercept 0.75 mg/kg, administered SC once every 21 days
           (for up to 4 cycles)

        -  Cohort 2: 12 to < 18 years: Luspatercept 1.0 mg/kg, administered SC once every 21 days
           (for up to 4 cycles)

        -  Cohort 3: 6 to < 12 years: Luspatercept 0.75 mg/kg, administered SC once every 21 days
           (for up to 4 cycles)

        -  Cohort 4: 6 to < 12 years: Luspatercept 1.0 mg/kg, administered SC once every 21 days
           (for up to 4 cycles)

        -  Cohort 5: 2 to < 6 years: Luspatercept 0.75 mg/kg, administered SC once every 21 days
           (for up to 4 cycles)

        -  Cohort 6: 2 to < 6 years: Luspatercept 1.0 mg/kg, administered SC once every 21 days
           (for up to 4 cycles)

        -  Cohort 7: 6 months to < 2 years: Luspatercept 0.75 mg/kg, administered SC once every 21
           days (for up to 4 cycles)

        -  Cohort 8: 6 months to < 2 years: Luspatercept 1.0 mg/kg, administered SC once every 21
           days (for up to 4 cycles).

      The first dose of luspatercept should be administered at least 14 days after the last
      transfusion prior to enrollment. Subject enrollment via the Integrated Response Technology
      (IRT) system and study treatment administration should be on the same day (Cycle 1 Day 1),
      provided that the eligibility criteria are met. Otherwise, the subject will need to be
      rescreened.

      Once all 6 subjects in a cohort have completed the first cycle (Study Day 22), a Dose Review
      Team (DRT), consisting of the Celgene Medical Monitor, Celgene lead safety physician, Celgene
      biostatistician, other Celgene functional area representatives or designees, as appropriate,
      and all active site Investigators and/or designees (at sites with a subject who has received
      study drug), will review all safety data, including dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), adverse
      events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), and laboratory results (including hematology and
      chemistry) reported during Cycle 1 of each dose level.

      A DLT, using the current active version of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity
      Criteria for Adverse Events, version 5.0 (NCI-CTCAE v.5.0), is defined as any of the
      following toxicities at any dose level occurring within 21 days of the first administered
      dose:

        -  Treatment-related SAE of ≥ Grade 3

        -  Treatment-related nonhematologic AE of ≥ Grade 3

        -  Treatment-related hematologic AE of ≥ Grade 4

      The DRT recommendations to enroll the next cohort at the next planned dose level and/or
      proceed to the next lower age group will be based in part upon the following criteria:

        -  If a DLT occurs in ≤ 1 subject (out of 6) in a cohort within 21 days following the
           initial dose of luspatercept, the next planned dose level and/or next lower age group
           dose may proceed;

        -  If a DLT occurs in ≥ 2 subjects (out of 6) in a cohort within 21 days following the
           initial dose of luspatercept, the next planned dose level and/or the next lower age
           group should not proceed;

        -  If a hemoglobin increase of ≥ 2.0 g/dL (confirmed within 14 days after initial study
           treatment administration and not attributable to RBC transfusion) occurs in ≥ 2 subjects
           (out of 6) in a cohort, the decision to proceed to the next planned dose level and/or
           the next lower age group will need to be evaluated by the DRT.

      At least 12 subjects are planned to be enrolled with up to 12 subjects per age-group strata
      eligible for the Dose Determining Sets (DDS). With up to 4 age groups, a total of up to 48
      subjects are to be included in the DDS.

        -  If a DLT occurs in ≥ 2 subjects (out of 6) in a cohort within 21 days following the
           initial dose of luspatercept, the next planned dose level and/or the next lower age
           group should not proceed;

        -  If a hemoglobin increase of ≥ 2.0 g/dL (confirmed within 14 days after initial study
           treatment administration and not attributable to RBC transfusion) occurs in ≥ 2 subjects
           (out of 6) in a cohort, the decision to proceed to the next planned dose level and/or
           the next lower age group will need to be evaluated by the DRT.

      At least 12 subjects are planned to be enrolled with up to 12 subjects per age-group strata
      eligible for the Dose Determining Sets (DDS). With up to 4 age groups, a total of up to 48
      subjects are to be included in the DDS.

      To minimize safety risk to subjects, best supportive care will be available, including RBC
      transfusions, iron-chelating agents, use of antibiotic therapy, antiviral and antifungal
      therapy, and/or nutritional support as needed.

      Dose interruptions/delays and dose reductions may be used to manage toxicities. Subjects can
      receive study treatment for up to 4 cycles during the Treatment Period, until study treatment
      becomes intolerable, or the subject wishes to discontinue study treatment for any reason. The
      decision to discontinue a subject from study treatment, is the responsibility of the treating
      physician; however, prior to discontinuing a subject, it is recommended that the Investigator
      contact the Medical Monitor and forward appropriate supporting documents for review and
      discussion. Subjects are to undergo end-of-treatment evaluations when study treatment is
      discontinued. The reason for treatment discontinuation will be recorded in the electronic
      case report form (eCRF) pages and in the source document.

      During the Treatment Period, any subjects discontinued from study treatment will continue to
      be assessed in the Posttreatment Follow-up Period for AEs, concomitant medications,
      concomitant procedures, transfusions, hematologic improvement, and subsequent therapies.

      Any subject benefiting from the study treatment (at the Investigator's discretion), at the
      completion of the Treatment Period, will be offered the opportunity to continue luspatercept
      and long-term follow-up in the Long-term Treatment and Follow-up Period. Subjects entering
      the Long-term Treatment and Follow-up Period will continue to receive luspatercept at the
      same dose level as during the Treatment Period for up to 5 years from their first dose (Cycle
      1 Day 1) or when the drug is approved for pediatric patients (whichever comes first).
      Subjects who receive treatment for the full 5 years will then have an End of Treatment (EOT)
      visit and then a Post End of Treatment visit (12 weeks from last dose). Any subject that
      discontinues treatment prior to 5 years from Cycle 1 Day 1 will be have an End of Treatment
      visit, a Post End of Treatment visit (12 weeks from last dose), and then will continue in
      Long-Term Posttreatment Follow-up until 5 years from Cycle 1 Day 1.
