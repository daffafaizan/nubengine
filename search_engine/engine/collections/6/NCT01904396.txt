      secondary (genetic and acquired) carnitine deficiency in patients with limb girdle weakness
      and hypertrophic or idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy where an underlying cause is unknown.
      Identification and treatment with carnitine may potentially reverse or halt heart failure and
      skeletal muscle weakness in these patients.

      Specific aims:

        1. To ascertain the prevalence of primary and secondary carnitine deficiency in a
           population of adults with myopathy and hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathy of
           unknown etiology

        2. To describe the demographic and phenotypic characteristics of patients with myopathy and
           dilated or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy who have primary and secondary carnitine
           deficiency

        3. To measure the motor and cardiovascular response to carnitine supplementation in
           patients with myopathy, cardiomyopathy and carnitine deficiency
