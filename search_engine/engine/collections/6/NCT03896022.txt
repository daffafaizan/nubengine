      paracervical block and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as the only analgesics.
      Yet first trimester aspiration pain control is often inadequate with 26-32% of women
      reporting that they experienced severe pain. Moderate sedation and general anesthesia are not
      readily available, and investigations on opioids and anxiolytics have consistently found them
      ineffective for first trimester aspiration abortion pain. In 2018, The National Academies of
      Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) recommended research to improve pain relief.
      Limited data indicate that acupuncture is valuable in dysmenorrhea and for labor pain,
      conditions in which pain may be similar to that experienced during aspiration abortion.

      This randomized trial will recruit women seeking first trimester aspiration abortion. This
      study will evaluate two types of auriculotherapy applied to selected acupoints on the
      external ear. The study treatments are acupressure using gold beads and acupuncture using
      Pyonex needles; both are applied to the ear using adhesive disks. A control group will
      receive the adhesive disks alone. All participants will receive usual care for their
      aspiration abortion procedure, including a paracervical block and ibuprofen for pain
      management. The investigators will query the participants regarding pain and anxiety
      immediately after their procedure, in person, on the day of their procedure.
