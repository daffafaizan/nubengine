      locally advanced or metastasized, despite advances in surgery, chemo- and radiation therapy.

      In this trial the investigators assess a new immunotherapeutic strategy targeting the immune
      inhibiting enzyme, IDO to investigate the potential of vaccination against IDO as a possible
      anticancer target.

      IDO has recently been recognized as an important factor in immune regulation and development
      of immune tolerance in the microenvironment of cancer cells. Cells that represent IDO at
      their surface are known to inhibit the immune system. IDO expression is seen both in cancer
      cells and antigen presenting cells. The vaccination against IDO expressing cells is therefore
      two-sided. The vaccination therapy is thought to block the development of immune tolerance
      induced by IDO expressing cells. At the same time the investigators aim to stimulate the
      production of IDO specific T-cells, hence facilitating the elimination of IDO positive tumour
      cells. The primary end points are safety and toxicity evaluation. Secondary end points are
      immunological and clinical response.
