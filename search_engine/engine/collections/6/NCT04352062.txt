      postmenopausal women. The aim of the study was to assess the role of melatonin in chronic
      dyspepsia in this group of women, with consideration of Helicobacter infection. Methods: The
      study comprised 152 subjects Including 30 healthy women (group I), 60 women with asymptomatic
      H.pylori infection (group II), and 64 women H. pylori infected with chronic dyspepsia(group
      III). Endoscopic examination, histological assessment of gastric end duodenal mucosa, urease
      breath test(UBT-13C), and serum levels of 17-Î²-estradiol, follicle stimulating hormone,
      melatonin and urinary concentration of 6-sulfatoxymelatonin were determined by
      immunoenzymatic method. In group III - 14-day antibacterial treatment was introduced with
      pantoprazole, amoxicillin and levofloxacin. Afterward, in 32 women was administered
      placebo(group IIIa), and in 32 women (group IIIb) melatonin at a dose 1 m/morning and 3 mg/at
