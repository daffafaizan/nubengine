      European Society of Human Reproduction and Endocrinology (ESHRE) criteria with a history of
      at least one prior failed IVF cycle will recruited for the study. Antral follicle count
      (AFC), serum anti-mullerian hormone (AMH), and early follicular phase serum follicle
      stimulating hormone (FSH) levels will be determined at baseline. Autologous blood obtained
      from peripheral vein will be used to prepare PRP following standard protocols. PRP injection
      will be performed under sedation anesthesia, using a 35 cm 17 G needle under transvaginal
      ultrasound guidance. On the 2-4th days of the first six menstrual cycles following the
      procedure, AFC, AMH, and FSH levels will be re-assessed. Patients with at least one antral
      follicle will be started on ovarian stimulation for in-vitro fertilization- intracytoplasmic
      sperm injection (IVF-ICSI), followed by embryo banking/ preimplantation genetic testing-
      aneuploidy (PGT-A) or embryo transfer. Markers of ovarian reserve (AFC, FSH, AMH), and IVF
      laboratory outcome parameters (number of metaphase II (MII) oocytes, 2PN(pronucleus) embryos,
      cleavage stage, blastocyst embryos) will be followed.
