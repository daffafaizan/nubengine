      remission state) will be recruited to receiving visceral osteopathic therapy. Participant
      will received four standardized osteopathic session of 45 minutes (1 session every 7 days:
      week 0, 1, 2 and 3) and a follow up visit at week 4. The osteopathic protocol will
      specifically address the gut-to-brain neuro-immuno-vascular axis.

      Global quality of life and severity of IBS-like symptoms will be a assess at week 0, 2 and 4
      using three standardized questionnaires. Gut permeability and intestinal inflammation will be
      assessed at week 0 and 4 by measuring Zonulin (pre-Haptoglobin 2), Histamine and Diamine
      Oxidase (DO) levels respectively. Vagal tone at the beginning and at the end of each
      osteopathic session will be evaluate using heart rate variability (HRV) measurements.
