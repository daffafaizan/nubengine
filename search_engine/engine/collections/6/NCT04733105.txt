      syndrome (ARDS), which leads to a mortality of 30-40%. An altered type I interferon (IFN)
      response has been demonstrated in patients with severe COVID-19, together with a high viral
      load. A recent study revealed that 10% of patients admitted in the intensive care unit (ICU)
      for severe COVID-19 had positive type I anti-IFN antibodies. Such finding has potentially
      important therapeutic implications, as patients having positive anti-IFN antibodies could
      benefit from targeted interventions, including plasmapheresis. The aim of the current work
      is, in a large cohort of patients with severe COVID-19 admitted in the ICU, to determine the
      prevalence of patients with positive anti-IFN antibodies and to determine their outcome, as
      compared to patients having negative anti-IFN antibodies.
