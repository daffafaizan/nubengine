      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (UC or CD), who have had an inadequate response with, lost
      response to, or were intolerant to conventional therapy or an TNF-alpha antagonist. This
      study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of vedolizumab in a routine clinical
      practice setting under real world conditions.

      This study will enroll approximately 600 participants. The data will be prospectively
      collected, at the centers from routinely scheduled follow-up visits and recorded into
      electronic case report forms (e-CRFs).

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in South Korea. The overall time for data
      collection in the study will be approximately 6 years.
