      levofloxacin) will be administered to each patient by randomization. Each formulation will be
      assigned the code, such as A, B, C, or D, and the treatment sequences will be generated as
      ABCD (sequence 1), BCDA (sequence 2), CDAB (sequence 3) and DABC (sequence 4). On the first
      day of drug dosing in period I, volunteers will be randomly assigned to a sequence of
      treatments as indicated in a pre-printed randomization scheme, which was generated using
      block randomization with block sizes of 4 and 6, and the allocation ratio of 1:1. Subjects
      will be stratified by sex. Subjects in sequence 1 will receive treatment A during the first
      study period and will then cross over to receive treatment B, C, and D at the second, third
      and fourth periods, respectively (each after a 7-day washout period).
