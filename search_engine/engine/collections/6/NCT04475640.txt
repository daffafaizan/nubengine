      I. To determine the prevalence of genetic mutations in cancer patients from various ethnic
      populations seeking care at Mayo Clinic Arizona cancer clinics.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Perform a chart review to assess the impact of genetic testing as part of standard of
      oncology care:

      Ia. Determine prevalence of pathogenic germline mutation detected by multi-gene panel
      testing.

      Ib. Determine differences in germline mutation detection in these patients as compared to
      traditional guideline (National Comprehensive Cancer Network [NCCN]) based approach for
      genetic evaluation.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo collection of blood or saliva sample for genetic testing.
