      (characterized by an established prediction rule). The expected prevalence of lung cancer in
      this high risk group is estimated to be 2% per year. All individuals benefit from clinic
      visit, low-dose Chest CT, spirometry and auto-fluorescence bronchoscopy at baseline, Chest
      CT, follow-up doctor visit, and auto-fluorescence bronchoscopy at least at year 2 and 5.
