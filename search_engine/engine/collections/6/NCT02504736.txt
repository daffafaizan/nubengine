    
      This is a prospective, non-controlled, open label, multicenter trial of colesevelam in
      Canadian South Asian adults at high cardiovascular risk.

        1. 15-20 clinical sites from Ontario, Quebec, Manitoba and British Columbia will be
           selected from CCRN's network of primary care physicians and cardiologists to identify
           patients having stable type 2 diabetes or documented stable CAD with metabolic syndrome
           who are on maximally tolerated statin therapy, with LDL >2.0 mmol/L or non-HDL > 2.6
           mmol/L.

        2. Following informed consent, patients will be screened at baseline for HbA1c, fasting
           blood glucose, lipid profile, renal function and liver enzymes.

        3. Baseline demographics, CAD and diabetes documentation and concurrent drug therapy will
           be collected.

        4. 250 eligible patients will receive a physician prescription of colesevelam (Lodalis) 625
           mg tablets (3 tablets taken twice daily) for 24 weeks.

        5. Physicians will be requested not to change lipid or diabetes therapy over the 24 week
           course of the trial.

        6. Patients will be contacted at 2 and 12 weeks (visit 3 and 4) via a phone call to assess
           adherence to the prescribed therapy, review other concurrent medications and assess for
           any adverse events.

        7. The week 24 visit (study visit 5) will include collection of fasting blood work as per
           screening visit, review of concurrent drug therapy and a final assessment for any
           adverse events.
