      (Citalopram, Reboxetin or interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT)). At baseline, day 7 and day 28
      we assessed the severity of depression and the cognitive performance with respect to
      cognitive flexibility, memory and attention. We measured pCREB with an enzyme linked immuno
      sorbent assay (ELISA).
