      genetically transmitted disease inducing muscular weakness predominating on shoulders and
      hips. Currently, there is no effective therapy to slow the progression of the disease. SMA is
      due to a neuron motor attempt of the spinal cord and recently it has been demonstrated a
      neuromuscular junction (NMJ) involvement, according to recent studies.

      EMOTAS study aim to understand if NMJ abnormalities could have an impact on motor performance
      and fatigue in SMA type 3 ambulatory patients by electromyogram and to improve by
      non-invasive therapy quality of life of patients.
