      different meals (mashed potatoes, hash browns, French fries, rice, or beans matched by 50g of
      available carbohydrate) and meal skipping will be examined. On six separate mornings, one of
      the meals or no meal will be provided in a random order upon their arrival. Blood glucose,
      subjective appetite, and mood will be measured at baseline, 10, 30, 60, 120, and 180 minutes
      after meal consumption. Cognitive performance will be measured using an immediate and delayed
      word recall test, and two to three executive function tasks at 10, 30, 60, 120, and 180
      minutes after meal consumption.
