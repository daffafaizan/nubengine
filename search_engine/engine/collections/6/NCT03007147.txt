    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To compare disease-free survival (DFS) of standard risk pediatric Philadelphia chromosome
      (Ph)+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treated with continuous imatinib mesylate (imatinib)
      combined with either a high-risk Children's Oncology Group (COG) ALL chemotherapy backbone or
      the more intensive European (Es)PhALL chemotherapy backbone.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the feasibility of administration of imatinib after allogeneic hematopoietic
      stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in high risk Ph+ ALL patients.

      II. To determine event-free survival (EFS) of high risk pediatric Ph+ ALL patients treated
      with EsPhALL chemotherapy, HSCT in first complete remission and post-HSCT imatinib.

      III. To compare rates of grade 3 or higher infections in standard risk (SR) Ph+ ALL patients
      between the two randomized arms.

      IV. To evaluate event free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) of all enrolled
      participants.

      V. To evaluate OS in SR patients. VI. To evaluate OS in high risk (HR) patients.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the toxicities associated with post-HSCT administration of imatinib.

      II. To evaluate the long-term toxicities in SR patients treated with chemotherapy plus
      imatinib (no transplant), overall and between both randomized arms.

      III. To determine prognostic significance of minimal residual disease (MRD) in Ph+ ALL at
      various time points during therapy.

      IV. To evaluate MRD in HR patients just prior to HSCT and then at regular intervals post-HSCT
      and explore the association of these measurements with long-term outcome.

      V. To evaluate concordance of MRD assessments made by IGH-T cell receptor (TCR) polymerase
      chain reaction (PCR) assay and next generation sequencing (NGS) assays.

      VI. To determine prognostic significance of IKZF1 gene aberrations and deletions.

      VII. To determine frequency and prognostic significance of p190 and p210 BCR-ABL1 fusion
      variants in pediatric Ph+ ALL.

      VIII. To measure adherence to oral chemotherapeutic agents (imatinib, 6-mercaptopurine, and
      methotrexate) during the maintenance phase in SR Ph+ ALL patients.

      IX. To identify factors associated with poor adherence. X. To determine association between
      relapse risk and adherence to each oral chemotherapeutic agent (separately and combined).

      XI. To measure adherence to imatinib after allogeneic HSCT in HR Ph+ ALL patients and
      identify factors associated with poor adherence.
