    
      This Phase III trial was performed as a monocentric, open label, randomized design, with 1
      treatment regimen, in 3 cycles (12 weeks), with administration in multiple doses, in which
      the healthy volunteers received one coated tablet of the test product - ethinyl estradiol +
      levonorgestrel + folic acid, 0.02 mg + 0.10 mg + 0.4 mg (Level-Fol® Biolab Sanus
      Farmaceutica, Brazil) for 21 days and a placebo coated tablet containing folic acid 0.4 mg
      only (Biolab Sanus Farmaceutica, Brazil) on the last 7 days of the cycle.

      The subjects were required to present to the Clinical Unit for every drug administration,
      which was assisted by a member of the research team. Blood samples of 15 mL were collected
      via direct venepuncture into tubes containing 50 µL of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)
      at pre-dose, 1st, 21st, 28th, 29th, 49th, 56th, 57th, 77th and 84th day of treatment.

      Te safety assessment was based on recording adverse events throughout the study duration as
      well as through the monitoring of vital signs and evaluation of laboratory tests and ECG.
