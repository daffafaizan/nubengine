      interact with celiac patient factors to trigger immunological response. Gluten-free diet
      (GFD) is the only effective treatment for celiac disease (CD) and its compliance should be
      monitored to avoid accumulative damage. However, practical methods to monitor diet compliance
      and to detect the origin of an outbreak of celiac clinical symptoms are not available.

      This study assesses the capacity to determine the gluten ingestion, and to monitor the GFD
      compliance in celiac patients by detection of gluten and gliadin 33-mer equivalent peptidic
      epitopes in human feces.
