      mortality in patients with a positive history of suicide attempts. This study is the first
      prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled multi-center trial focussing on the
      proposed suicide preventive effects of lithium in patients with suicidal behavior but not
      suffering from bipolar disorder or recurrent major depressive disorder. Patients with a
      recent history of a suicide attempt are treated with lithium or placebo during a 12
      month-period. The hypothesis is that lithium treatment will lead to a 50 % reduction of
      suicidal behavior.
