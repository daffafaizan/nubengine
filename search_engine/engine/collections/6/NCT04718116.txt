      post-surgical pain can result in cardiovascular, pulmonary and gastrointestinal
      complications, as well as chronic pain and negative psychological effects. A negative impact
      may be seen on immune function, coagulation and wound healing. Opioids have been the
      cornerstone in the treatment of pain after cardiac surgery. However, opioids have a number of
      adverse effects such as respiratory depression, gastrointestinal alterations, dizziness,
      delirium, addiction.

      Tapentadol is a new synthetic opioid with dual mechanism of action. It acts as a mu-receptor
      agonist, as well as norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. It is used to treat moderate to severe
      pain and is associated with fewer adverse effects compared to other opioids.

      The aim of this randomized one-blinded study will be to evaluate the efficacy and
      tolerability of two different oral doses of tapentadol and compare it to tramadol (an opioid
      commonly used to treat post-surgical pain).

      Patients undergoing cardiac surgery and being discharged from ICU to ward within 30 hours of
      surgery, will be divided into 3 groups. Group A will receive tapentadol 50mg p.o 3 times
      daily for two days, group B will receive tapentadol 75 mg p.o 3 times daily for two days and
      group C will receive tramadol 100 mg p.o 3 times daily for two days. Pain level will be
      assessed with Numeric Rating Scale (NRS), before drug administration and two hours after drug
      administration. Overall patient satisfaction will be assessed with Likert scale. Brief Pain
      Inventory( short form) and DN4 questionnaire will be used to detect chronic pain and
      neuropathic pain respectively, 3 and 6 months after surgery.
