      This is deleterious for their metabolic condition and slows recovery after surgery.

      A carbohydrate-rich beverage is taken immediately before surgery and gastric emptying rate is
      assessed in elderly (75-100 yo) women prior to surgery for acute hip fracture. As comparator
      another two groups of women are used; one scheduled for elective surgery for hip replacement
      due to osteoarthritis; another healthy female volunteers.

      On the day of surgery the primary study group of acute hip fracture is given a
      carbohydrate-rich beverage 400 ml, total 200 kcal in combination with paracetamol 1.5 g.
      Blood samples are intermittently drawn during 180 minutes to measure recovery of paracetamol
      in plasma and gastric emptying rate calculated according to previously published principles.
      In the same manner a group of women on waiting list for hip replacement surgery due to
      osteoarthritis are enrolled for estimation of gastric emptying rate. In addition, another
      group of completely healthy women are enrolled for assessment of gastric emptying.
