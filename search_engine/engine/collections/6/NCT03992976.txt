      home using a variety of techniques that mirror clinical practice. This includes content from
      medicine, physiotherapy, nursing and psychological techniques, such as relaxation.

      The study will use interviews (one semi-structured interview and one 'think-aloud' interview
      per participant) to explore the question: What content and features do young people with
      chronic pain, and their parents want to see in an online pain management intervention?

      The study seeks to recruit a group of teenagers from Great Ormond Street Hospital, as well as
      a group of parents. After the first round of interviews, participants have the option to be
      contacted about the second round.

      Recruitment for the first round of interviews will continue up until the point where no
      additional insights are found by adding new data to the analysis ('point of saturation'). We
      anticipate 30 teenagers and 30 parents will be sufficient. We hope to recruit young people
      with a mixture of ages and sexes, as well as a mixture of different pain diagnoses, and
      parents with varying backgrounds and sexes where possible.

      The insights gathered from this study will help develop a new program for managing chronic
      pain in teenagers, which we aim to make available through the NHS. The internet-based
      intervention hopes to contribute to successful chronic pain management at home, and may be
      used as an adjunct to clinical services, such as the Pain Control Service at Great Ormond
      Street Hospital.
