      the most common (85% - 90%) type. Cutaneous features of individual plaques include circular
      with centrifugal expansion, induration with sharp demarcation from surrounding skin, erythema
      and hyperkeratosis. Psoriasis has a negative impact on physical and mental aspects of life
      that is similar to other major chronic conditions. The modalities of psoriasis treatments can
      be divided into four main categories: topical, phototherapy, systemic drug therapies and
      systemic biological treatments. The currently available treatments for psoriasis result in
      either disease suppression or disease remission.There are many treatment options for the
      management of psoriasis using topical modalities; however all are lacking with respect to
      patient satisfaction and durability of treatment. Most current topical treatments, and many
      treatments in development, are based on modifications of a steroid structure or on Vitamin D.
      Recent research has identified a broad role for histone deacetylase (HDAC) proteins in
      numerous signaling pathways critical to cancer cell survival, such as epigenetic inheritance,
      gene regulation, mitosis,signal transduction and importantly, inflammation. Theoretically
      modulation of HDAC could lead to clinical benefit in inflammatory diseases.
