    
      Up to 10 archival breast tumor blocks will be obtained from the Department of Pathology, NUH
      - half of these blocks will be from patients who were diagnosed before year 2000, and the
      other half of the blocks will be from patients diagnosed between year 2000-2005 (control
      specimens). Basic tumor and patient information will be collected without patient identifiers
      - grade, stage, ER/PR/HER2 status, treatment received, outcome data. 8-10 ten-micron sections
      will be cut from each tumor block. RNA will be extracted from the tumor sections using the
      Roche High Pure FFPE RNA Micro Kit. RNA will be profiled using the Illumina Veracode assay
      and the Affymetrix Quantigene assay. RNA extraction and gene expression profiling will be
      performed by collabroators at the Genome Institute of Singapore.
