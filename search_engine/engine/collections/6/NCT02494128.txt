      randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluated with questionnaires before and after the
      intervention. Focus group interviews 6 months after the intervention will be performed with
      the CHC nurses participating in intervention group. 3 groups with 25 CHC nurses in each group
      are to participate in a three day education in group leadership and group processes. The
      education aims to provide knowledge and awareness about group dynamics, group processes and
      group leadership and also aims towards increased self-awareness in the role as group leader.
