    
      This is an open-label study consisting of a Screening period (1 day), 4-day treatment period
      (96 hours) followed by a 1-day dose taper period (24 hours), a 2-day acute follow-up period,
      and a 3 week extended follow-up period.

      On Day 1 of treatment SRSE subjects under seizure suppression or burst-suppression with a
      continuous IV AED (third-line agent) will be given a 1-hour IV loading infusion of SAGE-547
      followed by a maintenance infusion. After 48 hours of SAGE-547 treatment, the continuous IV
      AED (third-line agent) will be weaned while continuing SAGE-547 at the maintenance infusion
      for the remainder of the treatment period. After 96 hours (4 days) of therapy with SAGE-547,
      the dose will be tapered and discontinued over 24 hours.

      The subjects will have routine continuous EEG monitoring during the Screening period, and
      continuing until 48 hours after SAGE-547 treatment has completed. Subjects will then have
      follow-up examinations weekly for the next 3 weeks (Days 8, 15, 22, and 29), during which
      safety and functional assessments will be obtained. Apart from treatment with SAGE-547, all
      subjects will receive the standard of care for adults in SRSE along with ongoing treatment
      for all underlying medical conditions.
