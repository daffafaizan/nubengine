      type 1 diabetes. Patients will complete screening procedures up to 60 days before
      randomization to determine eligibility before enrollment to the treatment phase.

      The procedure for evaluating the efficacy of the G-Pen (glucagon injection) consists of
      inducing hypoglycemia by intravenous administration of regular insulin diluted in normal
      saline. Each participant will undergo two episodes of insulin-induced hypoglycemia, and in
      random order will receive 1 mg G-Pen (glucagon injection) during one episode and 1 mg Lilly
      Glucagon during the other episode. There will be wash out period of 7-28 days between
      treatment visits.

      Blood glucose levels will be monitored post-dosing, with a return of plasma glucose to a
      concentration > 70 mg/dL within 30 minutes signifying successful hypoglycemia rescue. As a
      confirmation of efficacy, subjects will complete a questionnaire concerning changes in
      symptoms of hypoglycemia following treatment with glucagon.

      Subjects will return for a follow-up safety visit 3-14 days following administration of the
      final dose of glucagon.
