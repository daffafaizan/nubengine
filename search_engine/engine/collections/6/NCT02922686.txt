      with phenoxymethylpenicillin for the emergency department treatment of cellulitis, wound
      infections and abscesses as evidenced by current disparate prescribing practice and hospital
      guidelines. Feasibility studies for the planned trial have shown that 45-50% of emergency
      department patients with these infections in Ireland are discharged on oral antibiotics which
      is consistent with findings in other jurisdictions. Despite the significant healthcare and
      economic costs associated with cellulitis, there is a paucity of scientific evidence
      concerning the appropriate antibiotic treatment for these conditions. Additionally, "less
      severe" infections tend to be over-treated and severe infections under-treated, indicating
      unjustifiable levels of antibiotic misuse, insufficient knowledge of therapeutics and a lack
      of evidence to risk-stratify patients with cellulitis to different treatments.The planned
      trial is therefore likely to be definitive due to the current clinical equipoise between the
      use of both penicillins for the emergency department outpatient treatment of this group of
      infections
