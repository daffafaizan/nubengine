      extensive rehabilitation, and generating fears of loss of function and need for
      institutionalization. Existing acute medical rehabilitation settings-skilled nursing
      facilities (SNFs) and inpatient rehabilitation facilities (IRFs)-often do not adequately meet
      the needs of depressed elders, resulting in a missed opportunity for effective and functional
      recovery. This study will test a new program that will enhance acute rehabilitation in SNFs
      to target mood, motivation, and functional recovery in the 2 to 4 weeks after
      hospitalization. This program, developed by the research team, increases the intensity and
      engagement of physical therapy (PT) and occupational therapy (OT).

      Participation in this study will last until discharge from the SNF, with follow-up
      assessments lasting until 3 months after entry. Participants will be randomly assigned to
      receive either the enhanced acute medical rehabilitation or treatment as usual. Participants
      receiving the enhanced care will complete up to 3 hours of enhanced PT and OT per day from
      study entry until discharge, excluding weekends. Participants receiving treatment as usual
      will receive standard PT and OT. Study assessments will take place at baseline, after 8 and
      15 days, and after discharge. Follow-up assessments will occur after 30, 60, and 90 days.
      Assessments will include questionnaires and interviews measuring positive and negative
      affect, and functional impairment and disability.
