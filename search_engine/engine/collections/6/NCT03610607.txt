      gingival inflammation status. Participants will be assigned into two groups after the second
      dentist visit based on their execution of periodontal health maintenance. Participants whose
      number of P. gingivalis is unchanged or higher compared to that found at baseline will be
      considered poor maintenance. Those not having maintained a good dental hygiene will further
      be randomly assigned to two groups. One group will be given more intense oral health
      education, while the other one will receive the same education as post therapy. The result of
      intensive education and a shift in ratio of S. cristatus and P. gingivalis will then be
      measured for both groups at the third dentist visit (9 months after initial periodontal
      treatment) and the effectiveness of the intervention will be tested at this stage.
