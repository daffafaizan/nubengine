    
      Using a 3-arm randomized trial design with repeated measures at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months, the
      study will randomize N=1650 smokers who present for LDCT lung cancer screening to an passive
      referral usual care control condition, proactive referral to a digital cessation intervention
      that combines web and text messaging, or proactive referral to a digital cessation
      intervention combined with Tobacco Treatment Specialist counseling. The Study will examine
      overall effectiveness of the interventions in promoting abstinence, the impact of proactive
      referral to treatment, and the total cost and cost effectiveness of the interventions. The
      Study will also examine the representativeness of the enrolled sample and explore barriers
      and facilitators to intervention adoption with LDCT clinic leaders. The trial is structured
      as a practical clinical trial to answer key questions of direct relevance to LDCT
      decision-makers.
