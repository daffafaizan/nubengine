      (17-20%) in 2:1 ratio in women compared to men. Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation
      (rTMS) is an effective neuromodulation technique for the treatment of Major Depressive
      Disorder and it has demonstrated favorable clinical effects when applied over the Left
      Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (LDLPFC); however there is evidence that other areas of the
      prefrontal cortex such as the Dorsomedial Prefrontal Cortex (DMPFC) could be ideal for rTMS
      treatment targets during the presence of MDD, given its association with deficient cognitive
      processes during the course of the illness. There is also evidence of the use of 5Hz
      frequency with the same clinical effectiveness from other frequencies such as 10 Hz and 20 Hz
      when applied to the LDLPFC. However, there are no current research that have addressed the
      use of this frequency on DMPFC.
