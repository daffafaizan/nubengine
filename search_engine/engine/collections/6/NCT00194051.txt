      arthritis. One possible mechanism for this is the generation of abnormal gait biomechanics
      secondary to obesity that are conducive to the development of knee osteoarthritis.

      We evaluate gait biomechanics, knee symptoms and knee radiographs in 35 obese patients before
      and after gastric bypass surgery to determine the effect of significant weight loss on gait
      biomechanics, knee symptoms and knee radiographs.
