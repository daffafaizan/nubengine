    
      Patients with Fibromyalgia as primary diagnosis assessed by the 1990 & 2010 ACR (American
      College of Rheumatology) criteria, presenting or not comorbid CFS, according to the Canadian
      and International CFS criteria, age 40-75 and BMI<35 (N=40), will be subjected to
      physiotherapy treatment consisting on 8 sessions of manual therapy (twice weekly) of 25
      minutes including pressure maneuvers of about 4,5 N by a single operator (Collegiate
      Physiotherapist). Blood samples (10-20mls/participant) will be obtained before and after
      first treatment, and after fourth and last treatment to determine molecular blood changes
      associated to the physiotherapy protocol applied. PBMC (Peripheral Blood Molecular Cells)
      transcriptome before and after treatments (RNAseq) will be studied towards identifying
      treatment-associated differential expression, mechanomiR profiles included. Patient health
      status with treatment will be monitored by FIQ, MFI and SF-36 questionnaires, in addition to
      an anonymized satisfaction questionnaire to register potential undesired secondary effects.
