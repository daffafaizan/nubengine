      (CLEAR Stroke) trial is part of the Specialized Program on Translational Research in Acute
      Stroke (SPOTRIAS). The overall goals of SPOTRIAS are to enhance delivery of acute stroke
      patient care and train acute stroke translational researchers.

      Stroke most often occurs when blood flow to the brain stops because it is blocked by a blood
      clot. When a blood clot blocks the blood supply to the brain, parts of the brain may not get
      enough blood and oxygen to survive. As a result, permanent brain damage can occur, which can
      affect a person's ability to walk, talk, and function independently. In order to reduce the
      risk of permanent damage, it is important to restore blood flow to the brain as quickly as
      possible.

      The CLEAR Stroke study will enroll 100 participants with acute stroke due to a blood clot.
      The purpose of this multi-center, randomized, double-blind study is to determine the effects
      of using a combination of two drugs, integrilin (or eptifibatide) and activase (or
      recombinant tissue plasminogen activator, rt-PA, recombinant t-PA), to dissolve blood clots.
      More specifically, the CLEAR study is being done to determine if a lower dose of activase,
      given in combination with a second drug, integrilin, is a safe treatment for acute stroke.

      Activase, used alone, is already approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as
      treatment for patients with a stroke caused by blockage of an artery in the brain and when
      given within 3 hours of the onset of stroke symptoms. Integrilin is also already FDA-approved
      as a treatment for blood clots causing heart attack. The investigational aspect of this study
      is the use of integrilin for a stroke victim in combination with activase.
