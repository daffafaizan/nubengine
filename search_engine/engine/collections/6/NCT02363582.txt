      beneficial nutrients such as prebiotics and lactoferrin. Previous studies have shown that
      both prebiotics and lactoferrin play important roles in generating a bifidobacteria-dominated
      colonic microflora as well as the intestinal immune systems. The purpose of this study is to
      investigate the stool characteristics（including intestinal microbiota） acceptability, and
      gastrointestinal tolerance in infants fed a starting infant formula supplemented with
      prebiotics and lactoferrin, and compared these data with infants on exclusively breast
      feeding.
