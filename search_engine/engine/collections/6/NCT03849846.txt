      n=28 participants). First, all participants will read and sign the consent form. They will
      also complete a sociodemographic questionnaire. Then, the moderator will conduct the
      discussion using a semi-structured interview guide, based on the construct of the Theory of
      Planned Behaviour. The interview guide has been developed to identify the beliefs that
      determine the participants' attitudes (advantages/disadvantages), subjective norms
      (approval/disapproval of important others) and perceived behavioral control
      (facilitators/barriers) related to a hypothetical participation in the NutriQu√©bec study. The
      participants will also be questioned about their preferences regarding the recruitment as
      well as their concerns about the security, use and share of data. The focus groups will be
      recorded and transcribed. Two coders will perform the codification independently using NVivo
      10.
