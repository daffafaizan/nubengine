    
      This is a double-blind, randomized, multicenter, international study of ATB200/AT2221 in
      adult subjects with late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD) who have received enzyme replacement
      therapy with alglucosidase alfa (ie, ERT-experienced) or who have never received ERT (ie, ERT
      naïve) compared with alglucosidase alfa/placebo.

      The study will consist of a screening period up to 30 days, a 12-month treatment period, and
      a 30 day safety follow-up period. Subjects who complete this study will have the option to
      participate in an open label extension study to receive ATB200/AT2221 under a separate
      protocol.

      Enzyme replacement therapy-experienced subjects will continue to take alglucosidase alfa
      during the screening period; treatment with alglucosidase alfa will then be replaced by study
      drug (ATB200/AT2221 or alglucosidase alfa/placebo) on the same schedule without interruption
      (ie, every 2 weeks).

      Infusion visits will be scheduled every 2 weeks throughout the study; assessments (eg,
      clinical laboratory tests) for initial safety monitoring will be performed at these visits
      for the first 6 weeks of the study. Study visits that include efficacy, safety, and other
      assessments will be scheduled approximately every 3 months and may occur over 2 days,
      provided all study assessments and procedures (with the exception of pharmacokinetic [PK]
      sample collection) are performed before administration of study drug.

      Efficacy assessments (ie, functional assessments) include evaluation of ambulatory function
      (6MWT), motor function tests (Gait, Stair, Gower, and Chair maneuver [GSGC] test and Timed Up
      and Go [TUG] test), muscle strength (manual muscle testing and quantitative muscle testing),
      and pulmonary function tests (forced vital capacity [FVC], slow vital capacity [SVC], maximal
      inspiratory pressure [MIP], maximal expiratory pressure [MEP], and sniff nasal inspiratory
      pressure [SNIP]). Patient reported outcomes (Rasch-built Pompe-specific Activity [R PAct]
      Scale, EuroQol 5 Dimensions 5 Levels Instrument [EQ-5D-5L], Patient-Reported Outcomes
      Measurement Information System [PROMIS®] instruments for physical function, fatigue, dyspnea,
      and upper extremity, and Subject's Global Impression of Change). The Physician's Global
      Impression of Change will also be performed.

      Pharmacodynamic assessments include measurement of biomarkers of muscle injury (creatine
      kinase [CK]) and disease substrate (urinary hexose tetrasaccharide [Hex4]). Blood samples
      will be collected for determination of total GAA protein levels and AT2221 concentrations in
      plasma for a population PK analysis. Safety assessments include monitoring of adverse events
      (AEs), including infusion associated reactions (IARs), clinical laboratory tests (chemistry,
      hematology, and urinalysis), vital signs, physical examinations including weight,
      electrocardiograms (ECGs), and immunogenicity. Concomitant medications and nondrug therapies
      will also be recorded.
