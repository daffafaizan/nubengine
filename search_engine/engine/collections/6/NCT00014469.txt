        -  Determine the antileukemic potential of busulfan and melphalan prior to allogeneic bone
           marrow transplantation in patients with advanced or high-risk hematologic malignancy.

        -  Determine the incidence of transplantation-related morbidity and mortality in patients
           treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the incidence of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease in patients
           treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive cytoreductive chemotherapy comprising busulfan IV over 2 hours
      every 6 hours for a total of 16 doses on days -8 to -5 and melphalan IV over 30 minutes on
      days -4 to -2. Patients undergo T-cell replete allogeneic bone marrow transplantation on day
      0. For graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis, patients receive tacrolimus IV continuously or
      every 12 hours beginning on day -1 and continuing for 50 days to 6 months followed by a
      taper. Once oral medications are tolerated, patients switch to oral tacrolimus every 12
      hours. Patients also receive methotrexate IV on days 1, 3, 6, and 11.

      Patients are followed weekly through day 100, every 6 weeks for 3 months, every 3 months for
      1 year, and then every 3-6 months for 6 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 30 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.
