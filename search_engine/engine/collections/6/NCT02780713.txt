    
      A phase 1, open-label, single centre study to assess the pharmacokinetics, Safety and
      tolerability of different forms, formulations and doses of AZD9496 in healthy volunteers.
      This is a fixed sequence study with 5-sequential treatment periods. Each subject will receive
      5 single doses of AZD9496 in different forms, formulations and doses.

        -  Treatment period one will assess AZD9496 Variant A: 100mg.

        -  Treatment period two will assess AZD9496 Reference form: 100mg.

        -  Treatment period 3 will assess one of AZD9496 Variants, B, C or D: 100mg.

        -  Treatment period 4 will assess one of AZD9496 Variants, B, C or D: 100mg.

        -  Treatment period 5 will assess one of AZD9496 Variants A, B, C or D: *300mg. *Based on a
           review of pharmacokinetic and safety results from Treatment Periods 1, 3 and 4, a lower
           dose of 200 mg may be administered in Treatment Period 5.
