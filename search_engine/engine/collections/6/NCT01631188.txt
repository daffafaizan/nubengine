      from bypass. During minimally invasive port access valve surgery, it may not be possible to
      place the leads on the surface of the heart because of the limited surgical exposure. In this
      case, transvenous pacing is used. Minimally invasive port access surgery uses specially
      designed, FDA approved catheters for the procedure. We wish to review the effectiveness of
      being able to place the wires through the catheters and pace the patient.
