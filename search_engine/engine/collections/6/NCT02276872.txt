      tolerability, and PK of oral treprostinil administered 3 times daily (TID) or 4 times daily
      (QID), at the discretion of the Investigator, with food in pediatric PAH subjects aged 7 to
      17 years of age (1) transitioning from continuous IV/SC Remodulin, (2) transitioning from
      inhaled prostacyclin, or (3) as add-on to current PAH therapies in de novo prostacyclin
      subjects. Eligible subjects were assigned to a cohort based upon their background therapy.
      All subjects received oral treprostinil provided as 0.125, 0.25, 1, or 2.5 mg
      extended-release tablets. Subjects in Cohort 1 began the transition from IV/SC Remodulin in
      the hospital with a goal of complete transition to oral treprostinil within 5 days. The
      initial dose of oral treprostinil for Cohort 1 was calculated from the subject's dose of
      IV/SC Remodulin and weight. Subjects in Cohorts 2 and 3 were initiated on 0.125 mg TID or QID
      oral treprostinil with dose escalations possible every 24 hours in increments of 0.125 mg TID
      or QID at the discretion of the Investigator during the first 4 weeks, and in increments of
      either 0.125 mg or 0.25 mg every 24 hours thereafter. Cross titration occurred for Cohorts 1
      and 2 such that doses of IV/SC Remodulin or inhaled prostacyclin were decreased as subjects
      were fully transitioned to oral treprostinil.
