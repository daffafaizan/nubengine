tissue distribution of electrolytes, ca and mg in experimentalhyper- and hypoparathyroidism.the effects of experimental hyper- andhypoparathyroidism on plasma and tissuedistribution of electrolytes and tissueexchangeability with ca and mg were studiedin dogs following acute renal pedicleligation.  in hyperparathyroidism, plasma concentrationsof mg and inorganic p aswell as ca were increased.  a greater accumulationof ca occurred in some tissuesand a lesser accumulation in others thanin acute hypercalcemia of comparableseverity and the fractional rate of exchangeof tissue ca was 30% more rapid thanin control and acute hypercalcemic dogs.bone exchange of ca was not significantlyincreased.  cell mg concentrations werenot appreciably altered by hyperparathyroidismexcept for a significant 9% decreasein myocardium, but the fractional rateof exchange of tissue mg was increased.acidsoluble p concentrations were decreasedin 3 tissues and na and c1 concentrationswere decreased by 10 to 25% in 4 tissues.in hypoparathyroidism, in addition to adecreased plasma ca, the incrementin plasma inorganic p that usually occursafter renal pedicle ligation was 75% lessthan in control dogs.  cell ca concentrationswere decreased by 10-40% but thefractional rate of exchange of tissue ca wasunaltered.  although cell mg concentrationswere unaltered a 40% increase occurredin the exchangeability of skeletal musclemg.  tissue na and c1 concentrations weredecreased by 20% in 2 tissues.  it has beenpreviously reported that hypercalcemiaincreases cell ca concentrations by raisingthe extracellular ca concentration gradient.evidence has also been presented thathypercalcemia directly inhibits cellinflux of mg and na and cell efflux of k.with altered parathyroid activity, 2 typesof effects are observed: those which aredependent upon an abnormal extracellularca concentration and those which appear tobe due to intrinsic effects of parathormoneon cell cation transport.  the presentdata are compatible with the hypothesesthat parathormone stimulates bidirectionaltransport of cell ca and p, stimulatescell influx of mg and opposes the effects ofhypercalcemia on cell transport of univalent ions.
