    
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of in vivo exposure therapy on the
      functional brain activity of subjects with height phobia using a fear provocation paradigm.
      We expect differential activation of the fear circuitry in height phobics compared to
      non-phobic controls, and that successful behavioral therapy will normalize the heightened
      fear response in height phobia.
