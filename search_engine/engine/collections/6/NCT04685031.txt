      nitroglycerin ointment on the prevention of superficial phlebitis caused by cannulation.

      Background: Today, more than 80 to 90% of hospitalized patients receive intravenous treatment
      during their treatment, and more than 500 million peripheral venous catheters are placed
      annually, although cannulation provide numerous benefits in clinical setting, but because of
      its invasive feature, it can end in unpleasant outcomes such as phlebitis Method: This
      clinical trial was conducted on 110 patients admitted to the surgical ward, in three groups
      of clobetasol, nitroglycerin, and control. The data collection tools included demographic
      information, information about intravenous treatment and phlebitis measurement scale. In the
      intervention groups, after venipuncture, 1.5 cm (about 2 g) of ointment was applied in the
      distal part of the Angio catheter and the site was dressed with sterile gauze. In three time
      periods of 24, 48 and 72 hours from the time of venipuncture.
