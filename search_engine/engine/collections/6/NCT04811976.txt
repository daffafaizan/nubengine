      treatment of ACS. Unfortunately, postoperative in-stent restenosis (ISR) is still inevitable.
      The incidence of ISR is as high as 10%-20% at 3-6 months after PCI. And its prevention and
      treatment is very difficult clinical problems. So it is necessary to identify the potential
      risk factors to provide evidence for the prevention of ISR. Current research shows that
      anxiety and depression are related to the increased risk of major adverse cardiac events and
      mortality in patients with acute myocardial infarction. But there remains a relative paucity
      of evidence for the association between anxiety and depression and in-stent restenosis (ISR)
      .

      A retrospective cohort study was conducted in the first hospital of Qinhuangdao in 2015-2020.
      The patients who underwent coronary angiography 1 year after PCI in our hospital from January
      2015 to September 2020 were selected. Patients were divided into ISR and non-ISR groups
      depending on the follow-up coronary angiography results. Every 3 months until 12 months, the
      patients were consecutively recruited and followed up. Anxiety and depression were assessed
      using the Zung self-rating anxiety scale (SAS), self-rating depression scale (SDS) and
      psychosomatic symptom scale at each follow-up timepoint. Relative clinical information was
      recorded and analyzed. Logistic regression model was utilized for analyzing the association
      of depression and anxiety with the in-stent restenosis (ISR) after PCI.
