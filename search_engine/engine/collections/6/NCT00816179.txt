      mounted on the end) passed down the throat, through the stomach, and into the abdomen can
      quickly and accurately examine the organs and tissue of the abdomen and take biopsies if
      needed. We wish to determine if this endoscopic route is as fast and efficient as the
      laparoscopic route, which is the current standard of care.
