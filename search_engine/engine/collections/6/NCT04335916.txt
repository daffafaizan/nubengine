    
      Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is an extremely important therapeutic method in the treatment
      of certain psychiatric conditions. Its' effect has been demonstrated in many clinical trials,
      and the indications for the use of ECT are clearly defined. Thus, the absolute indications
      for the use of ECT are catatonia and malignant neuroleptic syndrome, while the relative
      indications for ECT are therapy-resistant schizophrenia, depression and chronic suicidality.
      When the lead psychiatrist sets an indication for the use of ECT, pre-ECT evaluation is
      conducted. Although the pre-evaluation aims to assess the psychophysical condition of the
      patient and to determine the potential risks and possible side effects of such therapy, no
      clear algorithm of procedures is specified. There is no data on clear guidelines for the
      necessary processing prior to the application of ECT, both at national levels and globally.
      The assessment recommendations, however, are very broad, and most of them are focused on the
      ethical issues of applying ECT. The standardized pre-ECT evaluation would provide physicians
      and patients a systematic and evidence-based risk assessment and presumption of adverse
      reaction profiles.
