      were included. They had a clinical indication for bilateral extraction of at least first
      maxillary premolars. Using a split mouth design, maxillary left and right sides were randomly
      divided into two groups. In group 1, LLLT was delivered at 10 points; 5 from buccal and 5
      from palatal aspects with a total dose of 8 Joule (J) per session that distributed as
      follows; 2 cervical, 1 middle, 2 apical. In group II, laser was applied from buccal side only
      at 5 points through the same order with a dose of 4 J per session. In both protocols,
      maxillary canines were irradiated with a gallium aluminum-arsenide diode laser in continuous
      mode with 635 nm, 100 mW, 25 J/cm2, 8 seconds/ point, 0.8 J/point. Both sides were distalized
      by a standard protocol with uniform 150 gm retraction force via a nickel-titanium closed coil
      spring. In both protocols, laser regimen was applied on days 0, 3, 7, and 14 in the 1st
      month, and thereafter on every 15th day until 6-month observation period of canine retraction
      phase. Amount and monthly rate of maxillary canine retraction and degree of anchorage loss
      were determined by direct intraoral and indirect 3D digital models measurements. Evaluations
      were undertaken immediately before initiating retraction (T0), after 4 weeks (T1), after 8
      weeks (T2), after 12 weeks (T3), after 16 weeks (T4), after 20 weeks (T5), and after 24 weeks
      (T6). Significance level was set at p < 0.05.
