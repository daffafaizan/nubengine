      juice) appears to reduce the amount of oxygen needed to complete moderate intensity walking
      in healthy, young individuals. Nitrate is known to be converted in the body to nitric oxide
      (NO), a substance which reduces blood pressure and may affect the energy-producing mechanisms
      inside muscle cells. Exercise tolerance and muscle function typically declines with age and
      nitrate supplementation therefore may help improve cardiovascular health and the ability to
      carry out low-intensity daily activities in aging populations. The purpose of this study is
      to see if healthy, elderly individuals benefit from beetroot juice intake similarly to the
      effects seen in young adults. If this is indeed the case, then it may suggest that dietary
      supplementation with a relatively cheap, widely available, and natural food product may
      improve the ability of healthy elderly individuals to undergo everyday tasks and ultimately
      improve their quality of life.
