    
      For this study inpatients and outpatients of the clinic for integrative medicine and
      naturopathy Bamberg, Germany, who had a routine gastroscopy and/or coloscopy with tissue
      biopsy or an endoscopy with confocal laser endomicroscopy and tissue biopsy were enclosed.

      These patients, who were examined during a routine diagnostics, should submit an extra
      morning stool sample up to two weeks before or after the gastroscopy and/or coloscopy to
      generate the data of the fecal biomarker mentioned above.

      On the basis of the biopsy samples generated through the routine examination we can determine
      the histology scores, Nancy Index and Riley Score. The determined scores, the data of the
      fecal biomarkers and the results of the confocal laser endomicroscopy as well as, if
      available, more clinical data such as the clinical activity index (CAI), the
      MAYO-Score/Disease Activity Index (DAI), the endoscopic Rachmilewitz-Index (REI) and the
      Questionnaire for inflammatory bowel disease (IBDQ) will be anonymised inserted into a SPSS
      data bank and will then be interpreted.

      For the adequate description of the collective data of gender, age, blood levels and
      medication will be gathered and added to the data bank anonymised.

      The calculated data will then be compared with the clinical evaluation of the patients with
      symptomatic irritable bowel syndrome, active inflammatory bowel diseases and patients with
      other gastrointestinal diseases.

      The aim of this study is to develop improved methods for non invasive diagnostics of
      gastrointestinal diseases.
