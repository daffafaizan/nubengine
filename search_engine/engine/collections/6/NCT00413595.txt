      will be investigated during different prophylactic therapeutic approaches. In this study the
      investigator will not be given any instructions on stroke and Fabry therapy.

      All patients with any etiology of stroke and a diagnosed Fabry disease submitted to the
      stroke unit of the participating centres which commit to work with the EUSI (European Stroke
      Initiative) recommendations for stroke management and diagnosis will be included into the
      study.
