        -  To assess the safety of nelfinavir mesylate in combination with bortezomib in patients
           with relapsed or progressive, advanced hematologic malignancies.

        -  To establish the phase II recommended dose of nelfinavir mesylate in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of nelfinavir mesylate.

      Patients receive oral nelfinavir mesylate twice daily on days 1-21 and bortezomib IV on days
      8, 11, 15, and 18 in course 1. Course 1 has a duration of 28 days. Beginning in course 2,
      patients receive oral nelfinavir mesylate twice daily on days 1-14 and bortezomib IV on days
      1, 4, 8, and 11. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 2 courses. Patients with responding
      disease may continue to receive nelfinavir mesylate and bortezomib for up to 4 additional
      courses.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 30 days.
