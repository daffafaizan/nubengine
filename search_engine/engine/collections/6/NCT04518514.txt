    
      The preanesthesia evaluation and risk assessment is conducted by an anesthesiologist prior to
      elective surgery. The physician assesses the patientÂ´s medical records and specifies the
      individual preoperative procedure in order to minimize the perioperative risks. The on-site
      meeting is often connected with extended travel time and during the COVID-19 pandemic also
      with an increased infection risk for the patient. This project was initiated to reduce time
      efforts on patient site and to reduce possible infection risks. The TAPE-software turns every
      patients home into a remote facility allowing the physician to conduct the preanesthesia
      evaluation over distance.
