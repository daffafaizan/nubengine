    
      A randomized, parallel, forced-titration design is being used to assess effects of TC-5619
      versus placebo on efficacy. A parallel group design allows the effects of TC-5619 to be
      clearly established, and the randomized nature of the design allows minimization of observer
      and subject bias. Because a forced dose up-titration design will be used, effects of
      individual doses will be preliminary, because the design confounds dose with time.

      The doses chosen (1mg, 5mg, and 25mg) reflect an appropriate range around the anticipated
      efficacious dose (3-10 mg), based upon preclinical extrapolations to the human, and upon the
      pro-cognitive effects of TC-5619 identified by CDR in the MRD study (Targacept Study
      TC-5619-238-CLP-002).

      All subjects will be tobacco non-users. It is possible that tobacco (nicotine) interferes
      with Î±7 NNR-mediated effects.
