      Intensive Care of the Intensive Medicine Service of the 12 de Octubre Universitarian
      Hospital. All adult patients admitted to the ICU with requirements for mechanical ventilation
      and in which the unit's pseudoanalgesia protocol is implemented and having signed your legal
      representative informed consent to participate in the study will be included. The Patients
      admitted to the ICU with predictable survival less than 48 hours; those who are not submitted
      to mechanical ventilation and those whose Legal representative refuses to sign the informed
      consent wouldn't participate.

      The patients will be randomized in two groups: Group A: Intervention group in which musical
      intervention will be applied between the first and the third day of mechanical ventilation.
      Group B: Control group with standard treatment without musical intervention.

      Live music will be applied every day of the week by professional musicians of the non-profit
      association Music in Vena (MeV) until mechanical ventilation is removed. There will be
      sessions of 30 minutes a day. The execution time will be from 13-13:30 hours, and the family
      will be allowed to participate. The type of music will be classical to be determined by
      musicians.

      The participants will be followed for the duration invasive mechanical ventilation.

      The Investigators of this project ensure that the principalities ethics for medical research
      in beings humans of the HELSINKI DECLARATION OF THE WORLD MEDICAL ASSOCIATION have been
      adapted. MUSICALCARE-ICU has been approved by the Ethics Committee of the 12 de Octubre
