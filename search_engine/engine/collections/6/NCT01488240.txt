      scars, there is a definite lack of appropriately powered, randomized controlled trials. Laser
      therapy can be quite expensive when compared to other treatment modalities for burn scars,
      and while promising, its true usefulness has yet to be conclusively demonstrated. For this
      reason, our research group is proposing the commencement of two randomized controlled trial
      pilot studies assessing the effects of pulsed dye laser (PDL) on burn scars. The objectives
      of this project will be to determine the effectiveness of pulsed dye laser therapy on burn
      scar vascularity, pliability, height and texture. It has been hypothesized that the PDL works
      on acute injury to decrease scar formation, and the fractional laser works on scar that is
      quiescent to promote remodelling. Therefore the investigators are proposing to study both
      acute injury and late burn scars. This project will compare the effects of each laser type,
      and will either help support or refute the assertion that laser therapy can be used to
      improve burn scars.

      Objectives:

      To determine the benefit of pulsed dye laser treatment in improving burn scar height,
      texture, vascularity and pliability in acute burn injury.
