      related risk factors like hypertension etc. falls and their risks are being underestimated by
      many physicians. Regardless of the high relevance of falls for the elderly as well as the
      Health Care System, risk of falling is only rarely being assessed. The reasons for this are
      manifold. Insufficient assessment of risk of falling are one of the reasons. Many registered
      doctors with their own practice do not use a standardized assessment of risk of falling that
      is quick and effective. Additionally, patients rarely report occurred falls to their
      physicians because they don't know the implications or are afraid of subsequently losing
      their independence.

      Physicians already assessing their senior patients' risk of falling lack the possibility to
      assign them to according ambulatory interventions since these scarcely exist in Bavaria.
      Chances for improvement are: standardized assessment of risk of falling needed to uncover
      senior patients' risk of falling quickly, reliably and efficiently at their family
      physician's. At the same time area-wide programs to effectively reduce falls by targeting
      individual behavior as well as general conditions must be provided to maintain the
      independence of individual senior citizens.
