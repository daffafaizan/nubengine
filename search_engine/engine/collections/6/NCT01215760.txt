      overlapping cortical areas on adjacent as a result of the absence of stimuli in the area of
      cortical representation of the injured nerve. Sensibility reeducation is a process of
      reprogramming the brain through a progressive learning proposing feed the somatosensory
      cortex with alternative stimulus to preserve the cortical map of the hand and facilitate the
      sensory recovery. This study is based on the hypothesis that sensory reeducation starting in
      the first days after surgery by training with the mirror promotes greater preservation of the
      cortical map of the original hand, with better functional results. We also believe that
      sensory reeducation performed early with the mirror will enhance the return of sensibility,
      emphasizing functional reorganization with less alteration of the cortical map of the hand.
      Metodology: Will be included patients over 18 with injury of the median and/or ulnar nerve at
      the first week after surgery. Patients will be randomized into an early group with the use of
      mirror and a classic group of sensory reeducation. In evaluating the Rosen score will be used
      with motor, sensory and pain/discomfort components. The assessment instruments used were:
      Semmes Weinstein monofilaments, Jamar® and Pinch Gauge® dynamometer, goniometry, shape and
      texture identification (STI), Sollerman test, Disabilities of the arm, shoulder and hand
      questionnaire (DASH), two points discriminator and numeric pain scale.
