      autoimmune because the immune system is targeting itself. Currently doctors are not able to
      identify patients at higher risk of developing such autoimmune toxicities and nor are doctors
      able to identify patients more likely to respond to such treatment. Markers in the immune
      system have already been identified which are associated with naturally occurring autoimmune
      diseases. In this study the investigators will examine immune cells from patients with
      advanced malignant melanoma receiving immunotherapy treatment with Pembrolizumab to see if
      similar immune system markers can be identified and if such markers may be related to the
      development of autoimmune side effects or response to treatment. This would enable better
      selection of patients for treatment with immunotherapy.
