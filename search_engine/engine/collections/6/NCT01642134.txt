      is an option with proven benefit definitively for treatment of severe symptomatic aortic
      stenosis in patients considered unsuitable for conventional open heart surgery.

      By avoiding the hemodynamic effects, cardiovascular and cerebral microembolic load of
      cardiopulmonary bypass circulation, it is assumed that the TAVI procedure is beneficial
      despite the risk of neurological complications. Currently antithrombotic therapy after the
      procedure is not standardized. International treatment guidelines recommends that
      post-operative patients with a conventional surgical aortic bioprosthesis maintain oral
      anticoagulation for 3 months after the procedure, unless otherwise noted for its
      continuation. Whereas some studies have postulated that in patients with aortic
      bioprostheses, dual antiplatelet therapy is as effective to prevent major cardiac and
      cerebrovascular events as oral anticoagulation, with a lower incidence of bleeding
      complications at 3 months of treatment, the investigators formulated the following
      hypothesis:

      â€¢ There is a lower incidence of major cardiac and cerebrovascular events in patients with
      dual antiplatelet therapy compared to patients with oral anticoagulation for 3 months after
      implantation of an aortic bioprosthesis TAVI procedure.
