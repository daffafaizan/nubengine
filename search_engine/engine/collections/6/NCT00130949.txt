      1000 annually and tends to involve the subject's dominant side. It typically results from
      repetitive arm movement with over use of muscles leading to small tears in the tendons
      attaching muscles of the forearm to the epicondyles that may progress to tendonitis. Pain on
      or around the lateral epicondyle may radiate down the subject's arm. Gripping or extending
      the wrist often intensifies the pain.

      More than 40 possible treatments have been proposed, reflecting a lack of consensus about
      optimal management. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly used to treat
      tennis elbow, but there are no trials to date that have compared them with other painkillers
      and one study found no clinically important benefit over placebo. Use of corticosteroid
      injections provides mixed results in relief of pain and at times insufficient evidence to
      support their use. Although complications associated with steroid injection are relatively
      uncommon, when a complication does occur, it can result in severe and disabling consequences
      for the subject. A small proportion of subjects fail to respond to only one injection of
      corticosteroid and some subjects who initially improved at four weeks had worse symptoms by
      six months.

      This study has been designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a single soft tissue
      injection of ALGRX 4975 at a dose of 100 Âµg in comparison to placebo in subjects with acute
      LE.
