    
      Paliperidone palmitate is an aqueous suspension that releases paliperidone gradually over a
      period of about 1 month and is under development to provide a sustained and stable level of
      paliperidone. This is a randomized (patients will be assigned to different treatment groups
      based solely on chance), double-blind (neither the patient nor the physician will know if
      placebo or drug is being given and at what dose), placebo-controlled, multicenter study in
      patients with schizophrenia. The study consists of a screening period (maximum 5 days,
      including a 3-day washout of psychotropic medications other than antidepressants, if
      applicable); a 7-day, open-label, oral run-in period; and a 64-day double-blind treatment
      period. The total duration of the study is approximately 11 weeks. Efficacy will be evaluated
      during the study using the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale for Schizophrenia (PANSS) and
      the Clinical Global Impression - Severity (CGI-S) scale. Safety will be evaluated by
      monitoring adverse events and changes in clinical laboratory results, including prolactin
      levels; physical examination results; tardive dyskinesia will be rated using the Abnormal
      Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS), akathisia will be rated according to the Barnes Akathisia
      Rating Scale (BARS), extrapyramidal symptoms will be evaluated using the Simpson-Angus Rating
      Scale (SAS); electrocardiogram (ECG); vital sign measurements; and concomitant therapy. ER
      OROS paliperidone (6 or 12 mg) or IR paliperidone (2 or 4 mg) oral dosage administered daily
      for 7 days (Day -7 to -1), followed by i.m. injections of paliperidone palmitate (either 50
      mg eq. or 100 mg eq.), or placebo on Days 1, 8, and 36 of the study.
