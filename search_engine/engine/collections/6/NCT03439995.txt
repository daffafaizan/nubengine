      the time between brain death and organ procurement. The optimal mode of mechanical
      ventilation for deceased organ donors has not been definitively established. Since deceased
      organ donors may develop atelectasis leading to impaired oxygenation, an open lung protective
      ventilatory strategy with higher positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP), lower tidal volume
      and recruitment maneuvers has been hypothesized to be beneficial. Favorable outcomes were
      observed in a European clinical trial comparing open lung protective ventilation (OLPV) to a
      conventional ventilatory strategy in terms of donor oxygenation and lung utilization for
      transplantation (Mascia L et al, Journal of the American Medical Association 2010). However,
      donor management procedures in Europe are much shorter in duration compared to the US and it
      is not clear that these findings are generalizable to the US donor management environment.

      The GOLD trial will test the effect of an OLPV strategy compared to conventional ventilation
      (CV) in the US donor management environment. This multi center trial will enroll 400 brain
      dead organ donors randomized into 1 of 2 treatment arms. After randomization, mechanical
      ventilation will be protocolized according to treatment arm with one arm receiving control
      ventilation (CV) utilizing standard Donor Network West (DNW) protocols and the other arm
      receiving the OLPV strategy with higher positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) and lower
      tidal volume compared to CV. The primary outcomes is donor lung utilization for
      transplantation.
