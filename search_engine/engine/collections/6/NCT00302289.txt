      weight regain is observed in most studies that could indicate that most subjects are not able
      to change their eating habits. There is a need for simple and safe methods to prevent weight
      gain and re-gain i.e. by increasing thermogenesis and decrease spontaneous energy intake
      (EI). Studies have shown that nutritional and food-related non-nutritional factors influence
      the adjustment of EI and EE as the compounds can enhance the diet-induced thermogenesis (DIT)
      and suppress appetite.

      Method: The present study was designed as a 4-way crossover, randomised, placebo controlled,
      dou-ble-blind study. Each treatment was separated by >3 d washout period. All treatments were
      administered as tablets containing either 500 mg green tea extract (whereof 125 mg
      cate-chins), 400 mg tyrosine, 50 mg anhydrous caffeine, or placebo.

      on each test day body weight and composition was assessed. All participants underwent a 4.5-h
      assessment of energy expenditure by indirect calorimetry in a ventilated hood. Energy intake
      recorded of an ad libitum pasta salad brunch served after the last hood measurement

      Subjects: Twelve healthy lean (20<BMI<25) weight stable non-smoking subjects between 18-40
      years of age were tested 4 times each with a wash-out period of at least 3 days.
