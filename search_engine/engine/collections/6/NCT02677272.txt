    
      This is a retroprospective study conducted in sixteen hospitals in south-west of France.
      Inclusion will last one year, including 4 periods (one per season) of 7 days (24h / 24,
      including necessarily each day of the week). All the NH residents admitted in ED will be
      included. For each resident included, medical and non-medical data will be collected in 4
      times: retrospectively before transfer to ED (=T0); and prospectively : at ED (= T1), in
      hospital services in case the patient is hospitalized (=T2) and at the patient's return to NH
      (=T3).

      At T0 data collected will concern the NH and resident basis medical state, resident's medical
      state the week before transfer and resident medical state before transfer to ED.

      At T3 data collected will concern the resident's return modality and his/her autonomy 7 days
      after his/her return

      Time frame:

      between T1 and T3 : mean expected duration will variate from few hours if the resident isn't
      hospitalized (ED visit) to an average 12.4 days, which is the average length of hospital stay
      of NH resident hospitalized after a transfer to ED (cf Pleiad study, Rolland 2012) plus 7
      days as Investigators will collect T3's data 7 days after the NH resident's return to NH
