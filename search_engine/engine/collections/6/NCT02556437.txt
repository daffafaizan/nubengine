      immunoglobulin (IGIV), may be self-induced and may induce fewer systemic adverse reactions.
      Limited SC infusion volumes and reduced bioavailability, however, necessitate multiple
      infusion sites, more frequent treatment, and dose adjustment to achieve pharmacokinetic
      equivalence. This is an issue in particular in MMN where relatively high and frequent doses
      are necessary to maintain long-term improvement of muscle strength. Recombinant human
      hyaluronidase (rHuPH20) increases subcutaneous tissue permeability and facilitates dispersion
      and absorption, enabling subcutaneous administration of higher (monthly) doses of Ig. If
      treatment with HyQvia is at least equally effective and safe as compared with conventional Ig
      treatment, HyQvia could become the preferred treatment option for patients with MMN as it may
      have attractive benefits for patients by its mode of administration.
