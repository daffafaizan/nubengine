      amifostine and high dose cisplatin in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. II.
      Determine the response rate and survival of these patients treated with this regimen. III.
      Determine the tolerability of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation, multicenter study of docetaxel. Patients receive
      amifostine IV over 15 minutes, immediately followed by docetaxel IV over 1 hour, followed at
      hour 2 by amifostine as above, immediately followed by high dose cisplatin IV over 30
      minutes. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of patients receive escalating doses of docetaxel until the
      maximum tolerated dose is determined.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-30 patients will be accrued for this study.
