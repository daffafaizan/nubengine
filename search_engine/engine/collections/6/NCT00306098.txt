      not receive infliximab. Group B will receive, in addition to Daclizumab, Sirolimus, and
      Tacrolimus, a dose of infliximab and islets from a single donor, as per the Edmonton
      protocol. Everything else about the clinical trial will be the same for both groups. The
      first 4 patients will be assigned to Group A, the next 4 patients to Group B, the next 4
      patients to Group A, and the next 4 patients to Group B (total =16). Patients in Group A will
      receive 1-2 transplants with cells from 2 donors. If the second donor pancreas is received
      and satisfactory at the same time as the first pancreas, one islet infusion will be used to
      infuse cells from both donors. If the second pancreas is not received until after the first
      transplantation, a second islet infusion will be done. A second course of five doses of
      Daclizumab will be started on the day of the second islet infusion).

      In order to determine if prolonged administration of etanercept, in combination with
      transplantation of cultured islets, will prevent TNF-Î± production and enhance engraftment, we
      have added Group C to the current protocol. Group C, in addition to Daclizumab, Sirolimus,
      and Tacrolimus, will receive Etanercept in the peri-transplant period and islets from one or
      more donors. The last 24 patients included in this Protocol will be in Group C if they are
      new, or in Group A and B Supplemental Infusion if they had previous transplants. Any Group A
      or B participants who are eligible for a supplemental infusion will receive etanercept but no
      infliximab.
