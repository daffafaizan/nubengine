        -  Assess tumor gene expression information from women undergoing surgery for breast cancer
           or core biopsy sampling of the breast.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.

      Tumor tissue is collected and analyzed for tumor gene expression by DNA microarray analysis
      for research studies.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients will be accrued for this study.
