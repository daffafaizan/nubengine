    
      The aims of this study are to evaluate clinical and biological factors of patients with BMs
      after reconstruction with intramedullary fixation (IMN) or endoprosthetic reconstruction
      (EPR) with a specific focus on (1) the rate of complication or failure; (2) differences in
      complication rates by anatomic site; (3) functional results as assessed by the
      Musculoskeletal Tumor Society System (MSTS); (4) differences in complication rate between
      patients treated with INM versus EPR; and (5) differences in survival in patients with
      metastatic bone disease based on disease-specific, laboratory, and demographic information.
