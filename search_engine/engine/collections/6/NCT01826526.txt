      intestinal failure. It requires the presence of a central venous catheter to assure adequate
      venous access. Catheter Related BloodStream Infections (CRBSIs) are frequent. Most CRBSIs
      originate from contamination of the catheter hub and subsequent growth of microorganisms
      embedded within the biofilm that rapidly develops on the inner catheter surface. The best
      preventive measure against the development of CRBSIs is observation of strict hygiene
      guidelines when inserting and manipulating a central venous catheter and in addition to this
      the instillation of antimicrobial solutions like TauroSeptÂ® or saline solution 0.9% into the
      catheter lumen (antimicrobial lock). This measure is currently widely used in clinical
      practice.
