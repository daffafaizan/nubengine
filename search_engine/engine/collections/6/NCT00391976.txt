      CF and who fulfilled the criteria for early infection with P. aeruginosa initially received
      tobramycin 300 mg twice a day for 28 days. At the end of the 28-day treatment period,
      patients who met the inclusion criteria and none of the additional exclusion criteria were
      randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either receive an additional 28 days of treatment with
      tobramycin 300 mg twice a day (56-day group) or to stop study medication (28-day group).

      All randomized patients had regular study visits until a positive P. aeruginosa sample was
      obtained. Once P. aeruginosa had recurred, the patient entered a follow-up phase where
      minimal information was collected for 27 months. During the follow-up phase, patients were
      treated according to their physicians' discretion.

      Patients who started treatment with tobramycin but were not randomized (i.e. due to a
      positive antibody test) and followed up during routine clinic visits. They were allowed to
      continue their 28-day treatment period and afterwards be treated according to their
      physicians' discretion.
