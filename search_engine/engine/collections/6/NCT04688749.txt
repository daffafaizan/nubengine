    
      This is a clinical study designed to evaluate if the DermaSense device can be a system of an
      automated analysis and classification of skin lesions aiming to provide a comprehensive,
      reliable and cost-effective approach to assist the Dermatologists' decision (biopsy,
      dermoscopy, histopathological analysis etc). The study enrollment will continue until a
      minimum of 180 subjects are enrolled in the study. Second Department of Dermatology, School
      of Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, at the
      "Papageorgiou" General Hospital will participate in this study. Dermatologists participating
      in the study will perform the patient and lesion assessment for biopsy as standard of care at
      the clinic.

      EIS (electrical impedance spectroscopy) measurements will be done once per participant
      recommended by the Dermatologist based on their clinical interest in various areas of the
      skin. Two sets of measurements will be performed for each participant, either at a nevus in
      contrast with a nearby clear patch of skin, or at a skin damage area (melanoma, basal cell
      carcinoma (BCC), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), etc) in contrast with a nearby clear patch of
      skin. Also, more repeated measurements may be needed to determine the validity of the
      measurement result. Evaluation and analysis of the measurement data will be done by the
      DermaSense team and will be used not only for applying appropriate statistical correlations
      compared to established dermatological diagnostic methods (eg dermÎ¿scopy, histopathological
      examinations, biopsies etc.) but also for training in artificial intelligence and machine
      learning methods. Finally, the participants will sign a consent form that is consistent with
      bioethical rules and according with EU GDPR regulation to protect their personal data.
