      contributes to limb amputation, and can cause painful symptoms which are difficult to treat.
      Application of a high intensity, DC electromagnetic field, as supplied by the investigational
      device the Magnetic Molecular Energizer (MME) has shown in a pilot study with participants
      having DPN in their feet, to have created significant improvement in painful symptoms and
      improved measures of neurologic function in 7 of 10 participants. This study will enroll
      participants and evaluate them at baseline with regard to pain levels, nerve function and
      quality of life. They will then be randomized to receive 120 hr exposure to either active MME
      procedure, or sham procedure. Following the 120 hrs the participants will then receive the
      same evaluation for pain level, nerve function and quality of life. These evaluations will be
      repeated a final time 6 months following. The participants will be blinded to whether they
      receive the active or sham procedure.

      The MME procedure consists of laying on a bed with the feet lying in the space between two
      large electromagnetic coils which, when activated, produce a DC magnetic field measuring 5000
      gauss. The participants will lay on the bed with feet in the magnetic field for 8 to 12 hours
      a day for 10 to 16 days in succession. Breaks are allowed, and no restraints are required.
      The procedure may be done at night so that participants may sleep.

      Pain assessment will be done by self assessment using rating with the Visual Analogue Scale.

      Neurologic function will be assessed with Cutaneous Perception Threshold testing using the
      Neurometer, a commercially available, FDA approved device.

      Quality of life assessment will be by the Neuropathy Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire.
