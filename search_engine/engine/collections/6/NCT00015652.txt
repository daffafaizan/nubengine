      HIV-uninfected patients with acute HCV infection, the presence of vigorous T-cell
      proliferative responses to HCV proteins is associated with normalization of serum
      transaminase levels and viral clearance. Furthermore, early results suggest IL-2 may improve
      transaminase levels in HCV/HIV patients. These observations provide the rationale for an
      immune-based therapeutic approach to HCV/HIV coinfection. This study explores the use of
      initial immunostimulatory therapy with IL-2 followed by the addition of antiviral therapy
      with PEG-IFN alfa-2b and RBV, as a possible synergistic approach to treatment.

      Patients receive IL-2 for 12 weeks followed by the addition of PEG-IFN alfa-2b and RBV at the
      Week 12 visit. Patients remain on IL-2, PEG-IFN alfa-2b, and RBV for an additional 48 weeks.
      At Week 60, all study treatment is permanently discontinued and patients continue to be
      evaluated through Week 84. Toxicity or intolerance is evaluated. Data is collected on
      biochemical and virologic responses.
