    
      Primary objective

      • To assess the impact of extended-release niacin (ER niacin) supplementation +
      antiretroviral therapy (ART) compared to ART alone on T-cell immune activation as defined by
      CD8CD38 percentage

      Secondary objectives

        -  To assess the change in total CD4 T-cell count after ER niacin administration

        -  To explore the effect of ER niacin on regulatory T-cells (Th-17/Treg) in blood and gut
           mucosa samples

        -  To explore the effect of ER niacin on cytokines and inflammatory markers such as INF-α,
           IL-1, IL-6, IL-17, D-dimers, usCRP and LPS

        -  To assess the influence of ER niacin on tryptophan (Trp) plasmatic levels

        -  To assess changes in cholesterol and triglycerides

        -  To explore ER niacin tolerance

        -  To evaluate the impact of ER niacin on quality of life (QoL), fatigue, depression, and
           neurocognitive scores

      Population: All participants will have an undetectable HIV viral load (< 50 copies/mL) for at
      least 3 months, current CD4 cell count of < 350 cells/µL and be receiving ART for at least
      the previous 12 months.
