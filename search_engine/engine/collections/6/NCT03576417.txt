    
      This open-label, randomized, controlled, multicenter phase III study will include 680
      patients who have been operated for their LA SCCHN and exhibiting extra capsular extension
      (ECE) and/or positive margins (high risk). Subjects will be randomized (1:1) to receive
      post-operative concomitant cisplatin-RT with or without nivolumab.

      The study is designed with the general objective of demonstrating that treatment with
      nivolumab in combination with 3 cycles of cisplatin during RT is more efficient and not more
      toxic than the SOC 3 cycles of cisplatin during RT.

      Stratification will be based on the P16 status (immunohistochemistry assay on surgical
      sample). Two classes: Oropharyngeal Cancer (OPC) p16 positive versus OPC p16 negative or not
      OPC.
