      of the soft caries, that can lead to a wide preparation and need of tooth pulpotomy if the
      caries reaches to the pulp chamber, even if the tooth is asymptomatic and shows no signs of
      pulpal inflammation (neither clinically nor radiographically). According to a number of
      recent evidence based researches, and only in selected cases, dentists were able to preserve
      the vitality of the pulp without complete removal of the caries present near the pulp
      chamber. A thin layer of caries near the pulp chamber is left, and a liner is placed
      (conservative treatment). The carious process is stopped when the tooth is sealed, and thus
      the tooth is saved without engaging with pulpotomy and wide preparation of the tooth. The
      purpose of this study is to evaluate the success rate of the conservative treatment of deep
      carious lesions versus the treatment provided today that includes complete removal of caries
      and probably includes pulpotomy and wide preparation of the tooth. The study also evaluates
      the cost-effectiveness of both methods of treatment of deep carious lesions.
