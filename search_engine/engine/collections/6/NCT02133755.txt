      syndrome and is there a differential benefit based on Body Mass Index (BMI, kg/m2).

      This study will use a single subject design where patients with PCOS will have regular
      clinical laboratory tests before and after treatment with bromocriptine. It is a pilot study
      comprised of 20 women with normal BMI (<25) and 40 women with BMI â‰¥27.

      Study data will be collected from participants during regularly scheduled clinic visits
      (enrolment) and 3 months later (follow-up). Standard care examinations, blood work and pelvic
      ultrasound will be performed and included as the study data.

      The main outcome of interest will be to evaluate the change in HOMA-IR (Homeostatic Model
      Assessment - Insulin Resistance) from baseline. It is calculated using a fasting glucose and
      insulin level. Additionally, to determine the magnitude of effect on HOMA-IR as a measure of
      insulin sensitivity in lean compared to obese women and the effect on insulin sensitivity in
      those with and without insulin resistance.

      Other measure of interest will be a change in glycated hemoglobin (A1C), serum androgens and
      pituitary hormone levels. No additional tests will be obtained above what is done in the
      course of usual assessment of patients with PCOS

      Change in HOMA-IR values will be calculated for each individual patient and tested using a
      paired t-test to determine if therapy had a significant impact on HOMA-IR values. A
      multivariate linear regression will then be applied to determine if this change in HOMA-IR
      values was influenced by either BMI or baseline HOMA-IR value along with any other
      potentially confounding variables.
