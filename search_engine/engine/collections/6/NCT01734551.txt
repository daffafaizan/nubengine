    
      Withdrawal from drugs, called Neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS), is a group of symptoms that
      occurs to babies whose mother took or used drugs (prescription, addicting, illegal, pain
      pills, or drugs for addiction treatment) during pregnancy. Medicines the mother takes while
      pregnant, the baby also takes. Babies may experience withdrawal after delivery, and may need
      treatment. There are different ways to treat babies with withdrawal - about 50% of doctors
      use morphine, an opiate, to treat these babies, the rest uses other drugs, like clonidine and
      phenobarbitol.
