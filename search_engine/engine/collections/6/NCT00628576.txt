    
      Deep-venous thrombosis (DVT) remains a common clinical problem (annual incidence 0.10-0.16%)
      and long-term morbidity as chronic venous insufficience (CVI) in 10-30%.

      As to recurrent DVT, initial treatment with Low-Molecular-Weight Heparin ( to-day's
      terminology Fractionated Heparin (FH)) and Unfractionated Heparin (UFH) has shown equal
      efficiency, whereas the efficacy concerning long-term morbidity has only more recently been
      published.

      This study was initiated to compare the efficacy of UFH and FH concerning the incidence of
      CVI after symptomatic DVT at short-term and long-term follow-up.
