    
      Plain abdominal Xray, Ultrasonography and unenhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis will be
      performed at the time of admission to the imaging department, within 2 days from ED visit and
      within a 1 hour delay from each other.

      Ultrasonography will be interpretated in combination to plain abdominal Xray, and
      independently from unenhanced CT, by two experienced radiologists blinded to the results of
      each other.
