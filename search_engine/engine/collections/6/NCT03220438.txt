      Alterations in "long-term potentiation" (LTP), a basic mechanism underlying learning and
      memory, may explain this impairment. This project will assess fMRI visual plasticity, thought
      to reflect LTP, in participants with and without schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Previous
      studies have shown that visual plasticity is impaired in schizophrenia. The major goal is to
      determine if Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) enhances visual plasticity in
      schizophrenia. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) provides a non-invasive means for
      altering brain electrical neural activity. TMS sessions (sham/placebo and real TMS) will be
      conducted before two MRI scans with two weeks in-between to assess whether TMS stimulation to
      the visual cortex will enhance visual plasticity in patients with schizophrenia-spectrum
      disorders. This project may provide a better understanding of the underlying neurobiological
      mechanisms responsible for learning and memory deficits in schizophrenia.
