    
      rVA576, a small protein complement C5 inhibitor which prevents the cleavage of C5 by C5
      convertase into C5a and C5b, will be used in an open label, non-comparative clinical trial in
      patients with PNH.

      Patients will be treated with rVA576 by daily subcutaneous injection in order to determine
      the safety and efficacy of the drug in these circumstances.

      If satisfactory control of the PNH is achieved, and at the discretion of the Principal
      Investigator (PI), patients will have the option of remaining on rVA576 and being entered
      into the long term follow-up study.
