      death among women in the United States. Despite advances in the diagnosis and treatment of
      breast cancer, one third of the women who develop the disease will die of the disease,
      accounting for approximately 46,300 deaths/year. While good primary therapies are available
      to treat early stage breast cancer, there is a substantial failure rate to these therapies in
      more advanced disease.

      Advances in the understanding of the immune response to cancer have lead to the genesis of
      immunotherapeutic approaches. Specifically, the development of anti-cancer vaccines holds
      promise as an adjuvant and preventive therapy for patients after both primary surgical and
      medical treatment for breast cancer, but who are at a high risk for recurrence. Patients with
      greater than four lymph nodes positive have an 87% chance of recurrence post standard
      surgical and medical therapies at 10 years. While patients with hormone receptor positive
      tumors have the option to undergo hormonal therapy, recurrence is especially high among
      estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor (ER/PR) negative patients. For these patients,
      currently there is no good treatment option after completion of primary therapy; close
      surveillance and watchful waiting is the standard.

      It is this population of patients that a vaccine strategy to induce cellular immunity would
      target. We propose to vaccinate these patients with an immunogenic peptide from the HER2/neu
      protein. If successful, this vaccine strategy could be utilized as an adjuvant to currently
      accepted first line therapy in future clinical trials.
