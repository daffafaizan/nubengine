      knowledge of their distribution in man is sparse and it is unknown whether alterations occur
      in type 2 diabetes. Twelve patients with type 2 diabetes and 12 age and BMI-matched healthy
      individuals underwent upper and lower double-balloon enteroscopy with mucosal biopsy
      retrieval from every ~30 cm of the small intestine and specific locations in the large
      intestine. The investigators evaluated the distribution of enteroendocrine cells (using IHC
      staining for their specific hormonal products) and evaluated mRNA expression of the
      corresponding genes along the entire intestinal tract in patients with type 2 diabetes and in
      healthy individuals.
