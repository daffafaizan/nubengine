      for reducing alcohol use through an 8-week randomized trial with 6-month follow-up. Our
      primary hypothesis is that either form of CBT will be more effective than standard treatment
      at increasing the percentage of days abstinent during treatment (8 weeks) and through the
      follow-up (6 months), assessed via Timeline FollowBack interviews.
