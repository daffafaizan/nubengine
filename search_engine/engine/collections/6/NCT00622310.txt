      (TDAT) and total daily energy expenditure (TDEE) are regulated in obese humans attempting to
      lose weight and maintain weight loss through exercise. Two exercise interventions will be
      compared; a structured aerobic exercise program and a walking program. exercise activity
      thermogenesis (EAT) will be verified, and non-exercise physical activity (NEAT), total daily
      activity thermogenesis (TDAT), and TDEE will be measured using state-of-the-art technologies.
      Subjects will be studied during a 6 month intervention period and then during a 6 month
      follow-up period. It is hypothesized that the walking program will have more favorable
      effects on TDAT and TDEE during both the intervention and follow-up periods. If the
      investigators hypotheses are correct, then data from the proposed study could be used to
      improve the effectiveness of exercise-based weight loss and weight loss maintenance programs.
