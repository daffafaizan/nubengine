      failure need supplemental oxygen and alleviation of an increased work of breathing. Patients
      with acute exacerbations of COPD have hypoxemia, hypercapnia and an elevated work of
      breathing due to increased airways obstruction and hyperinflation. Patient outcomes can be
      improved by aggressive bronchodilation and systemic corticosteroids, but methods that can
      augment spontaneous ventilation and decrease the work of breathing can help avoid intubation.
      High flow nasal cannula (HFNC) has been shown to be useful in patients with severe hypoxemic
      respiratory failure and those recently extubated from mechanical ventilation. HFNC provides
      warmed and humidified high flow (10-60L/min) by nasal cannula that allows precise titration
      of % inspired FiO2 in the air/oxygen blend. The AIRVO 2 device delivers warmed and humidified
      respiratory gases to spontaneously breathing patients using a humidifier and integrated flow
      generator. In this study, the air/ oxygen gas blend (20-35L/min) will be administered by the
      AIRVO 2 HNHF device to achieve an fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) > 90% at rest. A
      potential advantage of the AIRVO 2 HNHF device includes the ability of the device to deliver
      oxygen that has been warmed and humidified. Also, the high flow rates achieved with this
      device may reduce the work of breathing. This is an open-labeled pilot study of ten patients
      to determine the safety and feasibility of using the device in the management of patients
      with an acute exacerbation of COPD with acute on chronic respiratory failure.
