    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

        -  To explore the expansion patterns of KIR+CD56+ T-cells and FcRg-CD56+CD3- NK cells in
           response to viral infection and reactivation in pediatric allogeneic hematopoietic stem
           cell transplant (HSCT) patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        -  To describe the phenotype of KIR+CD56+ T-cells and FcRg-CD56+CD3- NK cells in pediatric
           allogeneic HSCT patients and healthy donors.

        -  To describe the specificity and functional capacity of KIR+CD56+ T-cells against viral
           antigens in both pediatric allogeneic HSCT patients and healthy donors.

        -  To describe the functional capacity of FcRg-CD56+CD3- NK cells against CMV-infected
           cells in both pediatric allogeneic HSCT patients and healthy donors.
