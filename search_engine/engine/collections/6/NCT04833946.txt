      OA disease progression in OA patients with moderate to severe knee OA.

      Hydroalcoholic extract of Andrographis paniculata (standardized for 50% bioactive
      andrographolides). It has been evaluated in clinical studies for its anti-inflammatory and
      anti-oxidant activities. Although the potential cartilage regenerative mechanism of
      Andrographis paniculata is unknown, Sponsor believe that Andrographis paniculata may have an
      effect on increasing the expression of collagen type II protein and also mitigate the
      migration of inflammatory cells or angiogenesis. In the present study, knee morphometrics
      (joint space narrowing of tibiofemoral joint, and cartilage thickness at the femur, tibia and
      patella compartments), cartilage turnover (serum COMP levels), bone turnover (serum Bone
      specific alkaline phosphatase) along with symptomatic relief (Using mWOMAC) in patients with
      primary knee OA over a period of 336 days will be evaluated.
