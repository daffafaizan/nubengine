      recruited.

      Methodology: A prospective correlation study between clinical examination and
      electrophysiology assessment. This project will perform carefully with a definitive chronic
      low back pain (LBP). Firstly, we will compare the surface EMG features from patients with LBP
      to normal data. In addition, the changes in electrophysiology assessment will be compared
      with clinical assessment by Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS). This allows us to verify the
      potential clinical application of surface EMG features in physiotherapy progress assessment.
