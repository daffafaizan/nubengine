      their symptoms. We use a qualitative methodology. Our study categorizes lived experiences,
      recorded in semistructured interview transcripts. We use psychodynamic and semiopragmatic
      analyses of the discourse to obtain hypotheses about possible reasons of the delay in the
      help-seeking process."
