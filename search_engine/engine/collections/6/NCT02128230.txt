      the proportion of subjects in complete remission by reducing host-imposed toxicity and
      facilitating timely completion of highly synergistic 8-drug combination therapy, including
      the next generation proteasome inhibitor, Carfilzomib. This will result in avoiding multiple
      myeloma re-growth that, we postulate, ensued in Total therapy 3 during recovery phases from
      severe de-conditioning. It is speculated that the incidence of positive minimal residual
      disease will be reduced with the addition of one cycle of consolidation therapy. The
      following approach will be implemented:

        -  apply a 4-day fractionated lower dose melphalan (80 mg/m2) together with CFZ-TD-PACE
           regimen in MEL80-CFZ-TD (carfilzomib, thalidomide, dexamethasone) PACE as a hopefully
           less toxic and more effective transplant regimen

        -  interspersed with 1 cycle of non-transplant supported MEL-20-CFZ-TD (carfilzomib,
           thalidomide, dexamethasone) PACE (in lower doses than with transplant) inter-therapy
           (reduced from two cycles due to prolonged thrombocytopenia)

        -  followed by CFZ-TD (carfilzomib, thalidomide, dexamethasone) PACE consolidation therapy
           post transplant #2

        -  CFZ-RD (carfilzomib, lenalidomide and dexamethasone) maintenance for 1 year followed by
           CFZ-D for an additional year
