      subjects will receive DymistaÂ® or Flixonase Aqua in one nostril each.

      Nasal tissue samples will be obtained from 24 patients. Subjects will be selected based on
      the subjects plan to undergo septoplasty, septorhinoplasty, or functional endoscopic sinus
      surgery. Subjects with different diagnoses can be added in the study: non-allergic rhinitis,
      allergic rhinits, chronic sinusitis and nasal polyposis. The number of subjects is based on a
      previous experiment where the presence of fluticasone propionate was tested on human nasal
      mucosal surface and in human nasal tissue after nasal application (Bonsmann, 2001).
