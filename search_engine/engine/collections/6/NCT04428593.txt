      volunteers were enrolled in 1 center. The study consisted of 4 periods: screening, single
      administration, multiple administration and follow-up.

      All eligible subjects were randomized into the study in appropriate cohort groups
      sequentially. Cohort 1 - Treamid or Placebo 5 mg once and then daily 14 days after a 6-day
      break; Cohort 2 - Treamid or Placebo 15 mg once and then daily during 14 days after a 6-day
      break; Cohort 3 - Treamid or Placebo 50 mg once and then daily during 14 days after a 6-day
      break. The decision regarding increasing of the study drug dose for a subsequent cohort was
      made by the Data Safety Monitoring Committee on the basis of preliminary safety results
      assessment. A total of 16 volunteers received Treamid (4 - 5 mg, 4 -15 mg, 8 - 50 mg) and a
      total of 4 volunteers received the placebo during the study participation. The follow-up
      period lasted for 4 weeks.
