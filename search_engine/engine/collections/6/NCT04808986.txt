    
      Primary endpoint

      - Estimation of the prevalence of healthcare professionals with IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2
      in each of the four study populations (general practitioners, paediatricians, healthcare
      professionals practising in community pharmacies and dental practices).

      Secondary endpoint

        -  Comparison of the estimated prevalence of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 between each
           healthcare professional population and the general population (EpiCOV and SAPRIS-SERO
           studies);

        -  Comparison of the estimated prevalence of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 between the four
           healthcare worker populations studied;

        -  Estimation of the prevalence of household contacts of healthcare workers with IgG
           antibodies to SARS-CoV-2;

        -  Estimation of the prevalence of neutralising antibodies to SARS-CoV-2;

        -  Estimating the prevalence of vaccine-acquired antibodies among health workers and their
           household contacts;

        -  Measurement of the association between SARS-CoV-2 IgG seropositivity and the
           characteristics (socio-demographic data, implementation of hygiene measures,
           professional practices, etc.) of the health professionals participating in the study;

        -  Measure of association between SARS-CoV-2 IgG seropositivity and characteristics
           (socio-demographics, adherence to hygiene measures, work practices, etc.) among members
           of health workers' households;

        -  Proportion of a- and paucisymptomatic forms in study participants;

        -  To retrospectively describe the symptoms reported by health workers and their household
           members with a biologically confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19.

      Target populations First phase The target populations are all four of the following
      healthcare professional populations: general practitioners, paediatricians, healthcare
      professionals practising in city pharmacies (pharmacists and dispensing chemists) and in
      dental practices (dental surgeons and dental assistants) who are self-employed in
      metropolitan France at the time of their inclusion in the study (planned for January 2021)
      The source populations are general practitioners, paediatricians, health professionals
      practising in city pharmacies (pharmacists and dispensing chemists) and in dental practices
      (dental surgeons and dental assistants) who are self-employed in metropolitan France, and who
      are affiliated to the following four health professional networks at the time of their
      inclusion in the study: Sentinelles, AFPA, IQVIA, and ReCOL networks.

      Second phase Household members of primary care health professionals The target population is
      all the members of the households of the following four populations of healthcare
      professionals: general practitioners, paediatricians, healthcare professionals practising in
      town pharmacies (pharmacists and dispensing chemists) and in dental practices (dental
      surgeons and dental assistants) who are self-employed in metropolitan France at the time of
      their inclusion in the study. The source population is made up of members of households of
      general practitioners, paediatricians, health professionals practising in city pharmacies
      (pharmacists and dispensing chemists) and in dental practices (dental surgeons and dental
      assistants) who are members of a network of health professionals listed below, and who are
      participating in phase 1 of the COVID-SeroPRIM study: Sentinelles, AFPA, IQVIA, and ReCOL
      networks.
