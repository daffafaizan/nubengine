    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of melphalan and
      fractionated total marrow irradiation (TMI) as conditioning regimen for autologous stem cell
      transplantation (ASCT) in patients with high-risk or treatment-insensitive multiple myeloma
      (MM). (Phase I) II. Evaluate the safety of the regimen at each dose level by assessing
      adverse events: type, frequency, severity, attribution, time course, duration.

      III. Evaluate the safety of the regimen at each dose level by assessing complication
      including: infection, delayed engraftment and secondary malignancy.

      IV. To assess complete response (CR) and minimal residual disease (MRD) rates at 100 days
      post ASCT in a phase II expanded cohort of patients treated at the MTD. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the predictive value of high risk features inclusive of fluorescent in situ
      hybridization (FISH), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), International Staging System (ISS) stage,
      gene expression profiling (GEP) for CR and minimal residual disease (MRD) for relapse free
      survival/progression free survival/overall survival (RFS/PFS/OS) after melphalan TMI
      (mel/TMI).

      II. To assess MRD by positron emission tomography (PET), next generation sequencing (NGS),
      and flow cytometry after mel/TMI, prior to maintenance and correlation with PFS and OS.

      III. To assess in a descriptive fashion PFS and OS following mel/TMI and ASCT. IV. Evaluate
      changes in fludeoxyglucose F-18 (FDG) PET pre and post TMI/melphalan.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assessment of bone marrow residual damage. II. Assessment of immune recovery dynamics.
      III. To conduct genetic profiling of myeloma cells. IV. Multimodal imaging for non-invasive
      assessment of treatment effect on bone and marrow.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of melphalan and TMI followed by a phase II
      study.

      MOBILIZATION AND APHERESIS: Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) over 2
      hours. Beginning 24 hours after cyclophosphamide administration, patients receive filgrastim
      subcutaneously (SC) or IV. Patients also undergo apheresis over 4 hours on day 10.

      CONDITIONING REGIMEN: Patients receive palifermin IV on days -8, to -6, undergo TMI on days
      -5 to -2, and receive melphalan IV over 30 minutes on day -1. Patients then undergo ASCT IV
      on day 0, receive palifermin IV on days 1-3, and receive filgrastim SC or IV on day 5.

      MAINTENANCE THERAPY: Beginning 30 days after ASCT, patients receive lenalidomide orally (PO)
      daily.
