      Randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of a Case Management programme for
      ED Frequent Users presenting risky alcohol use in the ED of a tertiary hospital in Barcelona.
      All patients between 18 and 65 years old that frequently attended Hospital Cl√≠nic of
      Barcelona emergency department during the previous year that reattend the ED during the
      recruitment period will be eligible to follow-up. Those of them presenting risky alcohol use
      according to AUDIT-C score will be randomized to either case management intervention or
      treatment as usual. Main outcomes will be the number of visits to the ED and proportion of
      risky drinkers measured by AUDIT-C at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months follow-up.

      Case management (CM) can be defined as a collaborative process of assessment, planning,
      facilitation, and advocacy for options and services to meet an individual's health needs
      through communication and available resources to promote quality cost-effective outcomes.
      Case managers identify appropriate providers and services for individual patients while
      simultaneously ensuring that available resources are being used in a timely and
      cost-effective manner. It is a model of continuous, integrated medical and psychosocial care,
      which is markedly different from the episodic and often fragmented care that occurs in the ED
      setting. Close partnerships with healthcare providers and community services resources are
      key factors of CM interventions, that should target patients with the greatest needs.
