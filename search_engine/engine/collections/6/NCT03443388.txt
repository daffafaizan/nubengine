      evaluate for consistent helmet deployment from a standing position. Part 2: up to 20 patients
      with drug resistant epilepsy who do not use existing head-protective devices will be enrolled
      and assigned to first enter "helmet" or "no helmet" groups. When assigned to the "helmet"
      group, patients will wear the helmet until deployment during a seizure or up to 3 months.
      Subjects will complete questionnaires about their seizures including any injuries sustained,
      post concussive symptom questionnaire, and the circumstances of inflation. Patients will
      return to site after helmet deployment. While assigned to the "no helmet" group, patients
      will complete the same questionnaires, except those relating to helmet inflation. We will
      compare circumstances, injuries, and post concussive scales in seizures resulting in falls
      occurring while the helmet was worn versus seizures resulting in falls occurring while the
      helmet was not being worn.
