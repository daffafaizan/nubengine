      mortality especially for patients with hematological diseases, and prompt initiation of
      antibiotic therapy is warranted for those who develop febrile neutropenia. As for initial
      therapeutic agents, beta-lactam antibiotics, i.e., third- or fourth-generation cephalosporins
      and carbapenems have been used frequently because of their strong and broad-spectrum of
      action. However, under these conditions, development of resistance mediated by a
      beta-lactamase is concerned, and there is a need for alternative non-beta-lactam antibiotics
      for this indication. Ciprofloxacin is a potent agent covering against wide range of strains
      including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and expected as a potential candidate. We have therefore
      planned a prospective randomized controlled trial designed to compare intravenous
      ciprofloxacin with cefepime for febrile neutropenic patients.
