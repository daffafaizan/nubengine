      colporrhaphy. Although this technique has been successful in the anatomic correction of the
      defect, the functional outcomes have been disappointing. This fact suggests improvement in
      the functional and anatomic outcomes following a traditional posterior colporrhaphy.
      Consequently, the idea of incorporating graft material into the repair to augment the
      patient's own tissue has been examined. Placing a piece of graft material in between the
      vagina and rectum adds an extra layer of support and thus augments the strength of the
      repair. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the anatomic and functional outcomes of
      posterior compartment, graft-augmented traditional posterior colporrhaphy vs. traditional
      posterior colporrhaphy alone.
