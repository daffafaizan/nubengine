      PPCI patients have previously been investigated. It is possible to identify a subset of
      patients with very low risk for subsequent cardiac events in the short-term, where prolonged
      hospital stay beyond three days does not alter the outcome. Early discharge have however, not
      been included in STEMI management guidelines formally. The effects of this discharge regimen
      on STEMI patients' health status (symptoms, functional capacity and quality of life) is not
      previously investigated. Shorter hospital stays saves health care resources. On the other
      hand, short in-hospital stay can affect the perceived satisfaction of care. Initiation of
      medical treatment, patient education, life style counselling and follow-up routines may
      suffer. Additionally, early discharge can increase anxiety and symptom level reducing the
      health related quality of life (HRQOL) and also lead to readmission. Patient satisfaction has
      become a recognised measure of the quality of health care.Currently there is little
      information on how early discharge influence the patients' satisfaction with the health care
      or the subjective perceived of HRQOL after discharge. We therefore wish to perform a
      prospective trial comparing outcomes with regard to satisfaction of care and HRQOL in
      patients admitted for STEMI randomised to either early discharge or standard care.
