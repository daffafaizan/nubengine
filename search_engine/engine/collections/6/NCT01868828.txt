      inclusion and exclusion criteria.

      Treatment

      Eligible patients are randomly assigned to receive either treatment PAD or VCD. All eligible
      subjects will be evaluated after 4 cycles treatment. According to the assessment of
      researchers and the willingness of patients to decide whether to autologous stem-cell
      transplantation (ASCT). Suitable for transplant patients will accept hematopoietic stem cell
      transplantation. Not suitable for transplant patients will continue accept treatment for 8
      cycles. The patients who accept more than 4 cycles treatment will receive efficacy
      evaluation.

      Follow-up

      All patients will receive 12 months of follow-up after the treatment period. Follow-up at 4,
      6, 8 and 12 month after the treatment period respectively. Subjects who have disease
      progression or accept other resistance myeloma therapy during the 12 months of follow-up
      phase will stop assessed about the study and start followed up only for survival status every
      6 months through telephone interviews or to research center follow-up. All patients will
      accept the follow-up for survival until last case patient who complete follow-up.

      Safety will be evaluated throughout the study by assessment of adverse events (AEs), physical
      examination, vital signs and clinical laboratory findings.
