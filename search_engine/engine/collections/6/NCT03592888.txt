    
      This is a single arm open label trial that will assess the safety and tolerability of mature
      dendritic cell (mDC3/8) vaccine (primer and booster) in subjects with resected pancreatic
      adenocarcinoma.

      Eligible patients that provide written informed consent will undergo apheresis to collect
      blood mononuclear cells for vaccine production approximately 1 week prior to vaccine
      infusion. Each study subject will receive cyclophosphamide 300mg/m^2 intravenously 3 to 4
      days prior to the vaccine dose to deplete regulatory T cells. For each vaccine dose, all
      subjects will receive autologous dendritic cells pulsed with mutant KRAS peptides
      corresponding to the subject's specific tumor mutation and human leukocyte antigen type. On
      Day 1, the subject will receive the primer vaccine dose; this will be followed by one booster
      vaccine dose approximately 8 weeks later. Peripheral blood will be taken weekly, and a second
      apheresis procedure will be performed at the end of study to monitor the immune response to
      the vaccine. Information will be gathered from usual clinic visits for approximately 1 year
      following the End of Treatment Study Visit to evaluate for disease recurrence.
