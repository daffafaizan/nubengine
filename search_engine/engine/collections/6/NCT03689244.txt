      subjects will undergo a right heart catheterization (RHC) (and left heart catheterization
      LHC, if needed) with measurement of pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) at Week 20 and will
      constitute the hemodynamic cohort; the remaining participants will constitute the
      non-hemodynamic cohort; who do not require a post-baseline hemodynamic assessment. They will
      undergo the same overall study assessments as the hemodynamic cohort excepted for RHC at Week
      20.
