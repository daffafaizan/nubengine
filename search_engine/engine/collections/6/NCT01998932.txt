    
      Forty patients with chronic venous ulceration of the lower limb who meet the inclusion
      criteria will be entered into the study and assessed over a twenty week period with
      assessments at week 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12 and 20. Urine, serum and ulcer fluid will be sampled.

      If the ulcer has not healed, further assessments using an approved biological dressing will
      be undertaken at weeks 20, 21, 22, 23, 25 and 28 with further sampling of ulcer fluid, urine
      and serum.

      Samples will undergo metabolic profiling using established metabonomic techniques developed
      at Imperial College.
