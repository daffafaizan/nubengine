      diseases. However, post operative complications such as dislocations, osteolysis, component
      wear and migration are still a concern. It has been noted in the scientific literature that
      precise acetabular cup position helps reduce such post operative complications. The Pelvic
      Alignment Level (PAL) offers this solution by assessing pelvic motion and optimizing implant
      position without the need for intra-operative fluoroscopy or a large capital expenditure. The
      focus of this study is to evaluate the clinical outcomes (acetabular cup placement, femoral
      offset, and leg length) of using the PAL instrument to those without using PAL instrument
      during total hip replacement. This will be a prospective, post market, randomized
      multi-center clinical study.
