    
      Duavee® which is the combination of the selective estrogen receptor modulator bazedoxifene
      and conjugated estrogen 0.45 mg) is an FDA approved drug for treatment of hot-flashes and
      prevention of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. The investigators recently reported the
      results of a single arm pilot study suggesting that 6 months of Duavee® was associated with
      improvement in several risk biomarkers including benign breast tissue proliferation,
      mammographic fibroglandular volume, IGF-1, SHBG and progesterone in high risk women in late
      menopause transition. Prior to opening a randomized Phase IIB trial of 6 months of Duavee® vs
      placebo in high risk women with hot-flashes followed by open label Duavee®, the intent of
      this study is to assess probable uptake of such a trial design with a pilot of 6 months of
      Duavee® vs wait-list control in symptomatic women. Additional imaging biomarker information
      from MRI will be obtained. A finding on MRI of greater background parenchymal enhancement
      (BPE) in high risk women is positively associated with higher probability of developing
      breast cancer and is independent of fibroglandular volume. BPE is reduced by selective
      estrogen receptor modulators including tamoxifen. The investigators will investigate change
      in MRI BPE over time for women randomly assigned to either receive Duavee® or not (wait-list
      control). The investigators will also explore development of fully automated breast MRI
      volumetric density measures.
