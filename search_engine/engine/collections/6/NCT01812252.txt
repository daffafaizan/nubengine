      I. To determine the effect of induction chemotherapy (IC) (intensive acute myeloid leukemia
      [AML]-like therapy), versus less intensive hypomethylating agents (HMA) as initial therapy,
      on failure-free survival.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine if IC (intensive AML-like therapy) in comparison to HMA as initial therapy, will
      affect transplantation frequency and quality of life.

      II. Conduct exploratory analysis of post-HCT outcomes (overall survival, and relapse).

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive decitabine or azacitidine intravenously (IV) or subcutaneously (SC)
      for 7 days. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 4 cycles of decitabine or 6 cycles of
      azacitidine in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM B: Patients receive induction-like chemotherapy per standard of care or per experimental
      protocol. This study does not require a specific chemotherapy regimen for Arm B.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 18 months.
