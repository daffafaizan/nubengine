      ((18)F-N-fluoroacetyl-N-(2,5-dimethoxybenzyl)-2-phenoxyaniline), to assess microglial
      activation in MSA subjects in response to treatment with verdiperstat.16 [F-18]PBR06 is an
      arlyoxyanilide-based, second generation TSPO PET ligand that has been demonstrated to have
      >90% specific binding to their TSPO target in monkey brain.11 It has already been used in
      humans in dosimetry studies17 and for studies assessing its pharmacokinetic and imaging
      characteristics in humans16 but has never before been used in MSA subjects until our previous
      study, IRB protocol #2016P002373. This study will provide a unique opportunity to assess the
      utility of a novel TSPO PET ligand that has a longer radioisotope half life (approximately,
      110 minutes) and hence, has the potential for widespread use depending upon the results of
      this study. Assessing clinical response in chronic neurodegenerative diseases can be
      challenging and objective biomarkers are urgently needed. This study would provide pilot data
      to inform future potential studies using [F-18]PBR06-PET for assessing prognostication,
      treatment response and drug development for MSA subjects.The investigators intend to recruit
      MSA patients, one subset for whom the investigators know the longitudinal trajectory of
      microglial activation changes because of prior participation in IRB protocol # 2016P002373.
      This will allow us to compare the effects of verdiperstat (BHV-3241) in a well characterized
      population with each patient serving as his/her own control. To be clear, patients who were
      not a part of the IRB protocol #2016P002373 will also be offered the study.

      The investigators intend to recruit MSA patients in whom the longitudinal trajectory of
      microglial activation changes has already been determined in IRB protocol # 2016P002373. This
      will allow us to compare the effects of verdiperstat (BHV-3241) in a well characterized
      population with each patient serving as his/her own control. However, patients who were not a
      part of the IRB protocol #2016P002373 will also be offered the study.

      The investigators will recruit 8 MSA subjects with previously completed [F-18]PBR06 PET
      imaging (for protocol #2016P002373) to participate in the study.

      The investigators intend to include patients with probable MSA as defined by the following
      criteria:

        -  Autonomic failure involving urinary incontinence (inability to control the release of
           urine form the bladder, with erectile dysfunction in males) or an orthostatic decrease
           of blood pressure within 3 min of standing by at least 30 mmHg systolic or 15 mm Hg
           diastolic and

        -  Poorly levodopa-responsive Parkinsonism (bradykinesia with rigidity, tremor, or postural
           instability) or

        -  A cerebellar syndrome (gait ataxia with cerebellar dysarthria, limb ataxia, or
           cerebellar oculomotor dysfunction) Subjects will be recruited during routine clinical
           appointments by their physician or one of the other co-investigators listed on the
           protocol at the Movement Disorders Clinic, 60 Fenwood Road, Boston, MA. All established
           MSA patients of the Movement Disorders Clinic will be sent a letter describing the study
           and a copy of the consent form.
