color test for the measurement of antibody to t-strain mycoplasmas.a metabolic inhibition technique for the measurementof antibody to t-strain mycoplasmas was developed,based upon the ability of t-strain mycoplasmas tometabolize urea with the concomitant production of ammonia,and the ability of specific, antiserum to inhibitthis ammonia production.  phenol red added to themedium served as an indicator of ph change resultingfrom ammonia production.  specific antiserum to t-strainmycoplasma t-960 was prepared.  the t-strainorganism was shown to be serologically distinct from therecognized large-colony mycoplasmas.  antibody tomycoplasma strain t-960 in human sera was demonstratedwith the metabolic inhibition technique.
