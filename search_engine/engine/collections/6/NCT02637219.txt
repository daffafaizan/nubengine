      inflammation. This study sought to determine whether systemic cytokine responses to microbial
      pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) are increased among subjects with severe COPD.

      In an observational cross-sectional study of COPD subjects, PAMP-induced cytokine responses
      were measured in whole blood ex vivo. We used PAMPs derived from microbial products
      recognized by TLR 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. Patterns of cytokine response to PAMPs were
      assessed using hierarchical clustering. One-sided t-tests were used to compare PAMP-induced
      cytokine levels in blood from patients with and without severe COPD, and for subjects with
      and without chronic bronchitis.
