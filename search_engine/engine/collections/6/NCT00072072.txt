      Primary

        -  Determine the biologically active dose of celecoxib administered with erlotinib in
           patients with stage IIIB or IV non-small cell lung cancer.

        -  Determine the toxicity profile of this regimen in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the clinical activity of this regimen, in terms of reduction in tumor burden,
           in these patients.

        -  Correlate biological endpoints with cyclooxygenase-2 and epidermal growth factor
           receptor inhibition in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, dose-escalation study of celecoxib.

      Patients receive oral erlotinib once daily and oral celecoxib twice daily on days 1-28.
      Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients with stable or responding disease may continue treatment
      beyond 2 courses at the investigator's discretion.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of celecoxib until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) and biologically active dose (BAD) are determined. The MTD is defined as the dose
      preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity (DLT).
      The BAD is defined as the maximum decrease in the level of PGE_2 where no DLT occurs.

      Patients are followed every 2 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 21-27 patients will be accrued for this study.
