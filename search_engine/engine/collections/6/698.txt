the effect of hydrochlorothiazide on water intakeand plasma osmolality in diabetes insipidus inthe rata fall in plasma osmolality accompanied the reduction of urine volume inrats with hypothalamic diabetes insipidus, given hydrochlorothiazide and anotherwise normal diet.  the plasma concentration was not reduced with ahigh sodium intake, although urine volume still fell.  normal rats and hypo-thalamic obese rats increased their water turnover after hydrochlorothiazide,yet their plasma concentration fell.  moreover the antidiuretic response tovasopressin, which is purely renal, was also accompanied by plasma dilution;although it is self-evident that rats which drink less are less thirsty, thereduction in thirst after hydrochlorothiazide may not be a direct result of thechange in plasma osmolality.as previously shown in patients (kennedy and hill, 1963) a high sodiumintake increased free water clearance in diabetes insipidus but did notinterfere with the reduction of polyuria by hydrochlorothiazide, whereas a highpotassium intake reduced free water clearance and prevented any effect of thedrug on urine volume.
