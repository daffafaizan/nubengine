      2015).according to IDF a further increase to 642million diagnosed individual by2040(Ogurtsova
      et al 2017).the major cause of morbidity and mortality in DM is macrovascular
      complications.75% of diabetic patients die of cardiovascular disease(CVD)( Ridker et
      al2017).Platelets are one of blood cells 1,5-3um in size and survive 8-10days ,their function
      extended beyond homestasis and thrombosis to be an active participant in intiating and
      sustaining vascular inflammation as well as in prothrombotic complications of CVD(Festa et
      al2002).platelets are hyperactive in diabetic patients ,the coagulation cascade is
      dysfunctional ,platelet inT2DM adhere to vascular endothelium and aggregate more readily than
      those in healthy people(Pretorius2011)*.platelets are activated when they are in contact with
      damaged vascular endothelium , once activated they secrete awide spectrum of inflammatory
      mediators , once they are activated , they intiate reactions by changes in the level of
      expression of surface glycoproteins(GP)results , which act as receptors for platelet agonist
      and for adhesive proteins involved in platelet aggregation(Pretorius etal2015)**.platelet
      activity can be measured by flow cytometry ,as flow cytometry allows the simultaneous
      detection of surface antigens in a sensitive and specific manner , it is therefore possible
      to examine aspects of the platelet membrane activity . the available platelet markers
      areCD41a marker forGP2b ,CD42 a marker for GP1b.both are used for platelet identification.(
      Pretorius et al 2017)***.CD62 a marker for P-selectin ,anti-CD62 react with alpha granule
      membrane protein which is expressed on the surface of activated platelet.CD63 a marker for
      GP4 and anti-CD63 react with lysosomal granule-membrane glycoprotein that is expressed on
      surface of activated platelet. CD62andCD63 are markers of platelet activation (Ibrahim et al
      2017).knowing the major role of platelets in inflammatory and healing process in the vascular
      system especially in diabetic patients ,created the urgency to study the impact of platelet
      activity in diabetic patients whom has macrovascular risk using flowcytometry.
