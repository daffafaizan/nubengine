      morbidity and mortality. SSc manifests by fibrosis of skin and internal organs. Although the
      underlying mechanisms are still subject to investigation, endothelial dysfunction and
      abnormal immune response are thought to contribute to vascular dysfunction and fibrosis in
      SSc.

      Pulmonary involvement, such as pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and interstitial lung
      disease (ILD) is a major cause of death in SSc. Although the 6MWT is generally used for
      evaluating PAH and ILD, the utility in SSc is undetermined. Several investigators have found
      weak or moderate correlations of 6MWT in pulmonary involvement in SSc. The 6MWT is influenced
      by the status of all organ systems involved in exercise (pulmonary, cardiac, peripheral
      vascular, neuromuscular unit and muscle metabolism) as well as by specifics of test
      conditions. There is a pressing need for new, practical method which corroborates the current
      6MWT for the evaluation of pulmonary disease severity in SSc.

      Breath-holding test (BHT) is one of the most useful methods for assessing the sensitivity of
      peripheral chemoreflex. Recent studies have demonstrated that BHT was correlated to pulmonary
      function test. BHT can be safely conducted and doctors handle a medical emergency during test
      easily as well. Therefore, this study evaluates the utility of BHT as surrogate marker of
      pulmonary involvement in patients with SSc.
