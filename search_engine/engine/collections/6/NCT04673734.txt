      macromolecules in brain tissue, such as myelin and cellular/axonal membrane components.

      Multi-echo Susceptibility-Based imaging (SBI) provides quantitative susceptibility maps and
      T2* maps that - when combined - permit the disentanglement of myelin from iron and various
      phases of myelin degradation.

      Myelin Water Imaging (MWI) quantifies the water trapped between myelin layers by separating
      the multiple water components in T2 relaxometry data. In fact, the presence of myelin on
      water pools bound to it provokes a loss in magnetic resonance (MR)-signal coherence, which is
      more rapid than the one characterizing the water pools located within the axons or in the
      cytoplasm.

      A method based on a spiral acquisition that achieves a myelin-specific signal in clinically
      compatible scan times is currently applied: T1 relaxometry (quantitative T1, qT1) - which
      measures the time that a perturbed nuclear spin distribution needs to get back to equilibrium
      in the longitudinal plane- is sensitive to a number of components of the brain tissue such as
      myelin, axonal diameter and the overall architectural organization of the brain tissue.

      Finally, multi-shell diffusion allows the application of mathematical models of diffusion
      compartments, which in part are influenced by myelin integrity.

      The goal of this study is to assess the stability of these techniques in scan-rescan
      experiment on 20 healthy subjects.
