      for venous and arterial thromboembolic conditions. Warfarin is metabolized in the liver by
      the cytochrome P450 system, the cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP 2C9) isoenzyme specifically, and
      polymorphisms in the CYP 2C9 gene have been associated with changes in metabolic function of
      the translated isoenzyme . These polymorphisms result in reduced metabolism of warfarin as
      compared to subjects having the wild type gene, consequently leading to systemic accumulation
      of warfarin; it is theorized that this leads to higher risk of adverse events. Other allelic
      variations have also been linked to changes in vitamin K conservation through their effects
      on vitamin K epoxide reductase complex, subunit 1 (VKORC1) . The combined impact of CYP 2C9
      and VKORC1 polymorphisms on warfarin's pharmacology have recently been reported.

      It is hypothesized that evaluation of genomic allelic type guided warfarin dosing will reduce
      thromboembolic and bleeding risks associated with warfarin therapy, and that adoption of a
      genetic testing strategy in a primary patient care setting would improve warfarin
      effectiveness and patient safety, and reduce costs to health care payers.
