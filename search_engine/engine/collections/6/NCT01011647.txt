      criteria will include:

        -  Unstable angina

        -  Acute myocardial infarction

        -  Congestive heart failure Subjects enrolled in the study will be scored for sleep apnea
           using a novel approach designed by the sponsor. That score will not be used in the
           course of treatment. A follow-up call will determine whether the subject was identified
           for sleep disordered breathing during the hospital stay. A comparison will be done on
           the number of those identified with and without the use of the sleep scoring device.
