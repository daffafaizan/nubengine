      After the enrolment and consent of participation the patient receives a questionnaire
      consisting of different independent assessments. The visual analogue scale with values from 1
      to 10 quantifies subjective pain. A functional pain questionnaire (Pain-Out) is developed to
      assess the pain in between the last seven days, the associated limitations, the actions and
      side effects of combined pain therapy.

      To measure the generic health-related quality of life the patient is asked to answer the
      EuroQoL Group 5-Dimension 5-Level Self Report Questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L).

      A Virtual Reality application is offered immediately after the questionnaire has been
      completed. Following the application of VR the patient will receive VAS and functional pain
      questionnaires again to assess the change from baseline.

      Control phase:

      The following control phase is to review the effectiveness of VR application on the basis of
      two different control groups. In a randomized setting 30 patients with mamma carcinoma
      receive an application of VR before their radiotherapy. The second control group consists of
      40 patients with an individual indication of a colonoscopy.

      Instead of pain by VAS and QoL in the pilot phase each patient receives now the Hospital
      Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) before and after the application. The Functional Pain
      Questionnaire remains with the control group of patients with mamma carcinoma.
