      orbit, skull base, nasopharynx, and brain. Because of the close proximity of these targets to
      the eyes, the retina is often incidentally and unavoidably irradiated. As a result, some
      patients develop radiation retinopathy and possibly vision loss. Clinicopathologic studies
      suggest similar microvascular mechanisms for both radiation- and diabetic retinopathy: small
      vessel occlusion and ischemia that can lead to neovascularization, increased capillary
      permeability, and visual loss in the regions of retina perfused by damaged vasculature. UNC
      has a novel, non-invasive retinal imaging technology called a Retinal Oximeter which measures
      hemoglobin oxygen saturation of retinal vessels. The difference in oxygen saturation between
      a retinal arteriole and venule pair reflects the oxygen consumption of the retinal region
      supplied by that vessel pair.
