      patients receiving an implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD) for the primary prevention of
      sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) require appropriate ICD therapy within 5 years. The NIH-sponsored
      PAREPET study (Prediction of ARrhythmic Events with Positron Emission Tomography,
      ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01400334) identified four independent risk factors that predict SCA or
      ICD equivalent in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy. Using retrospectively defined
      cut-points, the absence of these risk factors identified 38% of the cohort with a very low
      risk of SCA (<1% per year). This rate is actually lower than the 1.5-2% annual rate of SCA
      among patients with coronary artery disease and mild left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, who
      are not considered candidates for a primary prevention ICD. This proposal will prospectively
      determine whether these risk factors can form the basis of a clinically applicable approach
      to identify a subgroup of patients who are candidates for an ICD, but are at low enough risk
      of SCA to have an ICD safely withheld. Our long-term goal is to develop better approaches to
      identify patients with coronary artery disease who are most likely to benefit from prevention
      of SCA with placement of an implantable defibrillator.
