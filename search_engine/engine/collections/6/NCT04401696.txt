      from parents of the participants, total of 120 neonates fulfilling inclusion and exclusion
      criteria will be enrolled and randomly allocated in two groups; group A and group B. All
      demographic details of participants in both groups be collected. In group A, neonates will be
      given bCPAP for respiratory support while neonates in group B, will be given nasal oxygen as
      control group. Neonates in both groups will be followed for 48 hours. The effectiveness will
      be determined by the reduction in Silverman Anderson Retraction Score (SARS) up to or less
      than 3, at the end of 48 hours. Data will be collected and analysed.
