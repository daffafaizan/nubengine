      compared with outpatient usual care. From a clinical point of view, the trial will allow to
      investigate how telemonitoring contributes to reduct the combined end point of all cause
      mortality and re-hospitalizations, as well as the other kinds of access to hospital
      facilities (bed-days, specialistic and ER visits). The trial will examine whether the CHF
      patients improve their health-related quality of life and reduct the anxiety about health
      conditions, thanks to the telemonitoring. A cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analysis will
      be carried out in order to determine if and how telemonitoring helps to limit the healthcare
      expenditure. The evaluation will deal also with organizational changes and task shift due to
      telemonitoring introduction and patients and professional perception towards the service.
