    
      This project is a prospective parallel-group randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled
      study in which 240 current smokers who are willing to completely switch from their regular
      cigarettes to an electronic cigarette (SREC) for 6 weeks will be randomly allocated to use a
      SREC containing either 15 or 0 mg/ml nicotine in the liquid. All participants will take part
      in a 1-week baseline period to assess normal smoking behavior prior to double-blind
      randomization.

      Following randomization to their assigned study product, participants will be supported in
      their switching efforts with regular contacts both in person at the Penn State Milton S.
      Hershey Medical Center and over the phone. The main measures will be recorded at two
      in-person visits after the randomization (switching) visit: (a) 3 weeks after switching and
      (b) 6 weeks after switching. All participants will also be followed up at 10 weeks by phone
      to identify whether they have continued to use electronic cigarettes or regular cigarettes
      and to assess their motivation to change.
