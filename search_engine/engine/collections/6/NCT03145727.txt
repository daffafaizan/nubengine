      Cyclophosphamide (AC) as a part of breast cancer treatment. All volunteers will be submitted
      a 30 minutes TENS prior to chemotherapy administration. Three different TENS treatment will
      be test: 1) placebo; 2) high frequency and 3) low frequency. The self-adhesive electrodes
      will be positioned in the same position for all different TENS treatment (opposite arm to the
      chemotherapy infusion). The eletctrodes will be positioned as follows: the first electrode at
      the PC6 point which is located proximal to the flexion fold of the wrist in the middle of the
      anterior face of the forearm, between the tendons of the long palmar and radial flexor
      muscles of the carpus and the second electrode at any point in the hand. After that, all
      volunteers will receipt a formulary to self-complete a nausea and vomit symptoms record
      during the next 24 hours. Number of incidence and magnitude of the symptoms will express the
      accumulated indices the occurrence and severity of the symptoms, as further describe in this
      protocol.
