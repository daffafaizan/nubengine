      PRBC(packed red blood cells) during their surgery it is proposed to:

        1. Evaluate evidence of differences in the standard of peri-operative transfusion care in
           different healthcare systems within Europe, and the use of blood conserving techniques.

             1. Evaluate the ratio of transfusion of PRBC to blood products in the operating room

             2. Evaluate which factors determine transfusion of PRBC (is it patient's haemodynamics
                / haemoglobin threshold/ pressure from the surgeon / acute brisk bleeding / else)
                and blood products (ratio to PRBC / POC (point of care) monitoring/ per protocol/
                else) in the operating room

        2. Evaluate whether there are factors in transfusion therapy that are associated with
           outcome (in-hospital mortality and unplanned admission to ICU(Intensive Care Unit).)
