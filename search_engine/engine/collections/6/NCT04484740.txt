      radical prostatectomy (RPE) or simple prostatectomy (PE) and patients undergoing
      tonsillectomy (TE). The individual time-points of gepotidacin administration will be chosen
      to ensure that the time-point of tissue removal corresponds with one of six different
      sampling time-points, as closely as possible.

      After study drug administration RPE or TE will be performed according to clinical routine.

      Subsequently, microdialysis (MD) probes will be inserted in the removed tissue (tonsillar or
      prostate tissue) ex-vivo and MD will be performed to determine unbound drug concentrations in
      the tissue.

      Plasma PK samples will be collected just before study drug administration and up to 48h after
      administration of gepotidacin.

      Since MD provides the concentration of the unbound fraction of gepotidacin, for comparison we
      will calculate the unbound fraction of the concentration values obtained through blood
      sampling. To this end, we will determine the protein binding using ultrafiltration for each
      subject at the time-point closest to the Cmax. The individual protein binding can then be
      used to calculate the unbound plasma fraction of gepotidacin. This will allow to transform
      the plasma PK data to the same scale as the microdialysis data.

      Samples will be analysed using non-compartmental analysis (NCA) for plasma concentrations and
      population pharmacokinetic models (PopPK) for tissue concentrations pooled with plasma
      concentrations.
