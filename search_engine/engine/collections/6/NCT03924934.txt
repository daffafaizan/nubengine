      be recruited. These index participants will be interviewed to determine the epidemiologic
      network, and will be mailed a monthly BioWipe kit to screen for ongoing HRE intestinal
      carriage. Contacts of the index participant will also be approached and mailed a BioWipe kit
      to screen for the presence of HRE and/or carbapenemase gene(s) that were present in the index
      patient. If this initial sample is negative, the contact is not further interviewed or
      tested. If the initial screening is positive for the carbapenemase gene of interest, then the
      contact will be asked to answer the same questions as the index patient and will receive a
      monthly BioWipe kit. For each positive contact, a second-generation network of contacts will
      be constructed, who in turn will be approached for screening.

      An additional subset of participants, those with CDC-defined HRE isolated during
      hospitalization who are not discharged home will also be included. All HRE isolates that are
      isolated from the patient as part of routine clinical care will be sub-cultured and shipped
      to the central research laboratory. A limited data set will be collected.
