      (COPD) and Heart Failure (HF), are two of the most common and disabling chronic diseases.
      Both COPD and HF account for significant disability, mortality, and healthcare costs and are
      associated with lower health status and more functional and social limitations than other
      chronic illnesses, such as hypertension and diabetes. As our population ages and life span
      increases, the numbers of patients with these conditions and the subsequent healthcare costs
      will increase dramatically.

      The symptoms associated with COPD and HF can significantly affect daily functioning. Physical
      symptoms are often linked to increased levels of psychological distress, namely, anxiety and
      depression, which significantly affect quality of life and functioning above and beyond the
      impact of the medical disease. As depression and anxiety are modifiable clinical factors,
      there is a potential to significantly alter patient outcomes, as well as use of healthcare
      services. However, focused interventions are needed, given the high risk for poor mental
      health treatment and underuse of mental health services in persons with COPD and HF.
      Unfortunately, few intervention studies have been conducted in medically ill patients with
      these conditions. The current project will examine whether existing VA clinicians in the
      primary care setting, with training and support, can effectively administer a structured
      Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) intervention for depressed and anxious Veterans with COPD
      and HF.
