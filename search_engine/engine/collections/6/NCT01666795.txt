      surface GPIIb/IIIa and GPIb/IX are the two most frequently targeted autoantigens. Our
      previous studies in animal models of ITP demonstrated that intravenous immunoglobulin G
      (IVIG) could protect against anti-GPIIb/IIIa-mediated thrombocytopenia but failed to
      ameliorate ITP induced by most anti-GPIb/IX antibodies. The objective of this human study was
      to evaluate the association between the specificity of anti-platelet autoantibodies and
      response to IVIG treatment.
