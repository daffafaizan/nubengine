      lines and tumor tissues. Another study observed that the elevation of VEGF promotes the
      growth. Clinical analyses have discovered the high expression of VEGF is correlated with
      tumor progression, vascular invasion, distal metastasis and poor prognosis. However, few
      studies have been conducted to investigate the VEGF signaling in ICC cells and its possible
      mechanism in regulating ICC growth.Therefore,we try to clarify the mechanism of VEGF signal
      in ICC growth,proliferation and apoptosis.
