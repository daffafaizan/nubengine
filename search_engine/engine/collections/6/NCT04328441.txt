      world, with on 27 February 2020 the first detected case in the Netherlands.

      According to the WHO, Health-care workers (HCW) face an elevated risk of exposure to - and
      infection of Covid-19.

      Bacillus Calmette-Gu√©rin (BCG) was developed as a vaccine against tuberculosis, but studies
      have shown its ability to induce potent protection against other infectious diseases: the so
      called non-specific effects (NSEs). A favorable in vitro or in vivo effect has been observed
      in studies for distinct viral pathogens, e.g. respiratory syncytial virus, yellow fever,
      herpes simplex virus; human papilloma virus.

      Based on the capacity of BCG to reduce the incidence of respiratory tract infections in
      children, to exert antiviral effects in experimental models; and to reduce viremia in an
      experimental human model of viral infection, the hypothesis is that BCG vaccination induces
      (partial) protection against susceptibility to and/or severity of Covid-19 infection. This
      study evaluates the efficacy of BCG to improve the clinical course of Covid-19 infection and
      to prevent absenteeism in order to safeguard continuous patient care.

      This randomized controlled trial has been designed as a pragmatic study with a highly
      feasible primary endpoint, which is unplanned absenteeism, that can be continuously measured
      on a bi-weekly basis). This allows for the most rapid identification of a beneficial outcome
      that would allow other HCWs to also benefit from the intervention if and as soon as it has
      been demonstrated to be effective.
