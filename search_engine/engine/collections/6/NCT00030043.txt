    
      Neurofibromatosis Type 2 (NF2) is characterized by multiple tumors of the cranial and spinal
      nerves, and, in particular, by bilateral acoustic tumors. Surgical resection of these tumors
      generally results in the transection of the VIIIth nerve, destruction of the cochlea and
      auditory nerve, and total hearing loss. Due to the loss of the auditory nerve, these patients
      are not candidates for cochlear implantation. The Auditory Brainstem Implant (ABI) provides
      the only available intervention to restore some auditory sensation to these patients. An ABI
      is an implantable prosthesis that produces sound sensation by electrical stimulation of the
      ascending auditory pathway at the level of the cochlear nucleus.

      The PABI may be placed surgically during tumor resection. Efficacy will be assessed using
      psychophysical and standard speech reception measures.
