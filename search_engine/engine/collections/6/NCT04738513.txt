      the most important aspects to ensure clinical success both in terms of esthetics and
      function. Dental preparation for fixed prostheses can take various forms classified as
      horizontal preparation with a defined margin (chamfer), or vertical, or without a
      margin/finish line. According to some clinical reports, vertical preparation technique
      provides an increases in the gingival thickness and a greater stability of the gingival
      margin. Moreover, vertical preparation is characterized by being more conservative with tooth
      structure. Also, taking impressions is easier since it is a finish area and not a defined
      line.

      Null hypothesis:

        1. There will be no difference between vertical and conventional preparations in the
           clinical behavior of zirconia crowns in dental esthetic zone at baseline,3,6,9,12 months
           evaluation.

        2. There will be no difference between vertical and conventional preparations in the
           patient satisfaction of zirconia crowns in dental esthetic zone at baseline,3,6,9,12
           months evaluation.
