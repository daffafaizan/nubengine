      patients with schizophrenia. However, up to 50% of patients treated with clozapine fail to
      respond and continue to exhibit clinically significant residual positive and negative
      symptoms and cognitive impairments. An emerging trend in treatment is the addition of a
      second antipsychotic drug. This study will determine if risperidone when given as adjunctive
      treatment is more effective than placebo in treating schizophrenic patients failing clozapine
      therapy.

      Participants are randomly assigned to add either adjunctive risperidone or placebo to their
      current clozapine treatment in a single, daily dose for 16 weeks. Positive and negative
      symptoms, cognitive impairments, side effects of the treatment, anxiety, depression,
      hostility symptoms, and quality of life are assessed. Neurological tests, self administered
      questionnaires, and interviews are used to assess patients.
