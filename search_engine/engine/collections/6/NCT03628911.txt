      life-threatening arrhythmias by delivering a defibrillation shock to allow restoration of
      cardiac rhythm. These defibrillation shocks are extremely painful, owing to sudden rapid
      contraction of thoracic and abdominal skeletal muscle, which, in addition to the heart, are
      stimulated by the defibrillation shock. Tetanizing Burst Therapy is a novel electrical
      waveform which tetanizes skeletal muscle with a brief burst of stimulation prior to the ICD
      shock, thereby reducing muscular contraction due to the shock. This study is designed for
      those patients who are already undergoing ICD replacement.
