      function, increase physical activity, and improve behavioral symptoms among long term care
      residents with ADRD and to effectively coach and mentor caregivers through a care practice,
      Function Focused Care for the Cognitively Impaired (FFC-CI), that focuses on having
      caregivers teach, cue, model, and assist cognitively impaired individuals to perform
      functional tasks and engage in physical activity, while minimizing behavioral symptoms. This
      study will determine if a revised intervention, Function Focused Care for the Cognitively
      Impaired: Hip Care at Home (aka, Hip Care at Home), can be implemented in a home setting.

      The Hip Care at Home intervention will include an initial evaluation of the hip fracture
      participant, caregiver, and home setting by an interdisciplinary care team including a
      physical therapist (PT), occupational therapist (OT), and a coach (nurse or nurse's aide)
      trained in the function focused care (FFC) approach. The FFC coach will then work with the
      primary informal (family or friend, unpaid) caregiver to integrate the recommended
      environmental, behavioral, and physical interventions into the home setting, with weekly
      visits.
