      implant. It reduces intra ocular pressure by draining aqueous from anterior chamber into
      sub-conjunctival space formed around base of the implant. Reduction of intraocular pressure
      prevents further damage to optic nerve and functional visual field loss in advanced
      refractory glaucoma.
