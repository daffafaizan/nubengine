      this study was to assess and compare the effectiveness of kinesio tape and auricular therapy
      to decrease pain and drug intake in women with primary dysmenorrhoea.

      A randomized controlled trial was conducted. 114 university women from 18 to 30 years old
      were randomized to 5 groups: control, kinesio tape, placebo kinesio tape, auricular therapy
      and placebo auricular therapy. The study was carried out during 4 menstrual cycles of
      pre-treatment phase, 4 menstrual cycles of treatment phase and two follow up phases (first
      and third cycle after the treatments were completed). During the treatment phase, the
      techniques were applied during 72h in each cycle.

      The primary outcome measures were: Mean pain intensity of the 3 first days of bleeding,
      maximum pain intensity, number of painful days and dose of drug intake measured with the
      Visual Analogue Scale.
