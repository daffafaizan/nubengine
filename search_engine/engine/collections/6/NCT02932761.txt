      environment, congestion at the site of the suture, immune cell infiltration, and other
      effects and may subsequently affect the healing of uterine scars. It is reasonable to
      hypothesize that delaying the postoperative menstrual recovery period may allow uterine scars
      to heal without the inflammatory reaction caused by menstruation. Treatment with
      gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) has the ability to suppress
      follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) release, thereby maintaining
      low estrogen levels and causing temporary amenorrhea. A prolonged menstrual recovery period
      may be achieved after GnRHa administration. Vaginal repair of CSD combined with GnRHa may
      improve the therapeutic effects of treatment of CSD. Therefore, the randomized study was
      designed to evaluate whether the application of GnRHa in combination with vaginal repair
      could achieve better clinical effects than those achieved by vaginal CSD repair alone.
