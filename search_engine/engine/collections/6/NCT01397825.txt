      have relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma or other aggressive B-cell
      lymphomas. This study looked at safety, any anti-tumor effect, and it also determined a
      recommended dose of alisertib plus rituximab and alisertib plus rituximab and vincristine to
      take into further studies. Pharmacokinetic blood samples were studied to characterize any
      effects on the concentration of each of the drugs when administered together .

      The study enrolled 45 patients. Participants received the following treatments:

      Phase 1

        -  Alisertib 50 mg + rituximab in the Safety Lead-in

        -  Alisertib 30 mg + rituximab + vincristine in the Dose Escalation

        -  Alisertib 40 mg + rituximab + vincristine in the Dose Escalation

        -  Alisertib 50 mg + rituximab + vincristine in the Dose Escalation

      All participants were asked to take one alisertib table twice a day for 7 days in each cycle
      for up to 8 cycles along with rituximab on Day 1 of each cycle; some patients also received
      vincristine on Day 1 and Day 8 of each cycle. All participants with documented disease
      response or stabilization could continue with alisertib single-agent therapy for an
      additional 2 years or more.

      This multi-center trial was conducted in the USA. The overall time to participate in this
      study was up to 5.2 years. Participants made multiple visits to the clinic, plus a final
      visit 30 days after receiving their last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.
