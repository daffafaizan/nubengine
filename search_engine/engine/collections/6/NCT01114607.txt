      volunteers to compare the relative bioavailability of 5 oral GSK1605786 formulations.
      Recruitment/screening will occur within approximately 30 days of the first scheduled dose of
      study medication. Each subject will participate in five dosing sessions - each dose will be
      separated by at least seven days. The total duration of a subject's participation in the
      study, from Screening to Follow-up, is approximately 10 weeks.

      All subjects will receive single 500mg doses of the following five GSK1605786 formulations:
      A. ChemoCentryx formulation of GSK1605786; 2 x 250mg capsules [Formulation A] B. GSK
      formulation of GSK1605786; 2 x 250mg capsules [Formulation B] C. GSK direct-fill formulation
      of GSK1605786; 2 x 250mg capsules [Formulation C] D. GSK modified formulation of GSK1605786;
      2 x 250mg capsules [Formulation D] E. GSK tablet formulation of GSK1605786; 500mg tablet
      [Formulation E]

      Formulations A and B will administered in periods 1 and 2 in a random order, and formulations
      C, D and E will be administered in periods 3, 4, and 5 in a random order.

      Subjects will check into the clinical research unit (CRU) 1 day prior to dosing (Day -1). The
      study medication will be administered in the morning of Day 1 with 240 mL of water 30 minutes
      after a standard breakfast (i.e., fed state). For each treatment period, subjects will stay
      in the CRU through the 48-hour PK sample on the morning of Day 3. Subjects may be released
      from the clinic on Day 3 (after all required study procedures are completed) and return to
      the CRU that evening and the next morning for collection of the 60- and 72-hour PK samples.

      Upon completion of the last dosing period or early withdrawal, subjects will return to the
      clinic approximately seven days after the last dose of study medication for a follow up visit
      and be subsequently discharged from the study.

      The study will be conducted at one center.
