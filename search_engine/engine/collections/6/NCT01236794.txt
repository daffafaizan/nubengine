      including depression and type 2 diabetes have emerged as critical public health conditions.
      Furthermore, Latinos experience a disproportionately greater burden of these obesity-related
      disorders. Therefore, we have developed a 12-week community-based lifestyle intervention that
      includes weekly education sessions for children and their parents and 3 exercise sessions per
      week for youth. The program will be delivered at a local YMCA in the greater Phoenix
      Metropolitan area.
