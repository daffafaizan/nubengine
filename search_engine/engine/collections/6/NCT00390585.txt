      risk of developing CIN in patients with elevated serum creatinine concentrations compared to
      low-osmolar contrast agents. However, no information is available about a potential
      protective effect of Iodixanol in patients with impaired renal function on CIN when used
      during PCI. Due to the high volume of contrast exposition, patients with impaired renal
      function are at increased risk for the development of CIN compared to patients with normal
      excretory renal function.

      The purpose of the investigation is to determine the changes of renal function in patients
      with impaired renal function receiving Iodixanol 320 or Iomeprol 350 for percutaneous
      coronary intervention.
