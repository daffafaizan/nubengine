      I. To estimate the 1-year progression-free survival probability rate in younger patients with
      low and low-intermediate IPI risk advanced stage diffuse large B-cell NHL treated with
      8-cycles of CHOP-rituximab. (The CHOP-rituximab arm of this study was permanently closed,
      effective 10/15/04.) II. To estimate the 1-year progression-free survival probability rate in
      younger patients with low and low-intermediate IPI risk advanced stage diffuse large B-cell
      NHL treated with 8 cycles of CHOP-rituximab-G3139.

      III. To evaluate response (complete, complete unconfirmed, and partial) and toxicity for
      these regimens in this patient population. (The CHOP-rituximab arm of this study was
      permanently closed, effective 10/15/04.) IV. To estimate the 1-year progression-free survival
      and response rate in the subset of patients overexpressing bcl-2 protein.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      age-adjusted International Prognostic Index (0 vs 1). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2
      treatment arms. (Arm I closed to accrual as of 9/21/04.)

      ARM I (closed to accrual as of 9/21/04): Patients receive rituximab IV over 6 hours,
      cyclophosphamide IV over 15-45 minutes, doxorubicin IV over 5-20 minutes, and vincristine IV
      over 5-15 minutes on day 1 and oral prednisone on days 1-5.

      ARM II: Patients receive oblimersen IV continuously on days 1-7; rituximab IV over 6 hours,
      cyclophosphamide IV over 15-45 minutes, doxorubicin IV over 5-20 minutes, and vincristine IV
      over 5-15 minutes on day 5; and oral prednisone on days 5-10.

      In both arms, treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 8 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 1 year, and then annually
      for up to 5 years.
