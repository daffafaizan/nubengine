      birth defects, large infants, and stillbirths. Maintaining blood sugars in the normal range
      decreases these pregnancy complications. Currently, insulin is the primary medication used to
      treat pregnant women with T2DM. However, it is administered by injection several times a day
      and compliance is low in health disparity populations with high rates of obesity and
      diabetes. Insulin also has the potential to lead to dangerously low blood sugars. Metformin
      is a medication than can be administered as pills and is not associated with dangerous low
      blood sugars. In addition, this insulin sensitizer is the medication of choice for women who
      are obese and have T2DM outside of pregnancy. We hypothesize that metformin will achieve
      similar levels of blood sugar control compared to insulin. In doing so, metformin will
      prevent the increased risk of pregnancy complications associated with T2DM in pregnancy. The
      aims of this study is to determine if in pregnant women with T2DM, metformin achieves similar
      glycemic control, and similar maternal and neonatal outcomes when compared to insulin. We
      propose a pilot study of a randomized, controlled trial of metformin versus insulin in the
      treatment of T2DM during pregnancy.
