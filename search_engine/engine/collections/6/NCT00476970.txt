      languages. Patients randomly assigned to the study intervention receive an introductory
      letter in their native language. During the initial contact the navigator educates patients
      about CRC screening and explores patients' barriers to CRC screening. Based on results from a
      qualitative study conducted at in 2006, we developed interventions to overcome individual
      barriers to CRC screening tailored to each individual patient. Specific interventions include
      elucidation of culturally-specific health beliefs; teaching about cancer risk, colonoscopy,
      and colon prep administration; and help with appointment-making and transport.
