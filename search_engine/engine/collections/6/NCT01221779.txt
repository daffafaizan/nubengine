      lifespan worldwide, the incidence and prevalence of patients with stroke will dramatically
      increase in the future. One of the most frequent and devastating conditions after stroke is
      aphasia, which affects language production and comprehension. High-frequent intensive
      speech-and-language therapy is currently the treatment of choice in chronic aphasia. However,
      despite its general effectiveness, treatment effect sizes are only low to moderate. Thus,
      there is a pressing need to explore novel training-adjuvant therapies to enhance treatment
      efficacy. Moreover, very little is known about the neurobiology of treatment-induced recovery
      in chronic aphasia. This is the prerequisite to improve existing and/or develop new treatment
      paradigms.

      Thus, in the present project we aim to assess whether the outcome of intensive language
      training can be enhanced by adjuvant non-invasive brain stimulation. We will be using anodal
      transcranial direct current stimulation (atDCS) that has previously been shown to enhance (a)
      language and motor learning in healthy subjects and (b) motor recovery in stroke patients.
      Specifically, in a longitudinal group comparison design, two matched groups of patients with
      chronic anomia will receive two weeks of intensive language training with or without atDCS.
      Treatment effects will be assessed immediately after the two week intervention period and
      several months after the end of the training. We will also use functional and structural
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to elucidate language network changes in the two groups.
