      endarterectomy is performed to protects patients with severe atherosclerotic carotid artery
      stenosis against stroke.

      Surgical Pleth Index (SPI) is reported to properly reflect nociception-antinociception
      balance in patients undergoing surgical procedures, where a value of 100 corresponds to a
      high stress level and a value of 0 to a low stress level; values near 50 or increase in value
      > delta 10 correspond to the stress level which is known to reflect requirement for rescue
      analgesia.

      A randomized interventional trial to evaluate the effects of SPI-guided rescue analgesia on
      hemodynamic stability during anesthesia in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy under
      cervical plexus block.
