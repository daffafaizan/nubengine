    
      The study is a prospective cohort study in 40 patients with Persistent AF. It will comprise
      two groups:

        1. Active Group (AI guided ablation): An initial pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) procedure
           will be performed guided by AI targets. All patients (regardless of AF recurrence) will
           undergo a repeat EP study at 8-10 weeks to identify and re-ablate site(s) of PV
           reconnection

        2. Historical control group (Contact Force Guided Ablation): will be formed by the 40
           patients enrolled to the repeat study arm of the PRESSURE study (ClinicalTrials.gov
           Identifier: NCT01942408). All 40 patients underwent contact force-guided PVI followed by
           a repeat EP study after 8-10 weeks.

      End-points

      Primary outcome measure:

      The proportion of patients with pulmonary vein (PV) reconnection seen at repeat EP study

      Secondary outcome measures:

        -  The proportion of reconnected PVs seen at repeat electrophysiology (EP) study

        -  The proportion of patients maintaining freedom from atrial tachyarrhythmia for 12 months
           (after an initial 12 week blanking period)

        -  QOL 6 and 12 months after initial ablation, as quantified by the validated atrial
           Fibrillation Effect on QualiTy-of-life (AFEQT) and EQ-5D-5Lquestionnaires.

        -  Rates of major complications occurring within 60 days after a PVI procedure, measured in
           composite numbers and percentage.
