    
      This is a randomized, prospective study involving 660 patients undergoing cesarean sections
      at Tampa General Hospital. The control group (n=330) will receive standard Telfa pad dressing
      and the treatment group (n=330) will receive the silver impregnated dressing.

      The primary objective is to compare the percentage of patients who develop a surgical site
      infection between the two groups at the 1-week and 6-weeks post operative visits. The
      secondary objective is to assess the cosmetic outcome of the cesarean incision observed at
      the 1-week and 6-week post-operative visits. A plastic surgery investigator will also conduct
      a blinded assessment of cosmetic outcome by review of photographs taken of the wounds at
      1-week and 6-weeks.The tertiary objective is to evaluate the amount of narcotic and non
      narcotic medicine consumed during the hospitalization and query the patient with regards to
      pain involving the cesarean wound at 1 and 6 week post-operative visits
