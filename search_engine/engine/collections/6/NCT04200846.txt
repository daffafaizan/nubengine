      treatments that can improve both patient-oriented outcomes and access to liver
      transplantation for end-stage liver disease patients. The specific objective of this proposal
      is to generate pilot feasibility data required for future multicenter R01 application to the
      National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) which will test the
      novel central hypothesis that exercise improves frailty and lessens waiting-list mortality.
      Additionally, another goal of the study is to establish an optimal frailty tool for liver
      transplant candidates.
