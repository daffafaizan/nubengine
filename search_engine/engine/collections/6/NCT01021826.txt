      prostheses. Diabetes increases the risk of infections. In other fields of surgery,
      hyperglycemia induced by surgical stress (stress/perioperative hyperglycemia) has been
      associated with higher rates of postoperative infections and complications. Such studies have
      not yet been performed in the field of joint replacement surgery. Unlike several other risk
      factors of infected joint replacements, hyperglycemia is potentially modifiable and therefore
      its prevalence, predisposing factors and association with postoperative infections are of
      interest.
