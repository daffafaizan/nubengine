    
      This trial is a first-in-human (FIH), open-label, multicenter trial to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, immunogenicity, and preliminary efficacy of
      GEN3009 in subjects with relapsed/refractory B-cell NHL (both aggressive and indolent
      subtypes).

      The trial will be conducted in 2 parts; Dose Escalation and Dose Expansion. In the Dose
      Escalation part, GEN3009 will be administered by intravenous (IV) infusions at various dose
      levels in 28-day cycles. Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) will be assessed during the first
      treatment cycle and the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) will be identified. Additional subjects
      will be treated in the Dose Expansion at the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D).
