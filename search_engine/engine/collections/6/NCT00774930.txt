    
      This study consisted of a Screening period, conducted up to 4 months before randomisation,
      followed by three phases: a 16-week, double blind (DB), randomised, placebo-controlled phase;
      a 32-week initial open label (IOL) phase; and a long term open label extension (LTOLE) phase.

      The DB phase evaluated lanreotide Autogel versus placebo in subjects with a history of
      carcinoid syndrome (flushing and/or diarrhoea). This was followed by a 32-week IOL phase in
      which all subjects received lanreotide Autogel 120 mg every 4 weeks. Subjects in countries
      where lanreotide Autogel had not been approved for the treatment of carcinoid syndrome, who
      were well-controlled at the end of the 32-week IOL phase and chose to continue to receive
      lanreotide Autogel, were given the option of participating in a LTOLE phase. The LTOLE phase
      of the study was planned to end at least 2 years after the last subject had completed his/her
      participation in the 32-week IOL phase or when marketing approval for the treatment of
      symptoms of carcinoid syndrome had been obtained in the respective countries (whichever
      occurred first) or at any time the study was terminated by the Sponsor. The actual overall
      duration of the study was 6.5 years. During the LTOLE phase all subjects continued to be
      treated with lanreotide Autogel 120 mg every 4 weeks.

      The study planned to enrol approximately 100 adult subjects worldwide. Screening continued
      until 115 subjects were enrolled in the study.
