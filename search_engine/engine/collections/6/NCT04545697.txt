      the recording with the PSC) will take place 7-60 days before the upcoming oncology
      consultation. PSC will provide a summary within a week of the consultation.

      Primary Objective:

      To determine the percentage of enrolled participants who use a clinician-prompted,
      patient-administered smartphone application to create an audio recording of an outpatient
      oncology visit.

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. To determine the percentage of enrolled participants who listen to the audio recording
           within 1 week after the visit.

        2. To determine the percentage of enrolled participants who request and receive a written
           summary of the consultation from the Patient Support Corps within 1 week after the
           visit.

        3. To determine whether audio recording and summarization change decision-making quality
           measures.

        4. To determine whether audio recording and summarization change provider-reported workload
           and other outcomes.

        5. To determine whether audio recording and summarization change the frequency of follow-up
           communication between participant and clinic staff.

      Participants will be followed via electronic medical record review for 2 weeks after
      consultation
