    
      HB-201 and HB-202 are 'vectors', modified viruses intended to train the body to recognize
      antigens found in HPV 16+ cancer.

      Phase I Dose Escalation will comprise two treatment groups evaluating HB-201 single vector
      therapy (Groups 1 and 2) and two treatment groups evaluating HB-201 & HB-202 two-vector
      therapy (Groups 3 and 4). Group 1 and Group 2 Phase I Dose Escalation will determine a safe
      recommended Phase II dose of HB-201 for intravenous (IV) and intratumoral treatment. Group 3
      and Group 4 Phase I Dose Escalation will determine a safe RP2D of HB-202 for IV treatment.
      Various doses of the investigational therapies (HB-201 and HB-202) and dosing schedules may
      be evaluated in separate groups of patients (cohorts) during Phase I Dose Escalation.

      Phase II Dose Expansion may have up to six treatment groups (Groups A to F) with HB-201 and
      HB-202 administered at the recommended Phase II doses and the dosing schedule determined
      during Phase I Dose Escalation. Potential groups will explore the following treatments:
      HB-201 single vector therapy; HB-201 & HB-202 two-vector therapy; HB-201 single vector
      therapy in combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor; and/or HB-201 & HB-202 two-vector
      in combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor.
