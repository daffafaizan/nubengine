      Theory of Planned Behavior, and Theories of Social Support found to be effective in weight
      loss, physical activity and dietary change, based on a recent meta-analysis and other
      studies. The investigators proposed development of STAR-MAMA will incorporate specific
      behavior change techniques associated with these theories, including: "self-regulatory"
      intervention techniques (specific goal setting, prompting self-monitoring, providing feedback
      on performance, goal review), self-efficacy building intervention techniques (motivational
      interviewing, using decisional balance and relapse prevention), individual tailoring
      techniques (information on content and resources), and culturally tailored social support,
      and which incorporates family needs.
