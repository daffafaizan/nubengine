      study drug. So the study is not a true 2-arm study, it is a 2-part study.

      In both parts, participants with pathologically documented unresectable advanced NSCLC and
      triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) who have been refractory to or relapsed from standard
      treatment or for which no standard treatment is available, will be enrolled. In Dose
      Expansion, additional indications (hormone receptor [HR]-positive human epidermal growth
      factor receptor 2 [HER2]-negative breast cancer, small cell lung cancer [SCLC], endometrial
      cancer, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, HER2-negative gastric/gastroesophageal junction [GEJ]
      cancer, esophageal cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma [HNSCC], transitional cell
      carcinoma of the urothelium, colorectal cancer [CRC], platinum-resistant ovarian cancer,
      platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer, cervical cancer, and castration-resistant prostate cancer
      [CRPC]) may be evaluated, if the study treatment demonstrates acceptable safety, tolerability
      and efficacy in NSCLC participants. After the primary analysis, the main (registered) study
      will be considered complete, but data will be collected from participants who continue
      receiving study drug.
