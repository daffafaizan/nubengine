      with singleton pregnancy undergoing elective cesarean delivery under spinal anesthesia.
      Immediately, after spinal anesthesia administration, patients will receive either 250 mL
      colloid over 5 minutes followed by 500 mL crystalloid over 55 minutes then 250 mL colloid
      over 60 minutes (Combination group) or 250 mL crystalloid over 5 minutes followed by 500 mL
      over 55 minutes then 250 mL over 60 minutes (Crystalloid group). The studied maternal
      outcomes will be the urine output, ephedrine requirement, incidence of hypotension, inferior
      vena cava diameters, nausea/vomiting and bradycardia. Neonatal Apgar scores will be recorded
      at 1 and 5 minutes post-delivery.
