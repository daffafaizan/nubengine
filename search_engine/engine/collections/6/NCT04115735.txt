      Bundle recording from the subclavian vein using a stylet driven pacemaker lead and
      commercially available sheath can be done in a quick and reliable manner. Included in the
      study are patients undergoing permanent pacemaker implantation at Good Samaritan and Bethesda
      North Hospitals. The main outcome is successful recording of a His bundle potential.
      Secondary outcomes are the time necessary to record the His bundle and the measurement of the
      pacing threshold.
