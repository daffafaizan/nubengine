    
      ART0380 is a new investigational medicinal product that is a potent and selective inhibitor
      of Ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR). ART0380 is being developed as an oral
      anti-cancer agent for the treatment of participants with cancers that harbor defects in
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair and in combination with agents including those that cause
      DNA damage.

      This study is an open-label Phase I/IIa study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability,
      PK and preliminary efficacy of ART0380 as monotherapy or in combination with gemcitabine in
      participants with advanced or metastatic solid tumors, advanced or solid tumors that fail to
      express Ataxia-Telangiectasia Mutated protein kinase (ATM) by immunohistochemistry, and high
      grade serous ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian tube carcinoma.
