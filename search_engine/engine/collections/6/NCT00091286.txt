        -  Determine whether vaccination comprising HER-2-neu and carcinoembryonic antigen
           synthetic peptides, sargramostim (GM-CSF), and Montanide ISA-51 causes an immune
           response in patients with stage IIB, III, or IV colorectal cancer.

        -  Determine the safety of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive vaccination comprising HER-2-neu and carcinoembryonic antigen
      synthetic peptides, sargramostim (GM-CSF), and Montanide ISA-51 on days 1, 8, and 15. On day
      22, patients undergo removal of the lymph node into which the vaccination site drains to
      determine whether the immune system is responding to the vaccine.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 15 patients will be accrued for this study.
