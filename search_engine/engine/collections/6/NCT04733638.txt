    
      To evaluate the performance of the Viz ICH VOLUME algorithm to:

        1. detect the presence of ICH on brain imaging,

        2. measure the volume of ICH on brain imaging,

        3. and to assess the algorithm processing time,

        4. and the difference in time to notification, time to treatment, and clinical outcomes in
           comparison to standard of care.
