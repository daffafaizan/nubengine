      (GT1, GT2, combined GT3 - 6), and HCV/HIV co-infection status (co-infected, not co-infected).
      In China, eligible participants were randomized to Arm A or Arm B (defined below) in the
      following ratios: 2:1 for GT1, 2:1 for GT2, and 2:1 for combined GT3-6. In South Korea and
      Singapore, eligible participants were randomized to Arm A or Arm B in the following ratios:
      2:1 for GT1 and 2:1 for GT2.

      All Primary and Secondary Outcome Measures were pre-specified to be analyzed only in Arm A.
