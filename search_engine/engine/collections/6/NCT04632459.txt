      Pembrolizumab in patients with metastatic gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma

      Planned Sample Size : A maximum of 35 patients will be recruited to this single-arm phase II
      trial. In this single-arm phase II trial, 33 people were calculated using Simon's two-stage
      design and a total of 35 patients will be recruited to account for a 5% dropout rate.

      The sample size is calculated by use of a two-stage minimax Simon's design to control the
      type I error at 2.5 % for null hypothesis that, for arm, the true response was 15 % or below
      and to have 90 % of power if the true response was 40 % or higher. 19 evaluable patients are
      to be treated in the first stage. If 3 or fewer response are observed in the first stage, the
      arm will be stopped. If at least 4 responses are observed in the first stage, 14 additional
      evaluable patients are to be entered onto the second stage. At the final analysis, the null
      hypothesis will be rejected if at least 9 responses are observed in 33 evaluable patients. RR
      is reported with its exact 95% CI.
