      the study. As part of the study patients will receive the standard of care capecitabine (825
      mg/mÂ² by mouth twice daily) and radiation. Patients will start on ganetespib (STA9090) at a
      set dose level.

      The treatment consists of two parts. In the first part patients will receive ganetespib at
      full dose twice a week through the vein for two weeks. At the end of two weeks, a biopsy of
      the tumor will be performed to evaluate the effect of the drug on the tumor. In the second
      phase, patients will receive capecitabine, radiation and ganetespib at a specified dose level
      for 5 to 6 weeks. After completion of this phase, patients will have surgery to remove the
      tumor. Each three patients will be treated at a specified dose level. Patients will be
      monitored at least once a week for side effects. If there are no side effects in three
      consecutive patients, then the investigators will treat the next three patients at a higher
      dose level.
