      compared with filiform needles, because press needle taken home and could be manipulated as
      needed at home, unlike filiform needle where an acupuncturist must be available to do the
      treatment. Furthermore, the press needle needed to be changed once within 5 days, that is 2-3
      times in week. So we hope to have better acupuncture option (in effectivity and timewise) for
      COVID healthcare workers anxiety treatment. There are no study to compare the usage of the
      two types of needles for anxiety treatment to date.
