      and emotional functioning, particularly in the pediatric population. While approximately 90%
      of children eventually recover from an episode of depression, up to 40% of those children
      relapse within 1 to 2 years. Data indicate that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) delivered
      after depressive symptoms subside can significantly reduce depression relapses in adults.
      However, there are no comparable studies in children or adolescents. This study will
      determine whether CBT is effective in reducing a relapse of depressive episodes in children
      and adolescents with major depression.

      This study comprises two phases. In Phase 1, all participants will receive drug treatment for
      12 weeks. Participants who respond to the treatment will complete the study after 12 weeks.
      Participants whose depression symptoms return after 12 weeks will be enrolled in Phase 2. In
      Phase 2, participants will be randomly assigned to either continue drug therapy alone or to
      receive drug therapy plus CBT for 6 months. The CBT will focus on teaching participants
      skills to manage depressed moods and to identify situations which might put them at risk for
      a relapse in depressive symptoms. Self-report scales will be used to assess the depressive
      symptoms of participants who complete Phases 1 and 2 at study entry and at the end of the
      study.
