      objective of this study is to gather additional data to evaluate the safety and long term
      effectiveness of focused ultrasound treatment, and to include a larger cohort of
      African-American patients. Patients will be treated following the approved commercial
      treatment guidelines.

      Uterine leiomyoma (fibroids) are the most common neoplasms of the female pelvis. These benign
      tumors are generally oval in shape, and often highly vascular. On T2 weighted MR imaging
      exams, or T1 exams with contrast, uterine fibroids are easily identifiable. They occur in
      20-25% of women of reproductive age and can cause a variety of problems generally described
      as either bleeding or mass effects from the fibroid. In general, these symptoms can be
      classified into two categories:

        1. heavy menstrual bleeding, defined as bleeding on heavy days requiring a change of
           sanitary wear every 2 hours or less, significant clot passage, flooding, substantial
           prolongation of menstrual periods compared with the patient's prior experience, or
           anemia.

        2. pelvic pain or pressure, heaviness or discomfort, or similar symptoms in the back, flank
           or leg attributable to the bulk of the fibroid, urinary frequency, increase in nocturia,
           difficulty voiding or compression of the ureters with hydronephrosis.

      Measures of the clinical success of patients who elect treatment of fibroids are generally
      subjective, and evaluated by the patient in terms of improvement in the initial symptoms that
      caused her to seek treatment (decrease in pain, bladder or bowel symptoms, or reduction in
      vaginal bleeding), while experiencing a minimum of co-morbidities from the treatment itself.
