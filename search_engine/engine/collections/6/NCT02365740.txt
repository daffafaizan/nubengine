    
      Diabetic patients with a delayed GE will be studied in 2 separate occasions in euglycemic
      condition and under CGM. On both occasions, they will have to take a standard meal poor of
      lipids (rice 60 g; yellow squash 200 g; extra virgin olive oil 7 g; adult veal lean cuts 90
      g; bananas 180 g; ordinary bread 75 g).

      On the first occasion pre-prandial insulin will be administered as single bolus calculated on
      the basis of carbohydrate counting and each patient's insulin/glycaemic load.

      On the second occasion the amount of pre-prandial insulin will be the same as the first one
      test but fractioned into a double-wave bolus. The "tailored" insulin bolus will be defined
      according to the individual pattern of GE, as follows:

        -  GE T1/2 121-180 min= 60% as bolus + 40% during following 2 h

        -  GE T1/2 >180 min= 40% as bolus + 60% during following 4 h Glycemic variability will be
           assessed by the means of Continuous Glucose Monitoring System and the following indexes
           of glucose variability will be calculated: number of hypoglycemic events, number of
           hyperglycemic events, standard deviation of glycemia, glycemia variation coefficient,
           mean range of daily glycemia, interquartile range, M value, mean amplitude of glycemic
           excursions (MAGE), low blood glucose index (LBGI), high blood glucose index (HBGI).
