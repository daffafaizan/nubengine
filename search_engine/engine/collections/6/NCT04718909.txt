    
      This is an open-label, multicenter, randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of regorafenib plus sintilimab compared with regorafenib alone as the second-line
      treatment for unresectable HCC.

      180 patients with unresectable HCC who progress after sorafenib or lenvatinib treatment or
      are intolerant to these drugs will be enrolled in the study. The Patients will be treated
      with regorafenib plus sintilimab or regorafenib alone using an 1:1 randomization scheme.

      Regorafenib will last until disease progresses, intolerable toxicity, withdrawal of informed
      consent, loss of follow-up, death, or other circumstances that require termination of
      treatment, whichever occurs first. The administration of regorafenib will be delayed in cases
      of severe toxicities. And after recovery, regorafenib will be reintroduced at a reduced dose
      according to the dose delay and reduction guidelines. Treatment of sintilimab will last up to
      24 months, or until disease progresses, intolerable toxicity, withdrawal of informed consent,
      loss of follow-up, death, or other circumstances that require termination of treatment,
      whichever occurs first. In the arm of regorafenib plus sintilimab, patients will be allowed
      to have regorafenib or sintilimab as a sigle agent and will be still considered on study when
      the other drug cause intolerable toxicity.
