      will be enrolled in the study. All participants will fill out validated sleep questionnaires
      and complete sleep and seizure diaries. Furthermore, all participants will wear actigraphy
      watches prior to ketogenic dietary therapy initiation as well as four to six weeks after
      being on the diet. For control participants, the actigraphy will be completed at two time
      points to mimic that of the participants in the dietary therapy group. For the home sleep
      studies for the subset of participants, these will be completed at similar time intervals as
      that of the actigraphy. Adherence to the diet will be monitored according to standard medical
      management; for any participant on the diet, he or she will keep track of food intake and
      track ketones, which will be submitted at the four to six week follow-up visit.
