      perspective of disability. They must provide treatment to people with disability and care for
      them, but also should accept them with no judgements or discrimination. The general objective
      of this study is to know the attitude towards people with disability of Nursing and
      Physiotherapy students in the University of Cadiz. Method: This is a descriptive,
      correlational, transversal and synchronous study. A total of 200 students participate in the
      study (91 from the Bachelor's Degree in Nursing and 109 from the Bachelor's Degree in
      Physiotherapy). The 'Attitudes towards people with disability Scale' was used.
