      game prior to IV ketamine procedural sedation for long bone fracture reduction. Prior studies
      have demonstrated that children undergoing anesthesia or procedural sedation can have
      lingering negative behavioral changes lasting several weeks after discharge home. Children
      who are anxious have higher rates of developing negative behavior changes. Opiate pain
      control and pre-operative instructional workshops have demonstrated efficacy in decreasing
      negative behavior outcomes. There is some evidence that distraction techniques, such as VR,
      can alleviate pre-procedural anxiety and pain during procedures. To our knowledge, evaluating
      the use of a non-pharmacologic, virtual reality intervention and its effects on reducing
      post-discharge negative behavior changes following discharge from the Emergency Department
      has not been evaluated.
