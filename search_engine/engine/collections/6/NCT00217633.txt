      I. Correlate progression-free survival and overall survival with tumor size, time interval
      between primary cancer management and pelvic exenteration, and presence or absence of pelvic
      sidewall fixation by clinical examination in patients with recurrent cervical cancer treated
      with pelvic exenteration.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine quality of life of patients treated with this procedure. II. Correlate quality
      of life with reconstructive technique (e.g., no ostomy or â‰¥ 1 ostomy) in patients treated
      with this procedure.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo pelvic exenteration within 14 days after study entry. Quality of life is
      assessed at baseline and at 6, 12, and 24 months after surgery. After completion of study
      treatment, patients are followed within 30 days, every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months
      for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.
