    
      This will be a non-randomized, single-armed study conducted in the United States. Following
      screening, a minimum of 60 to a maximum of 80 subjects at up to 4 clinical sites will be
      enrolled. All participants will wear the G4 Sensor for one 7-day wear period (~168 hours). A
      subset of 20-30 subjects will wear two G4 Systems (one of which will be blinded) during the
      7-day wear period for the purposes of assessing precision. During home use, subjects will be
      asked to use the meter provided to them to take fingersticks for calibration and diabetes
      management. Subjects will also be asked to confirm high and low G4 System glucose
      alerts/alarms by taking a comparative fingerstick immediately after receiving an alert/alarm.

      All subjects will participate in one, 8-hour in-clinic session on Day 1, 4, or 7 of the study
      to collect accuracy information against a laboratory standard (YSI) and against SMBG. During
      the in-clinic session, subjects will have venous blood draws for evaluation of the YSI blood
      glucose measurements. Carbohydrate consumption and insulin dosing may be manipulated during
      the in-clinic session to ensure a wide range of glucose values. For the duration of this
      study, subjects will be instructed to use G4 System information as an adjunct to (and not as
      a replacement for) standard SMBG guidance of diabetes self-management.

      Subjects will perform G4 Sensor insertions at the clinic under supervision of study staff.
      Sensor insertion sites will be examined after removal of the Sensor(s). Study staff will
      document any irritation and/or Adverse Device Effects.
