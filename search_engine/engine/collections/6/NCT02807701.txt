      and pancreatic diseases including malignant and benign conditions. The outcome of PD has
      improved over the last two decades due to advances in surgical techniques, anesthesia and
      perioperative care . Although studies from high volume centers demonstrate reduce in the
      operative mortality to less than 3%, the postoperative morbidity rate is still ranging from
      30% to 60%. Laparoscopic surgery is being used increasingly as a less invasive alternative to
      traditional interventions for pancreatic resection. Laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy
      (LPD) is a difficult procedure that has become increasingly popular. Nevertheless,
      comparative data on outcomes remain limited despite several improvements in surgical devices
      and techniques that have allowed surgeons to approach the pancreas laparoscopically,
      laparoscopic PD remains challenging. LPD represents one of the most advanced abdominal
      operations owing to the necessity of a complex dissection and reconstruction. Recent reports
      note that complete laparoscopic PD including laparoscopic resection and reconstruction is
      both technically feasible and safe. In this prospective randomized study, investigators
      evaluate the safety and feasibility of surgical and oncological outcomes of minimally
      invasive PD compared to conventional open PD
