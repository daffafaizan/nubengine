      World Health Organization (WHO) group 4 PH. It is a rare, progressive pulmonary vascular
      disease that if left untreated, leads to progressively increasing pulmonary vascular
      resistance (PVR) and eventually right ventricle failure and death. Histopathologic findings
      including endothelial cell dysfunction and distal pulmonary arterial remodeling are shared
      between PAH and CTEPH, and PH-specific therapies (that is, riociguat) have shown efficacy in
      inoperable and persistent/recurrent CTEPH. The endothelin receptor antagonist macitentan
      offers a different mode of action and addresses an important unmet medical need for an
      alternative treatment option in this indication. This study will assess the effect of
      macitentan 75 mg on exercise capacity in CTEPH. The total duration of the study is
      approximately 6 years. The study comprises of a screening period (at least 14 days and up to
      60 days), a double-blind (DB) treatment period (28 weeks [minimum duration] up to 3.5 years),
      an open-label (OL) extension period (starts at end-of-DB-treatment [EODBT] and will end for
      all participants 104 weeks after the last participant has completed DB Week 28). The DB
      period consists of an 8-week up-titration phase and a maintenance phase. The maintenance
      phase is divided into a 28-week fixed duration part, at the end of which primary endpoint is
      assessed, and a variable duration part. The duration of the DB period for an individual
      participant depends on the timepoint of entry into the study and whether a CEC-confirmed
      clinical worsening event occurred. Participants who discontinue DB study intervention during
      the 28-week fixed duration part will be followed until Week 28 in a post-treatment
      observation period (PTOP).
