      Desogestrel of 2 tablet formulations with Desogestrel 0.075 mg to demonstrate bioequivalence
      of both formulations in terms of rate and extent of absorption:

        -  Test Product: Product manufactured by Laboratorios Andr√≥maco S.A.

        -  Reference Product: Cerazette [Trademark], product of Merck Sharp and Dohme Ltda.,
           Brasil.

      The 90% confidence intervals for the intra-subject coefficient of variation (Test versus
      Reference Product) for the main pharmacokinetic parameters area under the plasma
      concentration-time curve from time zero to time t (AUC0-t) and from time zero to 72 hours
      (AUC0-72), and maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) for total metabolite etonogestrel was
      determined.

      Participants were confined in the study site for approximately 36 hours during each study
      period (for 12 hours pre-dosing and for 24 hours post dosing) during which pharmacokinetic
      (PK) blood samples were obtained. 16 blood samples were taken up to 24 hours after the
      administration in each period. Participants returned to the site to provide additional blood
      samples at 48 h, and 72 h postdose.

      The washout period between the two study periods was 14 days. The samples from each
      participant were analyzed with 2 methods of highperformance liquid chromatography-tandem mass
      spectrometry bioanalytical assays to quantify total Dienogest and Ethinyl estradiol in
      plasma.

      The safety objective was to evaluate the tolerability of both formulations in women by
      collecting adverse events.
