      on admission to intensive rehabilitation units. Consented participants (who meet all
      inclusion and exclusion criteria) will wear an actigraphy watch for 2 nights to obtain a
      baseline for sleep pattern identification. Prior to treatment, baseline measures (detailed
      below) will be obtained. Participants will be randomized to receive either Bright White Light
      (BWL) or Red Light (RL) treatment. Light therapy treatments will be given for 30 minutes
      daily in the morning for 10 days, and an Actiwatch will be worn continuously during that
      period. At the end of 10 days, outcome measures will be obtained (as below). The specific
      period of treatment may be affected by the length of stay on the rehabilitation unit. For
      lengths of stay less than the 10 days, subjects will receive the intervention until the day
      of discharge at which time the outcome measures will be administered. The investigators
      primary outcome measure with be the actigraphic measurement of sleep efficiency. Other
      secondary measures will be participation in therapy, sleepiness, and attention. The
      investigators will also evaluate the anticipated device costs and clinical staff burden
      involved in utilizing light therapy exposure in an inpatient rehabilitation clinical setting.
