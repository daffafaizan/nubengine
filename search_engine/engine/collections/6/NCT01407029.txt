      Acetabular System in patients with degenerative joint disease requiring primary total hip
      replacement. A nonÂ¬-randomized, consecutive series of up to 158 patients will be enrolled,
      and a maximum of 8 sites will participate in the study. Each site is allowed to enroll up to
      22 patients. When 158 patients are enrolled from all sites, enrollment will be stopped,
      regardless of the number contributed from each site. The clinical data from this study will
      be compared with a historical control. The study will include follow up through 5 years.
