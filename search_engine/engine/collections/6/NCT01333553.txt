      structured light patterns on to the tissue of interest in a non-contact, reflection geometry
      and then capturing the reflectance with a camera.The system can image the depth-resolved
      optical properties of in-vivo tissues, allowing rapid, non-invasive visualization of
      sub-surface structures of Port Wine Stain.
