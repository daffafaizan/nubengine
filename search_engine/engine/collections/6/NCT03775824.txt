      for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. In a substantial number of cases however, these
      medications remain ineffective. At present, the scientific community has limited
      understanding of why some patients are resistant to these medications. The purpose of this
      study is to understand if the gut flora may associate with treatment response.

      Recent studies have associated rheumatoid arthritis with intestinal dysbiosis. Specifically,
      the bacteria Prevotella copri, has been associated with this disease, an observation that has
      been supported also by mechanistic studies. In patients receiving methotrexate, normalization
      of dysbiosis has been associated with successful treatment.

      This study is of observational character and integrated in the routine clinical care of
      patients with rheumatoid arthritis at the Rheumatology Clinic, Skane University Hospital,
      Lund, Sweden. Study participants are asked to deliver blood and fecal sampling at two
      time-points together with clinical evaluation of disease activity. With an estimated
      inclusion of 50 patients, at least 20 responders and 20 non-responders are expected to be
      included and to be compared to each other.

      If successful treatment response in rheumatoid arthritis is associated with specific
      alterations of the gut flora, these results may guide future studies on the impact of
      dysbiosis and probiotics on this disease.
