      receptors have been described mainly in the distal ureter. Blockage of adrenergic receptors
      has been associated to a decrease in ureteral resistance. In this study the investigators
      hypothesized that alpha blockers are associated to a decrease in ureteral resistance with an
      increase in successful endoscopic management of urolithiasis.

      Only patients with urolithiasis undergoing to endoscopic treatment are offered to
      participate. Patients are randomized between placebo arm or tamsulosin 0.4 mg/day.
      Demographic characteristics, stones characteristics and information related to surgery are
      recorded. Main study outcome is stone free rate and successful insertion of semirigid
      ureteroscope 8,0 - 9,8 Fr. All patients are follow-up for 30 days after surgery.
