studies on eperythrozoon infection in sheepthe intravenous inoculation of blood from sheep in the parasi-taemic stage of eperythrozoon infection produced detectableparasitaemia in recipient sheep within 7 days.  the parasitaemialasted from 3 to 12 weeks and was accompanied by anaemia andoccasionally by icterus.  no other symptoms developed and in acontrolled experiment on hoggs there was no significant differencein weight gain between infected and control animals.a concurrent attack of tick-borne fever led to the disappearanceof eperythrozoon from the circulating blood.  it is suggested that thisphenomenon may be caused by the pyrexia.the incubation period following the inoculation of infected bloodin ten 3 to 4 week old lambs varied from 3 to 6 weeks.  in eight ofthese animals the symptoms were less severe than in adult sheep, butthe two smallest lambs developed a profound anaemia and failed togain weight.culture of the organism on sheep blood agar or on sheep kidneymonolayers was unsuccessful as was the attempted transmission ofthe infection to mice.the transference of keds and lice from infected to uninfectedsheep failed to transmit the infection, but a sheep was infected by theintravenous inoculation of ground-up lice from an infected animal.the only characteristic histopathological changes in infectedsheep were lymphoid hyperplasia of the malphigian corpuscles in thespleen and deposition of haemosiderin in the cells of the proximalconvoluted tubules in the kidney cortex.
