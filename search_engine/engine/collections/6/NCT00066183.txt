      structure. Scientific evidence suggests that, in addition to Vitamin D and PTH systems, novel
      factors, such as Fibroblast Growth Factor 23 (FGF-23) and Matrix extracellular
      phosphoglycoprotein (MEPE), may play an important role in phosphorus regulation. These
      factors have been best studied in rare genetic and acquired phosphate wasting disorders such
      as tumor induced osteomalacia (TIO), X linked hypophosphatemia (XLH) and autosomal dominant
      hypophosphatemic rickets (ADHR). Patients with other abnormal phosphate regulating states
      such as hyperparathyroidism and hypoparathyroidism, pseudohypoparathyroidism etc. undergoing
      phosphorus-altering interventions may provide important insight into the role of these
      hormones.

      We are proposing an observational study with collection of blood and urine samples to study
      both established (e.g. mineral ions, bone markers, PTH-Vit D system, TMP-GFR) and novel (e.g.
      FGF-23 and MEPE) constituents of the phosphorus metabolism pathway. Patients with abnormal
      phosphorus regulating states will be enrolled and we will study the natural history of their
      disease and the effects of specific interventions that are likely to change phosphorus
      balance.

      The outcome will potentially aid understanding of this new field of mineral regulating
      hormones and generate both interest and research in phosphorus metabolism. It is hoped that
      this will also encourage clinical trials in treatment of phosphate wasting disorders.
