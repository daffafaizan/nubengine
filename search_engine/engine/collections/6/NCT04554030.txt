      that anti PD-1 immunotherapy can have on the spermogram of oncological patients at the level
      of the blood-testicular barrier, endocrine axis, among others, is not known. The
      proinflammatory mechanisms of immunotherapy could incur in damage evidenced as
      quali-quantitative alterations of the spermogram.

      Primary end point:

      To evaluate the difference in spermogram (counting, functionality, vitality, mobility) before
      and after treatment with anti-PD1 immunotherapy first line of oncological treatment of adult
      patients

      Secondary end point:

      Evaluate the association adjusted for nutrition, endocrine disorders. Evaluate modifications
      in the sexual functionality of patients through validated sexuality questionnaires before and
      during treatment.

      In the absence of information, according to the results obtained, cryopreservation prior to
      the start of treatment could be taken into consideration.

      Design: Observational prospective cohort with a single group. With start of follow-up from
      the oncological diagnosis of patients who are in the process of starting treatment with
      immunotherapy, checkpoint inhibitors in first line setting. The spermogram samples will be
      performed: 2 baseline before the start of the drug and +/- 5 days of the start of the
      treatment, separated by at least 2 weeks. Subsequent samples will be taken 3, 6 and 12 months
      after the start of treatment.
