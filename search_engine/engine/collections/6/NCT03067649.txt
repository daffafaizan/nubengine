      recommendations for parents of children with emotional/behavior problems. Mental health
      problems in parents can be a serious risk factor for psychiatric and medical problems in
      children, yet most parents of children receiving services for mental health or medical
      problems do not get treatment for their own problems. The specific aim of this study was to
      increase parents' adherence to recommendations for treatment. Parents were randomly assigned
      to either the Enhanced Motivational Intervention (EMI) or an information only control group.
      The EMI involves motivational interviewing comprised of a brief intervention that elicits the
      parents' "story," provides education about their problem(s), describes the potential link
      between parents' and children's symptoms, assesses their prior treatment history,
      expectations, and concerns about treatment, identifies potential barriers to treatment
      seeking, and determines the next step. Evaluations at baseline and 8-weeks and 4-months post
      intervention will assess parents' symptoms, functioning, and service utilization. The
      investigators hypothesized that adherence to treatment recommendations would be significantly
      greater for parents in the EMI group compared to parents in the control group.
