      complications in individuals with Sickle Cell Anemia (SCA) but poor adherence is a barrier to
      improving outcomes in patients with SCA. Directly Observed Therapy (DOT) has been shown to
      improve adherence in various chronic diseases but there is limited data in adults with sickle
      cell anaemia (SCA).

      Methods and design: To examine the effect of mobile-directly observed therapy (mDOT) on
      adherence to HU (mDOT-HuA) adults with SCA at Muhimbili National Hospital (MNH) in
      Tanzania.The mDOT-HuA study is single centre, prospective, randomized, open label clinical
      trial. 100 participants with SCA with hemoglobin SS genotype, aged ≥18 years, living in urban
      Dar es Salaam and able and willing to participate in the study. Participants will be divided
      into two treatment arms; 50 in standard monitoring (SM) arm: will receive fixed dose HU
      therapy with standard monitoring. 50 in treatment mDOT arm: will receive fixed dose HU
      therapy with standard monitoring and a mobile direct observed web based medication adherence
      monitoring system. The primary outcome is adherence to HU as defined as medication possession
      ratio of ≥80 at end of 3 months of HU treatment and mDOT monitoring. Secondary outcomes will
      be efficacy to HU treatment as measured through the the mean change in fetal hemoglobin
      (between baseline and end of 3 months) and safety, measured as the proportion of participants
      experiencing serious adverse events related to HU at week 2, 6, 10 and at the end of 3
      months.

      REDCap, an open source software application will be used to collect data using clinical
      research forms.

      Conclusion: This project has the potential for the development of novel strategies for
      improving HU adherence in SCA.
