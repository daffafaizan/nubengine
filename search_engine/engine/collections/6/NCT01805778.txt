    
      This is a multi-centre observational cohort study that will be conducted at The Hospital for
      Sick Children (Toronto), Princess Margaret Hospital (Toronto), McMaster Children's Hospital
      (Hamilton), London Health Sciences Centre (London), The Children's Hospital of Eastern
      Ontario (Ottawa) and The Children's Hospital of Orange County (Orange County, California).

      The study will address the current limitations in prediction and early diagnosis of
      anthracycline-induced heart disease. This will be accomplished by the following 3
      collaborative cores:

      Core 1 (Genomics) will focus on determining which children are most susceptible to
      treatment-related cardiac toxicity by assessing genes in pathways related to anthracycline
      absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion, as well identifying genes in pathways
      known to be important in the cardiac response to injury.

      Core 2 (Biomarkers) will explore whether existing and novel biomarkers allow for more
      accurate diagnosis of acute and late treatment-related cardiac toxicity. The core will use a
      human stem cell platform for discovery of novel biomarkers of anthracycline cardiac damage
      that will be evaluated in our clinical cohort.

      Core 3 (Cardiac imaging) will focus on the evaluation of new echocardiographic and CMR
      techniques aimed at early identification of cardiac damage after anthracycline exposure.

      It will investigate whether changes in cardiac function immediately after anthracycline
      administration predict which patients will develop progressive cardiac disease over time, and
      it will explore disease progression through the longitudinal evaluation of innovative
      echocardiographic parameters of remodeling and dysfunction in CCS exposed to anthracyclines.
