      daily dose of plecanatide administered orally. Patients who are Study Completers or Eligible
      Screen Failures whose eligibility is confirmed at the end of their participation in the
      double-blind plecanatide studies SP304203-04 or SP304203-05 will be enrolled.

      Beginning on Day 1, patients will take one (1) plecanatide 6.0 mg tablet in the clinic and
      thereafter every morning with approximately 240 mL (8 ounces) of liquid, with or without
      meals.

      Safety and tolerability assessments and patients' self-assessment of disease severity will be
      performed according to the Schedule of Assessments.

      Patients who discontinue early from the study will undergo an Early Withdrawal (EW) visit
      within 5 days after stopping study drug.
