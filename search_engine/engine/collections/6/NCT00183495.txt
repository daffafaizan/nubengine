    
      Bipolar Disorder (BPD), also known as manic-depressive illness, is a disorder that causes
      frequent shifts in an individual's mood, energy, and ability to function. An individual with
      BPD may go through periods of mania, which are characterized by increased energy,
      irritability, and an excessively "high" euphoric mood. The manic periods are followed by
      periods of depression, which are characterized by decreased energy, feelings of hopelessness,
      and anxiety. BPD is a persistent and severe mental illness with a high suicide rate; it must
      be strictly managed through medication and therapy. Many BPD medications have been developed
      recently; however, there are still many individuals who do not respond well to medication
      treatment. Research has shown that the way individuals experience illness has an effect on
      their response to medication. The purpose of this study is to gain insight into how
      individuals with BPD perceive and respond to medication treatment. Factors such as gender,
      degree of social support, drug and alcohol usage, and attitudes towards medication will be
      evaluated to understand how they affect medication and treatment adherence.

      This 6-month study will consist of 3 interviews. Each interview will last approximately 2 and
      Â½ hours and will include numerous standardized psychological questionnaires. The
      questionnaires will assess participants' attitudes toward BPD treatment; psychiatric illness
      severity, including symptoms of mania and depression; level of addiction to alcohol and
      drugs; availability of social support resources; and medication adherence.
