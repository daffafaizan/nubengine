    
      Objective: To investigate the effect of treatment with CSF on pregnancy rates in routine in
      vitro fertilization (IVF).

      Design: Double blinded crossover randomized controlled clinical trial

      Setting: Academically affiliated private infertility centers

      Subjects: Normal female IVF patients 18-38 years old, and above age 38 years, who are willing
      to be randomized to treatment.

      Interventions: Subjects receive transvaginally, utilizing an insemination catheter, a slow
      uterine lavage with G-CSF (Neupogen), 300ug (in 1 ml); controls receive saline. Patients who
      do not conceive will, after one month washout time, continue treatment in the opposite study
      arm.

      Main Outcome Measures: Implantation rate(IR) and pregnancy rates.

      Second Outcome Measures: Live birth rates and miscarriage rates.

      Statistical and Power considerations: Analysis will be by regression with IR as dependent and
      treatment as independent. Results will be adjusted by age and indices of ovarian reserve,
      such as antiMulerian Hormone (AMH). Presuming an implantation rate of 10% and anticipating a
      10% increase to 20% with treatment, 120 women, producing about 200 embryos in each study arm,
      will have to be recruited for 80% power and alpha of 0.05.
