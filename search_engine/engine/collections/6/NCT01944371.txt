      detection limit in the vast majority of motivated individuals with access to these drugs.
      However, HIV-1 persists in a small pool of latently infected resting memory CD4+ T cells
      carrying integrated viral genomes. Although other reservoirs for HIV-1 exist, the general
      consensus among experts is that latent virus (HIV DNA in resting memory CD4+ T cells) is the
      primary barrier to HIV-1 eradication. A widely discussed approach for eliminating this viral
      reservoir requires reactivation of latent HIV-1. Disulfiram, an FDA-approved drug used to
      treat alcoholism was shown to activate HIV-1 gene expression in vitro, suggesting that
      activation of latently infected cells in vivo may occur. Our primary hypothesis is that the
      addition of disulfiram to a stable effective antiretroviral drug regimen will result in a
      dose dependent increase in HIV transcription in CD4+ T-cells in HIV-1 in patients on highly
      active antiretroviral therapy (HAART).
