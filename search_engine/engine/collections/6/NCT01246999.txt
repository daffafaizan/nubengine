    
      The study will be conducted as a randomized, prospective, open-label evaluation of the
      clinical tolerability, vaccine virus shedding, and serum and mucosal antibody response to
      vaccination with either live trivalent influenza vaccine (LAIV) or trivalent influenza
      vaccine (TIV) in healthy children between the ages of 2 and 9 years. Children will be
      screened for antibody to A/Brisbane/57/07 (H1N1) and A/California/07/09 (H1N1),
      A/Perth/16/2009 (H3N2) and B/Brisbane/60/2008 before and at indicated times after the start
      of the study. They will not be randomized based on antibody levels. Children with prior
      documented infection with the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus will be excluded. Vaccine will be
      administered on days 0 and 28.

      Safety of vaccination will be assessed using symptoms collected by parents for 7 days after
      each dose of vaccine. Serum will be obtained prior to and on day 28 following each dose of
      vaccine and assessed for antibody by HAI, ELISA, and neutralization techniques. Nasal
      secretions will be obtained by nasal wick prior to and on day 28 after each dose and assessed
      for HA-specific IgA (immune globulin A) and IgG (immune globulin G)antibody by ELISA. Nasal
      swabs will be obtained on days 2, 4, and 7 after each dose of live vaccine and assessed for
      the presence and magnitude of vaccine virus shedding of the live attenuated vaccine by
      rtRT-PCR (real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction)and TCID50 (50% tissue
      culture infectious doses)on MDCK(Madin Darby Canine Kidney) cells.
