    
      Methods: This study aims to validate a short clinical screening grid for syndromic forms of
      schizophrenia linked to a pathogenic Copy Variation Number (CNV). The investigators plan to
      include 150 patients with defined (DSM V) schizophrenia and aged 15 years and more. The
      clinical grid will be prospectively fulfilled for every patients on the basis of his/her
      medical history and clinical examination. Array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH-a)
      will be performed on jugal mucosae sample to detect precisely syndromic forms of
      schizophrenia linked to the presence of a pathogenic Copy Number Variation (CNV).

      In subjects with no CNV that may explain the onset of schizophrenia, the investigators would
      like to complete the investigations with exome trio sequencing. With this type of very
      clinical approach, the investigators wish to determine which semiological elements should
      alert the psychiatrists as to the presence of a syndromic form. The objective is to propose
      at the end of this study a simple and reliable scale, usable in psychiatry consultation, to
      guide the genetic screening of forms of syndromic schizophrenia.
