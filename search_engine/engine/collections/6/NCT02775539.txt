      has a critical impact on prognosis. Currently, there is no specific treatment approved for
      this indication. Experimental research, performed by members of the consortium, demonstrates
      that treatment with B3 adrenergic receptor agonists produces a beneficial effect on pulmonary
      hemodynamics, right ventricular (RV) remodeling and pulmonary vascular proliferation in a
      translational pig model of postcapillary PH. Mirabegron, an oral B3AR agonist, is currently
      approved for a different medical condition (overactive bladder syndrome) with a good safety
      profile. Our main objective is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of mirabegron in patients
      with PH secondary to HF.

      The objective will be evaluated by conducting a phase-2 randomized placebo-controlled
      clinical trial in patients with PH associated to HF. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to
      mirabegron or placebo, and dose will be titrated till 200 mg/day. Patients will be evaluated
      with quality of life questionnaire, blood analysis, ECG, echocardiography, 6-minute walking
      test, right heart catheterization (RHC) and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) at baseline and
      after 16 weeks of treatment.
