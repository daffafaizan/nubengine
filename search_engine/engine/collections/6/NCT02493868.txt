    
      This is a randomized, double-blind (neither the researchers nor the participant know what
      treatment the participants is receiving), active-controlled, multicenter (more than 1 study
      site) study in participants with TRD to assess the efficacy of intranasal esketamine plus an
      oral antidepressant compared with an oral antidepressant (active comparator) plus intranasal
      placebo in delaying relapse of depressive symptoms. The study will consist of 5 phases:
      Screening/Prospective Observational Phase (4-7weeks) for direct-entry participants only,
      Open-label Induction Phase (4-weeks) for direct-entry participants only, Optimization Phase
      (12-weeks; open-label for direct-entry participants and double-blind for transferred-entry
      participants), Maintenance Phase (variable duration; double-blind for all participants) and
      Follow-up Phase (2-weeks). Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
