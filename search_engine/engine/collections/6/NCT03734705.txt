      possessions and by clutter that makes living spaces unusable. Cognitive behavioral therapy
      (CBT) is an effective treatment for hoarding disorder, but new approaches are needed to
      engage those who are reluctant to start or cannot tolerate CBT. Both intolerance of
      uncertainty and emotional avoidance are linked to hoarding disorder and may interfere with
      treatment engagement. Imaginal exposure, a therapeutic technique which involves repeatedly
      imagining feared scenarios and experiencing the evoked emotions, effectively targets both
      intolerance of uncertainty and emotional avoidance. The present study is the first to test
      whether imagining discarding possessions can improve hoarding symptoms more than does a
      control exercise. We hypothesize that compared to a control exercise, imaginal exposure will
      improve hoarding symptoms, intolerance of uncertainty and emotional avoidance.
