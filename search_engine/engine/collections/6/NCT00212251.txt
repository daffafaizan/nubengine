      obesity in middle age, now at epidemic proportions in America. While interventions to reduce
      weight retention specifically targeting the postpartum period have been few, interventions
      that promote modest weight loss starting in early postpartum are safe and could be
      efficacious, particularly for women who were overweight prior to pregnancy. Moreover,
      postpartum-related changes in cognitive factors (risk perceptions), behavioral factors
      (physical activity, diet), self concept (self-esteem) and social role (work, food
      preparation, child care) may make this time a "teachable moment" that could be capitalized
      upon by formal interventions. Interventions could leverage natural weight changes to
      encourage adoption of a healthy diet and increase physical activity, which together could
      accelerate and/or increase natural weight loss in postpartum. Whether the postpartum period
      is a teachable moment for weight loss interventions can be investigated empirically.
