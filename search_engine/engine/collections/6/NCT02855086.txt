    
      This is a dose-escalation study of cetuximab-IRDye 800CW. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2
      cohorts.

      COHORT I: Patients receive cetuximab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes and a lower dose of
      cetuximab IRDye800 IV over 30 minutes to 1 hour on day 0.

      COHORT II: Patients receive cetuximab IV over 30 minutes and a higher dose of cetuximab
      IRDye800 IV over 30 minutes to 1 hour on day 0.

      All patients undergo standard of care surgical resection of tumor on days 2-5.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at days 10 and 30.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      Determine the efficacy of cetuximab-IRDye 800CW (cetuximab IRDye800) in intraoperatively
      identifying malignant glioma compared to surrounding normal central nervous system tissue, as
      measured by tumor-to-background ratio.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      Determine the tolerability of the cetuximab IRDye800 as an imaging agent in subjects
      undergoing resection of malignant glioma.
