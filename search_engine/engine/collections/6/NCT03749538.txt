      patients with systemic autoimmune myopathies. Therefore, the main objective of the present
      prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study is to evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of the application of acute transcranial direct current stimulation session in
      patients with systemic autoimmune myopathies.
