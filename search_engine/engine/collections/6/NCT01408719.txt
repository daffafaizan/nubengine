    
      This study consists of four dietary phases which are separated by >28 days wash-out period.
      During the treatment phase, participants will be provided with all meals for the 35 day
      period. Breakfast meals will be consumed under the supervision of the research staff and
      lunch, dinner and snacks will be provided to take home in take-out packaging. While subjects
      are on the wash-out period they will return to their normal diet. The meals are on a 7 day
      rotating schedule that reflect an average Canadian diet. Changes in blood lipids, body
      weight, and waist circumference will be measured during each treatment phase. Cholesterol
      absorption and synthesis will be examined by stable isotope method. Single nucleotide
      polymorphisms (SNPs), rs3808607 of gene CYP7A1and rs429358 and rs7412 will be determined
      byTaqManÂ® SNP Genotyping assay following the manufacturer's protocol. Fecal samples will be
      collected at the end of each intervention phase and will be subjected to Illumina sequencing
      of 16S rRNA genes.
