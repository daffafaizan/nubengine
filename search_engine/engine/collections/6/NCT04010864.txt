      meeting the inclusion criteria will be fully informed of the study and asked to sign the
      written informed consent before enrolment.

      Two senior nurses that will conduct the initial screenings were employed to collect all
      diagnostic and medication information from medical records on every follow-up visit. The four
      psychiatrists are qualified and well-trained and will conduct the SIPS/SOPS interview at
      baseline and follow-up.

      The investigators will systematically record medication information. A model will be
      established to correlate antipsychotics with clinical and functional outcomes and demonstrate
      whether antipsychotics are useful and safe for preventing CHR individuals from converting to
      psychosis.

      Based on experience from the sampling process in the SHARP-1 project, the investigators will
      recruit 600 participants at CHR. Considering a dropout rate of 20%, 510 cases of CHR will be
      followed up. According to the sample size calculation formula in superiority clinical trials
      of new drugs, the sample size of 600 cases is adequate for the demonstration of the
      effectiveness and safety of antipsychotics in CHR subjects.
