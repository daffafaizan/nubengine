      patient education and self-care. A key self-care skill for heart failure patients is the
      early detection of subtle changes in symptoms. Daily diary use can be one method for patients
      to acknowledge and attend to their symptoms. This study is examining if the use of a diary in
      the form of an app on a mobile phone will improve patient outcomes. Participants will be
      randomized to one of two groups-- usual care or the Movn mobile application. Participants
      randomized to the mobile app will be asked to record their weight and any symptoms every day
      over the course of two months.
