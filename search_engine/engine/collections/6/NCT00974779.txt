      inflammation (e.g. serum CRP values). Hemodialysis may clear the blood from low molecular
      weight toxins and retention products such as creatinine, potassium, or urea. The dialyzer
      clearance of middle to high molecular weight substances such as cytokines and cytokine
      receptors is low. Nearly 50% of chronic dialysis patients have persistent subclinical
      inflammation which is strongly associated with cardiovascular disease and mortality. The
      study tests the hypothesis that removal of proteins in the weight range of 10.000-30.000 D
      via a more permeable dialyzer membrane reduces chronic inflammation in these patients.
