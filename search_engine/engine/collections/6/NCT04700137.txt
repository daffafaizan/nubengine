      intervention involves sending a series of brief, non-demanding, supportive text messages to
      the participant. One intervention arm will receive an introductory phone call and the caring
      text messages (CC+); the second intervention arm will only receive the same caring text
      messages (CC). The clinical trial will enroll a subset of 660 participants who report
      elevated levels of loneliness, suicide ideation, or other mental distress in the Aim 1
      survey. Enrollment will be stratified by population (providers and employees; patients) with
      165 per intervention arm in each stratum.

      The investigators hypothesize that delivering the Caring Contacts intervention with an
      introductory phone call will yield better mental health outcomes than delivering the Caring
      Contacts intervention with no introductory phone call.

      This will be the first published data directly comparing the effectiveness of two versions of
      the Caring Contacts intervention with individuals who report loneliness or other mental
      distress. The overall goal of the MHAPPS study is to better understand the mental health
      impact of COVID-19 and to determine how health systems can most effectively support mental
      health at scale among providers, staff, and patients in the COVID-19 era and beyond.

      This research is being conducted by a team including health system-based researchers,
      clinicians, other frontline healthcare workers, and administrators; academic researchers;
      follow-up specialists and administrators at the Idaho Suicide Prevention Hotline, and an
      advisory board of people with lived experience with suicide.
