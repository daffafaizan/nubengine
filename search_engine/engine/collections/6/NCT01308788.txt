      outflow drugs in terms of the response to known vascular parameters. Specifically; systemic
      perfusion pressure, retrobulbar blood flow and retinal microcirculation.

      A comparison of perfusion pressure, retinal microcirculation utilizing Heidelberg Retinal
      Flowmetry and retrobulbar circulation utilizing color Doppler ultrasound imaging
