      recorded. All patients underwent diagnostic lumbar puncture and each cerebrospinal fluid
      sample was examined by CC and FCM. The investigators identified patients with the only FCM
      positivity and the investigators correlated this condition with clinical and of laboratory
      data and with clinical outcome.
