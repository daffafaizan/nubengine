      with imatinib with an aim of achieving a maximal molecular response as the primary goal.
      Briefly, patients with CML who are taking imatinib and have been found to have a plateau in
      their level of the bcr-abl transcript will be eligible to participate in the study. Valproate
      will then be added to the imatinib, and subsequent bcr-abl transcripts will be monitored to
      see if the addition of valproate produced a further reduction. Patients will be monitored for
      efficacy and toxicity.
