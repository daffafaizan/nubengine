      Gonadotropins using antagonist protocol before the beginning of chemotherapy. Ovulation is
      triggered in all patients with a GnRH agonist.

      After retrieval, oocytes are denuded and matured oocytes are subjected to fertilization
      before embryo freezing or direct vitrification.

      Primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of performing a controlled ovarian stimulation
      with or without letrozole in young women with newly diagnosed breast cancer who are
      candidates to receive (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy in terms of mature oocytes collected.
