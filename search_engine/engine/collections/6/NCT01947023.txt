      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose of lapatinib that can be used in combination of
      dabrafenib.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity. II. Evaluate potential mechanisms of primary
      resistance of v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (BRAF) mutant thyroid cancer to
      dabrafenib by performing pathway profiling of tumor biopsies before and while on therapy.

      III. Obtain preliminary data on the activity of the combination of lapatinib and dabrafenib
      in BRAF mutant thyroid cancer through imaging.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of lapatinib.

      Patients receive dabrafenib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28 and lapatinib PO once
      daily (QD) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      NOTE: Patients also receive dabrafenib PO for 2 weeks prior to beginning treatment with
      lapatinib.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks and then annually
      thereafter.
