    
      The goal of this randomized treatment de-escalation study is to formally compare outcomes in
      HPV related oropharyngeal cancer tumors treated with a primary radiotherapy versus a primary
      surgical approach, to provide a high level of evidence to guide the selection of treatment
      options for a subsequent phase III trial

      The study will compare overall survival rates relative to historical controls for
      de-intensified primary radiotherapy [60 GY +/- chemotherapy] versus transoral surgery (TOS)
      and neck dissection [+/- adjuvant 50Gy radiotherapy] in patients with early T-stage
      HPV-positive squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx and to compare quality of life (QOL)
      profiles.

      The study will require a sample size of 140 patients randomized in a 1:1 ratio between the
      two arms. Arm 1 (radiotherapy +/1 chemotherapy) and Arm 2 (TOS)

      Patients will be followed for a total of 5 years
