    
      In this prospective, randomized, controlled trial, all patients born before 32 weeks of
      gestational age and/or with birth weight below 1500 g admitted to the tertiary neonatal
      intensive care unit(NICU) of the University Hospitals Leuven within 24 hours of birth, are
      eligible for inclusion in the study except for infants who died within the first 24 hours.
      Infants whose mothers intend to breastfeed will be randomly assigned, using a digital system,
      to receive either raw or pasteurized mother's own milk. The duration of the study is from
      birth to eight weeks of age or to discharge from the NICU, whichever occurs first. The need
      to ensure proper handling of the milk precludes true blinding of the caregivers. The
      institutional review board approved the study and written informed parental consent iss
      obtained before enrolment.
