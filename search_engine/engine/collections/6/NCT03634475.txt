      diagnosed with non-infectious chronic uveitis. PP-001 is a novel small molecule inhibitor of
      Dihydroorotate Dehydrogenase (DHODH) and has shown pre-clinical efficacy in treatment of
      non-infectious uveitis. PP-001 is to offer a local treatment alternative to corticosteroids
      with the objective to reduce or possibly replace steroid intake of non-infectious uveitis
      patients. In the current study, PP-001 will be injected in ascending doses into the vitreous
      body of the eye of study participants who suffer from non-infectious uveitis. Participants
      will be monitored for safety and efficacy evaluation of the study drug.
