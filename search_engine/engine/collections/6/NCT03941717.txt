      for pediatric acute pain. Moreover, this will be the first study to investigate a parent
      mindfulness intervention in the context of child pain. Within a randomized control trial, the
      objectives of this study are to test the effectiveness of a mindfulness-based intervention
      for children undergoing a venipuncture and their accompanying parent on (a) child ratings of
      pain and fear, (b) parent and child ratings of parent distress, and (c) parent perceptions of
      child pain and fear. Participants will complete questionnaires immediately before and after
      child venipuncture. This study aims to offer a novel intervention that may improve both
      parent and child experience during a stressful situation in which parent and child unmanaged
      distress has deleterious effects. The long-term objectives of this line of research are to
      improve extant pain management interventions for children undergoing needle-pokes or other
      painful procedures.

      Moderator Aims: To identify possible moderators of a differential treatment outcome (parent
      and child responses during the needle-poke). These psychological factors include parent and
      child state catastrophizing, trait experiential avoidance, and trait mindfulness which will
      be investigated as moderators of the impact of experimental group on the primary outcomes of
      child self-reported pain and fear, and secondary outcome of parent self-reported distress.
