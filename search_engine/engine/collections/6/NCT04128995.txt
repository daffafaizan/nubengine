      progression of T2D co-morbidities, including dyslipidemia, hypertension, non-alcoholic fatty
      liver disease and diabetic kidney disease. The pathophysiology of T2D in youth differs
      considerably from adults and current treatment approaches are in-adequate for youth. Thus,
      exploration of innovative approaches to reduce co-morbidities is critical. Metabolic
      bariatric surgery (MBS) significantly improves multiple outcomes in adults with T2D. Initial
      small, uncontrolled studies of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass also suggest beneficial effects in
      youth with T2D, but definitive studies and understanding of mechanisms in youth-onset T2D are
      lacking, especially with the now more common form of MBS, vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG).

      We will test the hypothesis that VSG will be more effective in reducing glycemia and
      comorbidities than the best currently available medical treatment: advanced medical therapy
      (AMT), via pancreatic, enterohepatic and/or metabolic changes. To test this hypothesis, 90
      adolescents with T2D will be studied to compare the effects of VSG vs. AMT on glycemic
      control and T2D-associated comorbidities, as well as underlying mechanisms.
