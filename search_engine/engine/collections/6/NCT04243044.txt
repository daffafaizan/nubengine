      can include increased response to muscle stretch and physical touch, as well as muscle
      stiffness. Due to the combination of symptoms, several drug therapies are currently
      prescribed to reduce spasticity but they may have negative side effects including fatigue and
      muscle weakness. Transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation (tcSCS) is a form of electrical
      stimulation delivered over the skin of the spine to that seem to have effects that are
      similar to drug therapy. Prior studies of tcSCS in persons with SCI suggest that tcSCS can
      reduce spasticity without negative side effects. The intensity of stimulation, or dose, that
      promotes the best response is not known. In addition sensitive measurements are necessary to
      assess the changes that can be seen in multiple presentations of spasticity. Understanding
      the response to different intensities of stimulation and how they affect spasticity will help
      guide rehabilitation for persons with SCI. Therefore, this study aims to identify the effects
      tcSCS as a non-drug intervention for spasticity management.
