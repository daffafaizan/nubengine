    
      The purpose of this study is to compare miRNA pattern, lung function values, bronchial
      inflammation and the Lung clearance index of Patients with Bronchiolitis obliterans aged
      between 6 up to 30 years of age with a matched control group.

      The sputum samples will be processed and quantitatively analyzed to get a profile of the
      cytological composition.

      Sputum and serum samples are analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction
      (qRT-PCR) and by cytometric bead assay (CBA). miRNA samples will be collected, processand
      compared with the miRNA database at http://www.mirbase.org/

      Methods and Work Programme:

        -  Measurement of nitric oxide in expired air (FeNO)

        -  Lung function testing with spirometry and body plethysmography

        -  Lung clearance index (LCI)

        -  Bronchodilation

        -  Blood test: blood count, CRP, RAST, serum inflammatory mediators, (genetic markers of
           the non-specific pulmonary defense system), miRNA analysis

        -  Induced sputum for inflammatory mediators and microbiological investigations
