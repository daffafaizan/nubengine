    
      Patients undergoing TKA for primary osteoarthritis of the knee are randomly assigned to
      either the PR or non-PR groups. The differences between groups with respect to age, BMI,
      gender, and preoperative Knee Society Score (KSS), and isokinetic performance are evaluated.
      Patients are evaluated at postoperative 3, 6, and 12 months with KSS and at 6 months and 1
      year with isokinetic measurements.
