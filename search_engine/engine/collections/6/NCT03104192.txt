      increased risk of disability, nursing home placement and early mortality. Conventional weight
      loss programs have the potential to reduce body fat, but are difficult to access for older
      obese adults due to transportation and mobility challenges. The overarching goal of this
      study is to conduct a program of pilot research aimed at developing and evaluating a
      technology assisted wellness intervention for older adults with obesity.
