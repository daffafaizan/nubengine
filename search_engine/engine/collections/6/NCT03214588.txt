      people who have Friedreich ataxia. This study will look at upper extremity (arms and hands)
      motor function and manual dexterity of people who take TAK-831. Efficacy evaluations also
      include other neurological, functional, and patient performance assessments.

      The study will enroll approximately 65 participants. Participants will be randomly assigned
      in a 2:1:2 ratio to one of the three treatment groups-which will remain undisclosed to the
      participant and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need):

        -  TAK-831 High dose

        -  TAK-831 Low dose

        -  Placebo (dummy inactive pill) - this is a tablet that looks like the study drug but has
           no active ingredient

      All participants will be asked to take three tablets of high dose, low dose, or placebo twice
      a day for 12 weeks.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to
      participate in this study is approximately 13 weeks. Participants will make 5 visits to the
      clinic, and will be contacted by telephone for an exit interview no later than 7 days after
      their final visit or termination. Participants will also receive a safety follow-up phone
      call 7 to 17 days after receiving their last dose of TAK-831.
