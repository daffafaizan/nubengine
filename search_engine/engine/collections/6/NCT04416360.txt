      behavioral and emotional difficulties. The disorders they suffer from, which considerably
      disturb family life, the therapies they benefit from, which help to organize and structure
      their daily lives, make them a coherent study group whose observation during home confinement
      is particularly relevant. Therefore, it is especially interesting to explore the impact of
      quarantine on the evolution of clinical symptoms and family dynamic.

      There is little evidence about the impact of prolonged confinement in these children. The
      first clinical observations, at the beginning of confinement, reported various situations.
      Some children showed marked emotional disturbances, whereas others seem to be happy with less
      social pressure. For ASDs, the ritualization can be a stabilizing factor. For ADHDs, the
      decrease in school pressure is undoubtedly a positive factor. The availability of parents to
      create a suitable environment could play a major role. In all cases, changes in care
      management (teleconsultations for most of them), disruption in routines and lack of points of
      reference, adjustment in parenting and caring for children for the parents (with difficulties
      that could increase with prolonged duration of confinement), could have serious long-term
      effects, but also create opportunities.

      So, the present study aim to document the experience of home confinement in children and
      adolescents with ASD and/or ADHD quarantined because of covid-19 outbreak in various
      socio-cultural contexts. The experiences reported by the children, their parents and their
      caregivers will help understand the psychological impact of quarantine.
