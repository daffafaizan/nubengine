      of preeclampsia results in pulmonary and vascular dysfunction in infants. Specifically, study
      investigators hypothesize that the anti- angiogenic environment of preeclampsia will impair
      pulmonary development and promote vascular dysfunction in infants. Furthermore, study
      investigators hypothesize that circulating progenitor cell (CPC) measurements in cord blood
      will correlate with infant pulmonary (Aim #1) and systemic vascular (Aim #2) function. Study
      investigators will determine whether the pro-angiogenic circulating progenitor cells (CPC)
      versus non-circulating progenitor cells ratio in cord blood of pregnancies complicated by
      preeclampsia predicts pulmonary diffusing capacity and systemic vascular dysfunction, as well
      as respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). This research
      represents an important translational study that extends observations made in pre-clinical
      animal models that have clearly established a critical relationship between angiogenesis and
      lung development. Preliminary data strongly suggest a relationship between pro-angiogenic
      circulating progenitor cells (CPCs), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), and pulmonary
      diffusion in human infants. Investigators will evaluate whether circulating progenitor cells
      (CPC)s are a biomarker for developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), investigators will
      relate circulating progenitor cells (CPCs) to the underlying pathophysiology, as assessed by
      pulmonary function testing methods that we developed for this very difficult age group to
      evaluate. A positive finding in the study would provide the rationale for future
      translational studies evaluating the therapeutic potential of circulating progenitor cells
      (CPCs) to stimulate lung development of premature infants, as there are currently no known
      therapeutic interventions that minimize or prevent the development of bronchopulmonary
      dysplasia (BPD). One of several approaches could be applied in the future to increase
      circulating progenitor cells (CPCs) in premature infants: 1) pharmacologic mobilization of
      pro-angiogenic cells from the bone marrow, 2) expansion of pro-angiogenic cells from an
      infant's cord blood for autologous infusion, and 3) transfusion of pooled pro-angiogenic
      cells from multiple donors.
