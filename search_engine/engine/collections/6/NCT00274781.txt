      Primary

        -  Determine the efficacy of arsenic trioxide and gemtuzumab ozogamicin to achieve complete
           and partial remissions in patients with advanced myelodysplastic syndromes.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the efficacy of this regimen, in terms of 50% decrease in Red Blood Cell (RBC)
           transfusion requirements and change in hemoglobin concentration from baseline in
           patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the platelet, neutrophil, bone marrow, and cytogenic response in patients
           treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the response duration in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the quality of life of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the safety and toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, open-label study.

      Patients receive arsenic trioxide IV over 1 hour once daily on days 1-5 in week 1 and then
      twice weekly in weeks 2-12. They also receive gemtuzumab ozogamicin IV over 2 hours on day 8.
      Treatment repeats every 12 weeks for up to 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, every 12 weeks during study treatment, and then 4
      weeks after the completion of study treatment.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study.
