    
      This survey was designed to examine the safety and efficacy of long-term use (96 weeks) of
      leuprorelin acetate 3 months depot for injection (Leuplin SR 11.25 mg for Injection) in
      premenopausal breast cancer patients in daily medical practice, as well as to examine factors
      that can influence the safety and efficacy of treatment with leuprorelin acetate SR 11.25 mg
      for injection (Leuplin SR 11.25 mg for Injection).

      For adults, 11.25 mg of leuprorelin acetate is usually administered subcutaneously once every
      12 weeks. Prior to injection, the plunger rod of the syringe is pushed upward with the needle
      pointed upward, allowing the entire suspension fluid contained to be transferred to the
      powder. The powder is then fully suspended in the fluid while ensuring that bubbles are not
      generated.
