      tacrolimus and MMF to the current strategy of tacrolimus and MMF dose adjustment in lung
      transplant recipients. The study will focus on the first three years post-transplantation, as
      treatment failures (including BOS) occur mainly during this post-transplantation period. As
      the aim of tacrolimus and MMF dose individualization is to avoid over- or underexposure, for
      the purpose of this study treatment failure will be a composite criterion gathering events
      which reflect both over- and underexposure to tacrolimus and MMF.

      Optimized TDM of tacrolimus and MMF based on blood tacrolimus and plasma MPA AUC Bayesian
      estimation will be compared to current strategies: tacrolimus dose adjustment based on trough
      levels (C0) and administration of a standard dose of MMF, decreased by the pulmonologist in
      case of adverse drug reactions or increased in case of inefficacy. The efficacy of optimized
      strategy vs. current strategies will be mainly evaluated through the incidence of treatment
      failure.
