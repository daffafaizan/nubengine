      anemia results from decreased body's iron content due to blood loss, poor dietary iron
      intake, malabsorption, or increased iron requirement. Immune activation drives a diversion of
      iron to storage sites, particularly the mononuclear phagocytes system in liver and spleen
      leads to poor hemoglobinization and anemia. Iron deficiency and immune activation lead to
      disturbances of iron homeostasis.(2) this trial will compare the response to iron deficiency
      anemia to lactoferrin plus ferrous poly maltose versus ferrous poly maltose in Children With
      Chronic Tonsillitis
