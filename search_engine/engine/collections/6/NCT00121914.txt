        -  Study group: PEI + long-acting somatostatin

        -  Control group: long-acting somatostatin alone

      Aims of the study:

        -  Does treatment with PEI+ long-acting somatostatin prolong survival as compared to
           treatment with long-acting somatostatin alone?

        -  Can time to tumour progression be extended in patients treated with PEI + long-acting
           somatostatin as compared to treatment with long-acting somatostatin alone?
