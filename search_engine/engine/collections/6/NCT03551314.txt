      fully elucidated. Currently, two modalities of non invasive ventilation are commonly used in
      Brazilian neonatal intensive care units: continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and nasal
      intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV). In this study, it was hypothesized that
      NIPPV will improve tidal volume when compared to CPAP. The objective of this study is to
      evaluate the effects of continuous positive airway pressure and nasal intermittent positive
      pressure ventilation on breathing pattern variables of very low birth weight neonates
      immediately after extubation. Soon after extubation, the neonates will be randomized into the
      CPAP-NIPPV (sequence 1) or the NIPPV-CPAP (sequence 2). The sequence will be assigned at
      random using sealed envelopes. Respiratory inductive plethysmography will be used to evaluate
      the breathing pattern (tidal volume, respiratory rate, minute ventilation, mean inspiratory
      flow) and chest wall motion (labor breathing index, inspiratory phase relation, expiratory
      phase relation, total phase relation and phase angle). Student t tests for paired samples
      will be used and the Wilcoxon test according to the data distribution. A significance level
      of 5% will be adopted. The analyzes will be performed by StatisticalPackage software for the
      Social SciencesÂ® (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA), version 17.0 for Windows.
