      efficacy/performance of the ReUnion RFX System. Efficacy/performance of the procedure will be
      measured by the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) Shoulder Score. Safety of the
      ReUnion RFX System will be demonstrated through reporting of device-related intraoperative
      and postoperative Adverse Events (AEs). Enrolled subjects will be assessed at Pre-Operative,
      Operative/Discharge, and at 6 Weeks, 6 Months, 12 Months, 24 Months and annually thereafter
      up to 10 years following the index procedure.
