      surveillance in a household cohort. From any individual in this population with any
      respiratory symptom or loss of smell or taste, with or without fever, investigators will
      collect a respiratory specimen and test these for SARS-CoV-2 virus by PCR, during 12 months.
      These cases will be identified through bi-weekly household visits, through an alert system
      involving community leaders and HDSS interviewers, or when presenting with symptoms at
      healthcare centres or the referral hospital. Demographic, epidemiological and clinical data
      (comorbidities, medication, obesity, HIV, TB, smoking) of possible cases and of the source
      population will be recorded at baseline; recent illness, potential risk exposure of each
      household member (including duration and type) to SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals, uptake of
      measures to reduce exposure/transmission, and barriers to the uptake of such measures, will
      be recorded/updated during every household visit.

      An age-stratified serial sero-survey will be conducted at baseline in a subset of the
      population in the population-based COVID19 surveillance, and at 3, 6 and 12 months, after
      confirmation of community transmission.
