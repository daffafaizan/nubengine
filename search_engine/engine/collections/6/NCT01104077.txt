    
      Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) is a cyst-like cancer of the pancreas that is
      increasingly being identified in medical practice, including during the screening of
      individuals at high risk of pancreatic cancer. It has been established that 10 to 20% of
      pancreatic cancers are familial. In comparison, there has been little research into the
      importance of genetic risk in IPMN incidence. The investigators will perform a retrospective
      chart review of patients with IPMN who were evaluated for surgical intervention at our
      tertiary referral center. The investigators are interested in determining the proportion of
      IPMN patients with a family history of pancreatic and other cancers. In addition, the
      investigators will assess if familial cancer risk is associated with increased risk for
      malignant IPMN and recurrence, relative to those patients without an inherited
      predisposition.
