    
      There are two basic aims of the study

        1. Prospective comparison of the reliability and accuracy of individual markers used for
           marking of a pathological axillary lymph node with subsequent targeted axillary
           dissection.

        2. Comparison of the number of complications during localizing and detection of individual
           markers and postoperative complications.

      In individual collaborating centers, these markers are commonly used in clinical practice for
      marking of a pathological lymph node in patients with breast carcinoma. The usual standard of
      practice and treatment will not be changed in any way; the patients will only be
      prospectively followed. The study will bring an answer to the question of which marker is the
      best for marking lymph nodes.

      Apart from the basic demographic and other data (patient age, side of the body, size and
      characteristics of the tumor (typing, grading, staging), type and time of surgery, the
      incidence of complications during implantation or detection of the marker, number of lymph
      nodes, complications after surgery, and the final histological findings, also the following
      outcome measures will be observed:

        -  depth of marker implantation (measured in mm)

        -  marker migration (measured in mm)

        -  success-rate of resection of the marked lymph node - assessment, whether the lymph node
           was removed (yes/no) using the respective marker, expressed in percent of successful
           removal for the respective marker

        -  time from localizing the pathological lymph node using the marker to surgery (measured n
           days)
