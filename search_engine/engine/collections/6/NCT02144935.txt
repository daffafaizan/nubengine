      questionnaires, PROMIS or Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System, are
      blocks of 8-10 questions. 7 blocks of questions for the parent and 7 similar blocks for the
      child: anxiety, depressive symptoms, fatigue, mobility, pain interference, peer
      relationships, upper extremity function.

      Participation via the Internet: When a child or family enters the Transverse Myelitis
      Association (TMA) website, they will be directed to information about the CAPTURE study. If
      the family is interested in participation, the TMA will give them the UT southwestern in
      Dallas, TX research coordinator information. It is up to the parent/guardian to contact the
      study staff from University Texas Southwestern. Once initial contact is complete, at the
      family's request, study staff will send the consent form to the interested family. The family
      will need to email or mail the consent back. Once the signed consent form is in hand, we will
      send the research survey to the email the parent provides. One survey for the parent, a
      separate but similar survey for a school aged child.

      We will invite parents of school aged children to complete a school survey. This is a one
      time only questionnaire. Ideally, the parents will complete this either 6 months or 1 year
      into their child's recovery of TM/AFM.

      We invite families living outside of North America to participate in the online survey. They
      need to be fluent in English, same as the North American cohort.
