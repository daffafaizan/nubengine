    
      This research study is a phase II clinical trial, the investigators are studying the safety
      and response rate of the combinations of elotuzumab, pomalidomide, bortezomib, dexamethasone
      (elo-PVD).

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved each of those drugs elotuzumab,
      pomalidomide, bortezomib, dexamethasone as a treatment option for Refractory or relapsed
      multiple myeloma.

      Pomalidomide is a drug that changes that enhances or suppresses your immune systems reaction
      to a stimulus.This change may help the body destroy tumor cells. Bortezomib is an inhibitor
      that targets how cells dispose of unneeded proteins. By blocking this process, bortezomib can
      help destroy unwanted cells. Dexamethasone is a steroid, that helps prevent inflammation in a
      wide variety of organs and acts against myeloma cells. Elotuzumab is a monoclonal antibody,
      Elotuzumab targets a protein that is highly common on the surface of multiple myeloma cells
      called SLAMF7.

      The combination of the drugs may provide an unique approach for treating the disease.
