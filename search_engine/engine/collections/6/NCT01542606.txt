      secretions having an elevated pH level, without false positives due to urine remains or
      incontinence. The study will also asses the physical comfort in using NORMA-SENSE gen 3 and
      the result reading clarity which includes the ability to visualize and interpret the
      NORMA-SENSE gen 3 results.
