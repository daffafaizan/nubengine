      procedures in the U.S. In our vascular practice, ultrasound-guidance is frequently used in
      patients with weak or absent pulses, known aberrant vascular anatomy, need for graft
      puncture, and to ensure accurate arterial puncture in patients expected to receive large
      doses of anti-thrombotic medications. Some practitioners routinely use this modality. The
      purpose of this study is to determine whether real-time ultrasound guidance is superior to
      fluoroscopic guidance in obtaining successful arterial cannulation during diagnostic and
      interventional catheter-based procedures in a primarily non-cardiac vascular patient
      population. Patients will be randomized to receive either real-time ultrasound-guided
      arterial access or fluoroscopic-guided access. Baseline patient demographics, co-morbidities,
      medications, pertinent laboratory data, and indications for procedure will be recorded.
      Procedural data recorded will include procedure type, type of access, operator, pulse
      quality, sheath size, closure device, angiographic data for access artery, antithrombotic
      medications used, and intra-procedural activated clotting times. Primary endpoint will be
      successful arterial cannulation by angiographic imaging. Secondary end points will be time to
      access, number of attempts, accidental venipunctures, first pass success, complication rates
      and hospital length of stay. Data regarding complications (patient history, examination,
      laboratory or imaging studies) will be included for a period of 90 days after the procedure.
