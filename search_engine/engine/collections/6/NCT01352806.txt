      placement both to achieve consistent success, and to avoid damage to other nearby structures.
      This prospective randomized study, will be performed in the pain management unit. We will
      assess patients who are scheduled to receive an epidural steroid injection. The investigator
      will request permission fro the ethics committee of Hadassah Medical Hospital.

      Three anesthesiologist will perform this study, every one of the anesthesiologist will be
      asked to identify intralaminar space by one technique and we will compare the accuracy of the
      identifying of the intralaminar space.
