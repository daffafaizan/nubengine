    
      This is an open labeled dose escalating trial in which a total of 32 subjects will receive
      one of four intranasal rFla-MBP vaccine doses according to the following chart:

      Group / N* / rFla-MBP

      A / 8/ 25 micrograms

      B / 8/ 125 micrograms

      C / 8/ 625 micrograms

      D / 8/ 1000 micrograms

      * minimum of 6 volunteers per group

      An interval no less than 60 days following the first dose will separate the first dose of
      each volunteer group receiving different rFla-MBP doses. All volunteers will receive three
      immunizations. The first dosing time point is Day 0, the second is Day 14 (+/- 1 day), the
      third is day 28 (+/- 2 days). Blood and stool specimens will be collected at intervals to
      examine systemic and mucosal vaccine antigen-specific immune responses. Vaccine safety will
      be actively monitored during vaccination and for 28 days following the third vaccine dose.
