      elevated serum aminotransferase levels and evidence of fatty liver in ultrasonography were
      presumed to have non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Those with NAFLD liver fat score greater than
      (-0.64) were enrolled. They were assigned to lifestyle modification alone or lifestyle
      modification plus smoking reduction groups.

      Liver fat content, fasting serum glucose, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate
      aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, triglyceride, cholesterol, high and low-density
      lipoprotein, homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance(HOMA-IR), and anthropometric
      measurements (body mass index and waist circumference) were checked at baseline and six
      months later.
