      the single-implant mandibular overdenture treatment. Sixty completely edentulous individuals
      will be included. First, new complete dentures will be fabricated for all of them. Panoramic
      radiographs and conventional tomograms of the mandibular midline region will be obtained in
      order to plan the implant placement surgery. After the adaptation period related to the use
      of the new dentures, a single implant (Titamax IT Cortical, Neodent, Curitiba, Brazil) will
      be installed in the mandibular midline of all participants. According to the primary
      stability obtained in the implant placement patients will be treated with an immediate
      loading protocol when achieving torque of at least 30 Ncm and implant stability quotient
      (ISQ) of at least 60. In cases of values below cited, conventional loading protocol will be
      adopted. Ball O-ring will be used as the attachment system for the mandibular overdenture.
      Clinical and patient-reported outcomes will be collected after 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after
      the installation of the overdentures.
