      (SPECT) and stress magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are performed rather than stress exercise
      electrocardiogram (ECG) in China, more patients undergo coronary computed tomographic
      angiography (CTA) for determining whether they should be sent to catheter lab. However,
      nearly 30% of patients sent to catheter lab were found without obstructive coronary artery
      disease (CAD) and this invasive procedure was unnecessary and overused partly. Fortunately,
      fractional flow reserve (FFR) based non-invasive CT algorithm technology (CT-FFR) showed a
      great potential in detecting functional myocardial ischemia related to coronary specific
      lesion (Discovery-Flow, DEFACTO and NXT trial)[1-3]. Moreover, clinical care guided by CT-FFR
      could provide benefits with equivalent clinical outcomes and lower expenditure, compared with
      routine clinical care over 1-year follow-up (Platform trial). On the other aspect, ADVANCE
      trial revealed that CT-FFR modified treatment recommendation was associated with less
      negative invasive coronary angiography (ICA), predicted revascularization and identified
      subjects at low risk of adverse events through 90 days in real-world. However, these studies
      was not randomized designed and selection bias still existed. So our registry is aim to
      evaluate whether CTA/CT-FFR outperforms the regular diagnostic care in ruling out patients
      without significantly obstructive CAD before catheter lab and improving clinical prognosis
      during follow-up in a randomized design.
