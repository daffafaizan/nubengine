      Italy. Forty healthy individuals will be enrolled in this study. In the same session in one
      randomly selected eye of each subject three consecutive measurements of foveal thickness will
      be performed using both TD OCT and FD OCT. All measurements will be obtained by the same
      experienced examinator.

      Time domain optical coherence tomography images will be obtained from each eye after pupil
      dilation using the Stratus OCT system (version 4.1. Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, CA).

      Spectral domain optical coherence tomography images will be obtained using the HRA-OCT
      Spectralis unit (Heidelberg Engineering GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany).

      All data will be analyzed with the statistical package MedCalc® version 8.1 for Windows
      (MedCalc®, Mariakerke, Belgium).

      The D'Agostino-Pearson test that computes a single P-value for the combination of the
      coefficients of Skewness and Kurtosis will be used to study the sample distribution.

      T-test will be used to compare means between Stratus and Spectralis measurements and
      orizontal and vertical measurements.

      To assess agreement between Spectralis and Stratus OCT foveal measurements the Bland and
      Altman plots of the agreement in foveal thickness will be used. For both orizontal and
      vertical foveal measurements the ratio (Spectralis/stratus OCT foveal thickness) will be
      plotted against the average of the two measurements.
