      I. Examine the feasibility (acceptance among University of Southern California [USC] Norris
      study team members and Twitter users in Los Angeles [LA] county) of targeted social media
      listening (SML) via Twitter as a tool for enhancing recruitment to cancer trials.

      II. Gain preliminary data on the impact (i.e., numbers recruited versus projected accrual
      compared to historic recruitment) of targeted social media listening (SML) as a tool for
      enhancing recruitment to cancer trials among Twitter users in LA county.

      III. Estimate the effect size of the number of people enrolled associated with the use of
      targeted social media listening (SML) via Twitter as a tool for enhancing recruitment to
      cancer trials.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients who mention specific cancer disease keywords and/or hashtags are identified and
      receive a message via Twitter. Patients are then contacted for recruitment into a clinical
      trial.
