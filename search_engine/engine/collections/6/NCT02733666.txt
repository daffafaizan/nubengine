      age, 6.7 years) were randomly divided into two groups. All participants had been diagnosed
      with lateral condyle fractures classified as Jacobs type II (unstable) or III. Closed
      reduction failed in all participants. Therefore, open reduction was performed under general
      anesthesia. One absorbable screw was used for fixation in the experimental group, while two
      1.8-mm K-wires were used in the control group. At 4-6 weeks postoperatively, the
      participants' plaster casts were removed, and functional training was started.
