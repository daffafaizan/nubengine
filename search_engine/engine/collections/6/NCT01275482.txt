      both, but the investigators cause local twitch response (isolated contraction of muscle
      fibers containing the latent trigger points)just in one group. So the investigators want to
      know whether the effectiveness of this technique is due to those local twitch responses,
      comparing both groups. The investigators asses Strength, range of motion, and overall,
      pressure pain thresholds to evaluate the pain sensitivity progress.
