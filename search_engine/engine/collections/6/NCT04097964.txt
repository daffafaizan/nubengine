      of the full FaCES (Facilitating Change for Excellence in SBIRT) adolescent change package for
      12 to 17 year old primary care patients. Primary care providers at two rural federally
      qualified health centers in New Mexico and Tennessee will be randomized as to when they
      receive training and begin delivering FaCES to their adolescent patients. FaCES includes
      targeted feedback based on the patient's endorsed substance use level on the S2BI screening
      instrument. Study participants will complete a baseline and follow-up assessment 3-months
      post study recruitment.
