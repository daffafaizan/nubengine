      elastic bandage and Unna boot, on time and on the healing characteristics of venous ulcers in
      Primary Health Care and the secondary objectives are to verify the effects of the therapies
      in tissue integrity and at the level of pain, to identify quality of life of the participants
      and to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the two therapies from the perspective of the
      Unified Health System. A randomized clinical trial is being carried out in two Primary Health
      Services in Porto Alegre city, with people with active venous ulcer. 126 venous ulcers, 63 in
      each group will be followed. The A group receives elastic compressive therapy (high
      compression elastic bandage) and the B group receives inelastic compressive therapy (Unna
      boot) by randomization. Once a week, during 26 weeks, a nurse applies the therapy according
      to the randomization group. And a blind evaluator for therapies will assess the
      characteristics of the ulcers and the size, on the first day and in every two weeks until 26Âª
      week.
