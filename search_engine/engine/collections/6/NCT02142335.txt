      Candidates for this study have melanoma that has spread to their lymph nodes or internal
      organs and that cannot be removed by a surgical procedure.

      The safety of this combination of drugs will also be looked at throughout this study.

      Rituxan will be administered IV at weeks 1 and 3 of each cycle. Abraxane will be administered
      IV weekly for 3 consecutive weeks. This is followed by 1 week of rest after which, the cycle
      is repeated. Following the second cycle, there will be a 4-week period of rest. Evaluation of
      response will occur on day 71 +/-3 days. If either disease stabilization or clear evidence of
      clinical response is observed two additional cycles of treatment will be administered.
      Lesions will be measured on the scan (CT or PET/CT), x-ray
