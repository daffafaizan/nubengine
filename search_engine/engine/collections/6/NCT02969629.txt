      efficacy of dopaminergic interventions in reducing pain remains questionable. This
      randomized, double blinded, placebo-controlled, cross-over study was aimed to explore the
      effect of the dopamine agonist apomorphine on spontaneous pain intensity and evoked cold
      clinical and experimental pain in patients with lumbar radicular neuropathic pain (NP).

      Data was collected from 35 patients (18 men, mean age 56.2Â±13.1 years). The following five
      pain measures were tested before (baseline) and 30, 75 and 120 min subsequent to subcutaneous
      injection of 1.5 mg apomorphine or placebo in two separate sessions: spontaneous pain
      intensity, threshold and tolerance to cold pain in the most painful site in the affected leg
      and in a remote healthy site in the dominant hand.
