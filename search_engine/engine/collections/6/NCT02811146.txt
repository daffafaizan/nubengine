      health by high morbidity and mortality rates that are associated. Studies show that changes
      in striated skeletal muscle of those individuals, possibly caused by progressive physical
      inactivity, contribute to the construction of the pathophysiology of this disease,
      emphasizing the importance of exercise for these patients. Exercise programs can be traced
      safer and related form the actual functional capacity thereof. Cardiac rehabilitation it is a
      set of activities that aims to ensure that patients with heart disease the best conditions,
      especially physical. In this context, non-invasive ventilation (NIV) is an alternative to
      provide an improved tolerance during exercise in patients with HF.

      GOALS: Evaluate the effectiveness of the use of NIV association to aerobic exercise in
      exercise programs supervised during cardiac rehabilitation exercise tolerance and quality of
      life in patients with heart failure when compared to performing these exercises without
      ventilatory support.

      METHODS: This is a clinical trial, controlled, randomized and blind to be developed with
      patients arising out of the main Recife reference centers in the care of patients with heart
      failure. It will be conducted assessments of functional capacity made by cardiopulmonary
      exercise testing (CPET), the Glittre-ADL test and through the questionnaire Duke Activity
      Status Index (DASI), assessment of quality of life using the questionnaire Minnesota Living
      with Heart Failure (MLWHF), and finally, in order to determine a clinical change, will be
      used to Patient Global Impression of Change Scale (PGIS).

      EXPECTED RESULTS: This study aims to demonstrate the efficacy of NIV continuously in cardiac
      rehabilitation programs, improvement of exercise tolerance, with consequent reflection in
      functional capacity and quality of life of this population.
