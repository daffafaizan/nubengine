    
      A prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled trial was performed. Consenting obese
      adult patients with impaired glucose tolerance, undergoing bariatric surgery, were
      randomized, by a computer, to receive placebo (0.9% Sodium-chloride) or dexmedetomidine 1
      ug/kg bolus in 10 minutes followed by an infusion of 0.5 ug/kg/h until the end of surgery.
      Baseline HgbA1c, glucose, and insulin plasmatic levels were measured. Subsequently, glucose
      and insulin levels were taken every 2 hours during the first 12 hours from the onset of the
      drug infusion. Intraoperative fentanyl and postoperative morphine consumption, pain score,
      the occurrence of emesis, and postoperative sedation levels were recorded as secondary
      outcomes.
