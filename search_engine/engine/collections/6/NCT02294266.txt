    
      Mephedrone (4-methylmetcathinone, 4-MMC) is a new psychoactive substance (NPS). Mephedrone is
      frequently used in combination with alcohol. At present, the effects of the interaction
      between mephedrone and alcohol in humans have not been previously evaluated in randomized
      controlled clinical trials.

      The aims of this study are 1) to evaluate the pharmacological effects after oral
      coadministration of mephedrone and alcohol and 2) determine the pharmacokinetics changes of
      mephedrone and alcohol concentrations after oral coadministration of mephedrone and alcohol.
