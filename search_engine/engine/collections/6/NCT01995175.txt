      years for the occurrence of Lower Respiratory Tract Infections. Through active and passive
      surveillance, any suspected case will be identified, assessed during an examination visit and
      followed up until completion through a diary card. Full symptomology will be assessed during
      the examination visit. The disease course and all healthcare utilization will be subsequently
      collected through a two-week diary card and contact with ay healthcare providers involved in
      management of the disease. RSV detection will occur through quantitative PCR of collected
      nasal swabs. A baseline cord blood serum sample of all subjects and a follow-up blood serum
      sample from a sub-cohort will also be collected to assess antibody levels at various points
      in time and in relation to risk of RSV LRTI.
