    
      This study is a phase II/III, multicenter, randomized, open-label clinical trial of
      non-inferiority design comparing a new regimen to the World Health Organization-endorsed
      conventional regimen for fluoroquinolone-sensitive MDR-TB. The control arm uses a
      conventional treatment regimen with second-line drugs including injectables for 20-24 months.
      The investigational arm uses a new shorter regimen including delamanid, linezolid,
      levofloxacin, and pyrazinamide for 9 or 12 months depending on time to sputum culture
      conversion. The primary outcome is the treatment success rate at 24 months after treatment
      initiation. Secondary outcomes include time to sputum culture conversion on liquid and solid
      media, proportions of sputum culture conversion on liquid media after 2 and 6 months of
      treatment, treatment success rate according to pyrazinamide resistance, and occurrence of
      adverse events grade 3 and above as evaluated by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
      Events. The population number is calculated as 102 per group (204 in total).
