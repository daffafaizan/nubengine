      volunteers were subjected to the many tests: history, session III of the Unified Scale
      Modified Parkinson's Disease - Unified Parkinson 's Disease Rating Scale, Ten meters walk
      test - Walk Test 10 meters and shoot gait, (using Studio Version 8 software). On the same
      day, the subjects underwent assessment of brain excitability to determine motor threshold and
      amplitude of the motor evoked potential (MEP). The randomization of the volunteers was
      conducted by an external search through opaque envelopes ordered according to a random
      distribution. The subjects were divided into two groups : control group , this group
      submitted to Transcranial Stimulation sessions a sham Continuous Current (sham tDCS) and gait
      training , and Experimental group, subjected to the stimulation by Transcranial Direct
      Current sessions (active tDCS ) and gait training.
