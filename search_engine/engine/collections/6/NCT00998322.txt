      of cancer death for both men and women. The American Cancer Society estimates that 37,170 men
      and women (18,830 men and 18,340 women) will be diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and 33,370
      men and women will die of pancreatic cancer in 2008.

      Activating KRAS mutations are the most frequent genetic abnormalities in pancreatic cancer
      (occurring in 75% to 95% of patients).

      REOLYSIN has been demonstrated to kill a wide variety of cells with mutations along the RAS
      pathway, including pancreatic cancer cells.

      The Phase 2 study is designed to characterize the efficacy and safety of REOLYSIN given
      intravenously in combination with gemcitabine every 3 weeks in patients with advanced
      pancreatic cancer.

      Response is a primary endpoint of this trial. Tumors will be evaluated by CT scan within 14
      days of starting treatment, then at 6 weeks, and then every 6 weeks thereafter.

      The safety of the gemcitabine and REOLYSIN combination will be assessed by the evaluation of
      the type, frequency and severity of adverse events, changes in clinical laboratory tests,
      immunogenicity and physical examination.

      Patients may continue to receive therapy under this protocol, provided he/she has not
      experienced either progressive disease or unacceptable drug-related toxicity that does not
      respond to either supportive care or dose reduction.
