      System (BGMS) and four additional Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems (BGMS) from other
      manufacturers. All meter BG results were compared with plasma results obtained with a
      reference laboratory glucose method (YSI Glucose Analyzer). Performance of the five systems
      were evaluated across the glucose range of the BGMSs using capillary blood. All testing and
      lancing were performed by study staff and some samples were tested from subject fingertips.
      Additionally, some blood samples were glycolyzed to lower the glucose concentration levels
      and glucose solution was added to other samples to raise glucose concentration levels.
