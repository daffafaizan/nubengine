      induction chemotherapies obtained by adding either Lenalidomide or Ibrutinib to a standard
      Rituximab-High Dose (HD) Methotrexate (MTX) based induction chemotherapy regimen. The R-MPV
      regimen is chosen as the backbone chemotherapy because of its wide use with robust
      reproducible results and a good and manageable toxicity profile
