      systems worldwide. Due to the large number of infections around the world, the implementation
      of strategies to reduce the number of intubations and the need for invasive mechanical
      ventilation becomes important. In addition to the inability of the Mexican health system to
      respond, patients under invasive ventilation have not had a favorable survival outcome. Up to
      97% mortality has been reported in patients requiring intubation. The exact cause of this
      poor prognosis is not yet known. Early recognition of hypoxemic patients could help with the
      results. It seems reasonable in these patients to perform procedures to improve the clinical
      respiratory picture before intubation in less severe cases due to the aforementioned. Prone
      patient placement during invasive mechanical ventilation is a widespread practice in the
      management of severe ARDS of other etiologies. Currently, few attempts have been made to
      implement the prone position in patients who spontaneously ventilate with supplemental
      oxygen, high-flow nasal cannulas, or noninvasive mechanical ventilation. Taking into account
      that it is a procedure that does not require additional infrastructure within the services
      and does not represent an additional cost for its implementation, it becomes a valuable tool
      in the context of COVID-19 where intubation is associated with high mortality and in a
      Additionally, there are mechanical ventilator deficits in most hospitals. This work has
      feasibility to be carried out because it will be carried out in critical areas that have
      equipment and trained personnel for it in the different shifts, in addition to having
      patients diagnosed with COVID-19.
