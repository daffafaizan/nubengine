      divided into 4 types: Tradition (from origin to insertion), Cross, New (from insertion to
      origin) and Control (non-taping). The order of types will be assigned to subjects randomly.
      The 4 types of taping will be applied in 2 days that one week apart. Ultimate physical
      rehabilitation system (Pris RS, BTE, USA) will be used to access the differences of muscle
      strength and muscular endurance between different taping skills. The aims are to investigate
      the effect of the different method of kinesiology tape on performance of fatigued biceps
      brachii.
