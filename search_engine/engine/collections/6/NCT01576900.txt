      caused by overactive bladder, the combined therapy of anticholinergics plus behavioural
      modification has been established as the first line therapy. However, nocturia mainly comes
      from polyuria has been treated with desmopressin pharmacotherapy and the effect of behaviour
      modification education has not yet evaluated. Therefore, in this study, short term
      synergistic effect of combinational treatment of desmopressin and SyBeMeP (Systemized
      Behavioral Modification education Program) comparing desmopressin monotherpy will be
      evaluated in patients with nocturia.

      Control group: Desmopressin (Minirin Tablet 0.1-0.4mg/day) + simple instruction Study group:
      Desmopressin (Minirin Tablet 0.1-0.4mg/day) + SyBeMeP. Patients will be randomized and
      assigned to each group at the ratio of 1:1. At screening visit, flowmetry and residual urine
      measurement, Complete Blood Count (CBC), atypical diabetes mellitus (ADM), electrolytes,
      urinalysis micro, urine concentration, and demographic examination will be done. Voiding
      diary will be distributed. At 2nd visit, patients will be randomized and each treatment will
      be initiated. IPSS, ICIQ-nocturia, and PPTB will be completed. Voiding diary will be
      distributed. At 3rd visit (2 weeks after from 2nd visit): IPSS, ICIQ-nocturia, and PPTB will
      be completed. Assess the treatment outcome including voiding diary analysis.
