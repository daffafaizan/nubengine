      individuals synthesize abnormal type I collagen. This results in the formation of abnormal
      bone matrix and a predisposition to bony fractures. Many unsuccessful attempts have been made
      to increase the bone mineral density of these individuals in the hope that this will improve
      the strength of their bones and result in a decreased fracture rate.

      Bisphosphonates are synthetic analogs of pyrophosphate which have an affinity for
      hydroxyapatite. These drugs act primarily on osteoclasts, impairing the development of
      immature osteoclasts and the function of mature osteoclasts, as well as depressing chemical
      signaling to adjacent cells, resulting in a shift in the balance of deposition and resorption
      in bone. Conditions for which bisphosphonates are being used in children include four broad
      categories, 1) a primary defect in bone mineralization 2) bone matrix abnormalities 3) bone
      abnormalities due to systemic disease or the effects of treatment of systemic disease or 4)
      significant soft tissue calcification with no bone abnormality.

      Pamidronate, an aminobisphosphonate, is a potent inhibitor of bone resorption. The purpose of
      this protocol is to evaluate the effectiveness of pamidronate in children with types III and
      IV osteogenesis imperfecta when the cycle time is varied. We plan to compare children treated
      with pamidronate on an every-three-month infusion cycle to children treated every six months
      with the same dose per infusion. We also plan to continue to compare children treated with
      pamidronate and growth hormone to children treated with pamidronate alone.
