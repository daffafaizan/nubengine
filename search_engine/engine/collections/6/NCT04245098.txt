    
      Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) can be caused by the deposition and accumulation of misfolded
      proteins called amyloid and is often an early manifestation of systemic amyloidosis.

      Patients with cardiac amyloidosis often have carpal tunnel syndrome that precedes cardiac
      manifestations by several years, and many patients will have undergone surgery for idiopathic
      carpal tunnel syndrome since the protein also deposits in the transversal carpal ligament of
      the hand.

      The investigators sought to identify the prevalence and type of amyloid deposits in patients
      undergoing carpal tunnel surgery and evaluate for cardiac involvement
