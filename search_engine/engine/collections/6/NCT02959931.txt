      pills helps to lower blood pressure. Also, the amount of oral potassium taken can improve how
      well the participants blood vessels work. These studies have focused on potassium given in
      the form of a pill. The investigators are interested in the effect of potassium consumed
      through food sources and how it will effect arterial health and blood pressure. The world
      health organization (WHO) recommends a K⁺ intake of at least 3510 mg/day from food for
      adults, excluding those with impaired K⁺ excretion. In this study the investigators aim to
      provide approximately 75% (approximately 2000 mg) of the total daily recommended intake for
      potassium in one meal. The investigators do not know whether dietary potassium (not pill
      form) will acutely improve the arterial health and if it will cause a decrease in blood
      pressure. The investigators hypothesis to see an improvement in vascular function following a
      high potassium meal compared to a low potassium meal.
