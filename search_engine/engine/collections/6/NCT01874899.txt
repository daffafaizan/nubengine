    
      A single-center, prospective, randomized study with a two-arm crossover design. The primary
      objective of this study is to establish threshold and therapeutic stimulation parameters for
      the RestoreSensor neurostimulator in response to postural changes. The secondary objective is
      to compare the effectiveness of spinal cord stimulation with manual versus automatic
      position-adaptive settings for chronic refractory low back and/or extremity pain.
