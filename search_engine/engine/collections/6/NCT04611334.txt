      accepted in the nephrology clinic of a northern medical center in Taiwan. It is estimated
      that 80 patients will be enrolled. After the patients have signed the consent form, use the
      sealed envelope website (http://www.sealedenvelope.com) will randomly assigned to the
      experimental group and the control group. The experimental group receive HRV biofeedback for
      four consecutive weeks, combined with eight-week StressEraser home practice; the control
      group received general routine care. Both groups of cases were repeated three times on the
      day of acceptance, one month and three months after the case were accepted, a total of three
      repeated measurements of physiological indicators (HRV, IL-6, CRP) and symptom scales (Piper
      Fatigue Scale, Chinese version of Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Table, the second edition of the
      Chinese version of the Baker Depression Scale) to evaluate the effectiveness of HRV
      biofeedback. The research results will be statistically analyzed with SPSS version 23.0, and
      with descriptive statistics, the distribution of basic demographic data and the measurement
      results of various indicators will be analyzed. Paired-sample t-test, independent-sample
      t-test, and multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) were used to analyze the statistical
      results of intervention effectiveness inference; the significance level was set to 0.05.
