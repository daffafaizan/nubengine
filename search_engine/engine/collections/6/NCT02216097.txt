    
      This is a Phase II, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group design study in male and
      female subjects with moderate-to-severe Post Traumatic Stress Disorder between the ages of 18
      and 60 years old. During this study, a dose of 4 mg PF-04457845 will be administered in the
      morning on Days 1-7. On Each subject will undergo a resting state fMRI (pre and post and day
      8), a fearful vs. neutral faces fMRI task and a fear extinction fMRI paradigm. The Emotional
      Faces Paradigm and resting state tasks will be performed on Day 1 (prior to drug or placebo)
      and on Day 8. Acquisition of fear conditioning will be performed during the first imaging
      session on Day 1. After the first imaging session on Day 1, subjects will complete behavioral
      rating scales and then be dosed. Approximately six hours after dosing subjects will re-enter
      the scanner and perform the fear extinction paradigm. On Day 2, subjects will perform the
      fear extinction memory retention task within the scanner. Further physiological monitoring,
      including skin conductance and heart rate, will take place during the fear extinction
      paradigm. One safety follow-up visit will occur between Days 11-18.
