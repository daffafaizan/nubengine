      prepackaged, moistened cloths with a standardized cleaning method compared to the previous
      standard-of-care for catheter care and maintenance. The primary objective is to investigate
      if the implementation of prepackaged cleansing cloths with a standardized cleaning protocol
      for all indwelling urinary catheter (IUC) care and maintenance provides a reduction in
      CAUTIs. The ReadyCleanse complete cleansing system will replace the previous
      standard-of-care. The ReadyCleanse intervention will be compared to the previous
      standard-of-care retrospectively.
