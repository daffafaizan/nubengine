    
      Is a Randomized trial to preterms infants <1500g and less than 34 weeks with RDS requiring
      machanical ventilation in the extubation period, randomized to receive NIPPV or NCPAP once
      extubation criteria were met. Parental written informed consent is required previous
      extubation. The failure rate is defined as the need for re-intubation and mechanical
      ventilation).

      Exclusion criteria are: major congenital anomalies; presence of cardiovascular
      instability;intubation less than 2 hours; mechanical ventilation more than 14 days, using
      muscle relaxant, airway anomalies, consent not provided or refused.

      Outcome measures:

      The primary outcome was to assess the need for re-intubation within the first 72 hours after
      extubation in the 2 groups.

      The criteria for failure were met by at least 1 of the following:

      pH < 7.25 and PaCO2 > 65 mmHg; recurrent apnea more than 2 episodes per hour associated with
      bradycardia; during 4 hour continuous; 2 episodes of apnea that required bagand-mask
      ventilation in any time during the study; or a PaO2 < 50 mm Hg with a fraction of inspired
      oxygen > 0.6. The secondary outcomes concerning respiratory support were total duration on
      ETT ventilation, total duration on NCPAP, total duration on supplemental oxygen, incidence of
      pneumothorax,BPD and dead. Other outcomes included incidence of patent ductus arteriosus
      (PDA), necrotizing enterocolitis, intraventricular hemorrhage grades 3 and 4, retinopathy of
      prematurity stage 3, time to full feeds, and length of hospital stay.

      Sample size calculations for the primary outcome: We estimated that there would be a more
      than 80% chance of detecting 43% difference between the groups (alpha 0.05) when samplesize
      (n) is 110 patients for each mode of treatment.
