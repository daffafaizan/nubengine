    
      Background:

        -  Patients receiving care at the NIH Clinical Center are required to be enrolled on a
           clinical protocol.

        -  Following participation in a treatment protocol, it may be in the best interest of the
           patient to continue to be followed at the Clinical Center.

        -  The National Cancer Institute Surgery Branch (NCI-SB) conducts clinical trials utilizing
           gene transfer. The current U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requirements for
           long-term follow-up are up to fifteen years for some products. As this time-period is
           frequently longer than studies are expected to be open, a long-term follow-up protocol
           is necessary to ensure the follow-up of these participants.

      Objective:

      -Primary objective:

      --Provide a mechanism for long-term follow-up of participants who have participated in
      research studies in the NCI-SB.

      Eligibility:

        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years.

        -  Participant has been enrolled on an NCI-SB treatment protocol.

      Design:

        -  Participant will undergo physical exams, laboratory evaluation, imaging, or phone
           follow-up as clinically indicated.

        -  Procedures that entail more than minimal risk to the patient should not be performed for
           research purposes on this protocol.
