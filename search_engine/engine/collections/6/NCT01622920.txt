      measure enamel thickness in less curvaceous anterior incisor (front) teeth, and ultimately
      monitor erosive tooth surface loss (TSL), which mainly occurs on anterior (front) teeth and
      the occlusal (top) surface of posterior (back) teeth. In this study, quantifying enamel
      thickness with ultrasound will provide data which will be assessed for reproducibility and to
      determine whether or not ultrasound is a potentially viable tool to measure and monitor acid
      erosion of teeth. This would allow dentists to reinforce advice to patients to reduce acidic
      consumption, and will motivate them to keep whatever is remaining of their 'precious' enamel
      tissue, which if lost, will necessitate fillings to be made. These fillings will require
      future repairs and possible remakes, as they have median survival rates of five years.
