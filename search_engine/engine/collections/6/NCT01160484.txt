      preclinical studies and impressive response rates (73 & 89%) in early clinical trials for MM
      patients with relapsed/refractory disease as well as first-line therapy. In addition, the
      efficacy of PLD with bortezomib in anthracycline-insensitive patients has been greater than
      single-agent bortezomib when comparing across studies. The immunomodulatory drugs,
      thalidomide and lenalidomide, target the tumor cell microenvironment, are antiangiogenic,
      have an immune activation effect and also exert a direct cytotoxic effect on myeloma cells. A
      phase 1 clinical study by our group also demonstrated that low dose PLD, administered at a
      more frequent dosing schedule, in combination with bortezomib, and dexamethasone (DVD
      regimen) is well tolerated and associated with high response rates and durable responses. In
      this phase II prospective trial, we will evaluate this regimen and show that this change
      enhances the DVD-R regimen's safety and efficacy for patients with relapsed/refractory MM.
