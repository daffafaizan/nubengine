      For every patient two contra-lateral class I carious molars will be selected, so the total
      number of included molars will be 46 molars. One contra-lateral molar will be randomly
      assigned to the chemo-mechanical (Brix 3000) caries removal technique and the other will be
      assigned to the conventional rotary one. From every molar two dentin specimens will be
      collected (baseline and after excavation) with a total of 92 samples
