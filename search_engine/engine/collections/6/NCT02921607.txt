      the leading causes of hospital admission worldwide, particularly in those over-65 years.
      Patients with heart failure frequently require acute hospitalisation and are at increased
      risk of mortality (more than half of heart failure patients will die within five years of
      initial diagnosis, American Heart Association). The high hospital admission rate and
      readmission reduce quality of life and significantly drive up the costs of health care
      provision for these patients. Moreover, there is a high variability in the reported
      readmission rates across institutions and countries, indicating that the structure of health
      care delivery is variable and of significant importance to outcome in this population. This
      study sets out to investigate the most clinically effective and cost- efficient method of
      delivering care to patients with heart failure focusing on the phase immediately before
      hospital admission, the hospital stay and the immediate discharge period, through analysis of
      the current standards of practice in both Ireland and the United Kingdom.
