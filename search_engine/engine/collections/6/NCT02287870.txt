      with twice the anesthetic intensity, four to five times the metabolization and half the side
      effect of procaine. The chloroprocaine hydrochloride product made in China has been on sale
      since 2002. To determine the clinical efficacy of low-epidural anesthesia with chloroprocaine
      versus lidocaine, the investigators carried out a prospective, randomized, double-blinded
      multi-centre clinical trial. The results demonstrate that epidural anesthesia using
      chloroprocaine has a more rapid onset time and shorter duration than with lidocaine. It can
      also provide a reliable sensory and motor block in epidural anesthesia, and is thus a more
      attractive alternative than lidocaine for middle and short duration surgical procedures.
