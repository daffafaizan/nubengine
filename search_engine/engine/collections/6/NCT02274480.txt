      be composed of patients on similar anthracycline therapy and dose but without a decline in
      LVEF on Cardiac MRI (CMR). Clinic visits with monitoring for cardiotoxicity occur as part of
      standard of care after therapy initiation. The study and control group will be composed of 15
      patients each. At the discretion of the treating physician, patients will be recruited from
      the Breast Medical Oncology Service.
