    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if the administration of post-Induction age-adjusted intrathecal triple
      therapy (ITT) on a Modified Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (MBFM) interim maintenance high-dose
      methotrexate (IMHDM) backbone will improve 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) of children
      with high-risk (HR) B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) compared to age-adjusted intrathecal
      (IT) methotrexate (MTX). (Completed effective March 19, 2018) II. To determine, in a
      randomized fashion, if the cyclophosphamide + etoposide containing regimen (Experimental Arm
      1) will improve the 4-year DFS of children, adolescents, and young adults with very high-risk
      (VHR) B-ALL compared to a modified MBFM-IMHDM regimen that contains a second IM (Control
      Arm). (Completed effective February 15, 2017)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the toxicity and tolerability of post-Induction age-adjusted ITT compared to
      age-adjusted IT MTX in children with HR B-ALL. (Completed effective March 19, 2018) II. To
      determine the toxicity and tolerability of Experimental Arm 1 compared to the Control Arm in
      children, adolescents, and young adults with VHR B-ALL. (Completed effective February 15,
      2017) III. To determine whether a single-arm, modified Induction with limited anthracycline
      exposure and post-Induction therapy regimen with MBFM-interim maintenance intermediate dose
      methotrexate (IMIDM) and reduced vincristine (vincristine sulfate)/steroid pulse frequency
      and enhanced supportive care in children with Down syndrome (DS) and HR B-ALL will result in
      a >= 65% 5-year DFS and < 10% Induction mortality.

      IV. To describe the outcomes for children and young adults with Philadelphia chromosome
      (Ph)-like B-ALL and a predicted TKI-sensitive mutation treated with dasatinib plus
      MBFM-IMHDM.

      V. To determine the toxicity and tolerability of MBFM-IMIDM in children with DS and HR B-ALL.

      VI. To estimate overall survival (OS) rates both overall and by regimen a) for HR B-ALL and
      b) VHR B-ALL patients.

      VII. To determine the incidence of osteonecrosis (ON), defined by magnetic resonance (MR)
      imaging, and to characterize the natural history of clinically silent ON in children,
      adolescents, and young adults 10 years of age and greater and to assess the role of drugs
      (i.e., asparaginase and methotrexate) in addition to corticosteroids, in the risk for
      development of ON. (Completed accrual July 2016) VIII. To determine if the prevalence of
      cognitive deficits measured by CogState, in children (ages 6 to < 13 years) with HR- and VHR
      B-ALL at 1 year off therapy, is significantly higher than the normative population (> 14%) in
      the following domains: working memory, executive function, visual motor, processing speed,
      and visual attention.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine if the reduction of minimal residual disease (MRD) from end-Induction to
      end-Consolidation is greater for children, adolescents, and young adults with VHR B-ALL
      receiving Experimental Arm 1 compared to the Control Arm. (Closed effective October 20, 2017)
