    
      This open label, multicenter study will be conducted in 2 parts: a dose-escalation phase
      (Part 1) and a dose-expansion phase (Part 2).

      In both Part 1 and Part 2, eligible patients will be assigned to receive oral D07001-softgel
      on Days 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, 12, 15, 17, and 19 of a 21-day cycle (9 doses per cycle).

      Part 1: Dose Escalation Phase (Phase 1b) Part 1 of the study will follow a 3+3 dose
      escalation scheme at predefined dose levels. There will be sequential cohorts of 3 to 6
      patients each with increasing doses of 40 mg, 60 mg, 80 mg, 120 mg, and 160 mg per cohort.
      There will be no intra patient dose escalation. Cycle 1 (21 days) is defined as the dose
      limiting toxicity (DLT) assessment period.

      Part 2: Dose Expansion Phase (Phase 2) In Part 2 of the study, eligible patients will be
      randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive D07001-softgel in an open label manner at 1 of the 2
      dose levels selected for expansion. Twenty (20) patients will be enrolled to each dose
      expansion cohort. Patients will be treated until withdrawal from treatment due to disease
      progression according to RECIST v1.1, withdrawn consent, or when another treatment
      discontinuation criterion is met. Patients who are discontinued from study drug for reasons
      other than disease progression or toxicity in the first 2 cycles of Part 2 will be replaced.
