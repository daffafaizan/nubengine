      Mark approved PROMUS Element™ Everolimus-Eluting Coronary Stent System (PROMUS Element),
      which combines the Element™ stent (the latest generation stent from Boston Scientific
      Corporation [BSC, Natick, Massachusetts, United States]), everolimus, and the poly (n butyl
      methacrylate) (PBMA) and poly (vinylidene fluoride co hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP)
      polymers. The PROMUS Element, received CE Mark on November 3rd 2009; it is currently under
      investigation in the PLATINUM clinical trial, and has great promise as it combines BSC's
      novel stent technology with the everolimus drug and polymers that have demonstrated excellent
      performance in the SPIRIT clinical program.

      PROMUS Element comprises the following key components: everolimus, 2 polymers, and the
      Element stent component. The same everolimus and polymer combination is commercially
      available in many countries on the MULTI-LINK VISION™ stent. It is manufactured and
      distributed by Abbott as the XIENCE™ V Everolimus Eluting Coronary Stent System (XIENCE V),
      and also distributed by BSC as the identical stent system, also manufactured by Abbott, as
      the PROMUS™ Everolimus-Eluting Coronary Stent System (PROMUS). The names XIENCE V and PROMUS
      are used synonymously within this protocol.

      While PROMUS Element is a new DES system, its constituent parts are either approved by the
      Food and Drug Administration (FDA, i.e., drug and polymers from PROMUS, P070015), are under
      investigation in an FDA-approved trial (i.e., Element stent component in the PERSEUS trial,
      G060237), or have received an approvable letter from the FDA. The balloon component material
      of the PROMUS Element delivery system is the same as that used in TAXUS Liberté (P060008),
      which received an approvable letter on February 11, 2008. The PROMUS Element stent delivery
      system is from the Apex™ Monorail™ PTCA Dilatation Catheter (P860019/S208), which received an
      approvable letter on October 24, 2006. Table 1 compares the TAXUS Express2, TAXUS Liberté,
      and PROMUS Element stent systems.
