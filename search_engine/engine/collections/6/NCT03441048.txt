      challenge. Nearly 60% of AML patients ultimately relapse or have refractory disease, and
      failure to achieve remission in this population is almost universally fatal. Therefore, a
      critical need exists for the development of novel therapies.

      Currently, for RR-AML, many institutions utilize the chemotherapy regimen of CLAG-M
      (cladribine, cytarabine, G-CSF, mitoxantrone) based on a reported morphological complete
      remission (CR) rate of 58% in prospective clinical trials. Because of this, and its favorable
      performance when compared with outcomes reported for other regimens utilized in RR-AML, we
      believe enhancing the efficacy of CLAG-M is a rational approach to improve therapy in RR-AML.

      A promising approach that could enhance the clearance of leukemic blasts when added to CLAG-M
      chemotherapy is a monoclonal antibody radioconjugate directed against markers expressed in
      leukemic cells. Radiation has known cytotoxic properties in chemo-resistant AML. The benefit
      of an antibody radioconjugate would be leukemic specific delivery of potent radiotherapy with
      potentially minimal systemic off-target side-effects. One such antibody radioconjugate is
      Lintuzumab-Ac225, a highly cytotoxic alpha radiation emitter that targets the CD33 cell
      surface antigen, which is expressed on leukemic cells.

      In this novel study, we aim to add the radioconjugated antibody Lintuzumab-Ac225 to salvage
      CLAG-M chemotherapy in order to improve the treatment response for patients with RR-AML.
