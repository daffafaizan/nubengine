      levels, the investigators propose the following randomized, double-blinded, placebo
      controlled protocol in relatively healthy volunteers. The investigators will evaluate
      aldosterone and cortisol production in response to an angiotensin II infusion under the
      following test conditions: 1) placebo, 2) simvastatin therapy (lipophilic statin), and 3)
      pravastatin therapy (hydrophilic statin). Measurements will be made to assess the effect of
      both acute (single dose) and chronic (6 and 12 weeks) therapy of the two statin medications.
