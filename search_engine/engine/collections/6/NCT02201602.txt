      (T2DM). SU promotes insulin secretion from the pancreatic islet beta cell via binding and
      inhibition of the ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channel. The KATP channel is made up of two
      subcomponents, an inner Kir6.2 K+ channel (coded by the KCNJ11 gene) and an outer SU receptor
      1 (SUR1) (coded by the ABCC8 gene). Although all SUs are mechanistically similar in terms of
      increasing insulin secretion, they bind to distinct regions of Kir 6.2 and SUR1 to exert
      their function. Different types of SU (e.g. tolbutamide, glibenclamide, glipizide,
      glimepiride and gliclazide) can therefore be grouped by their binding sites (A/B/A+B site) on
      the KATP channel [3]. Interestingly, the KCNJ11 E23K (rs5219) variant was shown to confer
      susceptibility to T2DM and the ABCC8 S1369A (rs757110) variant was found to be in complete
      linkage disequilibrium with it i.e. inherited together as a genetic block (haplotype). A
      recent in vitro molecular study suggested that the minor haplotype (K23/A1369) of KATP
      channel is sensitive to inhibition by gliclazide (binds to A-site) but not glibenclamide
      (binds to A+B site), and that the increased responsiveness to gliclazide was largely due to
      the A1369 allele. Understanding how the response to these two SUs may vary with the presence
      of the minor haplotype (K23/A1369) would therefore be beneficial for customization of patient
      treatment to achieve better clinical outcomes.
