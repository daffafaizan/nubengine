      sleep problems. Nutrition and low physical activity may predispose to chronic pain. To gain
      information on the life style factors of adult chronic pain patients referred to university
      hospital or central hospital pain clinics in Finland, 477 patients have been recruited to the
      study. The patients fill in questionnaires on sociodemographic factors, pain, medication, use
      of health services, physical activity, smoking, use of alcohol or other substances, sleep,
      quality of life, nutrition and psychological factors at their first visit to the pain clinic.
      Height, weight, waist circumference, blood pressure and pulse are measured by the study
      nurse. A blood sample for analysis of blood sugar, cholesterol (total, LDL, HDL),
      triglycerides, HbA1c and sensitive C-reactive protein (CRP) is taken. The pain clinician
      records the pain diagnosis, medication and other methods of pain management chosen. The
      patients will be sent follow-up questionnaires at 2 years and 5 years after baseline.
