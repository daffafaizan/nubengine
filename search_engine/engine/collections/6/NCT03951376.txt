        -  to co-create (involving adolescents, families, school staff, clinicians, policy makers)
           an innovative resilience holistic program in schools for the promotion of mental health
           in youth between 12 and 14 years;

        -  to deploy an intervention in five different pan-European regions;

        -  to better understand the natural history of mental disorders according to the resilience
           level and provide evidence of specific resilience factors promoting positive mental
           well-being longitudinally;

        -  to demonstrate the effectiveness and predict future impact of an intervention in terms
           of improvement of quality of life, mental well-being, and academic performance, and a
           reduction of absenteeism and bullying cases;

        -  to transfer the programme to Europe and beyond by disseminating the results and enabling
           innovative action plans for mental well-being in the youth.

      The UPRIGHT programmeÂ´s conceptual framework is structured in four different domains
      including skills for coping, efficacy, social and emotional learning and mindfulness
      practice. The intervention was developed by an innovative co-creation process (co-design,
      co-production and co-customization) participating five European regions representative of the
      cultural and socioeconomic variability (Lower Silesian in Poland, Basque Country in Spain,
      Trento in Italy, Denmark and Reykjavik capitol area in Iceland).
