    
      This Expanded Access Program will allow clinicians to use sulopenem etzadroxil/probenecid for
      the treatment of patients with serious or immediately life-threatening complicated urinary
      tract infection due to quinolone-nonsusceptible uropathogens where there are no satisfactory
      oral alternatives to use as step-down therapy after receiving an initial course of effective
      intravenous therapy. The recommended dose of sulopenem etzadroxil/probenecid 500 mg/ 500 mg
      is one bilayer tablet orally twice daily, taken with food whenever possible. No dose
      adjustment is required for patients with renal impairment. Duration of therapy will be at the
      discretion of the prescribing clinician, depending on the type of infection being treated and
      the response to therapy, and is expected to be less than ten days total.
