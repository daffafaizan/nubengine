      care. Both groups receive a resource packet containing information about caring for someone
      with dementia and a list of local resources. Caregivers in the intervention group also
      receive a series of telephone calls over 12 months, during which education, emotional
      support, and training in problem-solving skills are provided by trained therapists.
      Caregivers in the standard care group receive no additional psychosocial intervention.
      Participants are assessed pre-treatment, mid-treatment (6 months), post-treatment, and at a
      3-month follow-up.
