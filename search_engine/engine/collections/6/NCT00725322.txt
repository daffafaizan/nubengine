      with normally non-painful stimuli results in pain. Injected local anesthetics are often
      effective in providing temporary relief. In the course of clinical practice the investigators
      have observed that a number of patients with cutaneous allodynia have had marked persistent
      benefit from subcutaneous injection of Botulinum toxin Type A.

      Rather than killing targeted neurons, Botulinum toxin type A inhibits release of
      acetylcholine from cholinergic nerve terminals in a prolonged but ultimately reversible
      manner. Neuropathic pain and its hallmark allodynia are classically difficult to treat.
      Standard treatment with tricyclic antidepressants, anti-epileptic drugs, opiates and spinal
      cord stimulation is frequently disappointing leaving patients with refractory pain. Surgical
      or percutaneous ablation of involved nerves has fallen out of favor among many due to
      disappointing results.

      A pilot study is needed to assess the efficacy of superficially injected Botulinum Toxin type
      A for treatment of cutaneous allodynia and spontaneous pain among patients with neuropathic
      pain.
