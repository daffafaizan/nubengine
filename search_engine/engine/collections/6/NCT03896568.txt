    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of allogeneic bone marrow-derived human
      mesenchymal stem cells (BM-hMSCs) loaded with the oncolytic adenovirus DNX-2401
      (BM-hMSCs-DNX2401) administered by intra-arterial injection (i.e., transfemoral
      super-selective endovascular intracranial injection) in patients with recurrent glioblastoma
      (GBM), gliosarcoma or wild-type IDH-1 anaplastic astrocytoma.

      II. To determine the local and systemic toxicity of allogeneic BM-hMSCs-DNX2401 administered
      by intra-arterial injection (i.e., transfemoral super-selective endovascular intracranial
      injection) in patients with recurrent GBM, gliosarcoma or wild-type IDH-1 anaplastic
      astrocytoma.

      III. To determine at the molecular and cellular level the capacity of allogeneic
      BM-hMSCs-DNX2401 administered intra-arterially to home to and deliver DNX-2401 to recurrent
      GBM, gliosarcoma or wild-type IDH-1 anaplastic astrocytoma by analyzing post-treatment
      surgical brain tumor specimens for the expression and distribution of adenoviral proteins.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess shedding of adenovirus into the blood, sputum, and nasopharynx after
      intra-arterial administration of BM-hMSCs-DNX2401 in patients with recurrent GBM, gliosarcoma
      or wild-type IDH-1 anaplastic astrocytoma.

      II. To assess the development of anti-adenovirus antibodies after intra-arterial
      administration of BM-hMSCs-DNX2401 in patients with recurrent GBM, gliosarcoma or wild-type
      IDH-1 anaplastic astrocytoma.

      III. To evaluate immune-mediated cytokine responses after intra-arterial administration of
      BM-hMSCs-DNX2401 in patients with recurrent GBM, gliosarcoma or wild-type IDH-1 anaplastic
      astrocytoma.

      IV. To assess anti-tumoral activity and to determine progression-free survival (PFS) and
      overall survival (OS) after intra-arterial administration of BM-hMSCs-DNX2401 in patients
      with recurrent GBM, gliosarcoma or wild-type IDH-1 anaplastic astrocytoma.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      PART I: Patients receive oncolytic adenovirus Ad5-DNX-2401 intra-arterially (IA) over 20-30
      minutes on day 0.

      PART II: Patients receive oncolytic adenovirus Ad5-DNX-2401 as in part I. After 2 weeks,
      patients undergo surgery, then receive oncolytic adenovirus Ad5-DNX-2401 IA over 20-30
      minutes.

      After completion of study treatment, patients in part I are followed up on days 1, 4, 7, and
      14 of month 1, months 1.5, 3, and 4.5, every 2 months up to month 26, month 30, then every 6
      months thereafter. Patients in part II will be followed up on the day after surgery, weeks 1,
      2 and 4, months 2, 2.5, 4, 5.5 and 7, every 2 months until month 19, every 4 months until
      month 32, then every 6 months thereafter.
