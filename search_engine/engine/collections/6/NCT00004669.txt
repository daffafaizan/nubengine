    
      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study.
      Hydrocortisone therapy IV or placebo begins no later than 48 hours after birth and continues
      every 12 hours for 12 days. Hydrocortisone is given at 2-4 times the basal cortisol secretion
      rate.

      Tracheal lavage on intubated babies is performed at start of study and on day 4 of life to
      assess concentrations of inflammatory markers.

      If larger babies show appropriate response to ACTH by 15-17 days and the less mature babies
      show a decreased response, then a longer course of therapy is proposed for future studies.
