      regulate salt & water handling. Increases in dietary salt have salutary effects on
      orthostatic tolerance in a physiological laboratory. The infusion of intravenous saline
      acutely decreased heart rate in this patient population. Preliminary data from Vanderbilt
      suggests abnormal salt handling in patients with chronic OI in a few patients. These data
      need to be confirmed and a better understanding of sodium handling in response to acute salt
      loads is required in these patients.
