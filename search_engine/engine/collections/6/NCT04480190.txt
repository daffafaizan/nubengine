      adenocarcinoma. All components of therapy are currently used standards of care, however they
      have not been used in the neoadjuvant setting for the management of resectable biliary
      cancers. The study will use Gemcitabine/cisplatin, followed by chemoradiation.

      This is a feasibility trial with an accrual goal of 12 patients using the primary endpoint of
      completion of neoadjuvant therapy and surgery as an assessment of feasibility.
