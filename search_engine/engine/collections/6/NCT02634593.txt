      for obesity and comorbid metabolic disease in the offspring. Results of previous intervention
      studies designed to improve the metabolic health of obese mothers, and thereby reduce the
      risk to their offspring, have been modest at best. Furthermore, few studies have proved to be
      efficacious among low income African American women who have high risk for the transmission
      of obesity to future generations. The purpose of this study is to examine the feasibility of
      changing the types of foods and drinks that are consumed at night during late pregnancy in
      order to improve maternal glucose tolerance and reduce the risk for future obesity in the
      child. We hypothesize that women who replace their usual night-time foods and drinks with
      lower glycemic load options will have more stable night-time glucose and lower glucose
      following an oral glucose load. This intervention will be assessed in a cohort of African
      American women of low income, who were obese at their first prenatal care visit.
