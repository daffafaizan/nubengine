    
      OP-1250 is a small molecule Complete Estrogen Receptor ANtagonist (CERAN). OP-1250 potently
      competes with the endogenous activating estrogenic ligand 17-beta estradiol for binding in
      the ligand binding pocket. OP-1250 blocks estrogen-driven transcriptional activity, inhibits
      estrogen-driven breast cancer cell growth, and induces degradation of the estrogen receptor.
