      or are incompletely vaccinated. Recommendation for HPV vaccine could occur during pregnancy
      with the administration of the vaccine postpartum. Finding a way to make it easy for women to
      present for vaccination is imperative as this is currently a 3-vaccine series. The
      investigators are interested in understanding if women would find it acceptable if the
      investigators discussed and encouraged the vaccine while pregnant with receipt of the vaccine
      through their child's pediatrician at well-child visits in the postpartum period. The
      investigators will survey women in the third trimester of pregnancy to determine if they
      would find this acceptable and follow-up with them after their child's two month pediatric
      visit to reevaluate their opinion. No doses of the vaccine will be given.

      The investigators are also interested in understanding other factors that could affect
      whether or not women would be interested in receiving the HPV vaccine postpartum. This
      includes rates of attendance at postpartum visits as well as behavioral, knowledge and
      demographic characteristics that may be associated with acceptability of receiving the
      vaccine.
