      auscultation examinations. Two auscultations will be done by a cardiologist using both an
      acoustic traditional stethoscope and an electronic stethoscope. Two additional auscultations
      will be done by a 3rd year medical resident also using both an acoustic traditional
      stethoscope and an electronic stethoscope. All determinations will be compared to
      echocardiography results.
