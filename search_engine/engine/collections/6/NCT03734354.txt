      will be set up, with about 10 subjects in each dose group. Subjects will enter 1 mg, 2 mg and
      4 mg dose groups in sequence.

      After the clinical trial responsible physicians obtain the informed consent forms from
      subjects, the subjects will be screened 14 days to 1 days prior to taking the study drug
      (D-14~D-1).

      One day prior to dosing in each group (D-1), the included subjects are hospitalized On the

      stay in hospital for observation and be discharged on Day 4 of medication. On days 6, 8, 10,
      12 blood samples are collected and safety evaluation will be performed. Telephone follow-up
      will be performed on day Day31.

      Blood samples are collected to determine and evaluate blood concentrations of Brexpiprazole
      and its main metabolite DM-3411 before dosing, and 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72,
