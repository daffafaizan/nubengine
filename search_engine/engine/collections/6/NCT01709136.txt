      hypertension and renal dysfunction, will be converted to sirolimus with low-dose tacrolimus,
      or Tacrolimus withdrawal. This study will evaluate allograft function by serial clinical lab
      testing, the pharmacokinetics of sirolimus and tacrolimus, the glomerular filtration rate
      (GFR) and the potential side effect of sirolimus, such as marrow suppression and
      hyperlipidemia. Two pharmacokinetic evaluations are planned: once around the third
      post-transplant month and another one at about 12 months. Expected outcomes are, a better
      understanding of sirolimus pharmacokinetic parameters over time in pediatric/adult liver
      recipients and early efficacy and safety data of the sirolimus as a non-nephrotoxic
      alternative to tacrolimus.
