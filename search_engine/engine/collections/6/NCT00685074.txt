    
      The purpose of this Stage I/II intervention study (that is, Stage II for drug use and Stage I
      for alcohol use and smoking) is to test the efficacy of a brief, computerized motivational
      intervention for substance abuse among post-partum women. The study will randomly assign 350
      post-partum women to either intervention or control conditions, with intervention itself
      taking approximately 30 minutes in the period before the participant leaves the hospital.
      Inclusion criteria will include post-partum status, age between 18 and 45, ability to
      understand spoken English, and meeting criteria for one of the three substance use groups:
      any illicit drug use in month prior to pregnancy, meeting T-ACE criteria for problem alcohol
      use, or smoking in past month. Exclusion criteria will include receipt of narcotic pain
      medication in the past 3 hours, no sleep since giving birth, and inability to provide
      informed consent (e.g., due to psychosis or other clear cognitive impairment).

      Lab-based follow-up will occur at 3- and 6-months postpartum. The primary outcomes will be
      participant report of frequency of substance use and toxicological analyses of substance use
      (urinalysis and expired breath CO at 3 and 6 month follow-up, hair analysis at 6-month
      follow-up). Secondary outcome measures include HIV risk behaviors, receipt of treatment
      services, motivation to change, self-efficacy, mental health functioning, violence exposure,
      and consequences related to substance use.
