      cognitive performance in youth MDD subjects. Combined application of neurophysiological
      intervention and recording tools, including non-invasive brain stimulation, is suited to
      explore the impact of aerobic exercise on brain physiology and cognition in humans. We will
      apply transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to obtain evoked potentials with
      electromyography (EMG) to explore cortical excitability. In the same participants, we will
      combine motor learning, working memory, and attention task to explore the association between
      the physiological effect of aerobic exercise and respective cognitive alterations. This
      project aims to explore the impact of aerobic exercise on cortical excitability and cognitive
      performance, and the association between these phenomena in youth MDD subjects. The study
      will improve our understanding of the role of aerobic exercise in cortical excitability, an
      important physiological basis for cognitive processes in humans, the underlying physiological
      mechanisms with regard to the aerobic exercise, and their functional relevance in youth MDD
      subjects.
