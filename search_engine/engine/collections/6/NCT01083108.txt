      Presently it is unknown whether the rapid normalization of glucose metabolism in obese
      patients with type 2 diabetes after bariatric surgery (before major weight loss occurs) is
      primarily due to acute postoperative caloric restriction or due to changes in intestinal
      effects on insulin secretion and sensitivity. We speculate that bypassing the stomach and
      proximal small intestine affects glucose metabolism beyond simple caloric restriction, and
      that the mechanisms are related to changes in hepatic and muscle insulin sensitivity, changes
      in vagal afferent signals, and changes in incretins and other gut hormones.

      Aim

      To compare the effects of pure caloric restriction with caloric restriction early after
      bariatric surgery (Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass, RYGBP) in patients with type 2 diabetes, and to
      investigate the mechanisms that explain the observed difference in glucose metabolism

      Methods

      In patients with type 2 diabetes we will study the short-term changes in glucose metabolism,
      insulin sensitivity and gut hormone levels using a parallel group design. The non-surgical
      group will be studied before and after receiving a hypocaloric diet for 6 days mimicking the
      typical postoperative diet. The surgical group will be studied before and 6 days after
      bariatric surgery. The primary outcome will be the change in total body insulin sensitivity
      attributable to caloric restriction alone versus caloric restriction after RYGBP.
      Non-surgical subjects studied at NIH may enter an optional long-term weight loss phase.
