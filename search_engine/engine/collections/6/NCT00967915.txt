      for ankyloglossia (tongue tie) will decrease maternal nipple pain with breast feeding and
      improve infant's ability to breast feed. Our secondary objective is to determine if frenotomy
      for ankyloglossia will improve the length of time a mother breast feeds. Our hypothesis is
      that frenotomy will decrease maternal nipple pain, improve infant's breast feeding and
      prolong the duration of breast feeding.
