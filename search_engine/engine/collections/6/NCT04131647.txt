      maintenance following successful weight loss in overweight and obese Veterans. This research
      is especially relevant to the majority of Veterans who struggle with obesity and maintaining
      weight loss. Obesity increases the risk for storing excess calories in ectopic depots,
      including skeletal muscle. Intramuscular fat is related to altered substrate utilization
      (metabolic inflexibility) and defects in insulin sensitivity, ultimately leading to type 2
      diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease. The objective of this proposal is to test in a
      randomized clinical trial the effectiveness of an intensive weight management program with
      and without intermittent fasting (IF) to combat weight regain and the obesity crisis in our
      Veterans. Further, this application proposes to examine the role of several enzymes involved
      in skeletal muscle fatty acid oxidation as a mechanism for efficacious long term weight
      management.
