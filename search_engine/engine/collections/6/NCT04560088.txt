      members with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD). Further, social isolation and
      loneliness place older caregivers at risk of poor health, including increased inflammation,
      cardiovascular disease, depression, and premature mortality. Interventions to promote social
      connectedness in older caregivers have the potential to reduce elevated morbidity and
      premature mortality and buffer the high caregiving burden in this growing but understudied
      population. Thus, developing effective treatments to reduce social disconnectedness in older
      adults is essential, but previous behavioral treatment efforts have had limited success.
      Mindfulness-based interventions may reduce loneliness in older adults, as demonstrated in a
      randomized controlled trial of an 8-week mindfulness-based stress reduction program. Another
      recent study demonstrated the efficacy of a smartphone-based mindfulness training for
      reducing loneliness and increasing social contact in daily life among adults reporting above
      average stress; however, smartphone-based mindfulness training interventions have not been
      tested with older adults, nor have they been tested with caregivers of family members with
      ADRD. Specifically, prior studies were conducted with healthy adults not necessarily burdened
      by caregiving; it remains unknown how caregiver stress --related to competing demands on time
      and significant loneliness --may impact the ability to comply with the intervention as well
      as indicate barriers to efficacy. The current study will follow a similar protocol as the
      aforementioned randomized controlled trial that used a smartphone-based mindfulness training
      to address loneliness and social contact.
