        -  Determine the response rate in patients with advanced hormone-refractory prostate cancer
           treated with 3-AP.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive 3-AP IV over 2 hours on days 1-4. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for up to
      1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 2-3 months for up to 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 13-27 patients will be accrued for this study.
