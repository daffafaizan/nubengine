    
      Type 2 Diabetes is a common, complex health condition which can result in many serious and
      costly health complications if not treated and controlled properly. One in four Veterans are
      diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes. Vulnerable Veterans, such as minority, low-income, or rural
      Veterans, and Veterans with comorbid mental health diagnoses, are disproportionately affected
      and are less likely to have their diabetes under control. The goal of this study, using a
      randomized comparative effectiveness design, is to test the comparative effectiveness of an
      interactive, tailored self-management texting protocol (DD-TXT), versus a traditional
      education-only intervention (DSE) in a sample of Veterans with uncontrolled diabetes.

      The investigators will recruit from Veterans age 18 years and above who are actively
      receiving care at the study sites (as determined by upcoming scheduled appointment) who have
      uncontrolled glucose (HbA1c >= 8.0% for at least 50% of the most recent 6 months).
      Participants who meet these conditions and enroll in the study will be randomized to one of
      two groups. Those randomized to the intervention group will receive text messages from the
      DD-TXT protocol for 6 months, and those in the comparison group will receive text messages
      from DSE, a diabetes skills education-only texting protocol, for 6 months. The primary
      outcome will be HbA1c percent time in control. Secondary outcomes include self-reported
      adherence to diabetes self-care recommendations (SCI-R), diabetes self-efficacy, diabetes
      distress, LDL, and blood pressure control. The investigators hypothesize that DD-TXT will
      result in better proximal health outcomes and diabetes self-management behaviors vs an
      education-only protocol (DSE).
