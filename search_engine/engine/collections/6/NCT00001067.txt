      the nucleoside analogs. d4T, with a favorable toxicity profile and demonstrated anti-HIV
      activity in previous studies, provides an additional therapeutic option.

      Patients are randomized to receive d4T alone, AZT alone, or both in combination for at least
      12 weeks. After week 12, 3TC is added to the combination arm. Treatment continues for up to
      48 weeks (was a total of 48 weeks, amended 3/26/96).
