      Phase I dose escalation based on toxicity with Phase IIa dose expansion based on antitumor
      activity. Considering the "first in human" nature of this clinical study, the Bayesian
      Optimal Interval Design (BOIN) has been chosen to minimize any risks of exposure to the novel
      CD44v6 CAR T-cells during dose escalation. The study population is made up of patients with
      relapsed/refractory AML or MM expressing CD44v6.

      The medicinal product under investigation (MLM-CAR44.1 T-cells) is patient specific as it is
      prepared starting from lymphocytes of the patient collected through lymphocyte apheresis.
      These autologous T-cells are expanded in vitro in large numbers and genetically modified to
      express the CAR CD44v6Î”NL gene and thus acquire antitumor functions. As a safety feature, the
      MLM-CAR44.1 T-cells are genetically modified to also express the HSV-TK Mut2 gene (suicide
      gene), which can be selectively activated in case of severe toxicity through the
      administration of ganciclovir (GCV), leading to the death of proliferating CAR T-cells.

      The aim of this study is to assess the safety, antitumor activity and feasibility of CD44v6
      CAR T cell immunotherapy in AML and MM.
