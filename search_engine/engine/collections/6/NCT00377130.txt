      Primary

        -  Determine if a self-administered stress management intervention is effective in
           improving quality of life and decreasing psychological distress (anxiety and depression)
           in Hispanic and non-Hispanic patients receiving cancer chemotherapy.

      Secondary

        -  Determine if the degree of acculturation in Hispanics influences the observed
           helpfulness of the intervention.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      participating center, use of psychotropic drugs (yes vs no), and ethnicity (Hispanic vs
      non-Hispanic). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

        -  Arm I (self-administered stress management training plus usual psychosocial care):
           Patients receive a video DVD, audio CD, and brochure that provides information and
           instruction in 3 stress management training techniques (progressive muscle relaxation
           training and guided imagery, abdominal breathing, and coping skills training) to use
           during chemotherapy. Patients also receive usual psychosocial care.

        -  Arm II (usual psychosocial care only): Patients receive usual psychosocial care.

      Patients complete questionnaires to assess mood, quality of life, and other factors at
      baseline and before chemotherapy courses 2, 3, and 4.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 442 patients will be accrued for this study.
