      as induction of mineralization and inhibition of bacterial growth; however tunnel defects and
      cell inclusions in dentin bridges formed by CH may lead to leakage and bacteria penetration
      resulting in loss of vitality.

      TheraCal LC is a new light-cured, resin-modified, tricalcium silicate based material designed
      to use for direct and indirect pulp-capping aiming to achieve a bond to composite resins thus
      reducing micro-leakage.The formulation of TheraCal LC containing tricalcium silicate
      particles in a hydrophilic monomer provides significant calcium release that stimulates
      hydroxyapatite and secondary dentin bridge formation The use of laser for direct pulp capping
      has been suggested for the considerable advantages of lasers including decontamination
      effect, biostimulation effect, hemostatic and coagulant effect.The erbium,
      chromium-doped:yttrium, scandium, gallium and garnet (Er,Cr:YSGG) laser which is a relatively
      new device has been reported to ablate dental hard tissues thanks to its high absorption in
      water and also strong absorption by the hydroxyl radicals present in the hydroxyapatite
      structure
