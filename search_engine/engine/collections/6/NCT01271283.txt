      I. To determine the time to progression in patients with high-risk chronic lymphocytic
      leukemia (CLL) treated with lenalidomide.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the clinical response (complete and partial response) in treatment-na√Øve
      patients with high-risk CLL treated with single-agent lenalidomide.

      II. To determine the incidence of immune-mediated flare reaction. III. To determine the
      toxicity profile of single-agent lenalidomide in previously untreated patients with high-risk
      CLL.

      IV. To conduct correlative studies in bone marrow, peripheral blood, and/or lymph nodes of
      patients treated with lenalidomide.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive oral lenalidomide once daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 28 days
      for 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who
      achieve complete response (by morphological criteria but have persistent minimal residual
      disease by molecular criteria) or partial response may continue treatment beyond 8 courses.
      Patients may undergo bone marrow, peripheral blood, and/or lymph node sample collection at
      baseline and periodically during study for correlative studies.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 3 months for a maximum of 5
      years.
