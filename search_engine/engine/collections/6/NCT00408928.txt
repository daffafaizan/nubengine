      from another donor. GVHD is caused by certain cells called lymphocytes. Normally these cells
      make immune reactions that help protect the body from foreign substances that cause
      infection. Here, these cells attack the normal tissues of the body as if they were foreign
      substances. This interferes with the normal function of vital organs and results in their
      damage. In GVHD these cells attack the skin, liver and bowel. GVHD also increases the chances
      of infection.

      VELCADE速 is a drug that inhibits certain immune reactions that happen when lymphocytes
      encounter foreign substances. We are doing this research to determine if VELCADE速 may be
      useful in treating GVHD.

      VELCADE速 is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of multiple
      myeloma in patients who have received at least two prior therapies and have demonstrated
      disease progression on their last therapy. Its effectiveness is also being tested in other
      cancers. The dose of the drug being used in this research study is the same as what is used
      for the treatment of multiple myeloma. It has not been approved by the FDA for use in GVHD.
      Therefore, using VELCADE速 for GVHD is experimental in this research study.
