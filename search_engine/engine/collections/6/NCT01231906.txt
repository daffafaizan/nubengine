    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      l. Test the effect of the combination of vincristine (vincristine sulfate), cyclophosphamide,
      and topotecan (topotecan hydrochloride) (VTC) added to the standard 5-drug chemotherapy
      interval-compressed backbone on event-free and overall survival of children and young adults
      with Ewing sarcoma.

      CORRELATIVE SCIENCE OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate initial volumetric tumor size as a prognostic factor for event free survival
      (EFS) in patients with localized Ewing tumors.

      II. To evaluate histologic response as a prognostic factor for EFS in patients with localized
      Ewing tumors.

      III. To continue evaluation of biologic markers both as related to prognosis and as eventual
      therapeutic targets via encouraging concurrent enrollment on a Ewing sarcoma
      specimen-collection study.

      IV. To evaluate imaging response by flurodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography
      (PET) as a prognostic factor for EFS.

      V. To evaluate the effects of the type of local therapy on EFS and overall survival.

      VI. To evaluate the effect of local surgical margins in conjunction with histologic response
      on EFS in patients with localized Ewing tumors.

      VII. To evaluate the effect of local therapy modality (surgery, radiotherapy, or a
      combination) as well as the type of surgical reconstruction on musculoskeletal complications.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I:

      INDUCTION THERAPY: Patients receive vincristine sulfate intravenously (IV) on day 1 in weeks
      1, 2, 5, 6, 9, and 10; doxorubicin hydrochloride IV on days 1 and 2 and cyclophosphamide IV
      over 30-60 minutes on day 1 in weeks 1, 5, and 9; and ifosfamide IV over 1 hour and etoposide
      IV over 1-2 hours on days 1-5 in weeks 3, 7, and 11.

      CONSOLIDATION THERAPY: Patients receive vincristine sulfate IV on day 1 in weeks 1, 2, 7, 8,
      9, 10, 13, 14, 17, 18, 21, and 22; doxorubicin hydrochloride IV on days 1 and 2 in weeks 1
      and 9; cyclophosphamide IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1 in weeks 1, 7, 9, 13, 17, and 21; and
      ifosfamide IV over 1 hour and etoposide IV over 1-2 hours on days 1-5 in weeks 3, 5, 11, 15,
      and 19.

      ARM II:

      INDUCTION THERAPY: Patients receive vincristine sulfate IV on day 1 in weeks 1, 2, 5, 6, 9,
      10, 11 and 12; topotecan hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1-5 in weeks 1 and 9;
      cyclophosphamide IV over 15-60 minutes on days 1-5 in weeks 1 and 9, and on day 1 of weeks 5
      and 11; ifosfamide and etoposide as in arm I; and doxorubicin hydrochloride IV on days 1 and
      2 in weeks 5 and 11.

      CONSOLIDATION THERAPY: Patients receive vincristine sulfate IV on day 1 in weeks 1, 2, 7-10,
      13-16, 19, and 20; topotecan hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1-5 in weeks 1, 7, and
      15; cyclophosphamide IV over 15-60 minutes on days 1-5 in weeks 1, 7, and 15, and on day 1 in
      weeks 9, 13, and 19; ifosfamide IV over 1 hour and etoposide IV over 1- 2 hours on days 1-5
      in weeks 3, 5, 11, 17, and 21; and doxorubicin hydrochloride IV on days 1 and 2 in weeks
      9,13, and 19.

      Patients with responsive or stable disease undergo may undergo surgery alone in week 13 if
      lesion can be complete resected with negative margins and with reasonable functional result.
      Patients with unresectable lesions or inadequate margins after surgery receive radiotherapy
      during weeks 1-7. Patients with bulky lesions in surgically difficult sites such as the
      spine, skull, and periacetabular pelvis, patients with a poor response to induction
      chemotherapy, or those patients in whom surgery would result in unacceptable functional
      results may undergo radiotherapy alone in weeks 1-7 of consolidation therapy, and surgery
      should be performed after completion of consolidation chemotherapy. Patients with microscopic
      residual disease after planned pre-operative radiotherapy receive additional radiotherapy.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 3 months for 3 years and
      then every 6 months for 2 years.
