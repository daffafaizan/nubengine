    
      Cardiac procedures are associated with new cerebral ischemic lesions detected on
      diffusion-weighted MRI (Bendszus et al., 2006).

      A previous study suggests that sonolysis (continuous transcranial Doppler sonography using a
      2-MHz diagnostic probe) can reduce the risk of new cerebral ischemic lesions during carotid
      endarterectomy and carotid angioplasty / stenting (Skoloudik et al., 2015).

      Currently, it is unknown whether sonolysis can also reduce the risk of new cerebral ischemic
      lesions during MitraClip implantation - a percutaneous treatment option in patients with
      moderate / severe mitral regurgitation.

      In this study, patients will receive cerebral MRI and clinical neurological /
      neuropsychological examination before and after MitraClip implantation. During MitraClip
      implantation, all patients will receive continuous transcranial Doppler sonography using a
      2-MHz diagnostic probe with maximal diagnostic energy administered through either the left or
      the right transtemporal window (computer-generated 1:1 randomization).

      The primary endpoint is the median ischemic lesion volume detected on diffusion-weighted MRI
      after MitraClip implantation in the sonolysis group and in the control group.
