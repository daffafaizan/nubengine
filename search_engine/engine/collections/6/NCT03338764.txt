      of SM-1 in adults who sometimes have difficulty in falling asleep or staying asleep, but who
      do not have chronic insomnia. SM-1 is a combination drug product containing diphenhydramine,
      zolpidem and lorazepam. The study is a parallel group design; participants will receive
      either SM-1 or placebo to take at home as needed over the course of 3 months treatment
      period.
