      conditions. Blood conservation is a method that can reduce peri-operative allogeneic blood
      transfusion. This study has been conducted on 34 patients underwent laparotomy surgery with
      bleeding more than 20% of EBV. After being informed concent, research subjects were
      randomized into two groups: ANH (conducted ANH) and control group (without ANH). After
      starting general anesthesia, the ANH group was withdrawing blood based on Gross formula.
      Restoration of circulated volume was instituted by infusion of colloids. In control group,
      the operation was started right after the induction of anesthesia. The monitoring of blood
      pressure, heart rate, the amount of bleeding, total fluid, urine production, hemoglobin
      concentration and number of allogenic transfusion were recorded.
