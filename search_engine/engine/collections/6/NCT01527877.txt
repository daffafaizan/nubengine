      signal transduction pathway of PI3K-Akt-mTOR. Several PI3K inhibitors are being tested in the
      clinical trials for cancer treatment but not for the head and neck cancer yet. BKM120 is a
      specific Pan-class I PI3K inhibitor. We suggest multicenter single arm phase II study to
      determine anti-tumor effects of BKM120 in patients with recurrent and/or metastatic SCCHN who
      failed to prior platinum-based chemotherapy regimens.
