      behavior in teenage populations. The International Agency for Research in Cancer classifies
      indoor tanning as "carcinogenic to humans." There is evidence that female indoor tanning use
      increases dramatically from freshman to senior years of high school (e.g., 25-40% of older
      high school girls) making high school a critical time period for anti-tanning interventions
      to be carried out. This proposal assesses the effectiveness of a skin cancer prevention
      website for a nationally representative sample of high school teens in a randomized
      controlled trial. Teens exposed to the website will report reduced indoor tanning intentions,
      frequency and overall percentage of users while increasing sun protective behaviors at
      long-term (i.e 18 month) follow-up.
