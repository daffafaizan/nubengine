    
      This is a two-armed parallel group, prospective, randomized, double-blind,
      double-dummy,multicenter Phase 3 clinical study to establish the efficacy and safety of
      LCP-Tacro Tablets (tacrolimus, LifeCycle Pharma A/S, Hørsholm, Denmark) once daily for the
      prevention of allograft rejection in de novo adult male and female recipients of a primary or
      secondary kidney transplant evaluated by a combined efficacy endpoint comprised of acute
      rejection, graft loss and patient loss. The trial is designed to determine if the test drug,
      LCP-Tacro, is not inferior to an unacceptable extent to the reference compound, Prograf.
      Recipients of a kidney transplant who sign an informed consent form and fulfill all other
      inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomly assigned to once-daily therapy with
      LCP-Tacro Tablets or to twice-daily therapy with Prograf Capsules (tacrolimus, Astellas
      Pharma US, Inc., Deerfield, IL), each concomitantly administered with mycophenolate mofetil
      (MMF) and corticosteroids. All patients will also receive interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor
      antagonist (e.g.,Simulect®, basiliximab; Novartis Pharmaceuticals, East Hanover, NJ).
      Following screening,transplantation, and randomization, study visits will be conducted over a
      12-month treatment period; with additional visits during a 12 month extension period on
      treatment and a follow-up safety assessment by visit or telephone interview 30 days after
      withdrawal from study drug.
