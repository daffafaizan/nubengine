      posture resulted from a non-progressive cerebral disturbance. It is the most common cause of
      motor disability in childhood. Most therapies are palliative rather than restorative.
      Umbilical cord blood (UCB) may be used as restorative approach for children with CP.

      Many experimental animal studies have revealed that UCB is beneficial to improve and repair
      neurological injuries, this effect achieved due to immune regulation and angiogenesis as well
      as the neuroprotective effect.

      Based on animal studies and some clinical trials, UCB is suggested as a potential therapy for
      children with CP.

      This study is prospective, non randomized (open label) with control group

      Ð¡LINICAL PURPOSES Estimation of the efficiency of the method of transfusion of umbilical
      blood hematopoietic cells to patients with diagnosed infantile cerebral palsy depending on
      the degrees of compatibility of donor and recipient.

      RESEARCH PURPOSES

        1. To develop an algorithm of using the method of transfusion of hematopoietic cells of
           umbilical cord blood at complex therapy of patients with children's cerebral palsy.

        2. Formulate criteria for selecting patients for this method.

        3. To analyze the safety and efficacy of umbilical cord blood hematopoietic cells
           transfusion in patients with cerebral palsy using evaluation scales.

        4. To compare the efficacy of treatment of patients depending on the degree of tissue
           compatibility of the donor and recipient and other laboratory indications.

        5. To implement the method of transfusion of umbilical cord blood hematopoietic cells in
           the complex therapy of patients with cerebral palsy.
