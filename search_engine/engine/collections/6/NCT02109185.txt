    
      The study is to compare the safety, efficacy, and superiority of generic mometasone nasal
      spray to reference products and to placebo in the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis.
      This protocol describes randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 4- treatment group
      parallel study of 14 days duration preceded by a single blind 7-day placebo run-in period to
      investigate the clinical equivalence of Mylan's Mometasone Furoate Monohydrate Nasal Spray,
      50 ug per actuation to Merck Sharp & Dohme's (MSD) Nasonex® Nasal Spray, 50 ug per actuation
      or MSD EU's Nasonex® Nasal Spray Suspension, 50 ug per actuation. In addition, the
      superiority of the test and reference products to placebo will be assessed. Prior to
      randomization to one of 4 study groups, each subject will have a 7-day placebo run-in period.
      Each subject will then receive one of the following treatments: Mylan's Mometasone Furoate
      Nasal Spray 50 μg/actuation (2 actuations per nostril per day); Merck-US Nasonex® Nasal Spray
      50 μg/actuation (2 actuations per nostril per day); Merck-EU's Nasonex® and Nasal Spray
      Suspension 50 μg/actuation (2 actuations per nostril per day); or Mylan's Placebo Nasal Spray
      50 μL/actuation (2 actuations per nostril per day). Active treatment is for 14 days duration.
      Reflective total nasal scores (rTNSS) will be collected every 12 hours for 21 days.
