      associated with significant toxicity in some patients, and it does not prevent ultimate
      progression to AIDS and eventual mortality. Thus, there is a clear need for new
      antiretroviral drugs, and ddC is one such promising agent.

      Patients receive oral ddC for 48 to 177 weeks.
