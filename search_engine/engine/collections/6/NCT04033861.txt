      from 2018 JAN. to 2019 JAN, whose predefined time between symptom onset and percutaneous is
      not more than 12 hours. The door-to-balloon time, present to balloon time and first medical
      contact-to-balloon time will be documented. ECG in FMC and 90min after PCI also will be
      record. Patients assigned to the rhBNP group will receive intravenous rhBNP before PCI，and
      the variety of heart rate and blood pressure will be record. Routinely evaluation of
      corrected TIMI frame counting（CTFC）, TIMI myocardial perfusion frame counting and TIMI
      myocardial perfusion grade(TMPG).Blood tests including BNP, CK-MB and CRP are measured at
      admission and6, 12, 24, 48 hours after PCI. Both Cardiovascular magnetic imaging and
      echocardiography will be applied in Day 30 and 12 months. The composite endpoint is incidence
      of all-cause mortality, reinfarct, stroke and target vessel revascularization at
      hospitalization and follow-up. Principally patients are prevented from any drug affecting
      microcirculation (GPIIb/IIa receptor agonist, vascular dilation drug, etc.), otherwise it is
      necessary, which should be documented.
