      infants with diagnosis of pneumonia hospitalized in the NICU and NICU of the Santa Casa de
      Misericórdia Foundation of Pará (FSCMPA) participated in the study period from July to
      October 2016. The research obeyed ethical principles Of Resolution 466/12 of the National
      Health Council (CNS) and was initiated after approval by the Research Ethics Committee of the
      FSCMPA, opinion 1,690,842. The selection criteria were obtained through the collection of
      data from the records of newborns and annotated in standardized charts. Once included in the
      study, the patients were randomly divided into two groups of 14 PTNB, the premature group 1
      were submitted to the vibration technique (rhythmic and rapid movements of isometric
      contraction of the forearm, applied manually over the anterior chest region) and the Of Group
      2 to the acceleration of the expiratory flow (soft compression of the thorax applied with one
      hand in the lower ribs and the other using the ulnar border on the supramammary line). Both
      techniques were performed with the premature dorsal position, at the time of the expiratory
      phase, with a maximum duration of 10 minutes, once a day, for three consecutive days, in the
      afternoon period and by the same physiotherapist. After this procedure, aspiration of the
      upper airways of premature infants was performed. The pain indicators of the preterm infants
      (PIPP) of the two groups were evaluated in three moments, before the application of the
      technique (T1), immediately after the application of the technique (T2) and 15 minutes After
      its completion (T3), by a researcher previously trained and blind regarding the procedure
      performed. PIPP is a multidimensional instrument that evaluates pain indicators in the
      newborn using the following parameters: gestational age and alertness (contextual factors),
      heart rate and peripheral oxygen saturation (physiological indicators) that were measured by
      means of a pulse oximeter Of the brand (Dixtal®) and three aspects of facial mimetics
      (behavioral factors). Their scores may range from 0 to 21, scores less than or equal to 6
      indicate absence of pain, scores above 6 represent mild pain and scores higher than 12
      indicate the presence of moderate to severe pain.
