      euphoric effects. MDMA releases serotonin (5-HT), norepinephrine (NE), and dopamine through
      an interaction with the corresponding presynaptic monoamine uptake transporter. 5-HT
      transport inhibitors block MDMA-induced 5-HT release in vitro or in animals and also
      attenuate the subjective and cardiovascular response to MDMA in humans. NE transport
      inhibitors similarly prevent the MDMA-induced release of NE in cell assays and attenuate
      behavioral effects of MDMA in animals. Effects of the NE transporter inhibitor reboxetine on
      the response to MDMA in humans are currently investigated. Here we suggest evaluating effects
      of pretreatment with the combined 5-HT and NE transport blocker duloxetine on the
      pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of MDMA. The study will use a randomized double-blind
      cross-over design with four experimental sessions. Duloxetine (120 mg) or placebo will be
      administered 16 h and 4 h before the administration of MDMA (125 mg) or placebo to 16 healthy
      volunteers. Subjective and cardiovascular responses and plasma samples for pharmacokinetics
      will be repeatedly assessed throughout the experiments.
