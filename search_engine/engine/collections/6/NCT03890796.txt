      trial. For the first 2 weeks, all participants receive the same health care education
      program. Then for the following 10 weeks, participants will be randomized to either one of
      the two following groups with different conditions. For the control group, participants
      receive ten session of dementia care education. For the experimental activity scheduling
      group, participants receive ten session of dementia care education, plus weekly activity
      scheduling (AS) practice that focus on pleasant event scheduling and improving communication.
