      suicide risk. Building on earlier findings, we conducted a 6-week randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled trial to investigate the efficacy of midday light therapy for bipolar
      depression. The aims were to examine the change in depression levels and the proportion of
      patients who responded and remitted. We assessed predictors of response with measures of side
      effects, sleep quality, suicidality, and psychosocial functioning. We included depressed
      adults with BD-Type I or II confirmed on the SCID interview and taking stable-dosed antimanic
      medication. We excluded patients with psychosis, rapid cycling, obsessive compulsive
      disorder, alcohol or substance use disorders, hypomania or mania, and severe suicidality.
      Patients were randomized to 7000 lux broad spectrum light therapy OR 50 lux dim red light for
      45-60 minutes daily. Weekly, the blinded-clinician assessed symptoms with the Structured
      Interview Guide for the Hamilton Depression Scale with Atypical Depression Supplement
      (SIGH-ADS) and global functioning.
