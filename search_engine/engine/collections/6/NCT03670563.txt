      exercises, instructed with passive, active-assisted, and active techniques, affect functional
      measures such as balance, plantar pressure during gait, and vertical jump. A frustration
      index will be employed to assess participant frustration with learning a new exercise. 15
      will be enrolled in this arm of the study.

      Arm 2: The purpose of this arm of the study is to determine if a 4-week trial of foot muscle
      exercises, instructed with neuromuscular electric stimulation (NMES) and active techniques,
      affect functional measures such as balance, plantar pressure during gait, and vertical jump.
      A frustration index will be employed to assess participant frustration with learning a new
      exercise.15 will be enrolled in this arm of the study.

      Arm 3: This group will not engage in any training, but will serve as a comparator for the two
      intervention arms.
