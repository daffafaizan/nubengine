      brain does have inhibitory effects on epileptiform discharges and seizures. We hypothesize
      that mild cooling of the brain has anti-epileptic effects in epileptic patients who either
      have no identifiable seizure foci, who have multiple foci, or who have frequent
      localization-related seizures that are refractory to antiepileptic drugs. We have studied the
      feasibility and safety of a head-neck cooling device in 10 adult normal volunteers, and found
      that the head-neck cooling was feasible and safe, without significant complaints or problems
      voiced by the subjects. Overall, a slight reduction of core temperature was shown. Since
      cooling on a twice-a-week basis was well tolerated by normal volunteers, we would like to
      extend our study to patients with epilepsy to learn the optimal duration and frequency of
      head-neck cooling in terms of reducing seizure frequency. This will be a pilot study, as
      directed by PIRC and the IRB, in which we will evaluate 60 minutes of cooling performed once
      a week for 4 weeks in 5 epileptic patients. We will then report the results to PIRC and the
      IRB before we proceed with further study.
