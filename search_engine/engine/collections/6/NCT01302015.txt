    
      Buerger's disease, also known as thromboangiitis obliterans, is a rare disorder that, in most
      cases, affects young or middle-aged male cigarette smokers. It is characterized by narrowing
      or blockage (occlusion) of the veins and arteries of the extremities, resulting in reduced
      blood flow to these areas (peripheral vascular disease). The exact cause of Buerger's disease
      is not known; however, most affected individuals are heavy tobacco users.

      This drug is an autologous cell treatment for necrosis in the legs of patients with Beurger's
      diseases to improve symptoms through vascular regeneration.
