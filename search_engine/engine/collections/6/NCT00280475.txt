      radiation therapy with salvage stereotactic radiosurgery in patient with one to four brain
      metastases from lung, breast, and colorectal cancer.

      Total of 270 patients will be accrued for this study from 21 institutions within three years.
      The primary endpoint is overall survival. The secondary endpoints are proportion of
      performance status (PS) preservation, proportion of mini-mental status examination (MMSE)
      preservation, and adverse events.
