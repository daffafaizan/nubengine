      intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS), which is rTMS with theta burst frequency with
      2400 pulses/day in two sessions at 90% of resting motor threshold intensity over the DMPFC,
      given in ten days on week days (10 treatment days must be completed within a maximum of 21
      days). Stratified (depression and schizophrenia diagnosis) block randomization will be used
      for treatment allocation to active or sham side of the stimulation coil.

      Patients will be referred from their regular psychiatric care facilities. At the screening
      visit the patient will be assessed if fulfilling all inclusion and none of the exclusion
      criteria. At the baseline visit thorough psychiatric, cognitive and neurophysiological
      examination will be performed. The latter include investigation of cortical excitability with
      paired-pulse TMS, mismatch negativity (MMN, a measure of aberrant stimulus detection),
      startle-response, habituation, electrodermal activity (EDA), near-infrared spectroscopy
      (NIRS), 24 hour actigraphy and heart rate registration.

      During 10 week days the participants will receive a daily rTMS (or sham) treatment. On the
      day after last rTMS treatment the examinations performed at the baseline visit will be
      repeated. Four weeks after baseline there is a shorter visit to follow-up symptoms and
      functioning. At the end of this visit the blinding is unmasked and patients who have received
      sham rTMS will be offered active treatment in an open-phase. After the four weeks follow-up
      there are two additional and identical visits at 10 and 26 weeks after start of treatment.
