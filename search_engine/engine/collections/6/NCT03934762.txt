    
      For the purpose of study, ten male participants will be included in a pilot clinical trial.

      Initially, participants will undergo a baseline testing including assessment of body height,
      body mass and body composition, isokinetic evaluation of isometric, concentric and eccentric
      muscle strength of quadriceps, determination of VO2max, evaluation of DOMS level and resting
      blood sampling for the measurement of CK. Participants will be also provided with 7-day diet
      recalls and will be taught by a trained dietitian on how to adjust food/liquid portions and
      sizes and how to complete diet recalls (1 recall/day over a 7-day period).

      After baseline testing, subjects will participate in two trials, in a randomized,
      double-blind repeated measures design. In the first trial they will execute a bilateral
      eccentric exercise protocol. Immediately after the exercise protocol and daily for 7
      consecutive days, will be applied transdermal treatment with placebo (Control) in one leg and
      with natural aloe vera (Experimental, aloe vera peel and leaf) in the other. Following a
      7-day wash-out period the second trial will be conducted. Participants will execute the same
      eccentric exercise protocol, but they will be treated with either placebo (Control) or aloe
      vera soup (Experimental). The selection of the treatment for each leg will be randomly
      selected. In both trials, assessment of DOMS and strength (isometric, concentric and
      eccentric) in both legs and blood sampling (for the measurement of CK) will be performed at
      1h and 6h post-exercise as well as daily for 7 consecutive days.
