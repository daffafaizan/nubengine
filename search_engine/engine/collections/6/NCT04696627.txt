      least one year prior to the start date of the study, and the investigators will study cases
      occurring during a period of 5 years. These women will be matched by type of procedure (labor
      epidural), month of delivery and age with women who have received an epidural but did not
      sustain an unintentional dural puncture. The group of women who sustained dural punctures
      will be further divided into two groups, whether they have received epidural blood patch or
      not, to study the influence of the epidural blood patch on the outcomes. Women will have
      their anesthetic records reviewed to collect data on the anesthetic technique, presence of a
      dural puncture and treatment if applicable. All patients who qualify will be contacted and
      invited to take part in this study. Those consenting to the study will be interviewed by
      phone or answer the survey electronically. During the interview, they will answer questions
      derived from validated questionnaires for the majority of our outcomes of interest. In the
      few outcomes where a validated questionnaire does not exist, the investigators will search
      for our endpoint with dichotomic (yes/no) questions. The investigators will then compare the
      data gathered in the three different groups to validate or invalidate our hypothesis.
