      defined as a DOB value greater than 10 will be eligible to this trial. We will screen 150
      subjects and it is estimated that 40 H. pylori infected subjects will be eligible. Eligible
      subjects will be randomized to receive probiotic (Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus
      rhamnosus) or placebo, one pack twice daily, for 28 days. The primary outcome was the
      reduction in H. pylori load of greater than 20% than baseline. The secondary outcome was the
      impact of the probiotic on the gut microbiota and the adverse effects.
