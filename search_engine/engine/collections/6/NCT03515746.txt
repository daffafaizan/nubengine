      computer or using 3D goggles. They will sit in a comfortable chair, with a small camera
      tracking the hand and finger movements of their affected (dominant, in case of both hands
      affected) hand. The participant will grab any of the virtual cubes lying around the VE and
      put it in the treasure box. When the cube falls into the treasure box it disappears and the
      participant scores, one by one until the 10th cube or 120s of time elapse. The cubes will be
      randomly spread in the VE and will all have the same virtual size, weight and bouncing
      factor, but different colour. If the participant is left-handed, the treasure box will be
      mirrored to the right side. If the cube is pushed into the floor, it disappears without a
      score and is lost. Each participant will take 10 consecutive training sessions in 2 weeks,
      each session lasting for 30min. Within a session, the participant will take 5 trials, with
      breaks of 1-2 min between them.
