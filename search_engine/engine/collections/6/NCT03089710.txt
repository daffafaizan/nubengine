      indicated that adequate fluid management optimizes the cardiac out put, improves tissue
      perfusion, thus decrease the risk of postoperative morbidity. Muller et al developed a
      "Mini-fluid challenge method " to predict fluid responsiveness and the efficacy. To the best
      of our knowledge, the efficacy of the test was not discussed in the perioperative care in
      prone position surgery. The investigators design the study to investigate the effectiveness
      of mini-fluid challenge test in prone position surgery.
