      social interaction, and repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior. While most research
      has attempted to treat the behavioral deficits commonly associated with ASD, few studies have
      attempted to improve the core features of this disorder. A recent study found that donepezil
      HCl helped to improve speech production, attention span, and ability to express emotions in a
      group of children with autism. This study will provide an opportunity to conduct further
      testing of the effects of donepezil HCl on the cognitive deficits presumed to underlie the
      core features of ASD.

      This study begins at Week 1 with a baseline assessment. Participants are then randomly
      assigned to either donepezil HCl or placebo. Participants will start with either a 5mg/day
      dose of donepezil HCl or placebo followed by a cognitive assessment after 4 weeks on this
      dose. Participants will then have their dose increased to 10mg/day. Another cognitive
      assessment will be given after 4 weeks on this dose.
