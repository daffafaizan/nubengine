      spontaneous attacks in approximately 50% of migraine sufferers. Treatment of spontaneous
      migraine attacks with an antagonist to CGRP is effective in many patients. These data show
      that CGRP is involved in both initiation and maintenance of migraine attack.

      The consequence of migraine gene mutations on relevant migraine pathways has never been
      tested. The aim of the present study is to explore functional consequences of migraine gene
      mutations on their responses to CGRP infusion. The project will improve our understanding of
      the neurobiology of migraine and stimulate development of new treatment targets.
