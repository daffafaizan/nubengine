      might allow optimization of the oxygen supplementation during bronchoscopy, which reduces the
      risk of per- and peri-procedural hypoxemia. The investigators will conduct a pilot study
      corroborating the hypothesis that tracheal supplementation of oxygen during flexible
      bronchoscopy is advantageous in comparison to nasal cannula supplementation.

      The concept of our trial consists of a mono-centric observational study performed in the
      endoscopy suite of the Respiratory Division, University Hospitals Leuven. All patients will
      be given informed consent before inclusion.

      The aim of the present study is to measure the time to correction of O2 saturation when in
      case of desaturation below 90%, O2 administration is switched from the nasal to the tracheal
      route at a similar flow rate.
