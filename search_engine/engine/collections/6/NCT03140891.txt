      early use of noninvasive respiratory support strategies has been suggested to be the most
      effective pathway to reduce those risks. NCPAP is a widely used way of noninvasive
      ventilation strategies in preterm infants. However, there is only 60% success rate in
      avoiding intubation. Supplying with the combined advantages of HFOV and NCPAP with high CO2
      removal, no need for synchronisation, less volume/barotraumas, non-invasion and increased
      functional residual capacity, nasal high frequency oscillation ventilation (NHFOV) is
      considered as a strengthened version of NCPAP. Thus, NHFOV may be more effective as
      post-extubation respiratory support to avoid re-intubation and subsequent
      complications/sequelae comparing with NCPAP in preterm infants. To date, NHFOV was used
      increasingly in neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) around the world due to its convenient
      operation and no consideration of synchronisation, and several small studies have reported
      the beneficial effects of NHFOV in preterm infants. However, there were rare randomized
      controlled studies compared NHFOV with NCPAP as post-extubation respiratory support
      strategies in preterm infants.

      The purpose of the present study was to compare NHFOV with NCPAP as post-extubation
      respiratory support on the need for endotracheal ventilation and subsequent complications in
      preterm infants.
