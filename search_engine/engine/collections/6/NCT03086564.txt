      our research. The 70 patients will be randomly assigned to experimental group and control
      group with the ratio of 1:1, one group (control group) will go on receiving the TACE
      treatment solely; another group (experimental group) after enrollment will receive TACE in
      the first course.Then 10ml blood is taken for activated dendritic cells culture.CY treatment
      will be performed on patients in reasonable dose two days before the second TACE.The day when
      the second TACE performed, these patients will receive activated-dendritic cells
      simultaneously. 31 days after the first TACE therapy, all patients are determined if they
      should continue an additional course by monitoring their blood parameters, tumor indicators
      and imaging examinations. Additionally, we are setting up a treatment course containing 31
      days and going to change one course into 93 days after the third course.
