      17% of school-aged children. Most cases of childhood atopic dermatitis improve or resolve by
      adulthood. However, the majority of patients retain some features of atopic dermatitis and
      some continue to have severe disease that continues to adulthood. Moderate to severe atopic
      dermatitis cannot be adeuately controlled with topical agents. Consequently many patients are
      treated with systemic corticosteroids, cyclosporine, azathioprine, methotrexate, and other
      immunosuppressants that carry the risk of severe atopic dermatitis is greatly needed. The
      chronic use of current immunosuppressive agents is limited by cumulative end-organ
      toxicities. We propose inhibition of T cell trafficking to the skin with Raptiva will have
      beneficial effects in the treatment of patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis.
