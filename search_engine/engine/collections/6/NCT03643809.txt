      immune system. They are characterized by systemic or organ inflammatory attacks. In the
      absence of accurate diagnosis and adequate treatment, evolution can be lethal. Most SAIDs are
      hereditary, and the diagnosis is based on genetic analysis because the clinical features
      overlap. The investigators have been among the first in France to routinely develop Next
      Generation Sequencing (NGS), which allows a simultaneous and exhaustive analysis of a
      constantly evolving panel of now more than 60 genes involved in SAIDs. While there are
      epidemiological studies on the first described MAIs, nothing has been done regarding the
      newest clinical entities.

      Objectives The investigators want to study and value the data the investigators have
      collected on the most recent SAIDs (500 patients) Main objective: Establish correlations
      between the main mutations and symptoms presented by patients (genotype-phenotype
      correlation).

      Secondary objectives: Descriptive epidemiology study: Describe the most recently described
      clinical, genetic, and demographic characteristics of SAIDs.

      Methodology The investigators have over the last 20 years set up a database that continues to
      evolve. These data are collected prospectively from patients (N> 7000) with SAID refered to
      our laboratory for genetic analysis. This database contains invaluable demographic, clinical
      and genetic data, carefully collected for each patient, on a standard file of analysis
      request made with clinicians from the reference center for auto-inflammatory diseases and
      amyloidosis (CeRÃ©MAIA). The collection of consent is systematic (declared collection).
