      sudden death, with peak incidences occurring in the early morning. Platelet aggregation has
      also been shown to increase in the early morning. The investigators will test the hypothesis
      that alpha 2a-adrenergic receptor (ADRA2A) genetic variation, specifically haplotype 4,
      affects platelet aggregation. The investigators will compare diurnal platelet aggregation in
      haplotype 4 subjects with subjects in the other haplotype families. In addition, the
      investigators will compare platelet aggregation after the cold pressor test in haplotype 4
      with the other haplotype families. If there are no differences among haplotypes, then the
      haplotypes will be combined to analyze.
