      delayed due to limited availability of a formal duplex ultrasound. Physician performed 2
      point compression ultrasonography has been shown to have reasonable accuracy when performed
      in the emergency department and outpatient setting, but has not been studied on patients in
      the intensive care unit. We propose an observational study to assess the ability of
      intensivists to evaluate for deep vein thrombosis using 2 point compression ultrasonography.
