      employed to investigate the effects of treadmill training augmented with virtual reality on
      patients with MS. The study will include 200 participants. Participants will be randomized to
      either the intervention or active comparator. The intervention group will receive 18 sessions
      of Treadmill Training with Virtual Reality (TT+VR) and the active control comparison will
      receive 18 training sessions of treadmill training alone (TT) without the VR simulation All
      interventions will be delivered by therapists trained in the standard protocols. All subjects
      will be trained 3 times a week for 6 weeks, each session will last approximately 45
      minutes.Training progression will be based on increasing both motor and cognitive challenges,
      individualized to the participant's level of performance.
