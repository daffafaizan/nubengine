the effect of actinomycin d on parathyroid-inducedchange in bone and kidney.actinomycin d (amd), an antibiotic known toinhibit dna-directed rna synthesis,was used to study parathyroid-induced changesin ca mobilization in vivo and in vitroas well as renal excretion of ca and phosphatein rats.  intact and parathyroidectomizedrats subjected to peritoneal lavage wereadministered amd, and changes inca, p, and mg in lavage and serum wereexamined.  amd consistently lowered theca transfer into the peritoneal rinse in boththe intact and parathyroidectomized animals,although the drop in ca was more acuteif the animals were pretreated by subcutaneousinjections of amd than if amd wasadministered as a component of therinse.  pretreatment of lavaged animals withamd prevented the expected increasein osteoclast numbers in the distal metaphysisof the femur but had no effect if administeredas a component of the peritoneal rinse.the incubation of femora removedfrom both intact and parathyroidectomizedanimals resulted in media ca levels thatwere significantly lower after 4 hr. incubationwhen amd was added in vitro.  however,transfer of recently injected ca intothe incubation medium from animalstreated with amd was increased.  in addition,parathyroidectomy of animals subsequentto administration of amd still resultedin expected changes in ca and p in theurine although amd significantly increased pexcretion in both intact and parathyroidectomizedanimals.  it was concluded thatendogenous parathyroid hormone requiresthe continuous production of enzymes ultimatelyresponsible for its action on boneand kidney, but that this action is not necessarilyrelated directly to the productionof m-rna.
