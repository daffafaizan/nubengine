      Objectives: Firstly the patients recently diagnosed with cancer will be selected for
      enrollment who are on active treatment during lockdown based on the date of their
      registration in the hospital. This is followed by a telephonic interview with patients or
      their attendant to carry out a prospective, cross-sectional, observational study in order to
      address the issues and challenges faced by them during Lockdown.

      Collection of data will be done through telephonic communication. Participation in this study
      will be entirely voluntary. Telephonic verbal consent will be taken from the patients or
      their attendants before collection of their response on the study questionnaire and then will
      be asked questions accordingly based on the questionnaire which is available in English and
      Hindi both. Data and general information regarding participants will only be collected in
      questionnaire. No personal data of the participants will be taken which will also be conveyed
      to the participant or attendant during telephonic verbal consent.
