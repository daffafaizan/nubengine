    
      This is a multicenter, prospective, single-blinded, two-arm, randomized study. Enrolled
      subjects will have a single Bone Marrow Lesion of the tibia, single BML of the femur, or
      adjoining Bone Marrow Lesions of tibia and femur. Subjects will also be surgical candidates
      for knee arthroscopy due to mechanical symptoms, meniscus tear, loose body and/or synovitis.

      A stratified blocked randomization will be used to assign subjects to either Subchondroplasty
      with arthroscopy or to arthroscopy alone in a 2:1 ratio. Individual sets of blocks will be
      determined within study site and lesion polarity status (unipolar vs. bipolar).

      Subjects will be enrolled within 60 days prior to surgery and take part in follow-up visits
      for two years following surgery. A preoperative visit will occur at the time of enrollment.
      Follow-up visits will occur at the study site at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, and
      24 months post-surgery. Telephone follow-up interviews will be done at 9 and 18 months
      post-surgery. Target enrollment is 201 subjects, to include 134 subjects in the treatment
      group (Subchondroplasty + Arthroscopy) and 67 subjects in the control group (Arthroscopy
      alone). Subjects will complete the study at the 24 month follow-up visit. For the purposes of
      this protocol, a revision will be defined as any partial or total joint arthroplasty or any
      bone fixation, bone grafting or bone substitute procedure in the same compartment in the
      study knee.
