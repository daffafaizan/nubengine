      hysterometer to visualize the axis of the uterus and to measure the distance between the
      external orifice of the cervix and the uterine fundus in order to deploy the IUD / IUS.

      In the so-called direct technique, the operator does not measure the depth of the uterus
      thanks to a hysterometer and does not draw the cervix with a Pozzi forceps, the IUD / IUS is
      deployed as soon as the orifice passes. inside the cervix and the inserter tube does not
      enter the uterine cavity. With this method the Pozzi forceps is only used as a second line,
      especially in case of a fleeing neck.
