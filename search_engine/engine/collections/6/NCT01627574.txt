      contraceptive use and decrease STIs for at-risk youth for both those who do and do not want a
      pregnancy. Those interested in becoming pregnant will be counseled in the risks associated
      with teen pregnancy and what it means to have a healthy pregnancy and raise a child. The
      investigators will utilize Title X programs in Rhode Island to provide reproductive health
      services in the community. The investigators will recruit 325 at risk youth from Juvenile
      Justice programs, alternative schools, group homes, and Community Mental Health Centers and
      randomize them to two interventions: two sessions of personalized MI or two sessions of
      Awareness for Sexual Health (ASH), both delivered individually by trained counselors. MI is
      based on the principles of the Transtheoretical Model (TTM) and on MI, an empirically
      supported counseling technique designed to enhance readiness to change targeted behaviors.
      ASH provides didactic information about contraception, STI prevention and abstinence, and is
      intended to control for the effects of assessment and attention.
