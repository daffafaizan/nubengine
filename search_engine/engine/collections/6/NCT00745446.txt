    
      18 subjects healthy male volunteers will be recruited at Ume√• University. In a randomised,
      double blind 3 way crossover trial, subjects will be exposed to filtered air, diesel exhaust
      (300mcg/m3) or filtered diesel exhaust for 1 hour during intermittent exercise.

      2 hours following the exposure, thrombogenicity will be assessed using the Badimon chamber -
      an ex-vivo model of thrombosis formed under constant flow conditions.

      Forearm blood flow in response to infused intra-brachial vasodilators will be measured using
      venous occlusion plethysmography 6 hours after the exposure.

      Arterial stiffness will be measured using peripheral arterial applanation tonometry in the
      hour post-exposure.

      Blood samples will be collected at timepoints over the 24 hours after exposure.
