    
      In the Proof-of-Concept study (CAIN457A2102/ NCT00669916), AIN457 was proven to be
      efficacious in the treatment of moderate to severe chronic plaque-type psoriasis. As a
      result, a phase IIb regimen finding study had been started (CAIN457A2211/NCT00941031).

      The data gathered in this extension study of the core study (CAIN457A2211)was used to expand
      the safety database of the compound for the treatment of moderate to severe chronic
      plaque-type psoriasis. The participants in the extension study continued to stay on the exact
      same treatment regimen they were taking when completing the core study. The extension trial
      was first designed to provide long-term safety data of up to 100 weeks of treatment (32 weeks
      in the core study plus 68 weeks in the extension study (part 1)), and an additional 12 weeks
      of treatment-free follow-up for participants who did not continue in the extension study.
      Amendment 2 provided an additional 156 weeks of treatment (32 weeks in the core study plus
      224 weeks in the extension study, equaling 256 weeks of total treatment (part 2)), before
      participants entered the 12 weeks of treatment-free follow-up. Protocol Amendment 3 extended
      the prolongation part of the study by up to 104 additional weeks of treatment (part 3) or
      until the drug was commercially available in the market of the country of participation,
      whichever occurred first.
