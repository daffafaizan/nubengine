      HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) uptake will have been developed from a prior MSM
      community-driven hackathon contest. PrEP is an antiretroviral medicines-based prevention
      strategy against HIV infection, which has been proved save and effective.

      Part 1 includes in-depth interviews with 40 HIV-negative young MSM (18 and above) with a
      brief survey to collect demographic data. The interview topics include PrEP-related
      perceptions and feedback on the design of a mini-app prototype. Findings from Part 1 will
      inform refining the mini-app before the start of Part 2.

      In Part 2, a small two-arm randomized control trial with 70 young MSM (18 and above) will be
      conducted to evaluate the preliminary efficacy of the mini-app in improving PrEP-related
      perceptions and actual PrEP uptake, compared to a control group of standard of care.

      Participants in Part 2 will be followed up for 12 weeks (8 week intervention and
      after-intervention follow-up at 12th week). A subgroup of participants (n=15) from both the
      intervention arm and the control arm will receive two rounds of in-depth interviews,
      separately at the 4th and 8th week, to share their experience of using the app and changed
      perceptions and/or behaviors related to PrEP.
