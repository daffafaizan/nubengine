      nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer will be evaluated to determine whether candidate genetic
      variants are associated with the risk of recurrence and progression. Known tumor variables
      will be stratified and correlated with markers. The long term goal is to estimate the
      predicted risk of recurrence or progression well enough to modify surveillance schedules.
      Since 40% of superficial bladder cancer patients will never recur or progress, these
      individuals could return less frequently for followup, saving costs and discomfort. All
      patients will receive usual care and be followed to determine rates of recurrence and
      progression of the disease. Each subject will donate 30 ml of blood for extraction of genomic
      DNA and isolation of lymphocytes to assess DNA damage/repair function. In addition, each
      subject who undergoes a transurethral resection of the bladder (TURB) and/or random bladder
      biopsies as part of his/her usual care will donate urothelial cells from the random bladder
      biopsies for analyses of DNA damage/repair function. The DNA repair capacity of lymphocytes
      will be correlated with that of normal bladder tissue to evaluate the use of lymphocytes as a
      surrogate marker. When bladder biopsy tissue is not available, urothelial cells will be
      obtained from a cystoscopic or catheterized bladder lavage.
