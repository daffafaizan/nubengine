      Catheter ablation of ventricular tachycardia versus combined catheter ablation of ventricular
      tachycardia and renal denervation.

      A total of 50 patients with ventricular tachycardia treated with ICD shocks or ATP will be
      enrolled in this study. The randomization in the study is done before ablation.

      For the ablation, an arterial access is required in both groups. During a 30 minutes waiting
      time which will apply to both groups, renal denervation will be performed.

      In this period of time operators and staff will be blinded for the procedure, thereby they
      won't know if the patients will receive a renal denervation, in that way the investigators
      are avoiding a bias of future treatment of the patients.

      Follow up and repeat procedures:

      All Patients will be followed for a period of 3, 6, 9, 12 and 18 months after the procedure.

      Regular visits are done in the investigators office. The visit will include ICD
      Interrogation, VT documentation in ICD Holter, 24-hour Holter ECG or Tele-ECGs,
      echocardiography.

      Re- VT ablations are allowed at any time. In case of renal artery stenosis, denervation will
      not be performed. Drug therapy can be continued.
