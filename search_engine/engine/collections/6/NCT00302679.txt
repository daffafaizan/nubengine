      sigmoidoscopy every 5 years is recommended for average risk people above 50 years old.
      However,study in Taiwanese population demonstrated that 37.8% of colorectal lesions were
      beyond reach of sigmoidoscope, and in cases with lesions with advanced pathology, 66.7% did
      not have distal colorectal lesion. However, many people think colonoscopy is more painful and
      choose sigmoidoscopy for screening. However, according to experience in a self-payed health
      check-up center,unsedated total colonoscopy is not inferior or may be better than unsedated
      sigmoidoscopy in terms of pain and patients' acceptance.
