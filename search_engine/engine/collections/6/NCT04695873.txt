      home in-use period and a final follow up phone call. The enrolment visit will include
      confirmation of eligibility and collection of baseline data, including baseline pain scores
      using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), medical history, demographics, and baseline Patient
      Reported Outcomes (PRO) assessments. Baseline data collected will be assessed to confirm
      eligibility before randomisation, first product application (treatment group only), initial
      pain (VAS) Participant Perceived Questionnaires (PPQ) and PRO assessments. During the at home
      in-use period, those participants randomised to the treatment group will reapply the product
      daily, complete pain assessments using the VAS (morning and evening), PPQs and PROs (Day 3
      evening only). For participants randomised to the no-treatment group, they will complete pain
      assessments using the VAS (morning and evening) and PROs (Day 3 evening). All participants
      will continuously record Adverse Events (AE) and changes to concomitant medication throughout
      this period. During the follow up phone call, the participants will be contacted to establish
      any further AEs and/or changes to concomitant medication, additionally any queries related to
      diary entries will be made during this phone call. Participants will not need to return to
      the site unless advised to do so by the Principal Investigator (PI) or delegate.

      After completion of the investigation, the Investigator will make an Assessment of Tolerance
      for each subject based on their pain scores (VAS), PPQ responses and AEs reported.
