      the neonatal period is generally safe and feasible, and can improve intermediate term
      survival without handicap. There is, however, no information on whether cooling improves
      longer term (school-age) outcomes in non-handicapped survivors. The current observational
      trial is designed to help obtain additional followup information on children who participated
      in the initial randomized clinical trial of head-cooling for neonatal encephalopathy. A first
      step is to collect information on the current status (at 7-8 years of age) of participants in
      the original study using a standardized telephone questionnaire. This will allow the
      investigators to more appropriately target children for whom further, more detailed,
      in-person neurodevelopmental testing would be appropriate. Given limited resources,
      identification of children for whom such testing would be helpful and instructive is a
      necessary goal.
