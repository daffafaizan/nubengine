    
      The study is designed as a double-blind, multicentre, randomised, parallel group,dose-finding
      study of the efficacy, safety and tolerability of a three day regimen of the combination of
      pyronaridine/artesunate in the ratio 3:1. Pharmacokinetics of pyronaridine will be estimated
      in a separate sub-study. Patients will be recruited from between 5 to 7 study sites and will
      be randomised to one of 3 treatment groups:

      Group A: pyronaridine+artesunate PA (PP 6 mg/kg + AS 2 mg/kg) Group B:
      pyronaridine+artesunate PA (PP 9 mg/kg + AS 3 mg/kg) Group C: pyronaridine+artesunate PA (PP
      12 mg/kg + AS 4 mg/kg) Randomisation is planned to be balanced within each study site across
      all 3 study groups in pre-assigned treatment blocks. Patients who withdraw early for any
      reason will not be replaced.

      Patients will ideally be hospitalised for at least 4 days and will be required to remain in
      the vicinity of the trial site for a minimum of 7 days from start of treatment, or when fever
      and parasite has been cleared: 2 negative readings (fever and/or slide) taken 8 hours apart
      plus another negative (fever and/or slide) 24 hours later. The patient is to return to the
      study site, or to make themselves available, for all scheduled weekly follow up visits until
      discharge at Day 42.

      Patients will remain in the study for 42 days following first dosing (D0). In the case of
      adverse events reported and unresolved at visit Day 42, patients will be followed up for a
      further 30 days, or until resolution of event.
