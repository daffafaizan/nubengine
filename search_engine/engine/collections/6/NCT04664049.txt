      Because of its strong spread, variability, survivability, and invisibility, the number of
      infected people rise rapidly. On March 11, 2020, the WHO officially declared COVID-19 as a
      pandemic disease. As of October 3, 2020, the number of confirmed cases has exceeded 34
      million, and the cumulative deaths have exceeded 1 million. There are still no drugs to

      vaccine development cannot be completed in a short period of time. At the beginning of the
      infection outbreak, the governments of China and South Korea, adopted a cooperative of
      Chinese and Western medicine to treatment the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In

      world. Dietary supplement, NRICM101, has been available for people who diagnosed, suspected
      or prevented for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in September 2020. It is expected to
      help people not to progress to severe illness, and reduce lung damage and mortality. The
      investigators gather the effects of people who taking NRICM101 using the Real-World Big Data
