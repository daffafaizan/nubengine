      telomerase peptides. Each patient is given 6 immunizations with at least 5x106 peptide/lysate
      pulsed autologous DC. Vaccination 1-4 is given weekly and 4-6 at 2-week intervals. Those
      patients who exhibit stable disease, partial response or complete response after 6 injections
      will be given 4 more vaccinations at 2-week interval. The vaccine is applied by either
      intranodal or intradermal injection near the inguinal region. For adjuvant used IL-2 2 MIU
      sc. day 2-6. Scans and re-staging tests are performed at scheduled intervals throughout the
      study.
