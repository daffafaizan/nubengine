      I. To evaluate safety of tremelimumab alone and in combination with cryoablation in patients
      with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore the longitudinal values for immunological variables (including cluster of
      differentiation [CD]4+ ICOS+ T cells; effector to regulatory T cell ratio; absolute
      lymphocyte count) following treatment with tremelimumab in patients with metastatic RCC, and
      evaluate difference between combination cryoablation and tremelimumab in comparison to
      tremelimumab alone.

      II. To determine the objective response rate and progression-free survival of patients
      treated with tremelimumab with or without cryoablation.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive tremelimumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes at weeks 1 and 5.
      Within 4-6 weeks later, patients undergo surgery or biopsy. After surgery or biopsy, patients
      receive tremelimumab IV every 4 weeks (Q4W) for 3 doses, and then every 12 weeks (Q12W) in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM B: Patients undergo cryoablation and receive tremelimumab IV over 60 minutes at weeks 1
      (2-6 days after cryoablation) and 5. Within 4-6 weeks later, patients undergo surgery or
      biopsy. After surgery or biopsy, patients receive tremelimumab IV Q4W for 3 doses, and then
      Q12W in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30, 60, and 90 days, and
      then every 6 months.
