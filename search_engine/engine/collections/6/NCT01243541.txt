      rating scale; as measured by NPSI) between treated and untreated extremities at conclusion of
      paclitaxel therapy). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Differences in nail toxicity between treated
      and untreated extremities as measured by NCI-CTC v4.0 from baseline to conclusion of taxane
      therapy and at each time point (after each infusion and at conclusion of taxane therapy). II.
      Differences in peripheral sensory neuropathy subscale of NCI-CTC v 4.0 between treated and
      untreated extremities at each time point (after each infusion and at conclusion of paclitaxel
      therapy). III. Differences in pain intensity (0-10 from BPI) between treated and untreated
      extremities at each time point (after each infusion and at conclusion of paclitaxel therapy).
      IV. Differences in quantitative sensory testing between treated and untreated extremities at
      each time point (after each infusion and at conclusion of paclitaxel therapy). OUTLINE:
      Patients are randomized to 1of 2 treatment arms. ARM I. Patients wear an Elasto-Gel cold
      glove and sock on their dominant hand and foot every two weeks on days the patient is
      scheduled for paclitaxel.The glove and sock is worn for 15 minutes prior to paclitaxel
      infusion, 3 hours during treatment, and for 15 minutes after completion of chemotherapy for a
      total of 210 minutes. ARM II: Patients wear an Elasto-Gel cold glove and sock on their
      non-dominant hand and foot every two weeks on days the patient is scheduled for paclitaxel.
      The glove and sock is worn for 15 minutes prior to paclitaxel infusion, 3 hours during
      treatment, and for 15 minutes after completion of chemotherapy for a total of 210 minutes. In
      both arms, treatment repeats every 2 weeks for 4 courses in the absences of unacceptable
      toxicity.
