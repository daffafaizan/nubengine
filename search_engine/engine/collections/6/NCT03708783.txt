      gastric cancer. And D2 lymphadenectomy, including No. 10 lymph node dissection, should be
      performed according to the Japanese treatment guidelines for gastric cancer. Because of the
      complexity of the anatomy around the spleen, spleen-preserving No. 10 lymph node dissection
      is difficult. Although Professor Huang from Fujian Medical University Union Hospital has
      proposed the "Huang's three-step maneuver" to dissect No. 10 lymph node with preserved spleen
      laparoscopically, such method is far from popularized, especially in North China. In
      addition, the safety, feasibility and oncological efficacy of this method was not confirmed
      in such area, either.

      In this study, a prospective, single center, single-arm, non-inferiority clinical trial will
      be conducted to evaluate the short and long-term outcome of the laparoscopic
      spleen-preserving No. 10 lymph node dissection for patients with locally advanced middle or
      upper third gastric cancer in Beijing.
