        -  To evaluate whether serum NGAL, MMP-9, NGAL/MMP-9 complex, and soluble E-cadherin can be
           utilized as biomarkers to predict response in patients with non-small cell lung cancer
           treated with erlotinib hydrochloride.

      OUTLINE: Serum samples are analyzed for NGAL, MMP-9, NGAL/MMP-9, and soluble E-cadherin by
      ELISA and Luminex assays.
