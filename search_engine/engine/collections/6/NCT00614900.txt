      disease (COPD) is unclear. The presence of an abnormally increased pulmonary blood pressure
      worsens the prognosis of COPD, but the patients are not currently diagnosed or treated for
      pulmonary hypertension. The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence of pulmonary
      hypertension in 200 patients with COPD and explore whether it worsens functional capacity and
      symptoms. Furthermore we will look into whether blood gas values, NT-proBNP, CRP and lung
      function test result can predict which patients are at risk of having pulmonary hypertension.

      Methods: All patients will be screened by echocardiography. Those with signs of pulmonary
      hypertension will be admitted to right heart catheterization for direct measurements of
      pulmonary haemodynamics.

      All patients will perform a 6 minutes walk test and spirometry. Blood levels of NT-proBNP and
      CRP will be measured. Life quality by the St. George Questionnaire and contacts to the health
      care system is also assessed. Differences in these parameters are analyzed among patients
      with no, moderate or severe pulmonary hypertension.
