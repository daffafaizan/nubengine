      concentration, volume) in men with secondary hypogonadism who have been previously treated
      with topical testosterone. A maximum of twelve subjects per group were randomized to daily
      treatments of Androxal® or topical testosterone (Testim®) for six months. The protocol was
      later amended to include a treatment group who received Androxal after a 3 month wash out
      period.
