      and genetic etiology of Proteus syndrome (PS) and other overgrowth disorders hypothesized to
      be in the PI3K/AKT pathway. As we have recently determined the molecular cause of PS and the
      related disorder of fibroadipose overgrowth, our main objectives moving forward include
      genotype-phenotype correlations, identifying quantifiable phenotypic characteristics in
      patients and measuring changes in these characteristics over time, developing potential
      biomarkers for future therapeutic research, and using our new molecular insights to expand
      our understanding of both PS and related overgrowth disorders. The natural history and
      specific phenotypic characteristics of patients with PS and selected other overgrowth
      disorders will be determined by clinical assessment and longitudinal follow-up of patients,
      which includes patients who have been exposed to therapeutic agents, such as an AKT
      inhibitor. Subjects will be screened for eligibility using published diagnostic criteria for
      PS; screening for AKT1 and other pathway gene mutations may be used in patients with
      overlapping phenotypes. The discovery of the AKT1 activating mutation in patients with this
      disease provides an attractive target for directed treatment for this devastating disorder.
      This protocol aims to aid in identifying individuals with molecularly-confirmed AKT1
      mutations who may be candidates for pharmacologic interventional studies. We also propose to
      expand our clinical ascertainment to determine the full range of PS/AKT1 activating mutation
      phenotypes and to study other overlapping conditions. The etiology of these disorders will be
      studied using candidate gene analysis (primarily based on the PI3K/AKT pathway) and possibly
      exome and whole genome sequencing, performed as part of protocol 10-HG-0065.
