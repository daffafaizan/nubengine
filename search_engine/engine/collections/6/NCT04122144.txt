      standardized peer mother support (ENHANCED-SPS) intervention will increase viral load
      suppression among HIV-infected pregnant and post-partum women and increase retention of
      mothers in care hence resulting in reduced risk of vertical transmission in south western
      Uganda.

      Specific objectives are as follows:

      1) To evaluate the effectiveness of an enhanced VL counseling and standardized peer mother
      support intervention on viral suppression among HIV infected pregnant women at 12 months of
      follow up; 2) To evaluate the effect of the enhanced counseling and peer support intervention
      on retention in care at 18 months postpartum follow up; The investigators will randomize 14
      HIV clinics to the ENHANCED-SPS multi-component intervention vs. standard of care procedures
      (intervention=7 clinics and control=7 clinics,n=70 mothers/health facility) ;3) To assess the
      facilitators and barriers of VL and enhanced VL counseling and peer mother support
      intervention at 9 & 18 months of follow up.This will consider both patient and providers
      perspectives of the intervention implementation
