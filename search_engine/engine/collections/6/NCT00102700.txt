    
      This is a single-arm, non-randomized study of ARQ 501 in combination with gemcitabine in
      adult patients with treatment-na√Øve, unresectable, metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The
      study objectives are:

      Primary Objective:

        -  Assess the overall response rate (ORR) of patients treated with ARQ 501 in combination
           with gemcitabine.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  Determine time to tumor progression (TTP) of patients treated with ARQ 501 in
           combination with gemcitabine

        -  Further characterize the safety of ARQ 501 in combination with gemcitabine
