    
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the acute effects of a nonselective inhibitor of
      glutamate mediated synaptic transmission on the severity of parkinsonian signs and
      levodopa-associated motor response complications in patients with moderately advanced
      Parkinson's disease. In a controlled proof-of-principle clinical trial, the efficacy of the
      glutamate release inhibitor riluzole will be assessed through the use of validated motor
      function scales. Safety will be monitored by means of frequent clinical evaluations and
      laboratory tests.
