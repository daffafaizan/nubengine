      a significant mortality, morbidity and cost. It occurs frequently in patients who are
      intubated and on a ventilator. In two phase I/II clinical studies, we tested endotracheal
      tubes (ETT), internally coated with bacteriocidal agents, and the Mucus Shaver, which removes
      material from the inside of the endotracheal tube. We showed 1) no adverse events, 2) that
      coating the inner wall of the ETT with silver-sulfadiazine significantly reduced bacterial
      colonization of the ETT; and 3) the Mucus Shaver cleans the lumen, leaving the entire
      endotracheal tube free of secretions, and maintains the lumen diameter. In this study, to
      evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Mucus Shaver with the coated ETT, we propose to
      conduct a randomized trial in intubated patients on prolonged mechanical ventilation.
