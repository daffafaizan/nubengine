      FDA-cleared for liposuction and fat transfer) to perform a novel, minimally invasive
      laparoscopic and mini-laparotomy procedure to selectively remove intra-abdominal fat from the
      mesentery and to assess the resulting changes in blood glucose control, insulin sensitivity
      and body weight. Excess intra-abdominal mesenteric fat has been directly linked to insulin
      resistance, an important precursor of type 2 diabetes. Up to 30 study candidates will undergo
      screening and eligibility testing over a 5-week period from which 12 will be enrolled to
      undergo the procedure. During the 12-month period post-procedure, the patients will be
      periodically monitored for improvements in blood glucose control (HbA1c, oral glucose
      tolerance test (OGTT), fasting blood glucose (FBG) and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)),
      insulin resistance (hyperinsulinemic euglycemic glucose clamp), body weight, changes in fat
      deposits (Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) and
      Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA)) and overall metabolic health (including indirect
      calorimetry and various biomarkers). This prospective, single-arm study uses pre-operative
      patient data as the control. Safety assessments and monitoring for adverse events will be
      performed, throughout.
