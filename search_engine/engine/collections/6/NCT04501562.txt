      this is expected to double in 2030 (Singapore Department of Statistics, Ministry of Manpower,
      Registry of Birth and Deaths, September 2014). Cardiovascular diseases account for the
      majority of disability-adjusted life years by broad cause group, accounting for 20% of
      399,675 life years lost due to mortality and ill-health in 2010 (Source: Estimates from the
      Singapore Burden of Disease Study 2010).

      While chronological ageing is inevitable, a clear understanding is needed as to how ageing
      becomes a critical risk component of CVD for some individuals, and the mechanisms through
      which ageing results in such a vulnerable phenotype that leads towards clinical CVD.
      Following that, clinical tools and clinical guidelines to reduce cardiovascular disease and
      other health burdens contributed by ageing may be formulated. Such strategies may potentially
      reduce burdens and cost of healthcare provision to the ageing population.

      Our proposal will generate data that identifies functional and structural changes in the
      cardiovascular system that occur in during ageing. Using a longitudinal design, this research
      will provide high quality evidence that distinguishes healthy from unhealthy cardiovascular
      ageing, and reveal determinants and impact of CV ageing over time on CVD and associated
      health outcomes.
