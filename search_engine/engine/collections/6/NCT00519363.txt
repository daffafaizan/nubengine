      dyslipidemias. It is a relatively safe drug to use with periodic monitoring.

      Eligibility critera:

        -  age 18-60, females, as a marjority of lupus patients are female

        -  at least 4 ACR (American College of Rheumatology) criteria of SLE(Systemic Lupus
           Erythematosus)

        -  Moderate to Severe disease activity using approved SLEDAI(Systemic Lupus Erythematosus
           Disease Activity Index)

        -  LDL cholesterol 100-190mg/dl

      Exclusion criteria:

        -  Pregnancy, and or lactating or wants to get pregnant

        -  Unable to take atorvastatin due to allergy, liver disease, elevated liver functions,
           myositis, or elvated CPK(creatine phosphakinase)

        -  already on lipid lowering therapy

        -  already on amiodarone, clarithromycin, cyclosporin, erythromycin, itraconazole,
           ketoconazole, nefazodone, verapamil, protease inhibitors, niacin, digoxin,k
           cholestyramine, colestipol

        -  has a dianosis of Myositis. Our goal is to colledt preliminary data to see if there is a
           trend for the efficacy of atorvastatin in ameliorating SLE disease activity and to
           evaluate TLRs(Toll-like receptor) in SLE patients. A p value of <0.05 will be considered
           statistically significant. Our baseline and at subsequent visits, we will have 80% power
           to detect a minimum of 34%-39% difference for most of the continous variables measured
           at different intervals.
