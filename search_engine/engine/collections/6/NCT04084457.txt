      in cerebral blood flow, with subsequent improvements in vascular and cognitive function. In
      this study, the investigators aim to directly link daily blueberry consumption with improved
      vascular function, increased cerebral blood flow and positive cognitive outcomes in healthy
      elderly individuals. The investigators will use a large group of elderly individuals'
      representative of a healthy population, both males and females, aged 65-80 years to evaluate
      the health effects of daily blueberry consumption.

      The main aim is to investigate whether improvements in vascular and cognitive function
      previously seen after blueberry consumption can be seen following 3-months daily consumption
      in elderly individuals, and whether enhanced cognitive performance is correlated with
      increased cerebral blood flow. The investigators hypothesise that daily consumption of an
      anthocyanin rich blueberry drink will improve cognitive performance and vascular function,
      increasing cerebral blood flow, in healthy older individuals.
