      special sensory motor and visual motility, investigaters want to improve the clinical
      condition and quality of life of STROKE participants.

      The investigaters randomly select participants who only perform the rehabilitation treatment
      have performed. The other group that will receive the study's control group will receive the
      traditional rehabilitation physiotherapy treatment.

      The investigaters assess the condition and quality of life of the patients. (EQ5-D, Barthel
      index, MRS test) The ivestigaters examine the functional movement and equilibrium variables
      of patients. (6MWT, Berg balance test, postgraduation) After that, participants are
      undergoing a 4-week intensive rehabilitation treatment. All participants are in post stroke.

      Primary Hypothesis will be changes in life-quality tests (EQ5-D, Barthel index, MRS test).
      Functional tests show progress 6MWT, Berg balance test and postural control testing with
      posturography. The results are compared and evaluated among the groups.

      The expected hypothesis is that visual and acoustic stimulation produces a better physical
      state at higher intensity.
