    
      A Phase III, multicenter, randomized study to compare the rate of CR and duration of CR, in
      patients with TP53-mutated MDS who will receive APR-246 and azacitidine or azacitidine alone.

      Treatment will be administered on an outpatient basis. No investigational or commercial
      agents or therapies other than those described below may be administered with the intent to
      treat the patient's disease.

      Patients will be randomized (1:1) to one of two arms:

        1. Experimental arm: APR-246 + azacitidine; or

        2. Control arm: Azacitidine
