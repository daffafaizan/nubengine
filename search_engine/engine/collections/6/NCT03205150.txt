      placebo-controlled, parallel group study in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis
      (NASH).

      The study consisted of a 28 day screening period (Day -44 to Day -16), a baseline period of
      14 days (Day -15 to Day -1), a treatment period of 12 weeks (Day 1 to Day 84), and a study
      completion evaluation approximately 28 days after the last drug administration. The patients
      were advised to maintain their recommended diet during the study.

      Patients who met the inclusion/exclusion criteria at screening went to the study site for
      baseline assessments. All baseline safety evaluation results were available prior to the
      first dosing.

      The study started by enrolling patients into the 150 mg and placebo arms with a randomization
      ratio of 2:1. After the enrollment of the first 33 patients, the 30 mg arm was added to the
      study and the randomization ratio changed to a 2:4:1 ratio (150 mg: 30 mg: placebo) to
      maintain the 2:2:1 ratio across the three groups (150 mg: 30 mg: placebo) at study
      completion.
