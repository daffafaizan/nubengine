      presented simultaneously and separately to each ear. The brain, following binaural beat
      processing, synchronizes to the frequency difference between the two waves. Therefore, using
      a 5 Hz frequency difference (theta rhythm), which promotes relaxation, we could alleviate
      pain perception and subsequent analgesic medication use.

      Patients suffering from chronic pain will receive two consecutive interventions: binaural
      beat signals embedded in relaxing music and placebo (relaxing music without the binaural beat
      component), in random order.

      Electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings will be used to confirm brain frequency
      synchronization, whereas pain severity scales and a diary recording analgesic medication use
      will be used to identify differences between intervention and placebo arms.
