    
      The purpose of this study is to learn if it is possible and safe to treat persons with severe
      sickle cell disease (SCD) by bone marrow transplant (BMT) from human leukocyte antigen (HLA)
      half-matched related donors. Preparation before transplant includes the chemotherapy drugs
      hydroxyurea, fludarabine, thiotepa, anti-thymocyte globulin, and cyclophosphamide. It also
      includes radiation.

      Investigators also seek to understand the side effects of BMT in adolescents and young adults
      with SCD and measure how often serious side effects occur including those that are expected
      and unexpected. After transplant, investigators will measure the health of the body organs
      that ordinarily would have been damaged by having SCD in addition to testing the lungs,
      brain, and kidneys.
