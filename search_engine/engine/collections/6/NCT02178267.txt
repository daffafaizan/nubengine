      such as developmental immaturity of the immune system, encountering with the flora of
      neonatal intensive care unit, exposure to diagnostic and therapeutic interventional
      procedures, use of antibiotics, delay of enteral feeding may poorly affect the development of
      natural and mucosal immunity of intestine in newborns preterm during postnatal period.
      Exposure to these factors, newborn preterm infants' life threatens especially to change the
      development of the normal intestinal flora and intestinal immunity. Many randomized
      controlled studies reported that probiotics reduce intestinal inflammatory process and
      prevent colonization with pathogenic microorganisms of the intestines . In this study, the
      investigators investigated the effect of probiotic use on colonization of resistant
      microorganisms in newborn preterm infants receiving antibiotics.
