      risk of life that does not respond to conventional treatments. Hypoxic refractory syndromes,
      such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, are referred to as veno-venous ECMO (for
      Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation) (ECMO VV), whereas terminal cardiac dysfunctions require
      veno-arterial ECMO (VA ECMO). recovery of function (cardiotropic intoxication), or in the
      most severe cases, pending transplantation or long-term assistance.

      This is a qualified pilot study, as it is the first one interested in evaluating the quality
      of the GFR estimate of the two estimation equations (CKD-EPI and Cockcroft formula) by
      relative to the measured clearance of creatinine, a method that can be performed routinely in
      intensive care, for resuscitation patients under veno-arterial or veno-venous ECMO.
