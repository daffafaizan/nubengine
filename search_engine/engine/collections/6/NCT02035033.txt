        1. Osteoporosis (op) is a disorder of bone characterized by reduced mineral density and
           bone mass. The first step in the prevention and treatment of Op is ensuring adequate
           intake of calcium and vitamin D . While calcium supplementations clearly slow bone loss
           in both sexes,(1,2) their effects on fracture risk are less certain.(3,4)

        2. Experimental data suggest that . vitamin D 25 affects cardiac muscle directly; controls
           PTH secretion, regulates the rennin-angiotensin - aldosterone system, and modulates the
           immune system.(5) Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with hypertension; several
           types of vascular disease and heart failure.

        3. Evidence suggests that high calcium intake might protect against vascular disease.

      There is evidence that calcium intake might impact on serum lipid concentrations.(6) There is
      also evidence that calcium supplementation reduces blood pressure,(7) and that CV mortality
      is lower in hard water areas.(8)

      In contrast to the above a recent randomized, placebo controlled trial in 1471 postmenopausal
      women (mean age 74) reported in the BMJ (2 February 2008) found an increased rate of vascular
      events in healthy older women receiving calcium supplementation.

      Outcome measures were assesed over 5 years and included death, myocardial infarction, ,
      stroke, transient ischaemic attack and development of angina pectoris.A composite end point
      of major adverse events (MACE= major advrse cardiac events) included myocardial infarction,
      stroke, or sudden death. MACE was also more common in the calcium group (101 events in 69
      women v 54 events in 42 women, P=0.008). Adjudicated myocardial infarction was more common in
      the calcium group (24 events in 21 women v 10 events in 10 women, relative risk 2.12, 95%
      confidence interval 1.01 to 4.47).For stroke the relative risk was 1.37 (0.83 to 2.28) and
      the rate ratio was 1.45 (0.88 to 2.49). The authors concluded that calcium supplementation in
      healthy postmenopausal women is associated with upward trends in cardiovascular event rates
      and that this potentially detrimental effect should be balanced against the likely benefits
      of calcium on bone. (9) Possible mechanisms: The finding of an adverse trend in vascular
      events with calcium supplementation is not necessarily surprising, since calcium supplements
      acutely elevate serum calcium levels possibly accelerating vascular calcification, which is
      predictive of vascular event rates. Multiple observational studies have shown that cardiac
      event rate increases markedly over several years of follow-up with increasing levels of
      CAC(Coronary artery calcium) independently of conventional risk factors. CAC scoring has been
      advocated asa screening test for coronary disease risk in individuals at intermediate risk
      for coronary events

      AIMS of current study: To define the relationship between calcium in the diet and
      supplementation to the level of TSH : PTH; vitamin D; creatinine in blood; calcium and
      Phosphor in blood and urine and the calcium score in the coronary blood vessels .

      Methods:

      Prospective study One center study includes Carmel hospital ;Line clinic and Zvolon clinic.
      Collaboration between the radiologic department in Carmel hospital and the endocrine
      department in Line and Zolon.

      Includes 500 participants how recent or planned cardiac CT in the Carmel hospital.

      The subject will sign an informed consent before the collection of blood tests for calcium,
      phosphor, creatinin, vitamin D, and PTH , TSH, urine tests for calcium if they don't have a
      recent tests(three month) in the OPHEQ .

      Questionnaire. -

      Inclusion criteria:

      Recent or planned coronary artery calcium scoring performed at Carmel Hospital With or
      without simultaneously performed cardiac CT angiography.

      Male and Female. Aged 50-80 years. Hebrew speakers

      Exclusion criteria:

      Below age 50 years. Above age 80 years. Previous cardiac surgery . Inadequate cardiac CT
      study

      End point:

      Correlation between calcium score and the level of VIT D,PTH;TSH in the blood Calcium
      phosphor in blood and urine and calcium in diet and supplementation.

      Statistical analysis:

      Standard statistical analysis techniques SPSS 14 (T TEST, ANOVA, Spearman&Pearson
      correlation, will used in order to find the correlation between calcium score and blood
      levels of the above.
