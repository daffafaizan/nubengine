    
      In a previous randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled pilot study, subjects taking the
      nutritional supplements contained in these two weight loss plans had a short-term
      statistically significant increase in their resting metabolic rates as compared to taking a
      placebo. No increases were found in blood pressure, resting heart rate, or self-reported
      discomfort when taking the supplement.

      The current study was designed to extend the findings of the pilot study over a 60-day study
      period using a randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled protocol with the same weight
      loss interventions.
