      its role in the evaluation of cerebral dural venous sinuses in neonates has not been
      established. It is very important to evaluate the cerebral dural venous sinuses, as cerebral
      sinovenous thrombosis (CSVT) is an increasingly recognized condition in neonates.

      There is an obvious clinical need for systematically evaluating the role of ultrasound with
      doppler in the evaluation of cerebral venous sinuses. Advances in diagnostic imaging have led
      to rapid clinical implementation of newer technologies like MR and CT for evaluation of
      venous sinuses. However technological advances in older imaging methods like ultrasound which
      have advantages of being non-invasive and being performed at the bedside have not been
      evaluated.
