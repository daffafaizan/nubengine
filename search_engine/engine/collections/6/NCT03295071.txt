    
      The purpose of this study is to understand the evolution of visual functional and structural
      changes and other associated symptoms in patients with LHON. The relation between genetic,
      lifestyle and/or environmental factors and the LHON disease will be described, and a better
      understanding of the natural history of LHON disease and the healthcare associated to with
      the disease will be sought.

      In addition, we would also like to understand the economic burden for patients and their
      families with LHON resulting from direct and indirect costs they may have because of their
      disease.
