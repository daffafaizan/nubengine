    
      This treatment plan is intended for the use of UX007 (triheptanoin) in the treatment of a
      single patient with Glucose Transporter 1 (GLUT1) Deficiency Syndrome. Patient has already
      tried the other acceptable treatments for GLUT1 with either side effects that caused
      treatment to be discontinued (Ketogenic Diet) or a current treatment that is not showing any
      efficacy and is difficult to sustain for a long duration given this patient's age (modified
      Atkins diet). Due to the patient's ongoing neuroregression and lack of other viable
      treatments, the use of UX007 (triheptanoin) is warranted. There is no comparable or
      satisfactory alternative therapy to treat this patient's severely debilitating condition and
      the potential benefits to the patient justify the potential risks of the treatment. The
      potential risks from UX007 (triheptanoin) are not unreasonable given the context of this
      patient's condition.
