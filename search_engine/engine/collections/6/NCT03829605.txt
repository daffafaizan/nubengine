      foundation for human death in developing as well as developed countries. Ischemic necrosis of
      the myocardium is called myocar¬dial infarction. Despite improvements in medical and
      interventional therapies in recent years, acute myocar¬dial infarction is still an important
      cause of mortal¬ity and morbidity. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a colorless, water-soluble gas
      and is an endogenously produced labile diffusible mediator with multiple roles in the
      cardiovascular system in health and disease. H2S is endogenously generated, and
      cystathionine-β-synthase (CBS), cystathionine-γ-lyase (CSE), and 3-mercaptopyruvate
      sulfurtransferase (3-MST) are key enzymes involved in its biological production. Once
      interacting with carbon monoxide and nitric oxide, H2S will initiate a unique gaseous
      signaling net¬work and participate in the regulation of multiple patho¬physiological
      processes. Plasma H2S levels negatively correlated with HbA1c, duration of diabetes, and
      systolic and diastolic blood pressures.
