      I. To determine if the alterations in morphology and phenotype to the sentinel lymph nodes
      are reversible.

      II. To determine if the restoration of the morphology or phenotype of sentinel lymph nodes
      results in diminished regional tumor burden.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive sargramostim subcutaneously (SC) 3-5 days prior to undergoing
      sentinel lymph node biopsy.

      ARM II: Patients receive hypertonic saline SC 3-5 days prior to undergoing sentinel lymph
      node biopsy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.
