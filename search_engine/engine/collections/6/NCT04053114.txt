    
      This is a retrospective cohort with collection of tissues samples (FFPE or frozen), including
      female patients >18-year-old treated in French between 2009 and 2016 for a thyroid carcinoma
      on struma ovarii. Clinical data and tissues will be centralized for assessment. One of the
      endpoint is the description of the population (such as baseline clinical and pathologist
      characteristics, first treatment, survival, treatment relapse) ; the other endpoint is the
      comparison between the genomic profile of the tumor tissues obtained in NGS and those of the
      thyroid carcinomas obtained from the TCGA.
