      Adult Appendicitis Score between 11 and 15. The estimated prevalence of appendicitis in such
      patients is around 50%.

      Diagnostic imaging is done using conditional computed tomography i.e. abdominal ultrasound
      first and computed tomography only after negative or inconclusive appendicitis after
      ultrasound.

      In observation group repeated clinical examination is done after 6-8 hours interval with
      repeated blood test for calculation of Adult Appendicitis Score. Patients with decreasing
      score value continue observation without imaging, whereas patients with the same score value
      or higher (but below 16) undergo diagnostic imaging as in other group. Laparoscopy is done
      without imaging in patients with high score (16 or higher). Antibiotics are not allowed, but
      prophylactic antibiotics during induction of anesthesia are allowed.
