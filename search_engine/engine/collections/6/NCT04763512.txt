      onset within the first 6 months of life and 60% develop within the first year (Bieber 2010).
      Besides environmental factors, the aetiology of AD has been found to be associated with
      genetic variants involved in skin barrier function defect and inflammation, leading to dry
      skin with increases in susceptibility to environmental exposures (Bieber 2008).

      Partially hydrolysed cow's milk (whey) protein infant formula (pHF) has been shown to be
      effective in prevention of AD, both among at-risk and healthy infants (Exl, Deland et al.
      2000, von Berg, Koletzko et al. 2003, Jingrana and Dunjina 2015). However, to date there are
      no published pediatric data to document the relationship between partially hydrolysed protein
      formulas and skin barrier function, specifically evaluating the effect of pHF on
      Trans-epidermal Water Loss (TEWL) among infants. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the
      effect on skin barrier function as measured by TEWL and we hypothesize that infants consuming
      partially hydrolysed starter formula will have lower TEWL when compared infants consuming
      intact cow's milk protein starter formula.
