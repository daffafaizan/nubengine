        -  Compare the response rate of patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma treated with
           dexamethasone with or without thalidomide.

        -  Compare the toxicity of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Assess the effect of thalidomide on bone marrow microvessel density and angiogenesis
           grade and on the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and basic fibroblast
           growth factor in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment
      arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral thalidomide once daily on days 1-28 and oral dexamethasone
           once daily on days 1-4, 9-12, and 17-20. Patients also receive either pamidronate IV
           over 2-4 hours or zoledronate IV over 15 minutes on day 1 for bone strengthening.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive dexamethasone and pamidronate or zoledronate as in arm I.

      Treatment in both arms repeats every 28 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients may receive additional courses after the
      fourth course at the physician's discretion.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 194 patients (97 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
