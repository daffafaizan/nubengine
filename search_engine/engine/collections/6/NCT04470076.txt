      survival rate between 26%-60%. The recommended adjuvant therapy for stage Ⅱa-Ⅲb NSCLC were
      adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy. As for advanced NSCLC with EGFR activating mutation,
      EGFR-TKI combination with chemotherapy had improved survival compared with EGFR-TKI alone.
      The Chinese Thoracic Oncology Group-1103 (CTONG-1103) trial showed that neoadjuvant erlotinib
      has better PFS than neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

      The investigators propose that neoadjuvant EGFR-TKI combination with chemotherapy for stage
      Ⅱa-Ⅲb NSCLC with EGFR activating mutation might have better pathological response and
      disease-free survival (DFS) than chemotherapy alone, and maximize benefit early in a
      patient's treatment course. At the same time, dynamic 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron
      emission tomography (18F-FDG PET) was used to evaluate the standardized uptake value (SUV)
      and uptake rate constant (Ki) changes of lesions before and after treatment, so as to
      accurately and quantitatively monitor the tumor response of different therapy.
