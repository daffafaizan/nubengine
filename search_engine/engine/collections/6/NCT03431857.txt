    
      The TESS Shoulder System has been developed to provide a complete solution for many
      indications of shoulder arthroplasty. This system is founded on an original concept of an
      epiphyseal fixation with an optional stem. It comprises an Anatomic, a Reverse and a Stemmed
      version, however only the Anatomic and Reverse versions are part of this study.

      200 subjects suitable for TESS Shoulder Replacement are included into this study (Anatomic
      and Reverse). All potential study subjects are required to participate in the Informed
      Consent process.
