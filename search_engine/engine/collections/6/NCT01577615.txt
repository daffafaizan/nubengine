      last for approximately twenty four months. Infants will have daily assessments while in the
      hospital and three study visits after hospital discharge. All post-discharge visits will
      occur in an out patient hospital setting. During the first days of life, study staff will
      start observing infant's development by using assessment tools. Lab samples include one blood
      sample taken when other blood is being collected in the first days of life and one saliva
      sample when the infants starts bottle feeding.

      When tube feedings are started in the study group, caregivers (nurses, parents or research
      staff) will gently place hands on the infant while in the incubator (ill babies) or bundled
      outside the incubator. If the infant is in the control group, they will receive standard tube
      feeding care.

      When oral feedings are started in the study group, the infant will have an opportunity at
      every feeding to be breast or bottle fed while being held. If unable to complete the entire
      feeding orally, the rest will be tube fed.

      If the infant is in the control group, feeding opportunities will be decided by the medical
      team providing care.

      All infants will be observed during oral feedings twice a week while in the hospital. Study
      staff will watch heart rate, sucking activity (a sensor on the chin) and level of
      wakefulness.
