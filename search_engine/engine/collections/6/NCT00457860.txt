      Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to a total of 10 courses in the absence of dose
      limiting toxicity, complete response or disease progression. Patients are followed at 1, 3,
      6,12,15,18, 21, 24 months following the start of the last treatment cycle.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients each will receive escalating doses of recombinant CAT-8015 until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose proceeding that at
      which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is
      determined, between16 to 25 new patients will be added to the MTD cohort depending on how
      well the CAT-8015 is tolerated.
