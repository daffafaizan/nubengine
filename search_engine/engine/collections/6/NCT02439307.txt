      mortality. Currently, there is no consensus on treatment and yet there are few proven
      treatment options. Among the factors associated with MHE, is the small intestinal bacterial
      overgrowth (SIBO) present in 38.6% of patients with MHE. Rifaximin is a broad spectrum
      antimicrobial administered orally, with low risk of inducing bacterial resistance, and has
      been used in the treatment of MHE. It is unknown if the beneficial effect on MHE is
      associated with the elimination of SIBO and its efficacy when administered in patients with
      simultaneous diagnosis of MHE and SIBO was never been evaluated. The aim of our study is to
      evaluate the effect of rifaximin on MHE and SIBO in patients with cirrhosis.
