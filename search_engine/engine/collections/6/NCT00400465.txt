      Khonkaen University was performed this operation about 200 cases per years. After an
      operation a pressure dressing by Hypafix is usually used due to the belief that it will help
      to reduce complications such as post-operative bleeding or haematoma. However, the practice
      is uncomfortable to patients and makes it hard to detect early haematomas.

      We carried out a prospective randomised study to study the role of pressure dressing after
      thyroid surgery by evaluating the amount of fluids collected in the operative bed by
      ultrasonography compared with normal dressing.
