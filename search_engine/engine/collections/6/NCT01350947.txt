      5-azacitidine to determine the rates of complete hematologic response, hematologic
      improvement, complete and partial cytogenetic response, and overall and progression free
      survival.

      To develop biomarkers associated with response and gain insights into the mechanisms that
      determine response, gene expression profiling, genome-wide SNP array analysis, microRNA
      analysis, and DNA methylation analysis will be performed prior to therapy and at defined time
      points during the study. Phosphoproteomics profiling may be included in the analysis.
