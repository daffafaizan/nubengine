      of 50 years. It is a disabling disease that leads to wheelchair confinement. The cause is
      unknown but autoimmune mechanisms have been implicated. The primary goal of the study is to
      search for candidate autoantigen(s) that drive the autoimmune response and identify candidate
      pathogenic T-cell epitopes among the endomysial T-cells extracted from the patients' muscle
      biopsies. It is anticipated that the search for the antigens implicated in the clonal
      expansion of endomysial T-cells over time will elucidate the autoimmune pathogenesis of the
      disease and lead to the development of antigen-specific immunomodulatory therapeutic
      strategies. This is an investigative study intended to better define the pathogenesis of
      s-IBM. No new therapy will be provided except of standard care.
