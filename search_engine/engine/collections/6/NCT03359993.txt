      umbilical vein is clearly visible, and a blood reflux can be found easily. The investigators
      used the same equipment required for a peripheral venous injection: 24 gauge cannula,
      antisepsis, compress, and a syringe with the prepared anesthetic drugs. The investigators
      report 5 cases of intubations in the delivery room using this method to administer the
      premedication.
