      I. To assess the feasibility of implementing a Precision Oncology protocol in the treatment
      of patients who undergo genomic sequencing.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine treatment response rates in patients who receive targeted treatment versus
      those who do not receive targeted treatment.

      II. To assess survival in patients who receive targeted treatment versus those who do not
      receive targeted treatment.

      III. To assess changes in patient-reported outcomes in patients who receive targeted
      treatment versus those who do not receive targeted treatment.

      IV. To perform exploratory statistical genetic and bioinformatics analyses using the data
      derived from the genomic sequencing to catalogue additional important variants and determine
      whether there are any patterns or associations among patient level risk factors, their
      outcomes and genomic information that was not identified by the original genomic sequencing
      analyses.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive treatment based on the results of their genomic sequencing analyses.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2 months.
