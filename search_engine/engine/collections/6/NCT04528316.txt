      not yet convincing due to small numbers of participants and insufficient study methodology.
      More and high-quality evidence is needed in order to be able to draft exercise and physical
      activity guidelines for this population. Despite the positive results of exercise
      interventions in adult cancer patients, the evidence for benefits in childhood cancer
      patients is limited.

      There are Two Main objectives:

        1. To investigate the effectiveness of Pilates core stability exercises program. 2. To
           investigate the effectiveness of Humac balance and tilt system.

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. The effectiveness of coordination training in children with posterior fossa tumors.

        2. The comparison between balance and coordination training and which of both trainings has
           more effect.

      This study will take place in a pediatric oncology setting, Children's Cancer Hospital
      Egypt(CCHE), in outpatient setting. Patients will be evaluated for their balance and
      coordination at initial presentation, during treatment, and during follow-up after end of
      treatment at CCHE. Also patients will receive balance and coordination training, before each
      chemotherapy cycle-maximum one week- given the patient is in good state.

      Sixty children with posterior fossa tumors of both sexes will participate in this study. They
      will be selected from CCHE. They will be randomly assigned into 3 groups of equal number.
