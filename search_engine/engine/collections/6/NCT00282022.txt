        -  Determine the overall response rate (partial and complete) in patients with relapsed or
           refractory locally advanced or metastatic small cell lung cancer treated with VNP40101M.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to disease state
      (sensitive relapse [progressive disease > 3 months after responding to first-line
      chemotherapy] vs resistant disease [progressive disease during or â‰¤ 3 months after first-line
      chemotherapy]).

      Patients receive VNP40101M IV over 15-30 minutes once weekly for 3 weeks. Treatment repeats
      every 6 weeks for up to 6 courses. Patients achieving a complete response (CR) receive 2
      additional courses of therapy after CR.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 18 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 87 patients will be accrued for this study.
