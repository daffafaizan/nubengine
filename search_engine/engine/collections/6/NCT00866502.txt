      symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) that are associated with degeneration of
      dopamine-producing nerve cells in the brain. Administration of growth factors that stimulate
      neuronal stem and progenitor cells is one possible approach to restore the dopaminergic
      activity. The drug product sNN0031 containing the endogenous growth factor PDGF has been
      demonstrated to reduce the typical symptoms in animal models of PD.

      NeuroNova intends to investigate whether intracerebroventricular administration of PDGF in
      the form of the drug product sNN0031 can improve motor function in patients with PD. In this
      first study the safety and tolerability of treatment for 2 weeks followed by 10 weeks
      follow-up will be evaluated.
