      design. One hundred asthma patients who fill out the informed consent form are registered and
      randomized 1:1 into the ICT-based centralized clinical trial monitoring group (n=50) or the
      ambulatory follow-up group (n=50). The planned follow-up duration is 6 months. he ICT-based
      centralized clinical trial monitoring group is given home based spirometry and connecting
      system (gateway) equipped with personal identification system. Fingerprint registration is
      required in advance, so that it would be used for authentication before each use of
      spirometry. Symptom score and lung functions (FEV1, PEFR) obtained from gateway is saved,
      monitored, and sent out via a home-monitoring system. In the ICT-based centralized clinical
      trial monitoring group, feedback is sent to both patients and medical staff in the form of
      texts if there is a worsening of symptoms score and/or lung function.

      Subjects are to make office visits after randomization at 4, (8), 12, (16, 20), and 24 weeks.
      (ICT group will not visit at the schedules in the brackets) Each visit requires measurement
      of Questionnaire (ACQ) lung functions.
