      routine, either by the time required or by biological requirements.The temporary restorations
      must have sufficient retention and solubility between the consultation intervals to avoid
      displacement and infiltration; besides being biocompatible to avoid sensitivity. The aim of
      this study is through a randomized clinical trial, double blind, splithmouth, evaluate the
      success rate (retention rate and dental sensibility) of temporary direct restoration on vital
      teeth. The composition of the temporary material (based on Zinc-Oxide with Eugenol; and based
      on mineral trioxide aggregate) will be evaluated. Twenty-five participants with at least two
      vital teeth with the need to confection of direct restoration (each participant) will be
      selected. The teeth will be randomly divided into 2 different groups according to the
      temporary material composition (Based on Zinc-Oxide with Eugenol; and based on mineral
      trioxide aggregate). Data will be collected, tabulated and submitted to statistical analysis.
