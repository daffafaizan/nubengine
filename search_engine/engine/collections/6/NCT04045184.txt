      impact of food assistance on diabetes-related health outcomes in food insecure people living
      with HIV (PLWH). Compared to the general population, PLWH have increased risk for type 2
      diabetes and worse glycemic control when using similar pharmaceutical treatments.
      Interventions to improve diet quality could thus have a clinically meaningful impact on
      diabetes treatment in this population. However, many PLWH are food insecure and rely on food
      assistance to meet basic nutrition needs. This proposal will determine the feasibility of a
      protocol to evaluate diabetes-related health outcomes in food insecure PLWH and diabetes who
      receive high protein, high dietary fiber food boxes from Birmingham AIDS Outreach. The study
      will consist of retrospective analysis of electronic medical record data and stored
      specimens, and prospective cross-sectional analysis of food security and diet quality in PLWH
      who do versus those who do not receive the food boxes.

      Specific Aim 1: To determine the feasibility of recruiting, enrolling, and collecting dietary
      intake data from people living with HIV who are food insecure.

      Specific Aim 2: To compare changes over twelve months in glycemic control, food security, and
      diet quality in B-FED participants compared to non-participating 1917 clinic patients.

      This proposal aligns with the UAB Diabetes Research Center's goal to facilitate development
      of new methods to treat diabetes and its complications. The investigators will determine the
      effect size for scale-up of larger, longer-term assessment through an NIDDK-R18 grant to
      evaluate the real-world impact of B-FED on glycemic control and food security.
