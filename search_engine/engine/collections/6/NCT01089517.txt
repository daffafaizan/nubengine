    
      Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to the following dose groups:

        -  E10030 0.3 mg/eye + Lucentis速 0. 5 mg/eye

        -  E10030 1.5 mg/eye + Lucentis速 0. 5 mg/eye

        -  E10030 sham + Lucentis速 0. 5 mg/eye

      Subjects will be treated with active E10030 or sham E10030 in combination with Lucentis速 at
      Day 0, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, Week 16 and Week 20.

      Primary Efficacy Endpoint:

      The primary efficacy endpoint is mean change in visual acuity from baseline at the Week 24
      visit

      Safety Endpoints:

      Safety endpoints include adverse events, vital signs, ophthalmic variables [visual acuity,
      intraocular pressure (IOP), ophthalmic examination, color fundus photography, fluorescein
      angiograms (FA), optical coherence tomography (OCT)], and laboratory variables.

      Approximately 444 subjects will be randomized into one of the three treatment cohorts
      (approximately 148 patients per dose group).
