      with dementia also have behavioral disturbances. This is often not addressed, leading to
      increased use of nursing homes, higher incidence of injury (both patient and caregiver) and
      the use of tranquilizing medications. Pain is one of the strongest predictors of aggression.
      The prevalence of pain in persons with dementia is known to be about 50%. Untreated pain is
      associated with significant negative outcomes, including increased health care use,
      inactivity and isolation. The investigators aim to determine whether outcome differences
      exist between active intervention and control conditions in relation to the occurrence of
      aggressive behavior, pain and depression, and its impact on pleasant activities, caregiver
      burden, quality of caregiver-patient relationship, antipsychotic use, health-service use,
      injuries to patient and caregiver, and nursing home placement. The active intervention,
      Preventing Aggression in Veterans with Dementia (PAVeD), is a family caregiver-focused,
      home-based intervention that uses psychoeducational and behavioral approaches to help reduce
      the risk of aggressive behavior in persons with dementia. The objective of PAVeD is to
      improve several areas of patient life that are known causes of aggression: pain and distress
      (including mood problems), lack of pleasurable activities, and difficulty in
      patient-caregiver communication that may negatively affect relationship quality and
      caregivers' recognition of pain.
