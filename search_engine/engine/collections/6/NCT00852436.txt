      dysfunction in the nervous system. At the trigeminal area where somatosensory nerves are
      often damaged during dental /maxillofacial interventions, post-operative orofacial
      neuropathic pain (OFNP) estimated treated prevalence/incidence rates were ~3-12%, with 83% of
      patients reporting that OFNP started with a dental treatment. Although OFNP is a burden for
      the society, and a major cause of chronic distress, disability and expenditure of medical
      resources, clinical trials that assess efficacy of its treatment are scarce. Until today,
      treatments of OFNP are extrapolated from those issued for neuropathic pain in other body
      sites. This clinical trial will be the first to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerance
      of pregabalin in the treatment of OFNP. Based on the results obtained for neuropathic pain on
      non trigeminal areas, we expect to see positive results, and to provide evidence for
      effective management of OFNP with an anticonvulsant such as pregabalin.
