      increases the quality of adult supervision and rewards children for safe play. In an urban
      childcare center, 71 children, ages 3-5 years, and 15 teachers participated in the study. The
      primary outcome measures were teacher verbalizations (warnings, explanations, redirects),
      teacher location (core, outskirts, or fringe of playground), risk taking behaviors by
      children (using equipment appropriately), and number of injuries on the playground.
