      where malaria is also endemic and where U.S. military personnel are required to take malaria
      prophylaxis. Rabies post-exposure prophylaxis in unvaccinated individuals who are not on
      malaria prophylaxis consists of four, 1.0-mL intramuscular (IM) injections of the purified
      chick embryo cell (PCECV) rabies vaccine on days 0, 3, 7, and 14. The current Advisory
      Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) guidelines recommend that exposed persons who are
      taking malaria prophylaxis should receive a fifth dose of rabies vaccine 28 days after the
      exposure. These guidelines do not differentiate between drugs used for malaria prophylaxis
      This study will administer the post-exposure regimen to volunteers from a US population of
      military age who are taking one of three malaria prophylaxis regimens or no malaria
      prophylaxis. The goal of this study is to asses if individuals on malaria prophylaxis achieve
      the required rabies titer after completion of the four dose regimen.

      Obtaining rabies vaccine and rabies immune globulin in a deployed setting can be challenging.
      A full understanding of the requirements for protecting exposed individuals is necessary for
      appropriate decision making in a resource-constrained environment.
