      will undergo a focused phone interviews, followed by screening to determine eligibility.
      Participants that meet inclusion criteria will undergo baseline cognitive function testing
      via video (following NIH toolbox guidelines for remote cognitive function assessment),
      followed by a one week measurement of sedentary time using a physical activity monitor
      (actigraphy). At week 0, participants will be randomized into either a physical activity
      group to break up sedentary time or activity guidelines only in a 1:1 ratio. Follow up occurs
      at 6 weeks using the same measures as baseline.
