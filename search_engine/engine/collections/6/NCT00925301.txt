      46 sites worldwide. The study consisted of 2 stages and an optional open-label treatment
      extension phase:

      Stage 1 included a screening period of up to 2 months followed by a 6-month treatment period
      which involved 4 visits to the clinic. Participants were randomized in equal proportions to
      receive either migalastat or placebo.

      After completing the 6-month double-blind phase, all participants entered Stage 2 of the
      study and received migalastat in an open-label manner. Stage 2 treatment lasted for 6 months
      and involved up to 4 visits to the clinic.

      Participants who completed both Stage 1 and Stage 2 of the study as scheduled were offered
      the opportunity to participate in an open-label treatment extension phase with migalastat.
      The open-label treatment extension phase lasted 12 months and involved 2 visits to the
      clinic. A follow-up visit was undertaken 1 month following completion or discontinuation from
      the open-label treatment extension. Participants completing the 12-month open-label treatment
      extension and providing consent to enter a separate long-term extension were not required to
      complete this follow-up visit.

      Study assessments included clinical laboratory tests, 12-lead electrocardiogram, kidney
      biopsy, kidney function testing, echocardiography, and patient-reported outcomes.
