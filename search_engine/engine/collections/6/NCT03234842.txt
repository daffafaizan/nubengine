      eligibility. If patients decline proton radiotherapy or are otherwise unable to receive
      proton therapy they will be included in x-ray cohort (group 2).

      Chemotherapy will be delivered at the discretion of the treating Medical Oncologist. Weekly
      carboplatin and paclitaxel at standard doses is preferred. It is recommended that the weekly
      chemotherapy regimen be continued throughout the course of radiotherapy. Chemotherapy should
      begin within 48 hours of beginning radiotherapy.
