      time, in a fully automatic, time saving and operator independent way. It is possible to
      optimize the VV and AV delays in office, during follow-up visits, but also enable the
      automatic optimization that weekly optimize the AV and VV delays.

      For the reasons mentioned above, the sponsor expects that the SonR optimization method
      increases the number of patients optimized systematically at each follow-up The purpose of
      this study is to evaluate the percentage of patients optimized at least once every month by
      the SonR automatic optimization method, until M6 follow-up, in HF patients prevalently in
      sinus rhythm.

      The primary objective will be evaluated as the percentage of patients successfully optimized
      every month until M6.

      A patient is considered successfully optimized by the SonR during one month if at least one
      Atri-Ventricular (AV) or Ventricular-Ventricular (VV) optimization is completed by the SonR
      automatic optimization method during the month.

      Patients eligible for the analysis are those with SonR automatic optimization function
      enabled and at least 50% of the time in sinus rhythm
