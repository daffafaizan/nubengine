      often evolves toward a state of immunosuppression, which contributes to increased mortality
      and severe secondary hospital-acquired infections. However, the role of gamma globulin
      therapy in patients with severe infection including sepsis and septic shock is discussed
      controversially. We intend to retrospectively analyze the efficacy and application evaluation
      of gamma globulin in severely infected children hospitalized in the intensive care unit.
      Clinical and demographic data, as well as treatment outcome will be collected from the
      electronic health record. It is expected to provide evaluation basis for clinicians to
      formulate treatment plans and clinical pharmacists for special comments on the clinical use
      of gamma globulin.
