      spinal manipulation in healthy individuals.

      In addition, it was planned to investigate the effects of spinal stabilization exercises and
      manipulation on muscle strength, muscular endurance, balance and proprioception, depression
      and quality of life.

      It was planned to recruit 80 healthy volunteers between the ages of 18-25, studying at
      Gümüşhane University, to our study. The study program was explained to the participants in
      line with the Informed Consent Form. After the relevant form was signed by the participant,
      it was included in the study.

      Healthy individuals to participate in the study will be randomly divided into 4 groups;
      randomization will be done by "Research Randomizer" computer program. Group 1 Stabilization
      group (n = 20), Group 2 Manipulation group (n = 20), Group 3 Stabilization and Manipulation
      group (n = 20), Group 4 Control group (n = 20). Group 1 will be given stabilization exercises
      for a total of 24 sessions, 3 times a week for 8 weeks, each session for 45 minutes. Group 2
      will be applied high-speed low-amplitude (HVLA) chiropractic manipulation for a total of 8
      sessions, once a week for 8 weeks. Group 3 will be given both stabilization exercises and
      manipulation exercises. The fourth group will be followed as a control group and no
      application will be made. Prone plunk, side plunk and sorenson tests for muscular endurance
      in the individuals participating in the study; Quadriceps muscle strength for muscle strength
      assessment; Joint position sense for propioception; Y balance test for balance; Short Form-36
      (SF-36) for quality of life; Beck Depression Inventory was planned to be evaluated before,
      after, 1 and 3 months for psychosomatic evaluation.
