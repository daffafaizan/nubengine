      treatment services for patients presenting to the ED with medically unexplained symptoms
      (MUS). Patients who were assessed and referred by ED physicians will serve as a
      non-randomized condition controlling for some relevant variables. Our a priori hypotheses
      were that assessed and treated patients would have a reduction in ED visits and self reported
      symptoms after this intervention and that controls would have a smaller reduction in ED
      visits if any.
