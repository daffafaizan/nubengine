      death in childhood cancer survivors. Early detection of cardiac dysfunction is important to
      identify those in need for medical intervention to improve outcome. This study invites adult
      childhood cancer survivors to a clinical appointment to the University Hospital Bern,
      Switzerland. A detailed, standardized cardiac assessment including conventional and novel
      echocardiographic techniques (speckle tracking) is performed. Cardiac dysfunction is
      evaluated in survivors who have had cardiotoxic cancer therapy with anthracyclines and/or
      chest radiation (high risk) and in survivors who have had chemotherapy other than
      anthracyclines (standard risk).
