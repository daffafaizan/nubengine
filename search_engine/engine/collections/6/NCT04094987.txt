      relationship between the effect of fascial pressure and the success of the association block.
      We will use the ultrasound guided anterior Quadratus Lumborum Block. A peripheral nerve block
      catheter will be placed between the quadratus lumborum muscle and the psoas muscle with
      ultrasound.The pressure between the fascia and the pressure line added to the catheter tip
      will be measured.A peripheral nerve block catheter will be placed between the quadratus
      lumborum muscle and the psoas muscle with ultrasound. The pressure between the fascia and the
      pressure line added to the catheter tip will be measured.
