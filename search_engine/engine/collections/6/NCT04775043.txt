      adjuvant hormone therapy for hormone-sensitive breast cancer.

      The primary test of judgment is composite. The first step is a French validation of the
      HFRDIS questionnaire assessing the impact of hot flashes on daily life in a control
      population free of breast cancer (validated in English). The second step is a comparison of
      the impact of hot flashes on the quality of life of patients in both populations (control and
      hormone therapy adjuvant for hormone-sensitive breast cancer) via the HFRDIS questionnaire.

      In the first part of the study (control population): Patients will be seen in a city
      gynecology consultation. Patients between the ages of 40 and 60 will be offered participation
      in the study consecutively. If patients answer "yes" to the question "Do you have hot
      flashes?", they will then be included in the study and will have access to the study
      questionnaire. Upon their 2nd connection on the website (D15), patients will answer the
      HFRDIS Questionnaire again.

      In the second part of the study (patients on hormone therapy for breast cancer): Patients at
      the Institut Curie Saint Cloud aged 40 to 60 years included on hormone therapy adjuvant
      therapy who will be seen in a monitoring consultation will be offered participation in the
      study consecutively.
