      of influenza epidemics from 1915 to 1929 including the 1918-1920 pandemic. Retrospective
      studies have shown increased risk for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) during the first week
      following an infection with influenza.

      Biochemical markers of cardiac injury such as high sensitive cardiac troponins may be
      increased during infection with influenza. Increased levels of cardiac troponins are
      associated with adverse outcome in many different populations.
