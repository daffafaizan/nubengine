      Primary

        -  To determine the effect of selenium, when administered with standard care, in preventing
           the recurrence of bladder cancer in patients with non-muscle-invasive transitional cell
           carcinoma of the bladder at risk for recurrence.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the effect of selenium on the recurrence of bladder cancer, in terms of
           histological type, number, and size.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral placebo daily in addition to standard care.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral selenium daily in addition to standard care.
