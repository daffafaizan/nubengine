    
      This is an open, observational clinical study, 2 cycles treatment will be planned as
      neo-adjuvant therapy for NSCLC participants in stage IIIA (T1-2N2, T3N1, T4N0-1).

      Study design:

      Newly diagnosed Resectable IIIa NSCLC EGFR/ALK/ROS1 TEST PD-L1 TEST Collect puncture biopsy
      tissue/ Blood sample in screening period Chest enhanced CT Conditions allowed， whole body
      PETCT Exam; Group A：Targeted therapy Tumors with Driver genes （EGFR/ALK/ROS1 Positive） 2
      cycles（42 days; Group B：Immunotherapy Enroll Patients from 816 Research treated with
      Neoadjuvant immunotherapy Or, treated with immunotherapy in practice（with approval） Group
      C：Routine Chemotherapy Driver genes（EGFR/ALK/ROS1 Negative） and PD-L1 Test negative;
      Operation （within 6 Ws postoperation） Standard treatment， Allow adjuvant chemotherapy±radioth
      erapy Collect resected tissue sample(Tumor T and Node N) /Blood sample; comparisons before
      and after treatment: Imaging：CT、PETCT Sample：Tumor tissue、blood

      Objective and End point:

        1. Main objective and end point：DFS，pCR rate

        2. Second objective and end point：OS

        3. Exploratory objective and end point：cRR rate、relevant AE、Change of Scoring
           Scale、exploration for relevant biological indicators
