      Primary

        -  To estimate the antitumor activity of docetaxel plus trabectedin in patients with
           persistent or recurrent ovarian epithelial, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cavity
           cancer primarily through the frequency of objective tumor responses.

        -  To determine the nature and degree of toxicity of docetaxel plus trabectedin in this
           cohort of patients.

      Secondary

        -  To estimate the progression-free survival and overall survival of patients treated with
           docetaxel and trabectedin.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour and trabectedin IV over 3 hours on day 1.
      Patients also receive pegfilgrastim subcutaneously (SC) on day 1 OR filgrastim (G-CSF) IV
      over 15-30 minutes or SC once daily beginning on day 1 and continuing until blood counts
      recover. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.
