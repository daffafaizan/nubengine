      brain metastases is whole brain irradiation. This results on average in an increase in
      survival by 2 to 4 times compared to withholding irradiation. The majority of patients
      experience improvement in the level of functioning as a result of irradiation. None-the-less
      approximately half of patients die because of progression of the brain metastases and their
      quality of life is often dominated by the effects of brain metastases.

      Various different dosages of radiation have been assessed and we wish to further investigate
      this by comparing a less intense schema with a more intense schema. Both of these fall within
      the range of published experience but have not been directly compared. The more intense
      schema may have more effect on the tumour but previous variations of dose intensity have not
      shown significant differences in survival. Differences in control of the metastases in the
      brain have been suggested but there have been no good comparisons of quality of life.
      Obviously when survival is measured on average in only 3 to 6 months, this is an important
      parameter for comparison.

      Comparisons: Stratification is by diagnosis either excision or biopsy/clinical. Patients will
      be randomised to receive either 40Gy 20#bd or 20Gy 4#daily.
