      coronavirus, called SARS-CoV-2, was described in the Wuhan region of China. This SARS, caused
      by SARS-CoV-2 was called COVID-19, spread across the globe, causing millions of cases on all
      continents, and thousands of deaths, being characterized as a pandemic.

      COVID-19 is characterized by a flu-like syndrome, with symptoms such as fever, cough, myalgia
      and gastrointestinal symptoms. Most cases are mild, some even asymptomatic, but approximately
      15% of patients have more severe presentation, and approximately 5% are critical (7).

      The acute respiratory failure of critically ill patients with COVID-19 has different aspects,
      including hypoxemia of difficult treatment, associated in some cases with clotting disorders,
      changes in immunity and inflammatory phenomena that pose challenges for the management of
      these patients, whose mortality can be high.

      The Hospital das Clínicas da Faculdade de Medicina de São Paulo implemented an action plan
      that provides for the creation of 200 ICU beds to serve patients with COVID-19. Knowing the
      characteristics of critically ill patients with COVID-19 and their clinical outcomes is
      extremely important to inform clinical decision-making and to guide the strategy to mitigate
      the epidemic, both within each hospital and ICU and in public health management.
