      approximately one third of cases. And I/R injury may also induce cerebral insult, even
      Postoperative Cognitive Dysfunction (POCD).Transient sublethal episodes of ischemia before a
      prolonged ischemia/reperfusion injury, known as ischemic preconditioning (IPC), have been
      shown to reduce the extent of myocardial infarction (MI).And remote ischemic
      postconditioning(RIPoC), as another ischemic condition, limits MI size in animal models.

      However, there are limited outcome to demonstrate protection from RIPoC during cardiac
      surgery. The purpose of this study is to investigate the cardiac and cerebral protective
      effect of remote ischemic postconditioning , as a single-center, randomized controlled trial.
