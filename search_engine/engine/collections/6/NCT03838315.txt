      Radiculopathy but they work differently.

      Neural mobilization technique is different for all 3 nerves i.e Radial, ulnar and median.
      Neural Mobilization Technique target the single nerve which is being compressed and showing
      symptoms.

      Soft Tissue Mobilization include traction which decompresses the nerve and stretches the
      surrounding muscles along with help to reduce pain and tingling sensation. whereas hot pack
      helps to increase blood circulation and warm up muscles and isometric exercises provide
      strengthening and build endurance.
