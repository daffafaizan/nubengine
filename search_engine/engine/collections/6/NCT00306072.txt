      we have not explored the effect of the salacinol extract on postprandial glycemia or
      insulinemia in patients with type 2 diabetes.

      We planned to study 66 patients with diabetes in this multicenter, randomized, double-blind,
      three-treatment, crossover study. While in a fasted state, subjects were to consume one of
      the following three meals: a standard liquid meal containing 110 g carbohydrate, 18 g
      protein, 12 g fat, and 620 kilocalories (Control); Control plus 240 mg Salacia oblonga
      extract; and Control plus 480 mg Salacia oblonga extract. Postprandial serum glucose and
      serum insulin samples were to be analyzed for 180 min.
