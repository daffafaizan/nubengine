      program) mixed-method design with repeated (weekly) measures of a single cohort of 20
      patients with PH. This study will also explore preliminary efficacy testing to construct
      sample size estimates for future randomized control trials. Patients will serve as their
      controls.

      This study will enroll 20 patients from two PH clinics within the Ohio State University
      Wexner Medical Center (OSUWMC). Patients with PH condition related to the cardiac cause are
      managed at the OSU Cardiology clinic located at the Ross Heart Hospital. Patients with PH
      condition related to other causes are managed at the OSU Pulmonary clinic at Martha
      Morehouse. These inter-professional clinics provide access to a patient population with
      diverse race/ ethnicity, sex, and age. All eligible patients managed at both PH clinics at
      OSUWMC will be invited to participate. Patients in both clinics receive standard medical
      treatments according to institutional and national clinical practice guidelines.
