      group to a control group on brain health, cardiac fitness and overall quality of life in
      breast cancer patients starting chemotherapy either before (pre-operative or neoadjuvant) or
      after surgery (post-operative or adjuvant)

      This research study is a Pilot Study, which is the first-time investigators are examining
      this intervention in this setting. The study is trying to determine whether participating in
      a specific exercise program can improve brain and heart function, as there is some evidence
      that there can be cognitive changes after chemotherapy among some patients with breast
      cancer. This study intends to evaluate whether HIIT can improve cognitive function as well as
      cardio-respiratory fitness, among patients undergoing chemotherapy for breast cancer.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups:

        -  Group A: High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) for 16 weeks

        -  Group B: Attention Control for 16 weeks home-based stretching; the HIIT intervention
           will be available after the study ends

      The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment including
      extensive evaluations of your fitness and brain health, including MRI, blood tests, bone
      scans, fitness and strength assessments, and surveys at study entry and follow up visits.

      Participants will receive study treatment for 4 months and will be followed for 4 months.

      The total time for participation in this study will be about 8 months.

      It is expected that about 30 people will take part in this research study.

      The American Institute for Cancer Research is supporting this research by providing funding
      for the study.
