      following a cancer diagnosis. The current evidence suggests that exercise training is safe
      during primary adjuvant therapy and improves physical function and quality of life outcomes.
      Moderate exercise has been shown to improve fatigue (extreme tiredness), anxiety, and
      self-esteem. It also helps heart and blood vessel fitness, muscle strength, and body
      composition. However, despite guidance on implementing exercise recommendations for cancer
      patients, exercise counseling is still not standard of care in cancer centers across the U.S.
      Our goal is to collect data that will assist with translation of the evidence from randomized
      clinical trials into standard of care.
