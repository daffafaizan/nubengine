      intervals 5x injections of 0,5 ml of a solution of modified birch pollen extract outside the
      pollen season. The primary endpoint therefore is not the therapeutic effect of the specific
      immunotherapy (effect on symptoms of allergy during the birch pollen season) but the effect
      on the CPT. Acc. to the EMEA "Guideline on clinical development of products for specific
      immunotherapy for the treatment of allergic diseases" provocation tests are accepted as
      primary outcomes for dose-finding studies.

      For the CPT increasing doses of birch pollen solutions are applied to the eye and
      characteristic symptoms (eye redness, weeping, itching or burning and nose dripping/blockage)
      are assessed: 0 = absent, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe). At a score value of >=
      5/concentration the test is considered positive and finished.

      It is expected that at the end of the study higher doses are necessary to provoke a positive
      CPT.

      Furthermore comparative evaluation of the safety data (AEs) in the different dosage groups is
      a very important parameter for the evaluation of the outcome of the study.
