      Africa. Current malaria control largely consists of rapid treatment of patients.
      Amodiaquine-artesunate and other combinatory treatment regimes including amodiaquine are now
      being introduced as first-line antimalarial drugs in several African countries. However, data
      on the efficacy and safety of amodiaquine and amodiaquine-artesunate are scarce. In addition,
      there is evidence that common genetic host factors, e.g. sickle cell trait, may influence
      efficacy and safety of these drugs. To examine efficacy and safety of the named drugs as well
      as a potential influence of genetic host factors on these outcomes a randomized, double blind
      trial among 400 children with uncomplicated malaria is performed in northern Ghana.
