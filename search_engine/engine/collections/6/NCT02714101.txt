      the literature, the unique features of horses may be beneficial to children with ASD. There
      is limited research supporting the use of horses in occupational therapy interventions. This
      study examined the effects of equine-assisted occupational therapy for 7 children with ASD
      ages 4 to 8 years. A multiple baseline design was used. For each child, there were 9 to 11
      baseline assessments (gross and fine motor play activities), 9 to 12 intervention sessions,
      and 4 follow-up sessions (gross and fine motor play activities). Intervention sessions were
      40 to 60 minutes long and consisted of time spent on the horse and in horse related
      activities. Children were videorecorded in all conditions. Trained coders scored randomly
      selected segments of the video recording. Inter-rater reliability was good.
