      MTD is reached. Each cohort will consist of newly enrolled patients. Intra-patient dose
      escalation is not permitted. Once MTD is reached a total of 6 patients will be treated at MTD
      (phase I). For the phase II the minimax two-stage design will be applied. After testing the
      drug on 16 patients in the first stage of phase II, the trial will be terminated if 1 or
      fewer respond (SD, PR, CR). If the trial goes on to the second stage, a total of 34 patients
      will be studied during the phase II part.
