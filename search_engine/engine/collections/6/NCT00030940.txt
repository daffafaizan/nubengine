      of the trunk or limb muscles and frequent muscle spasms induced by unexpected visual,
      auditory, or somatosensory stimuli. It is an incapacitating disorder that leads to recurrent
      falls and impaired ambulation. The cause of the disease is unknown but an autoimmune
      pathogenesis is implicated based on its association with other autoimmune diseases and
      auto-antibodies, specific HLA haplotypes and high titer antibodies against GAD, the
      rate-limiting enzyme for the synthesis of GABA. Understanding the autoimmune mechanisms of
      SPS is fundamental to refine the diagnostic criteria and develop specific therapies. The
      goals of this study are: a) define the natural history of SPS in a homogeneous cohort of
      patients, b) explore a pathogenetic link between SPS and viral infections based on the known
      peptide homology between GAD and certain viruses and c) establish GAD-specific T-cell clones
      and search for candidate antigenic epitopes using synthetic peptide libraries. Collected
      clinical data will be used to delineate the rate of disease progression and the frequency of
      association with other autoimmune illnesses, auto-antibodies, or malignancies. It is
      anticipated that the knowledge acquired from the study will help us understand the mechanism
      of the disease and design antigen-specific therapeutic strategies. This is an investigative
      study intended to define the natural history and pathogenesis of SPS. No new therapy will be
      provided except of standard care.
