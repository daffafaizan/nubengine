      Primary

        -  To compare the progression-free survival of postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor-
           and/or progesterone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer treated with sorafenib
           tosylate vs placebo and letrozole, anastrozole, or exemestane.

      Secondary

        -  To compare the overall survival and time to treatment failure of patients treated with
           these regimens.

        -  To compare the objective tumor response rate and duration of response in patients
           treated with these regimens.

        -  To assess the adverse event profile of sorafenib tosylate in combination with aromatase
           inhibitors in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to prior aromatase
      inhibitor therapy (yes vs no) and line of endocrine therapy for metastatic disease
      (first-line vs second-line). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral sorafenib tosylate twice daily and oral letrozole,
           anastrozole, or exemestane once daily on days 1-28.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo twice daily and oral letrozole, anastrozole, or
           exemestane once daily on days 1-28.

      In both arms, treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically for up to 5 years.
