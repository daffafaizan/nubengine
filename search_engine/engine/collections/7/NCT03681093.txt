    
      This was a Phase 3b, Proof-of-concept study with a randomized, multicenter, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, parallel-group study design to determine the ability of fevipiprant plus
      standard of care (SoC) compared to placebo plus SoC to reduce the size of nasal polyps. The
      study enrolled adult male and female patients diagnosed with nasal polyposis with a nasal
      polyp score assessed by nasal endoscopy ≥ 4 at baseline with a minimum score of 2 in each
      nostril and a concomitant diagnosis of asthma. Patients who meet the inclusion/exclusion
      criteria were randomized in 1:1:1 ratio in either of the 3 arms fevipiprant 450 mg dose once
      daily (o.d.), fevipiprant 150 mg dose o.d. or placebo o.d. in addition to SoC (mometasone
      furoate spray).

      The study included:

        -  a Screening period of 2 weeks to assess eligibility

        -  a Run-in period of 4 weeks where patients utilized mometasone furoate spray (200 μg once
           daily, administered as two 50 μg actuations into each nostril)

        -  a Treatment period of 16 weeks. Patients continued to use the mometasone furoate SoC
           throughout the treatment period.

        -  a Follow-up period of 2 weeks following the last dose of study drug to collect
           additional data for safety variables.

      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of fevipiprant 150 mg and
      450 mg compared to placebo in the reduction of nasal polyps size and the effect on symptoms,
      quality of life and smell via patient-reported outcomes in patients with nasal polyposis and
      concomitant asthma.
