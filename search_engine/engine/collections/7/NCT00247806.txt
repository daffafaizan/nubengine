      will be approached to assess whether what the incidence of lactose intolerance is in the post
      transplant period and how quickly recovery occurs. A baseline lactose and lactulose breath
      test will be performed followed by repeat lactose breath tests starting 2 weeks after day 0
      and repeated every fortnight for 10 weeks. Stool pH and reducing substances will be checked
      at the time of the breath tests to see if there is any correlation.
