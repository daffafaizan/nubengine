      mellitus in Chinese PLA General Hospital and coronary arteriography confirmed as critical
      lesion of coronary artery. The patients were randomly divided into two groups: ezeimebum
      combined with simvastatin group and simvastatin group. The patients of the former group were
      given ezeimebum 10mg combined with simvastatin 40mg for 12 months while the patients of the
      latter group were given simvastatin 40mg for 12 months. Assessed coronary atherosclerotic
      plaque volume percentage (PAV) and standardized total atherosclerotic plaque volume (TAV) by
      intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) at the time of entry and out of the group after 12 months.
      The changes of PAV level in both groups were taken as the main endpoints, and the changes of
      TAV levels in the two groups as the secondary endpoints. The changes of serum lipids and
      hypersensitive C-reactive protein levels were compared between the two groups before and
      after the treatment. Major cardiovascular events (non-fatal myocardial infarction, all-cause
      death, readmission to acute heart failure, and revascularization of recurrent angina
      pectoris) were followed up for 12 months.
