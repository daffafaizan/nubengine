    
      This is a prospective, multi-center, parallel-group, subject and evaluator-blinded,
      randomized controlled trial to demonstrate the non-inferiority of the study device, STYLAGE®
      L, when compared to an active comparator for the correction of moderate and severe NLFs.

      Subjects will randomly receive STYLAGE® L or the active comparator (ratio 1:1) injection in
      the NLFs at first visit on Day 0.

      Proportion of subjects having a NLFs severity improvement (blinded evaluation), 6 months
      after treatment initiation will be assessed and compared between the two groups. This will
      also be done during the other visits (1, 3, 9 and 12 months after treatment initiation).
      Global aesthetic improvement according to blinded independent evaluator and subject,
      subjects' satisfaction, and safety parameters will also be assessed during the study period.
