      children in resource constrained settings. However, the physiological alterations of
      intestinal function that accompany both the demonstrable evidence of inflammation and
      architectural changes seen in biopsies from effected children have yet to be elucidated, and
      this knowledge gap limits the development of effective strategies to optimally manage the
      condition. Furthermore, a limited number of non-invasive assays exist with which to assess
      the presence of environmental enteropathy in low resource settings. This study aims 1) to
      determine if sucrose-isomaltase enzyme is altered in children with environmental enteropathy
      by using a 13C-Sucrose breath test 2) to determine if the test is able to be employed in
      resource limited settings.
