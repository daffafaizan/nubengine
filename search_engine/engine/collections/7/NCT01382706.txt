    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the efficacy of 1250 mg of lapatinib (lapatinib ditosylate) given in combination
      with docetaxel in prolonging progression-free survival of subjects with metastatic,
      previously treated transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) relative to historical controls.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the efficacy of 1250 mg of Lapatinib given in combination with docetaxel in the
      objective response rates and overall survival.

      II. To study the tolerability and safety of 1250 mg of lapatinib given in combination with
      docetaxel by assessing the incidence and nature of Grade 3, 4 and serious adverse events
      (AEs).

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the expression status of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or human
      epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) in tumor tissue and/or circulating tumor cells
      (CTCs) as potential predictors of response to therapy.

      II. To evaluate the number of CTC's present in 7.5mLs of peripheral blood as a predictor for
      disease progression and response of treatment in bladder cancer in the setting of combination
      therapy of lapatinib and docetaxel.

      III. To evaluate the effect of lapatinib in human at molecular level by targeting the
      phosphorylation activity of the AKT/extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) on pathway prior and
      during the treatment with lapatinib.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive docetaxel intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on day 1 and lapatinib
      ditosylate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 21 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for up to 2
      years.
