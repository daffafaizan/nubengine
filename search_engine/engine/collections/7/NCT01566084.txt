      will be randomly assigned to either a 'low salt' condition (placebo pills + 1200 mg dietary
      sodium) or a 'normal salt' condition (2300 mg sodium chloride pills + 1200 mg dietary sodium)
      and monitored for 5 weeks. After the initial set of 5 weeks, the subjects are switched into
      the opposite condition, completing the cross-over study design. During weeks 1-4 and 6-9,
      subjects are monitored weekly with 24 hour urine collections and diet logs. The assessment of
      the primary outcome (blood vessel function) is completed during weeks 5 and 10. BH4 and
      ascorbic acid are also administered during weeks 5 and 10 to measure the effects of sodium
      intake on endogenous BH4 levels and vascular oxidative stress.
