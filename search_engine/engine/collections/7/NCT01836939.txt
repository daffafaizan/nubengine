      suis ova (TSO) for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.

      Psoriasis is driven by T-cell infiltration in the epidermis. The T-cells involved in
      psoriasis exhibit a Th17-like and a Th1-like cytokine secretion profile. This excess Th17/Th1
      response is thought to play a critical role in the development of psoriasis, and reducing
      Th17/Th1 activity would be a potential way of halting the inflammatory process leading to
      psoriasis.
