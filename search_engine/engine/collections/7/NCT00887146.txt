      anaplastic glioma or high risk low grade glioma. The trial will only enroll patients with
      1p/19q co-deletion. This study includes two arms as described in the "Arms" section. A
      dynamic allocation procedure will be used to allocate an equal number of patients to
      different arms (Arms A:B = 1:1). This procedure will balance the marginal distributions of
      the stratification factors among arms. The stratification factors that will be used are
      cooperative groups (EORTC vs. all North American groups), age (â‰¤ 50 vs. > 50), performance
      score (ECOG 0-1 vs. 2), and tumor grade (anaplastic glioma vs. low grade glioma).

      The primary goal is to determine whether patients who receive radiotherapy with concomitant
      temozolomide (TMZ) followed by adjuvant temozolomide (RT + TMZ --> TMZ) (Arm B) have a
      marginally better progression free survival (PFS) as compared with patients who receive
      radiotherapy followed by PCV chemotherapy (RT --> PCV)(Arm A).

      Secondary Goals:

        1. Time to Progression - To determine whether patients who receive (RT + TMZ --> TMZ) have
           a significantly longer time to progression (clinical or radiographic progression) as
           compared with patients who receive radiotherapy followed by adjuvant PCV chemotherapy
           (RT --> PCV).

        2. Correlation between exploratory biomarkers and survival - To determine whether there is
           a difference in survival based on t(1;19)(q10, p10) translocation status and MGMT
           promoter hypermethylation status.

        3. Descriptive Comparisons of Additional Secondary Endpoints - To perform descriptive
           comparisons of additional secondary outcome endpoints, including overall survival,
           objective tumor response, prognostic factor analysis and quality of life.

        4. Toxicity - To determine the toxicity of the treatment in each arm and perform
           descriptive comparisons.

        5. Neurocognitive and Quality of Life (QOL) Effects - To determine the neurocognitive and
           QOL effects in patients treated on this protocol and correlate these results with
           outcome endpoints.

        6. Banking of Biospecimens and Neuroimaging Studies - To store blood products (i.e.,
           plasma, DNA and buffy coat), tumor tissue and MRI/CT images for future scientific
           investigations.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 12 weeks for 1 year, then
      every 4 months for 2 years and then every 6 months until progressive disease or until the end
      of study participation.
