      biopsy-proven NASH were enrolled in this double-blind, randomized,placebo-controlled study.
      BMI, AST, ALT, gamma glutamyl transferase (γ-GGT), lipid profile, homeostatic model
      assessment (HOMA), serum endotoxin, Toll-like receptor 4 (TlR4), interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-10,
      tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and cytokeratin-18 (CK-18) levels were measured before and
      after a 6 month administration of rifaximin (1100mg/day, 550 mg tablets 1 × 2 before meals).
