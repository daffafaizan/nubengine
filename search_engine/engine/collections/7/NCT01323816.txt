      care units (ICU). The goal is to compare outcomes of patients that have received care in
      medical intensive care units in a tertiary care facility with two different models; the
      traditional model including a resident, pulmonary fellow and attending and a nontraditional
      model which has Nurse Practitioners as the direct care deliverer, a pulmonary fellow, and an
      attending. Outcomes that will be measured include ICU length of stay, hospital length of stay
      after ICU discharge, ventilator days, daily spontaneous breathing trials, and daily awakening
      trials, as well as mortality in hospital and after discharge.
