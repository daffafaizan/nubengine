      (1μg/kg) + midazolam (0.04-0.03 mg/kg) for CS and midazolam (0.04-0.03 mg/kg) for EGDS and in
      group P (n=70) fentanyl 1µg/Kg + propofol TCI 1.2-1.6 μg/ml for CS and propofol TCI 1.2-1.6
      μg/ml for EGD. Vital parameters and Observer's Assessment of Alertness and Sedation Scale
      (OAA/S) were monitored throughout the study. Endoscopist's and patient's satisfactions were
      measured after procedure and 24-72 h later by visual analog scale (VAS).
