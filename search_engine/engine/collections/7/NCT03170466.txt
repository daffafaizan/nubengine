      breathing, anxiety, and depression. Palliative Care (PC) is a medical specialty designed to
      focus on relieving patient suffering by providing an extra layer of support on top of usual
      care. To date, there has been little research on the impact of PC in HF. We will conduct a
      randomized clinical trial to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and perceived
      effectiveness of training cardiology nurses in PC and administering PC to their patients.
      Patients will be randomized into either the usual care group or the intervention group. Usual
      care participants will receive their care with no alterations, and intervention participants
      will receive the PC intervention from their nurse on top of their usual care. Both groups
      will complete health-related surveys on tablet computers, via email, and/or via telephone. In
      the intervention group, these answers will be used to tailor the intervention to the specific
      patient's needs. Caregivers will also be recruited into the study, and will complete surveys
      similar to the patients via the aforementioned methods.
