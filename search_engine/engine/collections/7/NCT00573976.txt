    
      STUDY PURPOSE This clinical research study will be performed to assess the validity,
      reliability, and sensitivity of the Spinal Cord Independence Measure (SCIM III) in measuring
      functional ability in persons with spinal cord injury (SCI).

      Aims and Hypothesis:

      Overall hypothesis - The SCIM III is a valid, reliable, and sensitive measure of functional
      ability in persons with SCI.

      Aim 1: Examine the validity of the SCIM III as an outcome measure to assess functional
      ability in persons with SCI.

        1. Criterion-related validity

        2. Construct validity of components

      Aim 2: Examine the reliability of SCIM III evaluations.

        1. Inter-rater reliability

        2. Internal consistency

      Aim 3: Examine the sensitivity of the SCIM III to functional change.

        1. Sensitivity to functional change compared to the Functional Independence Measure (FIM).

        2. Sensitivity to functional change over time

      STUDY DESIGN This is a multi-center, prospective clinical research study performed to assess
      the validity, reliability, and sensitivity of the Spinal Cord Independence Measure (SCIM III)
      in measuring functional ability in persons with spinal cord injury (SCI).

      UCI will act as the coordinating center for this study, collecting and performing statistical
      data analysis. There will be approximately 22 rehabilitation centers participating in this
      study. De-identified data will be transferred from these sites to Dr. Kim Anderson at UCI.
