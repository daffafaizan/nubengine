      techniques of mesh fixation during laparoscopic ventral hernia repair. Subject will undergo
      mesh fixation with either trans-abdominal sutures and metallic tacks or metallic tacks only.

      Pain will be assessed through week 12, and hernia recurrence will be assessed for 2 years
      after surgery. Subjects will complete pain questionnaires at baseline, each day during
      hospital stay, and at follow-up visits at 2, 6, and 12 weeks after discharge. Quality of life
      questionnaires will be completed at baseline, at discharge from hospital, and during
      follow-up visits at 2, 6, and 12 weeks after discharge.
