    
      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This study is a randomized, blinded, controlled study. Patients are
      stratified in both groups according to prior thymectomy (yes vs no) and by Quantitative
      Myasthenia Gravis Score (equal to or less than 10 vs greater than 10) so that equal numbers
      are assigned to each group. Patients in group 2 are also stratified as to whether they are
      currently on azathioprine.

      Patients are randomized to receive either intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) for 2 days or 5%
      albumin (the placebo) for 2 days. A second infusion of IVIG for 1 day or albumin placebo for
      1 day is given on day 22.

      At the end of 6 weeks, after the randomized study, patients may choose to receive 3
      additional IVIG infusions.

      Patients are followed on days 1, 21, 32, and 42 of randomized or open label study.
