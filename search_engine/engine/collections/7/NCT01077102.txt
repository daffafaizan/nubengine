      preventable and treatable. Dyspnea is the most important symptom that COPD patients
      experience and this can have a major impact on their daily live. While COPD is characterized
      by a spectrum of disease severity, most patients experience poor exercise intolerance
      attributable to ventilatory limitation as well as peripheral muscle fatigue, ultimately
      leading to severe disability.

      Endurance exercise is an important component of pulmonary rehabilitation and is aimed at
      preventing this decline in functional capacity. The effects of pulmonary rehabilitation are
      largely attributable to the exercise training component involving concentric muscle
      contractions, traditionally trough dynamic, large muscle exercise on a cycle ergometer or
      treadmill. However, many patients are unable to partake and benefit from such rehabilitation
      because of locomotor muscle weakness and severe ventilatory limitation that prevent them from
      exercising at intensities sufficient to provoke improvements in cardioventilatory and
      skeletal muscle function. Eccentric exercise is known for its unique physiologically
      fundamental characteristics: the lower metabolic demand for a same power output and greater
      muscle gains compared to the concentric exercise. For this reason, eccentric endurance
      training has been proposed as a novel adjunctive rehabilitative countermeasure for certain
      chronic diseases (such as coronary disease and COPD) and can play an important role for
      patients with advanced disease.
