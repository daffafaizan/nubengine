      The broad objective of this proposal is to pilot the CCDI program as an intervention to treat
      neurodevelopmental delays among 56 young children in Kenya

      Specific Aims:

      Aim 1: Determine the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial protocol to examine the
      effectiveness of the CCDI Program for Kenyan children with neurodevelopmental delays aged
      18-24 months within a public Maternal-Child Health (MCH) clinic setting.

      Hypothesis: The CCDI Program will be feasible, as measured by ≥90% of participants being
      willing to be randomized to either the intervention or the control group; ≥ 80% attending all
      10 biweekly caregiver meetings; ≥80% of children returning for their 6 month follow-up; and
      ≥80% returning for 12 month follow-up.

      Aim 2: Determine the acceptability, facilitators, and barriers of the CCDI Program for use in
      eligible children.

      Hypothesis: The CCDI Program will be acceptable, as determined by an analysis of prospective,
      concurrent, and retrospective acceptability, and specific facilitators and barriers to the
      program will be identified. Using focus group discussions and semi-structured interviews with
      caregivers, clinical providers, and community leaders, the investigators will determine
      aspects of the program are acceptable, facilitators, and barriers to improved
      neurodevelopmental care and allow the CCDI program to function optimally in this setting.

      Aim 3: Estimate the effect size of the CCDI Program to reduce neurodevelopmental delays in
      young Kenyan children.

      Hypothesis: The investigators will demonstrate a 40% decrease in the number of children with
      neurodevelopmental delays, as determined by a culturally adapted Bayley Scales of Infant and
      Toddler Development, 3rd edition (BSID-III) standardized score with implementation of the
      CCDI Program. This data will inform sample size justification for a future intervention
      study.
