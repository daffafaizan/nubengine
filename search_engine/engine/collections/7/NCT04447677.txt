      Clinical Center of Serbia from January 1st to December 31st 2015. The study included 164
      patients enrolled in the ART procedure at the Clinic.

      Basal hormonal status - serum levels of estradiol (E2 - pg/ml), progesterone (P4 - ng/ml),
      follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH - mIU/ml), luteinizing hormone (LH - mIU/ml) and
      anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH - ng/l) were measured on the 2ndor 3rd cycle day before
      stimulation commencement. During COS levels of estradiol were determined, while levels of
      progesterone were determined on the day of oocyte retrieval i.e. aspiration. Blood samples
      were taken by Vacutainer tubes (BD Vacutainer Systems) and centrifuged according to the
      manufacturer's instructions for the preparation of the serum samples. AMH value (Gen II ELISA
      ref. No. A79765; Beckman Coulter) in serum was measured by ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent
      assay), 1 ng / ml). FSH, LH, estradiol, and progesterone were analyzed by chemiluminescent
      immunoassay (Access 2 immunoassay system, Beckman Coulter).

      The main outcome measures were the procedure success as well as the pregnancy outcome.
      Pregnancy was confirmed by a positive finding of serum Î²-hCG (>25 MIU/ml) 14 days after
      embryo transfer. Clinical pregnancies were confirmed by transvaginal ultrasound findings of a
      gestational sac with a vital embryo at the 6th gestational week.
