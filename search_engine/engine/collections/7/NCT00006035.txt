      melanoma when treated with intratumoral bleomycin with or without electroporation therapy.
      II. Determine the safety of electroporation therapy in these patients. III. Compare the time
      to heal with these treatments in these patients. IV. Compare the duration of lesion response
      with these treatments in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to one of two
      treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive bleomycin intratumorally on day 1. Arm II: Patients
      receive bleomycin intratumorally followed by electroporation therapy intratumorally on day 1.
      Treatment continues every 4 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Patients in arm I
      with progressive disease after 1 course of treatment may be crossed over to arm II. Patients
      are followed at 4 and 6 months after final treatment.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients (10 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
