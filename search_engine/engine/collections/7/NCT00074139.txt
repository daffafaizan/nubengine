      Primary

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetic profile of docetaxel, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide in
           women with advanced breast cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the pharmacokinetic profile of this regimen in these patients vs the historical
           pharmacokinetic profile of docetaxel.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, crossover, multicenter study. Patients are
      randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive doxorubicin IV over 15 minutes and cyclophosphamide IV over 15
           minutes on day 1 followed by doxorubicin IV over 15 minutes, cyclophosphamide IV over 15
           minutes, and docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 22.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive doxorubicin IV over 15 minutes, cyclophosphamide IV over 15
           minutes, and docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1 followed by doxorubicin IV over 15
           minutes and cyclophosphamide IV over 15 minutes on day 22.

      Treatment in both arms continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients may receive additional therapy at the discretion of the treating
      physician.

      Patients are followed at 3-4 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24 patients (12 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 7 months.
