human growth hormoneclinical measurement, response to hypoglycemia and suppression bycorticosteroidsa standard test of growth-hormone secretory ca-pacity, based on radioimmunoassay of plasma growthhormone after insulin hypoglycemia, is described.  innormal subjects a standard insulin tolerance test, caus-ing an average blood glucose drop to 34 per cent ofresting values, produced a mean rise in growth hor-mone to 45.2 millimicrogm. per milliliter at one hour,with a total range of 25 to 70 millimicrogm. per mil-liliter.  no response was observed in 5 hypopituitarysubjects.under comparable hypoglycemic stimulation glu-cocorticoid-treated patients showed a marked in-hibition of the growth-hormone response, which wasrelated to dose.  subjects receiving more than 60 mg.of cortisol equivalent per day showed a mean plasmarise to 6.7 millimicrogm. per milliliter (range, 1.5to 13 millimicrogm.).  subjects receiving 20 to 60 mg.of cortisol equivalent per day showed a mean rise to16.6 millimicrogm. per milliliter (range, 13 to 20millimicrogm.).inhibition of human growth hormone was alsoaffected by duration of glucocorticoid treatment, be-ing greater with long-term than with short-term ad-ministration.
