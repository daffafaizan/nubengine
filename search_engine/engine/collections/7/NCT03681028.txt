      feasibility of implementing an individualized treatment regimen in patients with surgical
      recurrent GBM. Patients are not stratified according to demographic or treatment-related
      parameters. Patients must have recurrent glioblastoma treated with appropriate tumor
      treatment including radiation therapy at initial diagnosis. Surgery must be clinically
      indicated and patients must be candidates for tumor resection at UCSF.

      The goal of the current study is to build upon prior results by confirming the feasibility of
      actually implementing patient-specific drug regimens in a rapid, clinically-relevant
      timetable. We will also assess for efficacy, safety, and response outcomes of these
      patient-specific regimens, to generate preliminary data that would support a larger trial
      assessing efficacy of such an approach.

      Resected tumor tissue and blood will be examined using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) UCSF
      500 Cancer Gene Panel at the UCSF Clinical Cancer Genomics Laboratory and Whole genome and
      RNA sequencing. The clinical report generated from the NGS UCSF 500 panel will be provided to
      a study-specific Tumor Board who will generate an individualized treatment recommendation
      based on the report. The individualized treatment regimen potentially will include up to 4
      repurposed off-the-shelf FDA-approved targeted agents. The Board will identify the
      expected/anticipated drug-drug interactions and anticipated additional toxicities of the
      combination of therapies. The treating physician is given the report, discusses the suggested
      treatment options with the patient, and initiates treatment, ideally within 28 calendar days
      (and no later than 35 calendar days) after surgery. Treatment will continue until tumor
      progression.
