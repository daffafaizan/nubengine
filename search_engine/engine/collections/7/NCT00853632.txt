    
      This is a prospective, single-arm, multi-center study to be conducted in the US and outside
      the US (OUS). Approximately 250 subjects are planned to be enrolled to obtain long term data
      from 101 subjects at 8 years post implant of the Magna mitral valve. Of these 250,
      approximately 38 (15%) are anticipated to be simultaneous aortic and mitral replacements.
      Subject enrollment will not start in the US before obtaining FDA approval of this post market
      study.

      Assessments will be obtained for the preoperative and operative visits, and postoperatively
      at discharge, six months, 1-year and annually thereafter for a minimum of 8 years. Subject's
      demographics (date of birth, sex), physical assessment (heart rate, height, weight, systolic
      and diastolic blood pressures), New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class, cardiac
      rhythm, cardiovascular medical history/risk factors, non-cardiovascular conditions, previous
      cardiovascular procedures/interventions, antithromboembolic and lipid lowering medications
      and coagulation profile. Blood data will be collected from each subject preoperatively, at 6
      months and annually post implant through 8 year follow-ups. Echocardiographic evaluation
      required for each subject preoperatively, at discharge, 6 months (between 3-6 months), 1, 2,
      4, 6, and 8 year follow-ups. A QOL survey (EQ-5D) will be completed by the subject
      pre-operatively and at the 6-month follow-up visit.
