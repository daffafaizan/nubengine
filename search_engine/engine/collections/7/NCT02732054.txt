    
      HIV-infected adults with CD4+ cell counts < 200 cells/mm3, undetectable plasma HIV-1 RNA, and
      negative for all HBV markers were randomly assigned to receive one of these 2 regimens of
      recombinant hepatitis B vaccine (Centro De Ingenieria Genetica Y Biotecnologia, La Habana,
      Cuba); 1) 20 μg IM at months 0, 1, and 6 (3-standard doses group), and 2) 20 μg IM at months
      0, 1, 2, 6 (4-standard doses group).

      This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of these 2 hepatitis B vaccination
      regimens at month 7 after vaccination.
