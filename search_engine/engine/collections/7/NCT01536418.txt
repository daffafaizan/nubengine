    
      This is a multi-centre, double-blind, randomised, active treatment, parallel group study
      designed to induce clinical response and/or clinical remission with two oral doses of
      GSK1605786A (500 milligrams once daily, 500 milligrams twice daily) over a 12-week treatment
      period in subjects with moderately-to-severely active Crohn's disease. The primary objective
      of this study is to qualify subjects for enrolment into a follow up 52 week maintenance study
      CCX114157. Subjects who achieve induction of clinical response (CDAI decrease from baseline
      of at least 100 points) or remission (CDAI score less than 150) at Week 12 following
      treatment with GSK1605786A will be eligible for enrolment into the maintenance study
      CCX114157. Secondary objectives will include assessment of the safety and evaluation of the
      efficacy in induction of clinical response or remission.

      The study is planned to randomise approximately 900 subjects (450 subjects per group) with
      active Crohn's disease who have been diagnosed for at least 4 months, with documented history
      of disease in the small and/or large intestine, and characterised by a CDAI score between 220
      to 450 (inclusive). Subjects will be required to have evidence of current active inflammation
      by elevated C-reactive protein (greater than the upper limit of normal of the highly
      sensitive C-reactive protein test) OR an elevated level of faecal calprotectin. Subjects will
      be allowed to participate in the study while continuing on stable doses of agents typically
      used to treat Crohn's disease. Inclusion of subjects who received prior treatment with an
      anti-tumor necrosis factor agent and discontinued due to loss or lack of efficacy will be
      limited to approximately 50 percent of the study population. Following a 3-week screening
      period, subjects will be randomised at baseline to receive blinded treatment with one of two
      doses of GSK1605786A (500 milligrams once daily or twice daily) for 12 weeks. All subjects
      meeting the definition of responder (CDAI decrease from baseline of at least 100 points) or
      who are in remission (CDAI score less than 150 points) at Week 12 will be eligible for
      randomisation into an ongoing maintenance study (CCX114157). Subjects who do not meet the
      definition of responder or who are not in remission at Week 12 will not be eligible to
      participate in study CCX114157.

      For subjects who complete the study the minimum duration of participation is 15 weeks and the
      maximum duration is 19 weeks.
