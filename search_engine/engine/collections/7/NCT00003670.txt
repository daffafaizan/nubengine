      refractory ovarian epithelial cancer or primary peritoneal cancer. II. Determine the time to
      progressive disease, time to treatment failure, response duration, and survival of these
      patients. III. Assess the safety of this treatment in these patients. IV. Measure changes in
      serum estradiol, follicle stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, and sex hormone binding
      globulin during this treatment in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral arzoxifene hydrochloride daily at a fixed dose. Treatment
      continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.
