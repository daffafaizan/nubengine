      the vulnerability of the embryos when exposed to fluctuations in temperature and CO2 levels.

      Thus embryos can only be allowed to leave incubators for a very limited time period.

      However, with the development of time-lapse systems for clinical use it is possible to make
      continuous time-lapse recordings of embryos while they are in a safe incubator environment.

      The embryos are not compromised, but the entire embryonic development can still be seen, and
      will subsequently provide new and essential information on the competence of the single
      embryo.

      Based on the above it is expected that the probability of selecting the most viable and
      competent embryo is increased, which, in turn, will increase the success rate for couples
      seeking infertility treatment.
