      accepted as the cornerstone for the treatment of people with type 2 diabetes. Consumption of
      low GI food has shown to improve glycemic control, lipid profile and reduce systemic
      inflammation. However, there are few dietary intervention studies attempting to change the GI
      of food by changing the staple carbohydrates. In this study, formulated rice with special
      fibre enrichment, Fibre Grains, was used to replace rice as the staple carbohydrates in one's
      diet. This fibre enriched rice has been previously tested to have a lower GI than normal rice
      while still able to preserve all the sensory characteristics of normal rice. With rice being
      a staple to Asians, this specially formulated fibre enriched rice offers a lower GI
      alternative to the conventional rice without affecting the people dietary preference.
