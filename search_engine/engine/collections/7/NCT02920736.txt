      inpatients who were hospitalized between Sep.2016 and Dec.2018 in the Respiratory ICU,
      Surgical ICU and Emergency ICU of 6 general hospitals in Beijing. Based on the Sepsis 3.0,the
      population(500 subjects) selected met the diagnostic criteria. Based on the KDIGO (Nephrol
      Dial Transplant. 2012) defines AKI as 3 degrees, the subjects were divided into acute renal
      injury group (AKI group) and non-acute renal injury group (non-AKI group). Approximately 110
      healthy volunteers enrolled as control group. Urine samples were collected from day 1 to day
      28 in all patient groups (or to the terminal time point of death), serum samples were
      collected on days 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 14 and the samples were collected from healthy subjects
      on the day of enrollment. Blood was centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 15 minutes, and urine at
      2,000 rpm for 5 minutes. The supernatants were transferred to Eppendorf tubes and stored at
      -80Â°C. All the specimens were re-numbered before the experiment. Urine sTREM-1 was measured
      by a double antibody sandwich ELISA. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the
      CPLA General Hospital (project No.2014-113-02). The following clinical datas were recorded
      for all patients through the unified database software: (1) basic clinical information:
      hospital number, gender, age, underlying disease, hospital admission. (2) Daily vital signs
      after admission: body temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, 24h urine
      volume, Glasgow score. (3) APACHE II score and SOFA score: arterial blood gas analysis, blood
      routine, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, blood biochemistry (liver function, renal
      function, brain natriuretic peptide, blood electrolytes) The APACHE II score and the SOFA
      score were calculated. (4) 28-day outcome (survival or death). Statistical analyses were
      conducted by SPSS 16.0 (SPSS, Chicago,IL, USA) and a two-tailed P < 0.05 was considered
      significant.
