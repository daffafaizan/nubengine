    
      Part 1 (1A & 1B): Dose Escalation

      Part 1A - Modified accelerated titration design to determine a tolerable weekly entry dose.
      Three dose levels of IMC-002 are planned to be tested: 0.3, 1, and 2 mg/kg. The MTD will be
      selected as the entry dose for Part 1B.

      Part 1B - Traditional 3+3 design with two weekly entry doses followed by escalating treatment
      doses. Upon the completion of the 2-week entry dose period, escalating treatment doses of
      IMC-002 will be given once every 2 weeks. Four dose levels of IMC-002 are planned to be
      tested: 3, 8, 15, and 25 mg/kg.

      Part 2: Expansion Cohort The study may be amended in the future to include expansion cohorts
      in selected tumor types to further evaluate extended safety of IMC-002 at recommended Phase 2
      dose in that tumor type. Sample size in the Dose Expansion part will be determined when the
      study is amended to include the expansion cohorts.
