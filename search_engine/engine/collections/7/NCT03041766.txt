    
      A phase 2a trial, self-contained, open-label, randomized, dose-escalation study in two
      parallel arms receiving three (3) injections at D0, D28, D56; both groups receiving 50 μg
      Sm14 vaccine candidate solution, either combined with 2.5µg GLA-SE for the first group and
      5µg for the second one in adults living in a S. mansoni and S. haematobium endemic area.

      Sm14: recombinant protein produced in yeast following Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP)
      conditions, presented in vials containing 0.55 ml solution Sm14, 0.4 ml solution is diluted
      with 0.4 ml of GLA (Synthetic Glucopyranosyl lipid A) for intramuscular administration.

      Medical examinations are performed at D0 (before injection, 1 hr and 4 hr after), and a
      safety evaluation at 24 hrs and 48 hrs, after each injection.

      Blood analysis: Liver function tests - renal function tests - blood counts, at W-1 before
      inclusion, and then 7 days after each injections and at W13 and W21 during the follow-up.

      Blood samples for immune response analysis at time of each injection, and then W12 and W20.
