      be contoured in 3D and the images fused to the planning TRUS study that is done in
      preparation for brachytherapy (of any type: seeds or HDR). The patient's treatment will
      consist of the standard combined external beam (4600 centiGray (cGy) in 23 fractions) and HDR
      brachytherapy boost (2 fractions of 1000 cGy given on days 5 and 15 of the external beam
      course). During each HDR treatment the plan will be manipulated such that the normally
      occurring high dose regions (125%, 150%) are positioned at the site of the identified
      disease. Normally approximately 60% of the prostate volume receives 125% of the dose and 30%
      receives 150%. By ensuring that the inherent dosimetry favors treatment of the known cancer,
      no region of the prostate would be "underdosed". HDR treatments are performed under general
      anesthesia as an out patient procedure.

      Statistical Analysis: This is a feasibility study and the data reported will be descriptive
      including the frequency with which the DIL can be visualized in this population, the DIL
      volume compared to total prostate volume, and the isodose that can encompass the DIL without
      violating dose constraints to adjacent organs (urethra and bladder). Toxicity will be
      monitored and efficacy will be assessed by repeat DCE MRI at 12 months and biopsy at 30
      months.
