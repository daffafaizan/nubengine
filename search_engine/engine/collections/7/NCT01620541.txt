      controlled trial (RCT) comparing the effectiveness of ankle arthrodesis and ankle
      arthroplasty over a 2-year follow-up period. The study used a modified Comprehensive Cohort
      Design. Subjects unwilling to randomize to surgery could still participate in the study by
      entering into the preference cohort and select surgery in consultation with their surgeon.

      By March 2014, no subjects had entered into the randomized cohort. The Data and Safety
      Monitoring Board (DSMB) recommended stopping recruitment in the randomized arm of the study
      since no subjects were willing to randomize to surgery. All patients were enrolled in the
      preference cohort and selected arthrodesis or arthroplasty. Despite the change in study
      design, the objectives remain unchanged.
