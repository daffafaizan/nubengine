      treatment of patients with cryptococcal meningitis. Patients will be randomly assigned in a
      1:1 ratio to receive 5.0 or 10.0 mg/kg/d of ABLC as induction therapy for cryptococcal
      meningitis. Patients receiving 10 mg/kg/d doses will be treated with ABLC for 7 days whereas
      patients receiving ABLC at 5.0 mg/kg/d will receive 14 days of ABLC therapy. After completion
      of induction therapy subjects will receive long-term fluconazole maintenance therapy at the
      discretion of the treating physician. The study will be conducted at the Washington Hospital
      Center
