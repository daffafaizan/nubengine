      will be identified at the time of the diagnosis of acute calf deep vein thrombosis and
      approached at that time. If they agree they would be randomly assigned to placebo or apixaban
      treatment for three months. Along with this they will also undergo repeat ultrasounds at 7,
      14, and 90 days along with telephone follow-up at 30 and 60 days.
