      the study announcement with their young adult members and social media. Eligible participants
      will complete a baseline battery survey via Qualtrics. The investigators will recruit 120
      participants. The survey will take approximately 30 minutes to complete. Participants will be
      randomly assigned to an experimental group or control group. The experimental group will take
      an Internet-based behavioral activation intervention. The intervention has four modules and
      will be administered via Qualtrics. A link to each module will be sent to the participants
      via e-mail. Participants will have one week to complete each module. Once a participant
      completes a module, the next module link will be sent after 3 days. A reminder will be sent
      at 7 days and 10 days until the module is complete. Each module will take approximately 30
      minutes to complete. The experimental group may continue to receive services as usual from
      the Children's Brain Tumor Foundation. The control group will continue to receive services as
      usual from the Children's Brain Tumor Foundation. The control group will have an opportunity
      to take the intervention once data collection is complete. Both groups will be asked to
      complete a battery of surveys at the end of the intervention and intermittently over a
      3-month period.
