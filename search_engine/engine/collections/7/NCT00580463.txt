      system (CNS) tumors or metastases to the CNS and related tissues as an invaluable resource
      for current or future research studies of the etiology, pathogenesis and treatment of human
      central nervous system tumors. The database will be established through the intra-operative
      acquisition of brain or spine tumors as well as the collection of blood and spinal fluids
      from consenting CNS tumor patients.
