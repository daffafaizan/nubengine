    
      Purpose: to study the features of the macular ILM, to study the features of the preretinal
      structures of the vitreous body of the Central retinal region, morphofunctional features of
      preretinal hyalocytes, and the mechanism of vitreoretinal adhesion.

      Study Protocol: examination of donor human eyes obtained from an eye Bank after sampling
      material for corneal transplantation.

      Research method: scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of the central retina (macular and
      paramacular zone): ILM, preretinal vitreous.

      Scientific hypothesis: vitreoretinal adhesion is provided not by laminin and fibronectin, but
      by the interweaving of vitreous collagen fibers between the epiretinal vitreous (more firmly
      fixed to the retinal surface) and the cortical vitreous.

      Expected results: determination of ILM thickness in the macular zone, microanatomy of
      preretinal vitreous strutcures, and possible mechanism of vitreoretinal adhesion,
      establishing the possibility of intravital synthesis of collagen fibers synthesis in the
      adult vitreous.
