    
      Primary objectives of this study are:

        -  to determine the absolute bioavailability of OZ439 following a single oral dose of OZ439
           dispersion and a simultaneous single intravenous (iv) microdose (100 μg) infusion of
           [14C]-OZ439 under fasted conditions (Part 1)

        -  To evaluate the effects of a single oral dose of cobicistat, a strong cytochrome P450
           (CYP) 3A4 inhibitor, on the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of a single oral dose of a
           dispersion of OZ439 simple granules under fasted conditions (Part 2)

        -  To evaluate the PK of single doses of OZ439 granules when restricting the target dosing
           volumes to 64.5 or 100 mL (Parts 1 and 2)

      Secondary objectives are:

        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of OZ439 when administered alone, and to assess
           the safety and tolerability of OZ439 and cobicistat when co-administered as single doses
           to healthy subjects (Parts 1 and 2)

        -  To determine the PK parameters of OZ439 single iv microdose (100 μg) infusion of
           [14C]-OZ439 (Part 1)

        -  To assess the effects of the total dosing volume and of dose to volume ratio on OZ439 PK
           under fasted conditions (Parts 1 and 2)

        -  To determine the PK parameters and exposures of cobicistat (Part 2)
