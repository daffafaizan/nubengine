      Fibroblast Growth Factor 23 (FGF23) in murines, both health and with acute or chronic renal
      disease. Also, observational studies indicate an association between EPO and FGF23 levels in
      patients. Until now, it has not been demonstrated whether the use of rEPO does increase
      plasma FGF23 in End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) patients in hemodialysis (a population with a
      high use of this therapy for the management of chronic anemia).

      Our objective was to evaluate whether the administration of rEPO increases plasma FGF23
      levels in ESRD patients in hemodialysis.

      We performed a prospective cohort with ESRD patients without rEPO therapy. We performed 2
      groups: patients with requirements of rEPO therapy due to anemia (Hb < 10 g/dL) and patients
      without rEPO therapy (Hb > 10 g/dL).

      We measured plasma FGF23 (intact and C-terminal) at baseline and during 12 weeks.

      Demographic, clinical and laboratory data was obtained. Patients treated with rEPO received
      beta-epoetin (Recormon, Roche), according to current recommendations.

      Patients were follow-up during 3 months to evaluate the effects of rEPO. Our primary outcome
      was changes in plasma intact FGF23 at 12 weeks, between both groups.
