      technology to guide surgical treatments of corneas with superficial opacities and
      irregularities. OCT is well known for its exquisite resolution, but until recently it has not
      had sufficient speed to capture the shape of the cornea because of eye motion during OCT
      scanning. The development of Fourier-domain OCT (FD-OCT) technology has made the requisite
      speed possible.

      Eyes with superficial opacities (corneal scars and stromal dystrophies) can be treated by
      phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK). Currently, many surgeons rely on subjective slit-lamp
      impression of opacity depth to guide PTK and repeat slit-lamp examinations during surgery to
      determine if the opacity has been sufficiently reduced. Unpredictable hyperopic shifts can
      occur after PTK. The aim of this project is to develop methods for imaging the cornea with an
      FD-OCT system that will precisely measure corneal shape and use this information to guide
      surgery. Patients with irregularly shaped corneas could have their vision restored by
      reshaping the corneas with a procedure that combines the precision of OCT and lasers.
