      GS-248 versus placebo on Raynaud's Phenomenon (RP) in subjects with Systemic Sclerosis (SSc).

      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in multiple sites in 4
      countries in Europe. Approximately 80 subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 allocation to
      receive either GS-248 (120 mg) or placebo once daily. The study will comprise an enrolment
      period, a treatment period, and a follow-up period, with a total of 5 study visits over
      approximately 10 weeks.
