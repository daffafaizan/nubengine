      convalescent plasma transfusion administered to critically ill patients with COVID-19.

      1 To study the efficacy of plasma from patients recovered from COVID-19 infection with a high
      neutralizing antibody titer (NAT) as treatment for individuals who are critically ill with
      COVID-19.

      2. Determine if the antibodies from convalescent plasma will suppress virus load in
      critically ill patients with COVID-19.
