3384. adrenergic effects in splenic po2 of rats in air or oxygenat 5 atmospheresoxygen tensions have been measuredin the spleens of rats breathing air and duringexposure of the animals to 5 atm absof oxygen (hpo).  the response of splenic po2to compression was complex, usuallyreaching a peak value immediately after com-pression, then falling to a lower value.this form of response has been termed ahump response.  after adrenalectomyor bretylium tosylate injection the hump res-ponse of po2 after compression wasalmost abolished, and the values of splenic po2at 5 atm were considerably higherthan in control animals.  a combination of adrena-lectomy and bretylium tosylate alsomarkedly reduced the number of hump responses,but unexpectedly significantly loweredsplenic oxygen tensions, both when the ani-mals were under ambient conditionsor at 5 atm of oxygen.  cardiac rate and bloodpressure were studied in an attemptto find the explanation of this latter effect, andwhile blood pressure was the samein adrenalectomized rats and control rats afterbretylium injection, adrenalectomypotentiated the bradycardia produced by brety-lium tosylate.
