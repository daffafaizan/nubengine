      disease on two or more oral antidiabetic drugs. After the wash-up period, they were
      randomized alternately to first receive either IDeg-100 or IGlar-300 along with metformin.
      Each insulin was applied for 12 weeks. At the beginning and the end of each phase,
      biochemical and oxidative stress parameters were analysed and augmentation index was
      measured. On three consecutive days prior to each control point, patients performed a 7-point
      SMBG profile. Oxidative stress was assessed by measuring thiol groups and hydroperoxides
      (d-ROM) in serum. For augmentation index measuring, we used SphygmoCor (AtCor Medical,
      Sydney, Australia) which allow non-invasive measurement of AIx on radial artery using strain
      gauge transducer placed on the tip of a pencil-type tonometer. This method is based on the
      principle of applanation tonometry
