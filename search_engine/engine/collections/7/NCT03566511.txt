      noninvasive method of measuring brain activity by imaging the blood flow to different parts
      of the brain, to assess the impact of the medication diazoxide on both diabetic and
      non-diabetic patients. fMRI is a technique for measuring and mapping brain activity. This
      technique relies on the fact that cerebral blood flow and neuronal activity are coupled.

      Previous rodent and human studies have demonstrated that diazoxide activates potassium (KATP)
      channels that are sensitive to ATP in the hypothalamus, inhibiting hepatic glucose
      production. However, these inhibitory effects of diazoxide on hepatic glucose production are
      curiously absent in diabetic patients, which suggests that they may have impaired activation
      of KATP channels and thus lowered brain activity in this area of the brain.

      After screening and meeting eligibility criteria, participants will have 2 day-long study
      visits (one day in which the brain will be imaged before and after receiving diazoxide, and
      one day in which the brain will be imaged before and after placebo. Each study day will
      include up to 3 MRI scans per study visit and hourly blood draws.
