      fibrosis although being highly recommended and recommended in guidelines still sees studies
      exploring the outcomes from such an intervention limited. The present study aims to
      contribute to the available literature by investigating the effects of a high intensity,
      12week PR programme on functional and quality of life measures in patients with a diagnosis
      of pulmonary fibrosis. This study reports outcomes of an observational, quasi experimental
      type of study. A total of 120 participants were recruited: 60 patients formed part of the
      active group, another 60 patients were enrolled in an inactive group. Each participant was
      classified according to the modified Medical Research Council dyspnoea scale and placed in
      one of 5 categories (0 to 4) according to self-perceived breathlessness during daily
      activities. The following outcomes were measured: Lung function tests including
      plethysmography and diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide (DLCO), functional tests (6-minute
      walking test, Dyspnoea Borg Scale) and Health status measures (St George's Respiratory
      Questionnaire and HAD score).
