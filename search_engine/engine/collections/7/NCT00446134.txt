      efficacy and safety of 3 taribavirin dose levels, 20, 25, and 30 mg/kg/day, versus ribavirin
      800 mg/day to 1400 mg/day based on subject body weight, with both drugs administered in
      combination with peginterferon alfa-2b to therapy-naive patients with chronic Hepatitis C
      Virus genotype 1 infection.
