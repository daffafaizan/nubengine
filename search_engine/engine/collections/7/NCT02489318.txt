    
      This is a randomized (study medication assigned to participants by chance), double-blind
      (neither the researchers nor the participants know what treatment the participant is
      receiving), placebo-controlled, multinational, multicenter study of apalutamide in
      participants with mHSPC. The study consists of 4 Phases: Screening Phase (up to 28 days
      before randomization), Treatment Phase (28 day treatment cycles until disease progression or
      the occurrence of unacceptable treatment related toxicity), an End of Treatment Phase (until
      30 days after the last dose of study drug), and then a Survival Follow up Phase. In the event
      of a positive study result and notification of unblinding at either of the interim analyses
      or at the final analysis, participants in the treatment Phase will have the opportunity to
      enroll in an Open-label Extension Phase, which will allow participants to receive active drug
      (apalutamide) for approximately 3 years. Participants who are receiving apalutamide in the
      Open-label Extension Phase may continue receiving apalutamide in the Long-term Extension
      (LTE) Phase if they will continue to derive benefit from treatment (based on investigator
      assessment). Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
