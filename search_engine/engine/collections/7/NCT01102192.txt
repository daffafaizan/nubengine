      terms of their functional capacity and their specificity. We will analyse blood and thymoma
      tissue of patients with myasthenia gravis with thymona, patients with myasthenia gravis
      without thymona, and patients with thymona without myasthenia gravis.

      Hypothesis: The T-cells which are generated in the thymoma in thymoma-associated myasthenia
      gravis can be differentiated from T-cells which are generated in normal thymoma tissue with
      regard to functionality and T-cell receptor specificity. This non-physiological T-cell
      maturation might be the cause for the formation of auto-antibodies.

      On the other hand we want to examine the effects of thymectomy on the immune system in the
      context of myasthenia gravis. We will analyse blood and thymoma tissue of patients with
      myasthenia gravis with thymona, patients with myasthenia gravis without thymona, patients
      with thymona without myasthenia gravis and patients with cardiac, or thyroid surgery.

      Hypothesis:

        1. Thymectomy in patients with myasthenia gravis leads to a reduced number of
           auto-reactive, e.g. Acetylcholine receptor (ACh-R)-specific T cells. In contrast,
           T-cells with other specifities, for example against CMV or tetanus, are not affected.

        2. The non-physiological export of thymocytes from thymomas leads to a significant shift in
           leukocyte populations in peripheral blood.
