      acceptability and efficacy of iCBT among persistently depressed cardiac patients. Cardiac
      patients will be recruited from inpatient units in a university-affiliated hospital and
      screened for depression at 4 and possibly 8 or 12 weeks following discharge. Eligible
      patients will be enrolled in the iCBT program.Data regarding the primary outcome, improvement
      in depression severity, will be collected at completion of the intervention and at 8 weeks
      after completion. In addition to depression severity data, we will also obtain other data
      related to clinical feasibility, such as treatment adherence and the acceptability of the
      intervention to patients. Self-reported rates of hospital readmission or emergency visits for
      a cardiac cause will also be tracked.
