      administered orally on clearance of Plasmodium falciparum blood stage parasites from the
      blood in healthy subjects .The inoculum used for blood stage Plasmodium falciparum challenge
      (BSPC) contained an estimated 1,800 viable parasite-infected erythrocytes diluted into 2 mL
      of normal saline for injection. Blood was collected for malaria parasitemia assessment by
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Parasitemia ≥ 1,000 parasites/mL indicated that the subjects
      should be treated with ACT-451840 . If PCR counts were > 5,000 parasites/mL and symptomatic
      they were dosed within 24 hours. Subsequent PCR blood sampling were performed prior to
      ACT-451840 dosing and at 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 30, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, 120, 144 hours
      post-dosing and then approximately times per week until 2 consecutive negative samples, until
      Riamet® rescue treatment and at the final visit.
