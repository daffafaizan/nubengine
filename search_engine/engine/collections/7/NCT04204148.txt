      pneumonectomy. The incidence of cough can reach 25% â‰¤ 50%. Cough after operation can
      aggravate the pain of incision, prolong the hospitalization time, increase the cost of
      hospitalization, affect the conversation and even sleep of the patients, increase the
      psychological burden of the patients, and reduce the quality of life of the patients
      accordingly. Therefore, through this study, the investigators hope to understand the related
      factors of cough after thoracoscopic pneumonectomy and whether there are predictable risk
      factors, so as to provide theoretical basis for reducing the occurrence of cough after
      pneumonectomy.
