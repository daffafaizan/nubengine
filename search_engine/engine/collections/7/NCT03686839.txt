      functioning if the principles of application are seriously respected, whilst recognizing the
      necessary adaptation to the conditions of patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). This
      study examined the feasibility and acceptability of an electroencephalography neurofeedback
      training protocol in a sample group of older adults with MCI in order to identify the
      necessary conditions for an improved neurofeedback application. Participants performed an
      electroencephalography recording, a battery of neuropsychological tests before the
      neurofeedback training program (T0), following the neurofeedback training program (T2) and
      1-month follow-up (T3). A questionnaire about motivation, opinions of technical aspects of NF
      and feeling of cognitive improvement was administered at T0 and T2.
