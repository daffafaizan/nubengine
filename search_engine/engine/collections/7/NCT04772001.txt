    
      Patients diagnosed pathologically as cervical cancer (squamous carcinoma, adenocarcinoma or
      adenosquamous carcinoma) with stage of FIGO IB3 and IIA2 to IVB will be included in this
      study according to the prescribed criteria in the protocal. Classical radiochemotherapy will
      be conducted by clinical routine method. Radiation will be given by external beam radiation
      of 45Gy total dose and 3D-brachytherapy of 30Gy/5F or 28Gy/4F. Duration of radiotherapy will
      be no more than 8 weeks. Concurrent chemotherapy will be administrated weekly during
      radiation for a total of 5-6 doses. Cisplatin of 40mg/m2 will be the most preferred regime
      and for patients with intolerable toxicity of cisplatin, carboplatin of AUC 2 will be the
      alternative drug. Apart from that, hydrochloride anlotinib, a multiple targets
      anti-angiogenesis kinase approved by CFDA, will be orally taken daily at a dose of 12mg for
      14 days aiming to improve tumor response. Then rest for 7 days and start a new cycles for a
      total of 3 cycles. First capsule of anlotinib will be taken 7 days before the first
      radiation. Once the treatment is finished, patients will be examination for tumor evaluation
      and toxicity monitor every 3 months for the first 2 years and then every half years for the
      third year unless progression or death. During those period, patient characteristics, image
      data, tumor tissue, blood, urine, stool and microbial sample of tumor micro environment will
      be collected and analysis by multi-omics and bioinformatic technology. A total of 53 patients
      will be included and this study will be conducted in the department of radiation and clinical
      oncology in Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University.
