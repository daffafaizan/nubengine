      included in the study. Patients are assigned to desflurane group (Des) or propofol group
      (Prop). Des receives desflurane (1-2 MAC) inhalation between the induction of anesthesia and
      cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). After the induction of CPB, the anesthesia in Des is switched
      to a total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) with propofol. Prop receives a TIVA during the
      surgery. All patients receive a continuous infusion of remifentanil. Biomarker of myocardial
      damage troponin I is examined at 4 points; T1: after the induction of anesthesia, T2: arrival
      at ICU, T3: 12 hours after the ICU arrival, T4: 24 hours after the ICU arrival, T5: third
      post operative day (3POD).
