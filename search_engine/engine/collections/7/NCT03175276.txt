      Methods:

      Exposure: The short IQCODE is a 16-item questionnaire that ask relatives about changes in the
      elderly patients cognitive performance over the previous 10 years. The score range from one
      to five, with a high score reflecting bad evolution through the years.

      Settings: Patients (aged ≥75 years) admitted to ED (medical and surgery) and transferred to a
      geriatric ward at Aarhus University Hospital, who meet the inclusion criteria will be asked
      if the staff is allowed to contact their relatives. By oral consent, the relatives are
      interviewed by telephone or at the hospital. The IQCODE are filled in during the interview.

      In the geriatric ward the assessment of delirium by a positive Confusion Assesment Method
      (CAM) is done twice a day and is part of the regular procedure in the Geriatric Department at
      Aarhus University Hospital.

      Sample size: The power calculation is based on a pilot study of IQCODE. The study that
      included 32 75-year-olds from geriatric ward at Aarhus University hospital, showed an no
      incidence of delirium of when the IQCODE-score was ≤3,125. On the contrary the incidence of
      delirium was 15% when the IQCODE-score was >3,125. With a power of 90% and a significance
      level of 5%, 76 patients should be included in each group to predict delirium.

      Time frame: Of the 80 admitted to the geriatric wards, only 20% in the pilot study had an
      IQCODE-score ≤3,125. With an expected response rate of 70%, the data collection period is
      expected to last five months.
