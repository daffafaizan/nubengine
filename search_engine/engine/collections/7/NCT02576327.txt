      hematological malignancies. Although aprepitant has been shown to control CINV in highly
      emetogenic therapies for solid tumors, the antiemetic effect of aprepitant in hematological
      chemotherapies is still not clear. In this multi-central perspective randomized controlled
      study, the investigators are trying to evaluate the efficacy and safety of additional
      aprepitant to standard antiemetic regimen in Autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cell
      Transplantation.
