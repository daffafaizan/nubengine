    
      Melasma is a chronic condition in which dark areas appear on the forehead, cheeks, and upper
      lips. Hydroquinone is a skin lightener (or fade cream) and is one of the most commonly used
      medications for the treatment of melasma. Azelaic acid gel is currently used to treat acne
      and rosacea.
