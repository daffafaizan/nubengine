      Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for insomnia [via the American Academy of Sleep Medicine
      Sleep Telemedicine (AASM Sleep TM) platform] to gold standard face-to-face CBT for insomnia.
      The central hypothesis is that CBT for insomnia delivered by AASM SleepTM will be comparable
      to face-to-face CBT for insomnia for clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction, but AASM
      SleepTM will be a more cost effective treatment modality (primarily through reduced costs
      associated with facility use and patient time). The rationale for the proposed project is
      rooted in the critical need to disseminate CBT for insomnia using the most effective and
      efficient modalities, with recognition that therapist involvement likely produces the most
      favorable outcomes.
