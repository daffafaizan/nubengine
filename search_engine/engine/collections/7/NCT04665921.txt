    
      The study will include dose escalation (Part A) and dose expansion (Part B), with multiple
      disease-specific cohorts and a biology cohort in dose expansion. The biology cohort will be
      gated based on data generated from other expansion cohorts and will require additional
      biopsies. At the completion of dose escalation, up to 5 disease specific expansion cohorts
      and 1 biology expansion cohort may be activated by the sponsor in consultation with the
      Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC). Expansion cohorts in Part B will enroll subjects with
      selected tumors that are eligible for enrollment in Part A. The dose(s) to be examined in
      Part B will be at or below the maximum tolerated dose and/or the recommended dose determined
      in Part A. The recommended dose and/or schedule may differ between cohorts.
