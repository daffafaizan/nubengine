      community-operated summer programs on weight status (i.e., BMI z-score) and obesogenic
      behaviors of 1st-3rd grade children from low-income households. Using a pragmatic, Type II
      hybrid effectiveness-implementation randomized design, we will compare changes in weight
      status and obesogenic behaviors of children from low-income households randomized to one of
      two conditions: free summer programming or comparison/control.
