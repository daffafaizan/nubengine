    
      This study is designed as a parallel group randomized controlled clinical trial to determine
      if recurrent Glioblastoma (GBM) patients treated with drugs predicted by the ChemoID assay
      will have better outcomes than patients treated with standard-of-care control therapy chosen
      by the Physician.

      Upon obtaining informed consent, all eligible participants affected by recurrent GBM will
      have a tumor biopsy to undergo ChemoID drug response testing with multiple FDA-approved
      chemotherapeutic agents.

      Eligible participants will be randomized to a standard treatment arm with control treatment
      (chemotherapy chosen by the Physician from a provided list), or to a study arm of
      FDA-approved drugs selected by the ChemoID drug response assay.
