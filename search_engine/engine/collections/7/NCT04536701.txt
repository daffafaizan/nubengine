      recommendation solution (for caregivers) for in-home dementia patient care that focuses on
      caregiver-patient relationships. This includes monitoring for mood and stress and analyzing
      the significance of monitoring those attributes to dementia patient care and subsequent
      behavior dynamics between the patient and caregiver. In addition, novel and adaptive
      behavioral suggestions will be provided to family caregivers via text messages on project
      Smart phones at the right moments aimed to help improve familial interactions related to
      caregiving, which over time should ameliorate the stressful effects of the patient's illness
      and reduce strain on caregivers. The technical solution consists of a core set of statistical
      learning based techniques for automated generation of specialized modules required by in-home
      dementia patient care. There are three main technical components in the solution. - The first
      obtains textual content and prosody from voice and uses advanced machine learning techniques
      to create classification models. This approach not only monitors patients' behavior, but also
      caregivers', and infers the underlying dynamics of their interactions, such as changes in
      mood and stress. - The second is the automated creation of classifiers and inference modules
      tailored to the particular patients and dementia conditions (such as different stages of
      dementia). - The third is an adaptive recommendation system that closes the loop of an
      in-home behavior monitoring system.
