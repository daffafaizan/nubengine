3485. measurement of the cardiac output and ventricularvolumes by radiocardiographycardiac output was measured by externalcounting after injection of radioisotopes(rihsa and erythrocytes-cr51).  the resultsin 113 subjects, including 16 normals,are presented and compared with the resultsby other methods.  cardiac output atrest and after exercise was compared in 65 subjects.the principle of ventricularvolume measurement by radioisotope-cardiography isdiscussed.  the results ofmeasurement of the ventricular volume in 17 normalsubjects and 90 patients, andof measurement of the ventricular volume in 57 patients,are presented.
