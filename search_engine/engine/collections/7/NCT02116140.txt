      complete pharyngeal collapse leading to obstructive hypopnea and apnea during sleep. OSA
      often coexists with HF.

      Central sleep apnea (CSA) is characterized by: reductions in central respiratory drive during
      sleep that leads to episodes of partial or complete cessation of airflow. CSA often co-exists
      with HF.

      Continuous positive airway pressure(CPAP) delivers air through a nasal or oral interface to
      preserve upper airway patency. It is a treatment for symptomatic OSA or some patients with
      CSA.

      Adaptive Servoventilation (ASV) is effective in alleviating OSA and CSA. It provides
      expiratory positive pressure to alleviate OSA, and inspiratory positive airway pressure to
      eliminate CSA.

      Oxidative metabolism: utilization of substrates via the tricarboxylic acid cycle for
      Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production; it is linked to myocardial oxygen consumption and
      can be measured with [11C]acetate PET.

      The work-metabolic index (WMI) is the external work (minute-work) of the left ventricle
      corrected for the rate of oxidative metabolism and is an estimate of mechanical efficiency.

      Myocardial sympathetic neuron (SN) presynaptic function is the measure of uptake and storage
      of neuronal catecholamines in the heart measured by [11C]hydroxyephedrine (HED) PET.
