      normal medical examination, criteria for entry onto the registry will be verified to confirm
      eligibility, and medical procedures including demographic information, disease history,
      medical history, physical exam, and clinical laboratory testing performed under normal
      practice will be collected. Patients will receive PDT as per current practice and will be
      repeated as per the physician's judgment. All patients will be assessed as per current
      practice, that is usually at least three times, after a PDT session. Additional visits will
      be sought for those patients who are presenting photosensitivity reaction, esophageal
      stenosis, perforation at the site of laser light application, or any unresolved serious
      adverse reactions at the third visit after treatment. All patients will be requested by their
      physician to complete a two-part Daily Diary to record adverse reactions using a check-list
      form and a general section for reporting any adverse events and intake of concomitant
      medications at the time of the adverse event.
