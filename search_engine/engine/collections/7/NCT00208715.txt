      enrolled at four sites in the United States. This study consists of two parts. The first part
      consists of 6 weeks of open label treatment with a selected SSRI & double blind treatment
      with Provigil or placebo (inactive medication).

      After the six week double blind treatment phase all patients will enter a four week open
      label treatment phase with Provigil. The dose of Provigil is not to exceed 400 mg and cannot
      be less than 100 mg per day. They will continue taking the prescribed SSRI.
