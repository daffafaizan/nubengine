      priority for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. The pain that persists despite
      anti-inflammatory treatment is usually widespread and non-articular; it may lead to
      diminished quality of life and high medical, psychological and social costs. To develop
      better treatments for pain and prevent disability, it is critical to obtain a better
      understanding of widespread, non-joint pain in RA.

      Milnacipran is a selective serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI). No studies
      have examined the effect of SNRIs on pain in RA. However, several studies have examined the
      role of SNRIs in fibromyalgia and related pain conditions. Treatment with milnacipran has
      been associated with improvements in clinical pain severity in Phase 2 and Phase 3 randomized
      placebo-controlled trials of fibromyalgia patients. In animal models, milnacipran appears to
      moderate the pain-inducing effects of inflammation and central sensitization. Thus
      milnacipran may be an ideal drug to treat pain in RA.

      A clinical trial of an SNRI in the treatment of widespread, non-joint pain in RA will provide
      more information regarding pain mechanisms and may lead to more targeted, effective ways of
      treating pain in RA.
