      foods. Through a series of experimental studies, the investigators will evaluate how many
      weekly treatment visits there should be, whether children should be exposed to a single food
      or multiple foods during treatment, whether to use partial reinforcement or not, whether
      visits should be daily or weekly, and whether the exposures should be in single or multiple
      contexts. The investigators will be recruiting parent-child dyads in the San Diego community
      to participate in 8 to 16 weekly or daily treatment sessions either in their home, community
      center, or our lab, depending on the treatment arm. Parents and children will complete
      baseline and post-treatment assessments consisting of collecting psychophysiological data,
      completing laboratory tasks, and completing questionnaires. The investigators will be
      evaluating which treatment condition reduces overeating (as measured by our laboratory
      tasks).
