      practice and the St. John Medical Center Cancer Registry. Data will be obtained by review of
      both the clinic and hospital charts. In addition we plan to review and utilize liver tumor
      treatment and outcomes data from a national database. Treatment decisions, in cases managed
      by the primary investigator, were made on a clinical basis, often in collaboration with an
      interventional radiologist. Of the patients managed by the principal investigator, all
      procedures were undertaken after an informed consent process. Subjects were not exposed to
      risk beyond that posed by the recommended treatment. All treatments were within the scope of
      standard medical care. The primary investigator has no knowledge of the treatments chosen for
      the patients he did not manage. The subject's referring physician may be contacted to obtain
      follow-up data on the subject. The follow-up data will include: is the patient alive with
      disease; alive without disease, alive unknown; dead free of disease; dead with disease; dead
      unknown.
