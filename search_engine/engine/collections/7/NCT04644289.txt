    
      In total, 60 patients are planned to be enrolled in 2 consecutive cohorts (30 patients per
      cohort) into the trial.

      After histologic confirmation of high-grade epithelial non-mucinous, non-clear cell ovarian
      cancer, patients will be treated in two consecutive cohorts (A, B) of 30 patients each, with

      A) olaparib alone or B) olaparib in combination with durvalumab

      Treatment allocation will take place in two consecutive cohorts rather than by randomization.
      This will allow to evaluate the safety and feasibility in a stepwise approach. A trial
      steering committee (TSC) meeting will take place between the cohorts to review safety and
      feasibility prior to starting the second cohort. The safety follow-up of the first cohort
      will take 90 days as of the first dose of therapy.

      The window-of-opportunity treatment phase will be followed by primary debulking surgery and
      standard of care platinum based first-line chemotherapy at the discretion of the
      investigator.

      After completion of first-line chemotherapy patients who have not progressed during
      first-line chemotherapy will be offered maintenance treatment with olaparib for 24 months (or
      according to label).
