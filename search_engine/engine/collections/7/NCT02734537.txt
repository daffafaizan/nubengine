      I. To evaluate the disease-free survival (DFS) of patients with stage III-IV squamous cell
      carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) and disruptive p53 mutations after primary surgical
      resection followed by postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) alone or PORT with concurrent
      cisplatin.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the DFS of patients with stage III-IV SCCHN and non-disruptive p53 mutations
      after primary surgical resection followed by PORT alone or PORT with concurrent cisplatin.

      II. To evaluate the DFS of patients with stage III-IV SCCHN and p53 wild type after primary
      surgical resection followed by PORT alone or PORT with concurrent cisplatin.

      III. To evaluate toxicities of PORT alone or PORT with concurrent cisplatin. IV. To evaluate
      p53 mutation as a predictive biomarker of survival benefit given post-operative concurrent
      radiation and cisplatin.

      V. To identify potential genomic alterations in addition to TP53 mutations that may be
      developed to a novel treatment approach.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM A: Patients undergo intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) once daily (QD) 5 days a
      week for 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM B: Patients undergo IMRT QD 5 days a week and receive cisplatin intravenously (IV) over
      1-2 hours weekly for 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 3 years and
      then every 12 months for 7 years.
