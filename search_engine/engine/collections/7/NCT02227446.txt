      patients treated with local Vancomycin powder compared to those treated without local
      Vancomycin powder.

      Primary Hypothesis: The proportion of deep surgical site infections will be lower for
      patients treated with local Vancomycin powder.

      Secondary Aim #1: Compare antibiotic sensitivities of the bacteria in the patients who
      develop deep surgical site infections in study patients treated with local Vancomycin powder
      compared to those treated without local Vancomycin powder.

      Hypothesis 1: In the patients who develop infections, the antibiotic sensitivity profiles
      between patients treated with local Vancomycin powder will be non-inferior to those treated
      without local Vancomycin powder.

      Secondary Aim #2: Build and validate a risk prediction model for the development of deep
      surgical site infections in patients treated without local Vancomycin powder. (b) Explore
      whether the effect of local Vancomycin powder is modified by the predicted risk of infection.

      Hypothesis 2: Patient (e.g. medical co-morbidities) and injury (e.g open fractures) factors
      will be highly predictive of infection risk.

      Hypothesis 3: Patients with higher predictive risk will experience greater benefit from local
      antibiotics.
