    
      This study is an adaptive, randomized, double-blinded, controlled trial to evaluate the
      safety and efficacy of therapeutic agents in hospitalized adult patients diagnosed with
      COVID-19. The study is a single-center trial that will be conducted in Shebin Elkom teaching
      hospital. The study will be a series of 3-arm comparisons between two different
      investigational therapeutic agents (Ivermectin and Hydroxychloroquine) and a placebo. There
      will be interim monitoring to allow early stopping for futility, efficacy, or safety. Because
      of the possibility that background standards of supportive care may evolve/improve over time
      as more is learned about the successful management of COVID-19, comparisons of safety and
      efficacy will be based on data from concurrently randomized participants. An independent data
      and safety monitoring board (DSMB) will actively monitor interim data to make recommendations
      about early study closure or changes to study arms.
