      proven to be very effective in preventing the deterioration of pulmonary function in patients
      with degenerative neuromuscular disorders. Impaired airway clearance in stroke patients is
      associated with increased incidence of aspiration pneumonia.

      In this pilot study the investigators attempt to assess the efficacy of MI-E as part of a
      protocol for patients with dysphagia with impaired cough response.
