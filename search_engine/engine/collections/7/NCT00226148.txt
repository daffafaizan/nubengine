      patients, where the bonehealing after immediate implantplacement in molarregions is being
      investigated.

      Totally 90 patients are going to get a molar tooth extracted and immediately replaced with an
      implant (Br√•nemark System, Wide Platform). The molar tooth should be in such a condition that
      is has to be extracted.

      Extracting a molar leaves a defect which cannot completely be filled out by an implant. The
      90 patients are therefore randomised into 3 groups according to how the perimarginal
      bonedefects around the placed implants are being treated: 1. Bonechips 2. Membrane 3.
      Bonechips+Membrane. The bonehealing of the defects around the implants are then compared the
      groups in between. The amount of newly formed bone is being estimated too by digital
      radiography and subtractionradiography. Furthermore the prognosis for immediate placed
      implants in molar regions in relation to the method of defectreconstruction one year after
      crown delivery is also being investigated. All the investigations are conducted with the
      Ho-hypothesis that there is no difference in the bonehealing the three groups in between.
