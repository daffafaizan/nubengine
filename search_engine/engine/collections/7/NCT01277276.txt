      measure various tissues and can determine chemo brain symptoms. Near infrared diffuse optical
      imaging is a real-time, non-invasive technique that measures hemodynamic variations based on
      changes in hemoglobin oxygenation. Tissue in general and the cerebral cortex surface in
      particular, are transparent to near infrared light.

      Direct optical measurement of cerebral hemodynamic parameters is superior to systemic
      approaches that infer brain levels of hemoglobin. Optical imaging in conjunction with
      physiologic maneuvers measures vascular tone and reactivity and may permit early detection of
      changes in physiology that precede the onset of chemo brain symptoms. Since chemo brain
      specifically impacts working memory and executive function the optical imaging can measure
      the frontal cortical areas behind the forehead.
