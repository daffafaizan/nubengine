      with a problem that patients usually have a lot of comorbidities and physicians need to know
      —Åonsequently the huge number of medications and combinations. It is very difficult to decide
      quickly according to available data from libraries like PubMed. The Clinical Decision Support
      Systems (CDSS) based on real clinical data and its own Artificial Intelligence algorithms can
      help to make the right choice. This trial is designed to assess the difference between
      retrospective electronic medical cards (EMC) therapy prescriptions and MedicBK prescriptions
      based on key patient characteristics.

      Two groups of experts (cardiologists with clinical practice for more than 5 years) will be
      participating in the trial.

      Using main characteristics from EMC the first group of experts will put this data into
      MedicBK platform and assess retrospective treatment. The next blinded group of experts will
      perform prescriptions using MedicBK algorithms based on current guidelines and data from
      available clinical trials. The main hypothesis is the use Clinical Decision Support Systems
      (CDSS) better than current clinical practice. This option can help to make the right choice
      of medical combination based on main patient's clinical characteristics
