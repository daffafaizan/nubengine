      which up to 550 subjects will be followed through five years from implant of an Abbott
      annuloplasty device, with or without concomitant procedures, in five treatment groups,
      including primary mitral disease repair (N=200) with the Rigid Saddle Ring, Séguin Ring or
      full Tailor Ring without cut zone removal; secondary mitral disease repair (N=200) with the
      Rigid Saddle Ring, Séguin Ring or full Tailor Ring; primary tricuspid disease repair with the
      full Tailor Ring (N=50); secondary tricuspid disease repair with the full Tailor Ring (N=50);
      and primary tricuspid disease repair with the Tailor Band or partial Tailor Ring with cut
      zone removed (N=50). Study enrollment will occur at up to 25 global centers with
      approximately half or more of all implanted subjects being from European sites. The study
      will enroll adult subjects expected to be implanted with an Abbott annuloplasty device within
      90 days who meet all other eligibility requirements. Participants will complete annual
      in-clinic or telephone follow-up visits through five years from their annuloplasty implant.
      Data collected will include adverse events, cardiac medication usage, New York Heart
      Association functional classification (a measure of the severity of heart failure symptoms)
      and echocardiographic assessments of regurgitation through the repaired valve.
