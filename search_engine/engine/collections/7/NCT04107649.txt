      parallel three-arm RCT to establish the efficacy and sustainability of the effect of
      personalized intervention built on the principles of behavioral science and behavioral
      economics in improving PA among sedentary person who have undergone TKR. Our second aim is to
      establish the cost-effectiveness and budget impact of TAC(MI)+FI to improve PA in persons who
      have undergone TKR.

      The three arms will include:

      Arm 1: Usual post-TKR care

      Arm 2: Usual post-TKR care + Wrist-based physical activity tracker wear + Phone calls about
      general well being

      Arm 3: Usual post-TKR care + Wrist-based physical activity tracker wear + Telephonic Active
      Coaching (Motivational Interviewing) + Financial Incentives (TAC(MI)+FI).
