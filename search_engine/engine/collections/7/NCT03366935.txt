      with slow onset and inadequate sacral spread, unilateral or patchy sensory blockade, motor
      impairment. The combined spinal epidural (CSE) technique can provide rapid onset of
      analgesia, but is associated with greater side effects, including pruritus, fetal bradycardia
      and delayed testing of epidural catheters. Dural puncture epidural (DPE) technique is a
      modification of CSE technique. A spinal needle is introduced through the epidural needle to
      create a single dural puncture , after intrathecal space was identified by the free flow of
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) , the needle was removed without direct medication administration
      into the subarachnoid space. Privous studies have demonstrated that the DPE technique can
      improve block quality over the EPL technique with fewer maternal and fetal side effects than
      the CSE technique for parturients requesting labor analgesia. Besides the neuraxial
      techniques, maintenance regimens is another factor that affect the analgesic effect.
      Programmed intermittent epidural bolus (PIEB) provides greater spread of local anesthetic
      solution within the epidural space and therefore superior quality of analgesia compared with
      continuous epidural infusion (CEI). We designed this prospective randomized, double-blind
      study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the combined implementation of DPE technique and
      PIEB for labor analgesia.
