    
      Primary Outcome Measure:

      Our primary outcome measure is the change in levator ani muscle volume with correlation in
      improvement in stress incontinence. These will be assessed by MRI, urodynamic studies and pad
      tests. [Time Frame: 36 weeks]

      Secondary Outcome Measures:

      Our secondary outcome measures are: [Time Frame: 36 weeks]

        1. Change in urodynamic measurements including urethral pressure profile, cough stress
           profile, maximum urethral closure pressure, Valsalva leak point pressure, and pressure
           transmission ratios.

        2. Change in pelvic floor muscle strength as measured with a perineometer.

        3. Change in amounts of urinary leakage (in a 24 hour period) using the Pad Test.

        4. Change in subjective quality of life as it relates to incontinence using the
           Incontinence Impact Questionnaire, Urogenital Distress Inventory and Incontinence Diary.

        5. Change in hormone levels including total and free testosterone, dihydrotestosterone
           (DHT), estradiol 17 B, and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG).

        6. Change in complete blood count, chem 20, lipid profile (total cholesterol, triglyceride,
           HDL, LDL) and physical examination as compared to the baseline before treatment.
