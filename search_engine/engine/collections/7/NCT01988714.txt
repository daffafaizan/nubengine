      training (6 months), and at 12 month follow-up, using the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery
      (MCCB). The investigators will assess the following six constructs identified by MATRICS as
      separable, fundamental dimensions of cognitive impairment in schizophrenia, with a likely
      sensitivity to intervention [26]: 1) Speed of Processing, 2) Attention/Vigilance, 3) Working
      Memory, 4) Verbal Learning and Memory, 5) Visual Learning and Memory, and 6) Reasoning and
      Problem Solving (executive functioning). The investigators will also administer the delayed
      memory trials of HVLT and BVMT, Trails B, and D-KEFS Color-Word Interference Test [27], and
      will make one modification to the MCCB in utilizing BACS Tower of London [28] in place of NAB
      Mazes.
