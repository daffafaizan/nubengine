    
      Bilthoven Biologicals has developed a new bivalent OPV containing WHO approved Sabin strains
      of poliovirus type 1 and type 3. This phase III study will be conducted in two parts:

      Part 1 - 40 children of 60 to 83 months of age will be given single dose of BBio bOPV or
      licensed bOPV in 1:1 ratio. Primary objective is to assess safety of BBio bOPV.

      Part 2 - A total of 1080 infants of 42 to 56 days of age will be randomized to receive three
      doses of either BBio bOPV from one of the three lots or a licensed bOPV in 1:1:1:1 ratio as
      primary immunization series at 6, 10 and 14 weeks of age.

      Primary objective of this study is to assess non-inferiority of bOPV manufactured by BBio to
      that of licensed bOPV in terms of seroconversion. This study also will assess lot-to-lot
      consistency among three lots of BBio bOPV.
