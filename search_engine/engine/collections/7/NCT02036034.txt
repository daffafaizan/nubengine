      ophthalmologist with or without sedation.The surgical drapes used often covers the patients
      face and beyond in order to maintain sterility of the surgical field. This can lead to
      accumulation of carbon dioxide under ophthalmic drapes due to the exhaled carbon dioxide
      escapes incompletely through the drapes;hence results in an increase of carbon dioxide in the
      ambient air surrounding the patient's head.This causes an increase in arterial carbon dioxide
      partial pressure and thus hyperventilation and patient discomfort with restlessness and
      unable to stay still during the surgery.

      In recent years,several types of ophthalmic drapes have been produced.This study is look for
      possible difference in accumulation of carbon dioxide under the standard ophthalmic drapes
      compared to the modified draping.
