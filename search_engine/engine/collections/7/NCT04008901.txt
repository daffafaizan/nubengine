      using Rome III criteria were allocated to either test group (300 mg of BST-104, containing
      175 mg of Flos Lonicera extracts, twice daily) or placebo group (300 mg placebo, twice
      daily). Male and female patients > 19 years of age who had mild to moderate FD were eligible.
      They had baseline endoscopic screening, and patients without active lesions (peptic ulcer
      disease or gastric erosions) were enrolled. Written informed consent was obtained from all
      participants.
