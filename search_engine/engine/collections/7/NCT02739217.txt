      and effects on biomarkers of PBI-4050 in subjects with Alström syndrome. Approximately 18
      subjects will be enrolled. The duration of study participation is approximately 35 weeks for
      each subject and comprises of 9 on site visits and telephone contacts in between visits.

      Subjects who complete the initial 24 weeks of treatment may continue treatment for an
      additional 36 or 48 weeks (Extension Period [EP]), provided the subject signs informed
      consent. The extension period includes a further 3 on site visits and telephone contacts in
      between visits. The total duration of the study participation is extended to approximately 71
      or 83 weeks. The Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will determine if the safety data
      continue to support treatment for an additional 36 or 48 weeks.

      At the completion of the EP End of Treatment, subjects will be allowed to enrol in the
      Alström Rollover Study PBI-4050-CT-9-10 and continue ongoing study medication without any
      break in treatment.
