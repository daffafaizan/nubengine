      including surgery treatment, 131I therapy and TSH suppression therapy. It will involve nine
      hospitals which have participated in the first stage, and continually to observe the DTC
      patients who were recruited. The patients with more than 5 years long-term follow-up from the
      date of signing the informed consent form (ICF) in DTCC 1st to signing ICF in DTCC 2nd will
      be collected data retrospectively. For those follow-up less than 5 years, in addition to the
      retrospective data collection, one prospective visit will be conducted.
