    
      This is a multi-center, prospective, randomized, controlled trial to compare the therapeutic
      effect of stent and artificial blood vessel bypass to chronic long occlusion of the
      superficial femoral artery. Totally 200 patients will be entered into the trial. The study
      population will consist of patients with long superficial femoral stenosis and occlusion
      lesion (≥15 cm), presenting symptomatic ischemia（Rutherford 3-6）. The lesion does not extend
      beyond the aortoiliac artery or blow-knee popliteal artery, with at least 1 vessel
      infra-popliteal runoff to the foot.

      Trial participants will be randomized to either stent group or artificial blood vessel bypass
      group.

      Patients will be followed up for 3 years. Study examinations will be done at screening,
      procedure time, 1, 6, 12, 24 and 36 months after procedure.

      This study will be conducted at 3 centers in Beijing, China.
