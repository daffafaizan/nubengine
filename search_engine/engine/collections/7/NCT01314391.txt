        -  To determine whether Wilms Tumor (WT) patients without WT1-associated congenital
           anomalies or syndromes, but with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) unrelated to progressive
           bilateral tumors, carry germline WT1 mutations.

        -  To determine whether non-syndromic WT1 germline mutation carriers have a substantially
           higher incidence of ESRD than do WT patients who do not harbor WT1 mutations.

      OUTLINE: Archived blood and tumor tissue specimens (or DNA isolated from these samples) are
      analyzed for WT1 mutations by gene sequencing and PCR.
