      Neurapheresis therapy. The study works in tandem with the current SOC treatments for SAH and
      does not detract from the established care pathways, or deny enrolled subjects proven
      therapies. The PILLAR-XT study utilizes the established skill sets of chosen Investigators
      who are already trained in the treatment and care of SAH patients and insertion/management of
      lumbar drains.
