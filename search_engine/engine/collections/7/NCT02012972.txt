      from treatment and viral suppression as the primary outcomes. In this supplemental study, we
      will evaluate the role of NCDs and NCD risk factors on long-term retention on ART, with
      outcomes including mortality, loss to follow up, viral suppression and immunologic
      improvement, and physical functioning, ability to perform normal daily activities, and
      economic productivity among patients already on ART. The study will enroll up to 400 adult
      patients already on ART for â‰¥ 12 months at the RapIT study site. At enrollment, consented
      subjects will be screened for elevated levels of several NCD risk factors including body mass
      index; glucose using HbA1c levels; blood pressure and cholesterol; as well as signs of
      abnormalities in hepatic, renal, and lung function. A medical history will be taken, and a
      questionnaire will gather information about chronic pain, alcohol use, smoking, physical
      functioning, ability to perform normal daily activities, and economic productivity. Referral
      for further NCD diagnosis and care will be offered as needed. Existing electronic medical
      records will be accessed to obtain retrospective data since ART initiation and to follow
      subjects prospectively for up to 24 months after the enrollment screening is completed. Six
      months after enrollment, subjects with NCDs or at high risk of NCDs will be re-screened at a
      routine ART medication pickup visit to assess uptake of referral and whether risks,
      conditions, or outcomes have changed. The study will help identify reasons for poor outcomes
      on ART and point to interventions that will help achieve the overall goals of the national
      ART program.
