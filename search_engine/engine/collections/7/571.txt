influence of alloxan diabetes ongrowth hormone content of the rat hypophysishomog-enates of adenophypophysial tissue obtained from alloxan-injected adult male rats varying in duration and severity ofdiabetes, as well as from diabetic rats maintained on aninsulin replacement regimen, were assayed in immaturehypophysectomized female rats.  the ability of these crudehypophysial extracts to encourage tibial cartilage width ex-pansion gain in body weight, and to depress hematocrit andblood area levels was determined.  significant decrements inability to increase epiphysial cartilage width and ability todepress hematocrits were noted 14 to 28 days following injectionof alloxan.  increasing the intensity of the diabetic state wasassociated with decreased growth-promoting potency of hypo-physial preparations as well as with decreased ability toinfluence the hematological indices.  hypophysial extracts takenfrom insulin-treated diabetic rats contained more growthhormone than equivalent amounts of tissue obtained fromcontrol rats.  it is concluded that the adenohypophyses ofdiabetic rats contain diminished amounts of growth hormoneand the insulin repairs or encourages greater than normal ac-cumulation of somatotrophin in these animals.
