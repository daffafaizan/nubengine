      Therapy (TF-CBT) in treating child traumatic stress when implemented in community settings on
      a state-wide level in Delaware. Youth (ages 7-16 years) with a history of documented trauma
      (sexual or physical abuse, traumatic loss, domestic or community violence) and symptoms of
      Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) receive approximately 10 sessions of TF-CBT delivered in
      a state-contracted mental health agency. Children and adolescents are recruited from a public
      mental health population. PTSD symptoms and internalizing and externalizing behavior problems
      have been assessed in the first 72 participants at pre-treatment and then at 3-, 6-, 9-, and
      12-months after intake; subsequent participants (n=38) are only being assessed for symptoms
      and problems at pre-treatment and then at 3-, 6-months after intake.
