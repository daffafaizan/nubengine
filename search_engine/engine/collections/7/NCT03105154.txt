      PrevenaTM and the contralateral one dressed with conventional bandage immediately after
      suture. Both PrevenaTM and the conventional bandage at the contralateral side will be removed
      before the patient discharge. Groin wound complications such as deep space infection,
      cutaneous cellulitis, dehiscence or re-interventions for wound-related complications will be
      observed in a 30-day evaluation window. This observation will be performed during the patient
      admission and in the post-operative standard of care visits among the first 30 days.
