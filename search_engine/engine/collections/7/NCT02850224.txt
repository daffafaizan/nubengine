    
      Within this patient population, our specific aims therefore are to (1) examine current trends
      in screening and management of obesity and obesity-related conditions in a real-world urban
      practice setting; (2) examine the family (patient and parent/guardian) and clinician
      preferences for the identification and management of obesity and obesity-related conditions;
      and (3) design and conduct a Phase II pragmatic cluster randomized trial (PCRT) of an
      educational intervention in providers for guiding screening for obesity and obesity-related
      conditions during the well-child visit that incorporates and leverages PCO. Staff dedicated
      solely to this project will partner with the Henry Ford Health System's proposed
      Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Center's Cores staff members to design, execute and
      disseminate study results in order to affect clinical care. By seeking to understand the
      current screening patterns in pediatrics and by creating an education intervention for
      providers aimed at taking a patient/family centered approach to these preventative health
      screenings, we may increase PCOs which in turn may have meaningful implications for future
      adult health.
