      more effective than the conventional Right Ventricular Apex (RVA) position for restoring good
      heart function. The best site to place a lead has not yet been proven.

      This is a study comparing the long term clinical effects of two different lead positions. The
      measurements taken to assess the clinical effects include:

        -  the effectiveness of the heart's pumping action (as measured by ultrasound scans)

        -  measurements of how far patients can walk in 6 minutes

        -  analysis of blood samples

        -  collection of information from the pacemaker about heart rhythm problems

      Half of the patients in the study will receive conventional leads placed in the more common
      RVA position in the heart. The other half will receive a relatively new type of lead placed
      in what is called the Right Ventricular High Septal (RVHS) position.

      In order to fairly compare the outcomes of these two different lead positions this study has
      been designed as a 'randomized', 'blind' trial. This means that the group which patients will
      be entered into will be chosen at random and patients will not be told which group they are
      in.

      Patients will each have an equal (50:50) chance of being in either group. By carefully
      comparing the clinical differences between the two groups of patients, the study aims to
      prove whether or not there are additional benefits for patients when the RVHS lead position
      is used.

      All leads used in the study have been shown to be safe for patients and are available
      commercially for implantation. All of the implanting doctors involved in the study are
      experienced at implanting the pacemakers and leads that will be used in this study.
