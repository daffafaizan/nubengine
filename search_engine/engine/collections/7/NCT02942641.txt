      from June 2014 to May 2015. Patients under 18 years of age with a history of urinary
      retention, urinary tract infection, and poor compliance were excluded from this study. All
      the patients gave their written informed consents. The patients were randomly divided into
      two groups depending on the type of assigned intervention: CIC and indwelling urethral
      catheter groups.

      All the patients were followed up after 2 weeks; urinalysis and urine culture were obtained
      at the time of AUR and whenever the patients developed UTI-associated symptoms. The patients
      with positive urine culture at the time of AUR were excluded from the study.
