    
      AZD0424 is a potent orally available, potent (IC50 approximately 4 nM) inhibitor of Src and
      ABL1 kinases with additional activity against Src family kinase (SFK) members including Yes
      and Lck. AZD0424 was selective for SFKs and ABL1 kinase over C-terminal Src kinase (a
      negative regulator of Src) and a range of other kinase targets. The anti-cancer activity of
      AZD0424 is thought to be mediated primarily by anti-migratory and anti-invasive signalling
      and, as such, it is expected that in the late stage cancer setting strong signals of efficacy
      with this compound used as a single agent are unlikely, requiring it to be administered in
      combination with other anti-cancer agents.

      In summary the study will be performed in four main stages:

        -  AZD0424 monotherapy, dose escalation: Phase Ia single agent (AZD0424) dose escalation
           study to determine the MTD.

        -  AZD0424 monotherapy, dose expansion: Phase Ib single agent dose expansion at MTD (up to
           six additional patients may be recruited in order to provide paired tumour biopsies for
           PD analysis).

        -  Combination arm dose escalation: Provided that it is deemed appropriate (after review of
           available clinical data from the monotherapy part of the trial, and available
           preclinical and published data on the combination), a Phase Ia dose escalation arm of
           AZD0424 in combination with the selected agent will proceed to determine the MTD for the
           combination and a recommended Phase II dose.

        -  Combination arm dose expansion: Phase Ib combination arm using the recommended Phase II
           dose for both AZD0424 and the combination agent.
