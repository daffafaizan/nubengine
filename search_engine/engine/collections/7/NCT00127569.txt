      characterized by lymphadenopathy with angiofollicular hyperplasia and plasma cell
      infiltration, associated with KSHV/HHV-8. Patients typically have systemic manifestations
      such as fever associated with lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, respiratory symptoms,
      peripheral edema, cytopenia, hypergammaglobulinemia, hypoalbuminemia, and high levels of
      serum C reactive protein (CRP). Symptoms correlate with an important increase of KSHV/HHV-8
      DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. HIV-MCD is characterized by a rapidly progressive
      and often fatal course. HIV-MCD is often refractory to treatment. Vinca alkaloids produce
      frequent but short-lived responses, and most patients remain dependant upon chemotherapy.

      Lymph nodes of patients with HIV-MCD specifically harbor the virus in B cells located in the
      mantle zone, which stain positively for the CD20 surface antigen. Rituximab, a humanized
      monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody, has been reported to be effective in some cases, with
      conflicting data in other cases. The optimal schedule of infusions remains unclear.

      Kaposi's sarcoma is often associated with HIV-MCD, and the development of aggressive
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is not a rare outcome.
