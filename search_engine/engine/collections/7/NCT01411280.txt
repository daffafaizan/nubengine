      1 in 400 African American newborns annually. The pathophysiology of this group of disorders
      involves the production of abnormal hemoglobin (HbS), which causes red blood cells to assume
      a rigid, sickled shape upon release of oxygen, thereby reducing their viability in
      circulation. Consequently, chronic anemia and system-wide ischemia result in acute painful
      episodes, organ system failure, and neurological complications. Among the most debilitating
      effects of SCD are neurological complications. Despite the mounting evidence for structural
      and functional involvement of the frontal systems in pediatric SCD, there have been no
      clinical trials designed to manage the cognitive and behavioral sequelae associated with
      pediatric SCD.
