    
      Anemic or iron deficiency patients are randomized into treatment and placebo groups.
      Treatment (see below) will be given the day before the operation (day -1) or a maximum of 2
      days prior to the operation (day -2) in iron deficiency patients and a maximum of 3 days
      prior to the operation in anemic patients (day -3). The treatment will not be disclosed to
      the patient or the health care workers treating the patients during and after the operation.

      Patients without anemia or iron deficiency will also be observed and the same postoperative
      measurements performed. They will serve as a natural comparison group.
