      treatment success permanent lifestyle changes are necessary with regard to approach to food,
      physical activity patterns and behavior to emotional stress. Moreover, an association has
      been shown between sleep disturbance and obesity. Weight loss strategies regarding food
      intake regulation mainly focused on changing patterns of fat and carbohydrate consumption
      during the last decades. The role of protein has largely been ignored. However, protein has
      been observed to increase satiety and energy expenditure to a greater extent than
      carbohydrate and fat and can therefore reduce energy intake. However, it still has to be
      confirmed if this effect is permanent or transient over a longer period of time. Moreover,
      dietary intakes may significantly affect sleep when macronutrient intakes are manipulated.
      Since sleep deprivation has been recognized as a risk factor for obesity, improving sleep by
      a change in macronutrient intake would be promising in the treatment of obesity.
