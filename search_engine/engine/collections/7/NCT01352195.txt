      condition. The three conditions will include: (1) Usual care (UC), which will comprise a
      single smoking cessation booklet developed by NCI; (2) Standard Repeated Mailings (Stand-RM),
      which will be the same 8 Forever Free booklets (edited for cessation) distributed over 12
      months as in our preliminary studies; and (3) Intensive Repeated Mailings (Inten-RM), which
      will add two additional booklets to extend the intervention out to 18 months, plus additional
      monthly contacts. Assessments will occur at six-month intervals, through 30 months. An
      overview of the design is depicted in Table 4, which will be referenced throughout the
      remainder of this proposal.
