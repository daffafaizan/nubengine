      Genetic polymorphisms in drug-metabolizing enzymes, transporterss/receptors, and
      transcription factors might affect an individual s response to drug therapy.

      Inter-individual differences in efficacy and toxicity of cancer chemotherapy are especially
      important given the narrow therapeutic index of these drugs.

      During analysis of investigational agents, inter-individual variances in pharmacokinetics and
      pharmacodynamics are often noted. It is often wondered if these variances might in part be
      explained by genetic differences in drug metabolizing enzymes, transporters, or other
      criticial regulators of gene expression.

      Objectives

      To better understand the genotype-phenotype relationship, additional analysis correlating
      pharmacokinetic data with relevant genotyping.

      Eligibility

      All individuals previously enrolled on IRB approved clinical trials at the National Cancer
      Institute.

      Design

      In these retrospective studies, the association between an individual s pharmacokinetic
      profile and the genetic variation in their drug metabolizing enzymes and other critical
      regulators of gene expression will be investigated.

      The hypothesis that an individual s genotypic constitution may be associated with clinical
      response and/or toxicity will be explored.
