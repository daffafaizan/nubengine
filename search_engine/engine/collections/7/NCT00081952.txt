      therapy (HRT) is highly effective in reducing hot flashes, long-term HRT is associated with
      increased rates of breast cancer and heart disease. Safe, effective, and well-tolerated hot
      flash therapies are needed. The amino acids L-methionine and L-isoleucine have produced
      reductions in hot flash frequency. However, long-term L-methionine therapy may increase
      cardiovascular risks. This study will evaluate the short-term effects of L-isoleucine
      therapy. Data from this study will be used to conduct long-term studies in the future.

      Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to receive one of two different
      L-isoleucine doses for 2 weeks. Clinic visits will be made at baseline, Week 1, and Week 10.
      Participants will record the frequency and severity of their hot flashes in a diary.
