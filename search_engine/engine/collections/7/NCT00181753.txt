        1. Burn patients will experience an increased conversion of glutamine to glutamate and a
           decreased conversion of glutamate to glutamine as compared to healthy subjects. The net
           direction is from glutamine to glutamate in burn patients and would render glutamine as
           a conditionally essential amino acid.

        2. Because of the limited ability of liver to oxidize glutamate, it is possible that large
           doses of glutamine may cause increased gluconeogenesis in burn patients, thus
           aggravating the glucose homeostasis secondary to insulin resistance.

        3. Enterally and parenterally fed glutamine and glutamate have different metabolic fate in
           the splanchnic bed and peripheral regions, therefore the doses should be tailored
           according to the route of administration.

      This study, using stable isotope tracers, aims to track the metabolic fate of glutamine and
      glutamate in body with the goal of enhancing nutritional efficiency.
