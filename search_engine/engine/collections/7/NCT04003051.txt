      I. To determine the impact of a web-based adherence program (PREPARE) on self-reported
      swallowing function in head and neck cancer patients during radiation.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine community participant adherence to targeted swallowing and trismus exercises
      delivered by the PREPARE website video demonstrations.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To promote the long-term dissemination of the Dysphagia Prevention program through
      measurement of patient satisfaction and engagement metrics, training and continual feedback
      between the MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) research site and community collaborative
      research sites.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients use the password-protected Project Prepare website on a computer, tablet, or phone
      over 10 weeks to view: videos of the swallowing and trismus exercises, tips and stories from
      former patients, what to expect each week of treatment, recipes and cooking demonstrations,
      how to take care of their teeth during treatment, strategies for stress relief, and
      strategies for dry mouth and nausea. This website is designed to reach underserved
      populations who do not have ready access to specialized preventive care.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 6 months.
