      the remote ischemic preconditioning protocol and analyze them biochemically. The
      investigators focus on those ligands that have been previously implicated in conditioning
      protocols at any organ. In addition, the investigators will use a bioassay system, consisting
      of a Langendorff-perfused isolated heart with coronary occlusion/reperfusion and infarct size
      by TTC staining as endpoint, and then expose this bioassay system to arterial plasma obtained
      after the remote ischemic preconditioning stimulus or placebo. This approach will allow us to
      further characterize any potential transfer signal candidate with a pharmacological
      antagonist approach.

      The investigators will also obtain human atrial appendages after the remote ischemic
      preconditioning protocol or placebo and before patients were connected to the extracorporeal
      circulation. Contractile function of isolated trabeculae and vasomotor function of isolated
      arterial vessels will be analyzed in a bioassay system.
