      initial CHADIS Asthma Intervention module (CHADIS-AI), an innovative decision support system.
      CHADIS-AI content will be assembled and vetted by asthma experts and primary care providers
      (PCPs). Parent and teen focus groups will vet the content and language of the adherence
      materials and Care Portal. A system will also be established for points for patient
      participation, to give clinicians Maintenance of Certification (MOC) credit, and ongoing run
      chart reports of their patients' asthma status for continual Quality Improvement (QI)
      feedback. The resulting system will be pilot tested and refined by clinician feedback.
      Practices will be randomly assigned to intervention vs control. Control practices will use
      CHADIS for asthma care without the A-I module. Intervention practices will be further
      randomized to have remote coach support for patients or not. Outcomes will be examined of
      asthma severity/control, match of severity with guideline based medication management,
      numbers of Emergency Department (ED) visits, hospitalizations and oral steroid use. Effect of
      remote coaching will also be assessed.
