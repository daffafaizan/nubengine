    
      Hepatitis C virus (HCV) has emerged as a significant public health concern throughout the
      world. Its estimated prevalence in the US is 1.5 percent, or 2.7 million people with chronic
      infection. As many as 170 million people may have chronic HCV infection worldwide. The
      Centers for Disease control currently estimates that 40,000 HCV infections occur yearly in
      the US, with most current infection acquired through illegal injection drug use. It is
      estimated that 70 percent of those infected will develop chronic liver disease. The purpose
      of this study is to conduct a Phase I vaccine trial with a novel vaccine, HCV E1E2/MF59. The
      study objectives are to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of HCV
      E1E2/MF59 vaccine administered to healthy adult subjects and to compare the immune response
      to HCV E1E2 vaccine given at 4, 20, or 100 mcg in MF59 adjuvant. Sixty healthy adults, aged
      18-45, will be randomized to receive one of 3 different doses of vaccine or placebo. Each
      subject will receive vaccine at 0, 4, 24, and 48 weeks. Study procedures will include blood
      sample collections and questions regarding risk factors for acquiring HCV.
