      population. In Italy, around 48,000 new cases were diagnosed in 2013. Every year patients
      undergoing surgical procedures in the region of the breast and armpit, like other surgical
      areas, report a significant incidence of acute postoperative pain which in 25-60% of cases
      can progress to chronic pain and therefore it needs a timely and effective control.

      Breast surgery is associated with a high incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting
      (PONV) whose etiology is multifactorial and includes factors such as age, type of
      intervention, positive history of PONV and, primarily, the amount of morphine used to ensure
      postoperative analgesia, the type of anesthesia and the intensity of postoperative pain.

      The conventional anesthesiological approach to breast surgery involves the use of general
      anesthesia and postoperative analgesic therapy based on opiates and fans. Some techniques of
      locoregional anesthesia such as paravertebral block, thoracic peridural analgesia and
      intercostal block, associated with sedoanalgesia or general anesthesia, have joined the
      standard anesthesiological conduct helping to improve pain control, response to surgical
      stress, post-operative respiratory function, the incidence of thromboembolic events and it
      seems they can also contribute to reducing the incidence of distant metastases. In addition,
      making possible a reduced use of opiates further decrease the incidence of PONV. As part of
      this multimodal approach to anesthesia and analgesia for breast surgery, PECS Block I and II
      and the Serratus Plane Block (SPB) have recently been introduced into clinical practice.
