      risk of containing pro-inflammatory bacterial molecules, on markers of inflammation and
      cardiometabolic risk in healthy men. The study design is an interventional diet study, with 7
      days dietary advice to avoid processed foods, followed by 4 days in which lunch and evening
      meal are provided to volunteers. Anthropometric and blood markers of cardiovascular disease
      risk are measured at the start and end of each dietary phase. The aim is to gain an improved
      understanding of how processed foods modify risk of cardiometabolic disease.

      Three blood samples, each of 15 ml, will be taken on days 0, 8 and 12. Measurements at each
      timepoint include weight, waistline, serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high density
      lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, insulin, leptin, C-reactive protein and endotoxin.

      Volunteers will be requested to avoid processed foods, ready-prepared meals, foods containing
      minced meats, foods containing ready-chopped vegetables, cheese or chocolate for the first 7
      days of the study.

      For days 8 to 11, volunteers will be provided with meals, purchased from local supermarkets,
      which from previous tested were found to contain high levels of bacterial pro-inflammatory
      molecules (PAMPs).

      Diet diaries collected during the study will be combined with diet recall information to
      investigate habitual and on-study frequency of consumption of specific food groups.
