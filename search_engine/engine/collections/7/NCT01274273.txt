    
      Bevacizumab as monotherapy has effect in metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC). Bevacizumab
      in combination with interferon-alfa (IFN-α) has significant efficacy in mRCC and has been
      approved by EMA and FDA.

      The present study will assess whether the combination of Interleukin-2 (IL-2) and IFN-α with
      bevacizumab may add efficacy in patients with mRCC with a tolerable safety profile.
