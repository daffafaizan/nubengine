      (50 mL) in healthy adult volunteers. The study is a single-center, double-blind, randomized
      and placebo-controlled design. The primary objective is to assess safety of intravenously
      (IV) administered ZIKV-IG, while the secondary objective is to determine the PK profile of
      ZIKV-IG in healthy adult volunteers.

      There will be a total of 30 subjects enrolled into the study; dosing of the first six
      subjects will be staggered over three separate days, wherein two subjects per day will be
      randomized 1:1 to either receive 50 mL of placebo IV or 50 mL of ZIKV-IG IV (the total amount
      of gamma immune globulin [IgG] protein from a single 50mL dose is 4.65g). After the first six
      subjects are dosed, the remaining 24 subjects will be randomized 2:1 to receive either
      ZIKV-IG or placebo. A safety monitoring committee will review safety data (collected up to 3
      days post-dosing) of the first 12 dosed subjects prior to dosing of the remaining 18
      subjects. Overall, there will be 19 subjects randomized to receive ZIKV-IG and 11 subjects
      randomized to receive placebo on Day 1. On Day 1 (post-dose at 1 hour, 3 hours, 8 hours) and
      Day 2, safety and PK assessments will be conducted while the subjects are in the Phase 1
      clinic. After the discharge on Day 2, the subjects will come back to the clinic for safety
      and PK assessments on Days 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 22, 29, 43, 57 and 85. Total study
      duration for each subject will be up to 4 months (from screening to Day 85).
