      skipping mutation pre-treated or not with MET inhibitors. Elegible NSCLC patients with MET
      exon 14 skipping mutations or MET amplification will be treated with open label orally
      cabozantinib 60 mg/daily, cycles each 28 days. Disease evaluation will be performed every two
      months (8 weeks). Patients will be treated with cabozantinib until disease progression,
      unacceptable toxicity or patient refusal.Treatment will be continued until disease
      progression, unacceptable toxicity or patient refusal. Treatment beyond disease progression
      is allowed if considered appropriate by the investigator.
