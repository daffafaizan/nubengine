      in women of African American descent. The etiology is not completely understood, but CCCA
      likely results from a combination of hair-grooming practices, a pro-inflammatory state within
      the hair follicles, and genetic factors. The management of CCCA remains a challenge as there
      are no published treatment guidelines. Current therapies aim to decrease inflammation in
      order to prevent further hair loss.

      Apremilast, an oral phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor, has been shown to be effective in the
      treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthropathy. In vitro studies
      have demonstrated anti-inflammatory properties via inhibition of inflammatory mediators.
      Therefore, apremilast offers a possible therapeutic option for CCCA. This will be a
      single-center, open-label clinical study to determine the efficacy of apremilast in the
      treatment of mild to moderate central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia.
