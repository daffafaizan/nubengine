      Primary

        -  Determine the feasibility and toxicity of haploidentical related donor lymphocyte
           infusions (DLI) and interleukin-2, in terms of acute graft-versus-host-disease, graft
           failure, and transplant-related mortality, in patients with relapsed advanced lymphoid
           malignancies undergoing autologous stem cell transplantation.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the extent, degree, and duration of donor chimerism in patients treated with
           this regimen.

        -  Determine, preliminarily, activity of haploidentical DLI, as measured by complete
           response rate, in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.

      Patients receive high-dose melphalan IV over 15-60 minutes on day -2 and undergo autologous
      stem cell transplantation on day 0. Patients receive haploidentical related donor lymphocyte
      infusions (DLI) IV on days 1, 5*, and 10* and interleukin-2 (IL-2) IV continuously on days
      1-12.

      NOTE: *DLI are not administered on days 5 or 10 if grade 3 or 4 graft-versus-host disease is
      present

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed monthly for 3 months and then
      every 3-12 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study.
