      study, designed to generate hypotheses to better understand the MoA of cladribine tablets in
      RMS (to include RRMS or active secondary progressive MS). The study is designed to generate
      hypotheses regarding the impact and relevance of cladribine tablet activity in the CNS by
      assessing the cerebrospinal (CSF) levels of lymphocyte subsets, other immune cells, neuronal
      injury markers and soluble immunological markers in study participants with RMS before and
      during treatment with cladribine tablets, and the association of these CSF markers with
      corresponding blood markers and with clinical outcomes.
