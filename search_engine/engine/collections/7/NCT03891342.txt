      surgery under general anesthesia.

      Hypothesis to be tested: Administration of 500 ml of balanced solution as a bolus impairs GCX
      more than prolonged administration.

      The aim of the study: Comparison of two regimes of fluid challenge in patients with sepsis
      and in patients undergoing elective major surgery.

      Type of the study: Open, randomized, interventional.

      Subjects:

      Part A: Patients with sepsis within 48 hours before admission to ICU requiring fluid
      challenge based on clinical or echocardiographic assessment.

      Part B: Patients during major elective surgery requiring fluid challenge based on clinical or
      echocardiographic assessment.

      Sample size calculation (based on expected difference in PRB, alpha error I =0,05 and study
      power = 0,99) = 52 patients. Investigators plan enrolment of 60 patients for each part,
      totally 120 patients.

      Intervention:

        -  500 ml of balanced crystalloid solution within 5 minutes (group "fast")

        -  500 ml of balanced crystalloid solution within 30 minutes (group "slow") Data to be
           recorded and analysed: Demographics, severity score, fluid response assessment,
           sublingual microcirculation by SDF imaging will be recorded at time points: baseline,
           after intervention, after 60 minutes, after 120 minutes, plasma syndecan-1 will be
           analysed before intervention and 120 minutes thereafter, microcirculatory data and
           Perfused Boundary Region.
