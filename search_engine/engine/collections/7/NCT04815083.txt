      cosmesis, complications, discomfort, stress, adjuvant delay, medical costs and risk of local
      recurrence. Reducing positive margin rates can be achieved through optimizing surgical
      procedures. This study evaluates a new method for surgeons to visualize carcinoma in
      real-time, both in the surgical cavity and on the margins of excised specimen(s) during the
      index BCS procedure.

      The active ingredient of PD G 506A is aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride (ALA HCl). ALA HCl is
      a prodrug that is metabolized intracellularly to form the fluorescent molecule protoporphyrin
      IX (PpIX). The exogenous application of ALA HCl leads to a highly selective accumulation of
      PpIX in malignant tissues.

      This Phase 3, 2-part, single-blind [pathologist(s)-blinded] randomized placebo-controlled
      trial study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PD G 506 A to aid in the
      visualization of carcinoma during BCS. The Eagle V1.2 Imaging System will be used in this
      trial to visualize PpIX fluorescence.

      Part A is an open-label training phase of the study to optimize workflow and Part B of the
      study is randomized and single-blind and will serve as the pivotal portion of the study.
