    
      The purpose of this protocol is to study patients with primary immunodeficiency disorders
      with the goal of contributing to both the clinical and molecular understanding of this
      heterogeneous group of inherited diseases. Clinical issues to be addressed will include
      disease manifestations and evolution, as well prevention and management of medical problems.
      Patients with diseases of known molecular basis (including Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, ADA
      deficiency, JAK3 deficiency and other syndromes) will be genotyped in order to investigate
      phenotype-genotype correlation. Patients with disease of unknown or incomplete genetic
      characterization will be studied with hopes of contributing to the identification of specific
      genes responsible for disease. Studies of fresh cells, cell lines and tissue samples will be
      performed to help characterize the patient s syndrome as well as to test the efficacy of
      genetic correction when available.

      The outcome we seek is to improve our knowledge of the molecular basis, clinical presentation
      and evolution of primary immunodeficiency diseases and to collaborate to maintain or improve
      the health status of our patients. No investigational clinical interventions are planned
      under this protocol. It is anticipated that additional protocols will be generated from
      preliminary data gathered in this umbrella study.
