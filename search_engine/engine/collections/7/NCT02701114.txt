      block within the adductor canal has a substantial impact on pain following total knee
      arthroplasty. Our primary outcome to determine this difference will be opioid consumption
      within the first day following surgery. Secondary outcomes will include: pain scores,
      quadriceps strength, and distance ambulated during physical therapy.
