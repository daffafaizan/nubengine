      HIFU system for the treatment of painful metastases (palliative intent) and osteoid osteoma
      (curative intent).

      HIFU is classically delivered by a transducer integrated in the MRI table. This study
      assesses a new type of approach in which the HIFU transducer is manually placed on the skin
      of the patient and held in place by MR-compatible passive arms. Optical infrared navigation
      is used to help the physician with the positioning of the HIFU transducer.

      The primary goal of this study is to assess the feasibility of heating the tumor accurately
      with this new HIFU system. The evaluation and control of the treatment will be performed by
      Proton Resonance Frequency Shift (PRFS) MR thermometry.

      Secondary endpoints include the evaluation of clinical efficacy, quality of life and safety.

      Clinical efficacy is defined:

        -  in palliative intent by a decrease â‰¤3 on visual analogic scale

        -  in curative intent (osteoid osteoma) by a total disappearance of pain Quality of life is
           assessed by EORTC quality of life questionnaire-core 30 items Complications are recorded
           to assess safety.
