      Chi Lob 7/4. In line with other established antineoplastic, chimeric monoclonal antibody
      therapies such as Rituximab, Chi Lob 7/4 will be given by slow intravenous infusion once
      every week for a total of four weeks. This treatment regimen will facilitate early, rapid and
      dose dense administration of antibody to a patient group with advanced malignancy refractory
      to conventional treatment. The starting dose for each infusion of Chi Lob 7/4 will be 0.5mg
      (giving a total dose per patient of 2mg divided over 4 weeks). Escalation from one treatment
      dose level to another will only be permitted when at least 3 patients have completed
      treatment without dose limiting toxicity.
