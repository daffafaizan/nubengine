    
      This will be a randomized, placebo-and comparator-controlled, double-blind, multiple dose
      study with JNJ-54175446 in healthy male participants. The study will consist of a Screening
      examination (28 to 6 days prior to dose administration), a baseline 20 mg amphetamine (AMPH)
      challenge at least 5 days before first dose administration, a double-blind treatment period
      (18 days; 11 days of dosing with JNJ-54175446, minocycline or placebo; amphetamine
      (AMPH)/AMPH placebo challenge sequence on Day 7 and Day 10 for each participant), and a
      follow-up examination between 14 and 21 days after last dose administration. The maximal
      study duration for each participant will not exceed 9 weeks. Safety, pharmacokinetics (PK)
      and pharmacodynamics of JNJ-54175446 will be primarily assessed. Safety will be monitored
      throughout the study.
