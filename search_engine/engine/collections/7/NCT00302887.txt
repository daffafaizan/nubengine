      of physiotherapy applications in 20 female patients with fibromyalgia. Physical
      characteristics of the subjects were recorded. Intensity of pain, complaint of
      non-restorative sleep, and impact of fibromyalgia on functional activities were evaluated by
      visual analogue scales. All evaluations were performed before and after 20 sessions of
      treatment, which included connective tissue manipulation of the back daily, for a total of 20
      sessions and combined ultrasound therapy of the upper back region every other session. One
      year follow-up evaluations could be performed on 14 subjects.
