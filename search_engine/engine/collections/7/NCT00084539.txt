      Primary

        -  Determine the toxicity associated with adjuvant hypofractionated intensity-modulated
           radiotherapy using an incorporated boost in patients with early-stage breast cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the long-term cosmetic result and quality of life of patients treated with
           this regimen.

        -  Determine the long-term local control in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo adjuvant hypofractionated intensity-modulated radiotherapy with
      incorporated boost once daily 5 days a week for 4 weeks.

      Quality of life is assessed within 1 month of starting radiotherapy, at 6 weeks after
      completion of radiotherapy, and then every 6 months for 5 years.

      Patients are followed at 6 weeks and then every six months for 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 37-74 patients will be accrued for this study.
