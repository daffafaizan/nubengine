    
      Stage 1 is designed as standard phase 1 study with one arm and sequential dose cohorts with
      ascending doses. Each patient in each dose cohort will be administered TAB08 several times.
      After last TAB08 administration each patient will undergo investigational-treatment-free
      follow-up period.

      At Stage 2 at least one TAB08 dose, selected during Stage 1 will be studied during longer
      timeframe in extended patient population.
