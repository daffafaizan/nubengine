    
      The specific aims of this proposed study include the following:

        -  Evaluate the reduction or delay of mucositis related pain and morbidity with the use of
           gabapentin in patients with stage III or IV oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma
           undergoing definitive radiation with concurrent chemotherapy as part of their cancer
           management, compared to standard supportive side effect mitigation - using patient
           reported quality of life endpoints such as the Patient-Reported Oral Mucositis Symptoms
           (PROMS) scale.

        -  Assess morphine-equivalent opioid use in both treatment arms by collecting the patient's
           narcotic use in the previous 24-hour period at each weekly evaluation during radiation
           treatment.

        -  Report on change in Speech and swallow performance, as measured by the Performance
           Status Scale (PSS) for Head and Neck Cancer Patients

        -  Evaluate changes in weight from baseline throughout treatment between the two arms.

        -  Assess feeding tube requirements during treatment.

        -  Evaluate the adverse events associated with gabapentin.

        -  Evaluate the severity of radiation mucositis (grade 3-4, CTCAE, v. 4)
