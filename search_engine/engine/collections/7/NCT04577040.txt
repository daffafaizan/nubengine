    
      Introduction Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a common cause of lower urinary tract
      symptoms (LUTS) in middle-aged and elderly men, and the incidence rate of LUTS associated
      with BPH (LUTS/BPH) increases with age.

      LUTS can be broadly grouped into: (i) storage symptoms, such as frequency, urgency, and
      nocturia (ii) voiding symptoms, such as intermittency, weak stream and straining, and (iii)
      post-micturition symptoms, such as a feeling of incomplete emptying and post micturition
      dribble.

      For optimal management of LUTS/BPH, medications should be chosen based on age, disease
      progression, need for long-term management, and other clinical parameters.

      Alpha 1 adreno-receptors antagonists (alpha 1 blockers) are proposed as first-line drug
      therapy for LUTS/BPH as these agents reduce the adrenergic tone of the smooth muscle within
      the prostate and bladder neck, thereby relieving the bladder outlet obstruction.

      Tadalafil (phosphodiesterase type 5 [PDE-5] inhibitor) was approved for treating LUTS/BPH.
      The inhibition of PDE-5leads to accumulation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate in the smooth
      muscles of the prostate and urethra which causes their relaxation resulting in alleviation of
      the symptoms of LUTS/BPH.
