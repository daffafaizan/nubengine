      relevant health information and a platform for managing the complex health care needs
      associated with undergoing transitional care.

      Aims: To evaluate the long-term effectiveness of the Care & Organize Our Lifestyle (COOL)
      program, a self-regulation theory-based mHealth program, on improving disease knowledge and
      physical activity in youth with CHD.

      Methods: The COOL program is a 12-month randomized controlled trial that compared two active
      intervention groups to a standard-care control group (n = 47). Participants with simple and
      moderate CHD aged 15-24 years were recruited from pediatric or adult CHD outpatient
      departments. Participants in one active intervention group (n = 49) were provided with COOL
      Passport, a mobile healthcare application. Those in the other group (n = 47) were provided
      with access to the Health Promotion Cloud system and use of game-based interactive platforms
      along with COOL Passport. Outcomes were the Leuven Knowledge Questionnaire for CHD and the
      International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Taiwan Show-Card Version.
