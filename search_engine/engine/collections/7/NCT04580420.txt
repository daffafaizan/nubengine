    
      This is an open-label, repeat-dose, Phase 2 study of DCR-PHXC in participants with PH1 or PH2
      and severe renal impairment, with or without dialysis.

      Following the up-to-35- day screening period, participants will return to the clinic for
      monthly dosing visits through Day 180. Participants successfully completing the Day 180 visit
      will continue on to an extended follow-up period and receive open-label DCR-PHXC for an
      additional 3 years, or until DCR-PHXC is commercially available, whichever comes first. As
      participants in this extended treatment period will return to the clinic only every 3 months,
      participants and/or their caregivers will be trained in the at-home administration of
      DCR-PHXC.

      The total duration of the study is approximately 2 years from first participant, first visit,
      to last participant, last Day 180 visit, with up to an additional 3 years of extended
      follow-up.
