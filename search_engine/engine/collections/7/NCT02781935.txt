      incidence of DLMs. It is hypothesized that DW-MRI imaging could distinguish between a
      metastasis not completely sterilized by conversion therapy and a sterilized scar (non-viable
      tumor). If this can be demonstrated, the use of DW-MRI could make a significant impact on the
      surgical decision making process by providing surgeons a more reliable guide to decide
      whether to leave behind or to resect/ablate a site of DLM. Most importantly, this surgical
      choice can also have a significant impact on patient outcomes as it may impact the risk of
      local recurrence and the need for re-operation.The possibility of improving surgical
      management of complex CRLM is foreseen if the benefit of observing or resecting small
      residual metastases and DLMs is clarified through a multi-center and international
      prospective study.
