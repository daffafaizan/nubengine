      syndrome (IBS) which receive "Alflorex bei Reizdarm", a probiotic based on Bifidobacterium
      longum 35624, for 8 weeks by recommendation of their physician. IBS symptoms are recorded on
      a weekly basis by the participants. IBS severity score, interference with general life and
      safety parameters are also recorded. Primary objective is the assessment of the change in
      overall IBS symptoms (sum of abdominal pain, bloating, gas, difficulty in
      defecating/constipation and urgency/diarrhoea).
