      patient is unresponsive und unconscious (BIS 40-60) and a steady state is achieved, a
      standardized painful stimulus is applied by electrical stimulation of the ulnar nerve
      (tetanic stimulation [70 mA], 30 seconds, 50 Hz) in group 1. Thereafter remifentanil is
      infused to an effect compartment concentration target of 1 ng/ml. The standardized stimulus
      is applied again as the remifentanil target is reached. This procedure is repeated with
      remifentanil targets of 2 ng/ml and 3ng/ml. In group 2 remifentanil is targeted to effect
      compartment concentrations of 3 ng/ml followed by 2,1, and 0 ng/ml.

      After measuring the effect of the last painful stimulus the patient is intubated for surgery.
      Throughout the study the Composite Variability Index and standard monitoring is recorded.
