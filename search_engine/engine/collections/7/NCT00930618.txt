      mononitrate given intravaginally at 41+0, 41+2 and 41+4 weeks reduce cesarean section in
      nullipara with post term pregnancies. Treatments will be administered by midwifes in the
      maternity wards, women will be allowed to go back home in case of Bishop score<6. Otherwise
      labor will be induced with oxytocin. If undelivered at 41+5, women with Bishop score<6 will
      be induced with prostaglandins according to local protocols.
