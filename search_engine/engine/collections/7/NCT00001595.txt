    
      There are a variety of tumors affecting the pituitary gland and hypothalamus; the gene(s)
      involved in the pathogenesis of these tumors are largely not known; their possible
      association with other developmental defects or inheritance pattern(s) has not been
      investigated. The present study serves as a (i) screening, and, (ii) an observational
      research protocol.

      As a screening study, this protocol allows our Institute to admit patients with tumors of the
      hypothalamic-pituitary unit to the clinics and wards of the NIH Clinical Center for the
      purposes of determining eligibility for CC protocols.

      As an observational research study, this protocol aims at:

      Developing new clinical studies for the recognition and therapy of pituitary tumors; as an
      example, a new study had emerged within the context of this protocol: investigation of the
      psychological effects of cortisol secretion in pediatric (only) patients with Cushing
      disease, and (c) to study (longitudinally) whether CS in pediatric patients is also
      associated with a hypercoagulable state. Continuation of this protocol will eventually lead
      to new, separate protocols that will address all aspects of diagnosis of pituitary tumors and
      their therapy in childhood.

      Identifying the genetic components of pituitary oncogenesis; those will be investigated by
      (a) studying the inheritance pattern of pituitary tumors in childhood and their possible
      association with other conditions in the families of the patients, collecting tumor tissues
      and examining their molecular genetics, and using whole exome/genome sequencing (WE/GS) and
      related techniques in identifying genetic predisposition or causative factors.

      As with clinical studies, the present protocol may help generate ideas for future studies on
      the treatment and clinical follow up of patients with tumors of the pituitary gland and,
      thus, lead to the development of better therapeutic regimens for these neoplasms
