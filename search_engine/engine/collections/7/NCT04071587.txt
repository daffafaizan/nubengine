      will be included. Patients with severe hemiparesis after stroke will be allocated to one of
      two treatment groups by a computerized randomization program. Patients in the intervention
      group will receive training with a BCI system paired with functional electrical stimulation
      and visual feedback (RecoveriX, gtec, Austria) as part of their rehabilitation. The targeted
      number of training sessions in the intervention group is 12. Patients in the control group
      will receive conventional upper limb training. All patients will receive other rehabilitation
      according to their needs.

      Patients will be assessed by blinded raters before and after the intervention and 3 months
      post stroke. Main endpoint will be UL motor function assessed by Action Research Arm Test
      (ARAT) at 3 months post stroke. Other outcome measures comprise Fugl Meyer Motor Assessment
      and Functional Independence Measure. The patients and therapists' experience with this type
      of training will be evaluated with questionnaires and interviews.
