      after Caesarean section for pain relief. Codeine was originally considered safe to use while
      breastfeeding however, increased risk of adverse drug reactions has been demonstrated in
      mothers taking codeine, as well as their breastfed infants, when the mother possesses a
      genetic variation resulting in cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) ultra-rapid metabolizer (UM)
      phenotype. On average, most people convert about 10-15% of their codeine dose to morphine
      resulting in pain relief however, UM individuals can convert up to 50% of their codeine doses
      into active morphine. As many as 4% of North Americans may be UMs and these mothers and their
      breastfed infants are at high risk of serious adverse events despite "safe" codeine dosing
      due to morphine overproduction and accumulation in the mother and her breast milk. Observed
      side effects include severe sedation, decreased rate and depth of breathing and even infant
      death. In response to this problem, our hospital-based clinical trial strives to identify
      at-risk UM mother-infant pairs by performing a genetic test on non-invasive, voluntary saliva
      samples from mothers giving birth by Caesarean section and who will need codeine for pain
      relief while breastfeeding. We believe that this test will allow us to reliably identify
      at-risk UM mother-infant pairs and prevent adverse drug reactions in both by tailoring
      analgesic therapy to their genetic results: mothers identified as being UMs will be given
      other suitable analgesics, such as ibuprofen, in place of codeine-containing preparations. We
      propose that this prospective study will generate high-level data supporting the
      cost-effective genetic screening of mothers who will be taking codeine while breastfeeding
      before they begin taking their medications. Such testing is currently possible on a
      nation-wide scale through collaboration with the Canadian Pharmacogenomics Network for Drug
      Safety (CPNDS).
