      mechanisms involved in the process have not yet been found. Recently, it has been established
      that remodeling can be observed in children prior to a formal diagnosis of asthma. Clinical
      studies indicate that HRV, "common cold" infections, are a common cause of recurrent
      respiratory illnesses in childhood, and children with HRV-associated wheezing episodes have
      an increased risk of developing asthma. This led to the hypothesis that HRV infections may
      play a central role in the start of the airway remodeling leading to asthma.

      The goal of this study is to determine if alterations in relevant airway remodeling growth
      factors differ between healthy controls and asthmatic subjects, pre- and post-HRV infection.
      These growth factors will be assessed in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and endobronchial
      biopsy tissues and correlated with viral levels in both nasal lavage and BAL fluid.
