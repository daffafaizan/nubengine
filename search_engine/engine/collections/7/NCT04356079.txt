      primarily involved in disease causation. The mode of transmission of typical migraine in
      families is still unclear, but it is widely believed to be multifactorial although a role for
      a major susceptibility gene cannot be excluded. Aim of study: we aim to study the familial
      risk for developed migraine and its relation to EEG changes.
