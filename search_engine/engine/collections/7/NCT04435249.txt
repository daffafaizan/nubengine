      efficacy of a novel tissue engineered airway product, consisting of expanded autologous Bone
      Marrow (BM) derived Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSC) seeded on to a decellularised allogeneic
      patch of an airway scaffold in subjects with clinically significant bronchopleural fistula.
      It is a phase I/II open-label study, which is an uncontrolled pilot in 5 subjects.
