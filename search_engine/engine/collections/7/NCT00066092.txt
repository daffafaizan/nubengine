      will receive high-dose chemotherapy with autologous peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC or PBPC)
      transplant. The chemotherapy doses are high enough to severely suppress the bone marrow
      (where blood cells are made) and cause very low blood counts. A collection of stem cells
      (very young blood cells) followed by reinfusion to restore blood counts will be done to
      stimulate recovery of your blood counts. This procedure is called leukapheresis. Giving
      growth factors to patients is a method to increase the number of PBPC that can be collected
      during leukapheresis. This process of giving growth factors to patients is called
      mobilization (moving cells from the bone marrow to the peripheral blood where they can be
      collected). The purpose of this study is to determine if pegfilgrastim, an investigational
      drug, can safely and effectively mobilize stem cells. Filgrastim (also known as NEUPOGENÂ® or
      G-CSF) is approved by the FDA for stem cell mobilization. Pegfilgrastim is a modified version
      of Filgrastim that is longer acting.
