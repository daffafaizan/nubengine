      defined as a deficiency or an excess of energy, is associated with an increased risk of
      comorbidities, reduced survival rates, higher relapse rates, and worse treatment response.

      The present retrospective study assessed the nutritional status of children and adolescents,
      suffering from nine different kinds of cancer, based on BMI percentiles and standard
      deviation scores. Anthropometric data were recorded from clinical charts and an assessment of
      the nutritional status was made at the beginning of treatment, during the course of therapy
      and during a follow-up period of two years. The influence of treatment-related
      characteristics, the duration of therapy, and the occurrence of a relapse or progress during
      therapy on the nutritional status were examined.
