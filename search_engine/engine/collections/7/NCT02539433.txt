    
      Background: Pre surgical conventional imaging of neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) with CT, MRI,
      In-111 octreotide or 1-123-MIBG (metaiodobenzylguanidine) scintigraphy has limitations. This
      pilot study tried to improve the localization of these tumors with F-18-F-DOPA PET scanning.

      Methods: The investigators studied 22 patients, the majority referred with clinical diagnosis
      of carcinoid (9) or NETs (9) and a few with pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma (3). Carbidopa was
      administered prior to the F-DOPA injection in 12 patients. Comparison was made with prior
      conventional imaging. The F-DOPA findings, read blindly to the findings of other modalities,
      were compared with results of subsequent surgery (2), endoscopy (1), or a long-term follow up
      of mean duration of 49 months (for 20 patients). Two subjects were lost to follow-up.
