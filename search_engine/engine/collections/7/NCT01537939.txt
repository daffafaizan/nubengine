      Institutet (KI) in Stockholm, Sweden and Arizona State University (ASU) in the greater
      Phoenix area, Arizona. ASUKI Step used a quasi-experimental design based on the theory of
      social support. Participants included 2,118 faculty, staff, and graduate students from ASU (n
      = 712) and KI (n = 1,406) who participated in teams of 3-4 persons. The intervention required
      participants to accumulate 10,000 steps each day for six months, with a 3-month follow-up
      period. Steps were recorded onto a study-specific website. Participants completed a
      website-delivered questionnaire four times to identify socio-demographic, health,
      psychosocial and environmental correlates of study participation. One person from each team
      at each university location was randomly selected to complete physical fitness testing to
      determine their anthropometric and cardiovascular health and to wear an accelerometer for one
      week. Incentives were given for compliance to the study protocol that included weekly raffles
      for participation prizes and a grand finale trip to Arizona or Sweden for teams with most
      days over 10,000 steps.
