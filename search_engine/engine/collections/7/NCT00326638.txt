      yielding comparable long-term outcomes to surgery. Unfortunately, long term disease free
      survival data using PSA criteria have shown that less than 50% of high-risk patients are free
      of disease at 10 years. To improve on the results of conventional dose radiotherapy dose
      escalation with three-dimensional conformal radiation has been employed. Due to the irregular
      shape of the prostate and the variable motion of this organ there is substantial radiation of
      adjacent normal surrounding tissue during treatment which results in radiation-induced
      toxicity. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is a new form of radiation therapy.
      Preliminary evidence suggests that IMRT improves the dose distribution during radiation
      therapy of the prostate. The hypothesis of this study is that IMRT delivered using Helical
      Tomotherapy can reduce late toxicity of radical radiotherapy as compared to three-dimensional
      conformal radiation (3DCRT) in high-risk prostate cancer patients.
