    
      The patient population in this Phase II clinical trial will be patients with newly diagnosed
      high-grade glioma undergoing initial surgery. Patients will receive Surgery + GliadelÂ® wafer
      implantation + Limited Field Radiation Therapy with concomitant daily temozolomide (75 mg/m2)
      followed by monthly temozolomide given at the same dose (75 mg/m2 per day for 21 days each
      month.

      Patients will have up to 8 wafers implanted into the tumor resection cavity (depending upon
      its size) after maximal tumor resection. Between Study Days 14 and 45 all patients will begin
      a standard course of post-operative limited field radiation therapy to the tumor site and a
      surrounding margin. Temozolomide will be administered concomitantly with radiation at a daily
      dose of 75 mg/m2 daily (7 days/week) and then beginning no later than 30 days following
      completion of radiation therapy on a 75 mg/m2 daily dose given 21 days out of each month for
      a total of up to 18 cycles.
