      beliefs, affect, vaccine discussions, decision preparedness, and vaccine intentions and
      behaviors among those ages 18-45, while examining potential differences in responses between
      those ages 18-26 and those ages 27-45 and vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. In
      addition, the study will illuminate gaps in knowledge and awareness as well as the education
      intervention preferences (e.g., intervention platform, source of information, timing of
      intervention) of individuals ages 18-45. Among those ages 27-45, shared clinical
      decision-making is recommended. Compared to individuals ages 18-26, individuals ages 27-45
      may need to be supported uniquely so that they are prepared to engage in shared clinical
      decision-making about HPV vaccination with their healthcare provider. Thus, among
      unvaccinated individuals ages 27-45, for whom shared clinical decision-making is recommended,
      preparedness for engagement in shared clinical decision-making will be assessed and explored.
      The study also will allow investigators to identify how best to target information to young
      adults and mid-adults both for themselves, and among those with children, for their children.
