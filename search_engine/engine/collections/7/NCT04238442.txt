      Study methodology will follow the ISO protocol:

        -  85 adult (age 18 years or greater) subjects will be included (it is estimated that
           approximately 140 subjects will need to be screened as some will be ineligible). 85 is
           the recommended sample size for validation studies using the ISO protocol.

        -  Subjects will be recruited via an existing registry of over 250 individuals that have
           participated in past measurement studies, through advertisements, and from the
           University of Alberta Hypertension Clinic.

        -  Specific requirements for a certain percentage of subjects with specific age, sex, upper
           arm circumference, and baseline blood pressure levels will be observed to ensure that a
           representative sample is studied (according to the ISO standards).

        -  Subjects that are pregnant or with atrial fibrillation will be excluded. Blood pressure
           measurements will be taken using recommended, optimal technique.

        -  Nine measurements will be taken in each subject, alternating between blinded
           two-observer auscultation with a mercury-based sphygmomanometer (the reference standard)
           and the TM-2657. Careful attention will be paid to ensuring proper cuffing. The first
           two measurements will be discarded and the latter seven measurements (4 auscultatory and
           TM-2657 measurements) will be used in the analysis, which will be conducted according to
           ISO standards.

        -  Accuracy will be assessed according to Criterion 1 and 2 of the ISO standard.
           Bland-Altman plots will be generated. A plot of measurement error versus arm
           circumference will be generated as well.
