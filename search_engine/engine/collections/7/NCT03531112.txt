      (N=40) in North Carolina. Forty overweight and obese (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m²) community-based Black
      women will be randomized to the AAT intervention or wait-list control (who will eventually
      receive the intervention). AAT participants will meet weekly for 8 weeks, followed by a
      4-month period of daily weighing and weekly tailored feedback only. The study will examine
      the following: recruitment feasibility, attendance/retention, adherence, satisfaction, and
      barriers to completion.

      Aim 2: At 4 and 6 months, compare changes in (a) binge eating, eating self-efficacy, and
      depressive symptoms and (b) weight, blood pressure, and waist circumference for participants
      in the intervention vs. control group.

      H_1: Participants in the AAT intervention will report less binge and overeating and gain less
      weight than those in the control group at 2 and 6 months.

      Secondary aim: Examine characteristics (e.g., baseline BMI, severity of binge eating,
      frequency of self-weighing) related to change in binge eating and weight.
