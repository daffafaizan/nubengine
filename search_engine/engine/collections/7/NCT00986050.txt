      is the treatment of choice.

      The recommendation for routine stenting in PCI is based on 4 studies that have demonstrated
      the usefulness of bare metal stents in patients with STEMI. However this recommendation
      cannot be extrapolated (yet) to the use of drug eluting stents. Although DES have been used
      widely in unstable angina and in acute myocardial infarction, to date there are no
      evidence-based recommendations to support the routine use of DES in STEMI.

      GPI have been studied extensively in patients with non-STsegment elevation myocardial
      infarctions (NSTEMI) with planned or performed PCI. In STEMI tirofiban and and eptifibatide
      are less well investigated, and only abciximab is recommended in primary PCI, but the long
      term benefits require more investigation. In PCI randomized controlled clinical trials
      (RCT's) abciximab consistently showed a significant reduction in the rate of myocardial
      infarction and the need for urgent revascularization. Abciximab has been evaluated in 5 RCT's
      in association with primary PCI. The pooled analysis for the clinical outcome at 30 days,
      demonstrate a significant reduction of death, re- infarction and target vessel
      revascularization (TVR), mainly due to a reduction of repeat intervention. The long-term
      benefits require more investigation.

      The DEBATER trial is designed to answer the questions about the need for abciximab and about
      the use of DES in primary PCI.
