      presumed sarcoid uveitis. We plan to test conjunctival and lacrimal gland biopsy specimens
      from three groups of patients: patients with known, biopsy proven sarcoidosis, patients with
      suspected sarcoidosis, and patients with uveitis of an etiology other than sarcoidosis.
      Specimens will be tested for presence of cytokines, cell surface markers, and specific T cell
      receptor gene elements with immunohistochemical techniques using monoclonal antibodies. It
      has been shown that the diagnostic value of conjunctival and lacrimal gland biopsy looking
      for the presence of non-caseating granuloma in the absence of discrete nodules is low.
      Assaying for cytokines, cell surface markers, and specific T cell receptor gene elements may
      provide a more sensitive and specific diagnostic test for sarcoidosis in patients with
      presumed sarcoid eye disease.
