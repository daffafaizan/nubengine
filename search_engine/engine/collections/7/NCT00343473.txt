      diseases of the eye. OCT may be useful for the early diagnosis and monitoring of a variety of
      diseases involving the eye, such as Fuch's Dystrophy (type of eye disease) and retinal damage
      (eye diseases in the back of the eye) due to diabetes. OCT may also be useful for assessing
      contact lens and surgical procedures, such as LASIK (type of ophthalmic surgical procedure).
      The OCT is Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved. The ultra high OCT is a
      non-significant risk device (it does not present a possible serious risk to your health, your
      safety, or your welfare) that has not been approved by the FDA. This study will also be
      conducted at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Tufts-New England Medical Center
      New England Eye Center in Massachusetts
