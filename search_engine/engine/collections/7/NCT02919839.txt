      set up the infrastructure for research that will facilitate, for the first time, the use of
      big-data, machine-learning approaches in the application of personalized medicine methods in
      the management of type 1 diabetes mellitus. We will model the clinical, microbial, and
      nutritional factors underlying the variability in glycemic response to food in this
      population; develop algorithms for prediction of this response and for the accurate
      administration of insulin, assisting the clinical management of the disease and discover
      intervention targets in the gut microbiome aimed at improving glycemic control.
