      Substudy A - Phase 2: A Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, substudy to assess the safety,
      tolerability, and efficacy of oral etrasimod therapy in participants with moderate to severe
      CD that supports the selection of an induction and maintenance dose(s) for Phase 3.

      Substudy 1 - Phase 2: A Phase 2b randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging
      induction substudy to evaluate etrasimod as induction therapy and select an induction and
      maintenance dose(s) for continued evaluation in Phase 3.

      Substudy 2 - Induction: A Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled substudy to
      evaluate etrasimod as induction therapy.

      Substudy 3 - Maintenance: A Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled substudy to
      evaluate etrasimod as maintenance therapy. Participants from Substudy 1 and Substudy 2 will
      be enrolled in Substudy 3.

      Substudy 4 - Long-Term Extension: A long-term extension substudy for participants who
      complete at least 52 weeks of treatment. Participants from Substudy 3 and Substudy A are
