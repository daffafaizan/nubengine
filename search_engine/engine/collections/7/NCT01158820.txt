      performed with sedation. All procedural sedation carries some risk. Several features of the
      study may lower the risk of sedation relative to that of conventional sedation. An
      anesthesiologist will be present throughout the procedure. Continuous monitoring of
      respiration with RIP will be employed. Administration of sedation will be via a volumetric
      syringe pump. Benefits specific to dexmedetomidine-ketamine include the lack of respiratory
      depression and greater hemodynamic stability.
