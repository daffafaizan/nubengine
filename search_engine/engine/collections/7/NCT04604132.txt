    
      The study comprises three open-label substudies in patients with HER2-negative adenocarcinoma
      of the stomach or gastro-esophageal junction harboring FGFR2 gene translocations, FGFR2 gene
      amplifications, or FGFR1-3 mutations. Patients will be treated with single-agent derazantinib
      or derazantinib in combination with paclitaxel, ramucirumab, or atezolizumab. The study
      enrolls patients with either metastatic or recurrent locally advanced HER2-negative
      adenocarcinoma of the stomach or gastro-esophageal junction inoperable at the time of
      screening, and radiologically confirmed disease progression after one or at least one
      standard treatment regimen.
