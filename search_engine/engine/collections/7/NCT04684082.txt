      (colonic irrigation with the "Colon Hydromat") works in real-life practice.

      Colonic irrigation is regarded as a substitute for standard oral colonic purgative solutions
      for colonoscopy preparation. The advantage of colonic irrigation is that there is no
      unpleasant taste, it avoids the discomfort of diarrheic episode and there is no need to drink
      a large volume of water or fluids. The patient will receive the bowel irrigation with the
      "Colon Hydromat" directly before colonoscopy, at the same day. Aim of this study is to
      confirm performance (effectiveness), in terms of an adequate bowel preparation and safety of
      the "Colon-Hydromat", as alternative bowel cleansing device prior to colonoscopy. The primary
      performance (effectiveness) endpoint for this study is the colonic cleanliness, defined as
      overall quality of bowel cleansing as measured by the Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS).
      The primary safety endpoints for this study are adverse device events (ADE) and serious
      adverse device effects (SADE), product and procedure related.
