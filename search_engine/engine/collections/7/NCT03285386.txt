      can influence clinical outcomes in a range of conditions. The "critical power" is an
      important physiological threshold that demarcates exercise intensities that can be sustained
      for prolonged periods (i.e. below critical power) from intensities that result in exhaustion
      in a relatively short period of time (i.e. 2-30 minutes, above critical power). Critical
      power is therefore a key determinant of exercise tolerance. The speed with which oxygen
      uptake rises at the onset of exercise (i.e. oxygen uptake "kinetics") has been shown by work
      from our laboratory to be a key determinant of critical power. One intervention that can
      acutely improve the oxygen uptake kinetics is the performance of a prior bout of
      high-intensity exercise, known as "priming exercise". Patients with type 1 diabetes have
      previously been shown to have impaired exercise tolerance compared to healthy controls. The
      performance of priming exercise therefore represents a potential intervention to acutely
      improve oxygen uptake kinetics, and therefore critical power and exercise tolerance, in type
      1 diabetic individuals. The purpose of this study is therefore to assess the influence of
      priming exercise on oxygen uptake kinetics and critical power in a population of type 1
      diabetic individuals.
