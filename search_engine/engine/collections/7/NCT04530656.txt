    
      This is a phase I, single-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study, to
      evaluate safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (Sf9
      cell) in Chinese healthy population aged 18 years and older. Healthy adults who are ≥18 years
      old and ≤55 years old will be enrolled in the adult group and healthy elderly population who
      are >55 years old will be enrolled in the elderly group. To ensure the enrollment of healthy
      subjects, screening tests (hematology, biochemistry, and urinalysis) will be performed prior
      to the vaccination. In each age group, there are three regimen cohort: middle-dose at 0, 28
      schedule, high-dose at 0, 28 schedule, and high-dose at 0,14,28 schedule. The subjects in
      regimen cohort will be randomized to receive vaccines or placebos at a ratio of 3:1.

      The study will set up an Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) to conduct overall
      supervision. The IDMC is required to review the unblinded data when a significant event or
      risk occurs in the study that might cause the study to be suspended.
