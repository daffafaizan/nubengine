      adolescents with spinal deformities. It contains 21 items in five dimensions: psychosocial
      functioning (7 items), sleep disturbances (4 items), back pain (3 items), body image (4
      items), and back flexibility (3 items). Responses to items use a 5-point Likert scale. The
      possible score range is 21-105.

      The QLPSD has shown good validity and reliability. English, French and Persian versions of
      the QLPSD have been developed and validated. Good reliability and ease of use are mentioned
      in these versions. The QLPSD was designed to examine adolescents with spinal deformities and
      measure the effect of orthotic and surgical treatments on QoL. This questionnaire is
      practical and suitable for patients with spinal deformities. As a result we choose to
      translate the QLPSD into Turkish as it is less costly, practical and time consuming than
      developing a new tool. QLPSD may be preferred during follow-up of the results of conservative
      and / or surgical treatments for spinal deformities.
