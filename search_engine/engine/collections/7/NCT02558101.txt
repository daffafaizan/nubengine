      reduce lung cancer-specific and all-cause mortality in a large United States (US) trial, and
      screening is now being carried out in the US. Studies have shown that participation rates are
      invariably low, particularly by current smokers and those from socioeconomically deprived
      backgrounds; groups within which high risk candidates are overrepresented.

      In this study the investigators aim to improve informed participation in screening and reduce
      socioeconomic and smoking-related biases in participation. The investigators will identify
      individuals at high risk of lung cancer; specifically adults aged 60-75 who are current or
      recent former smokers. Eligible individuals will be invited by their General Practitioner to
      a "lung health check appointment" via one of two randomly allocated invitation strategies.
      The control materials will be similar to those used by UK screening programmes for other
      cancer types. The intervention materials have been designed to reduce barriers to
      participation among smokers from low socioeconomic status backgrounds.

      Those that attend will have a lung cancer risk assessment, and if confirmed to be eligible,
      will undergo a baseline LDCT scan. Data will be collected with respect to demographics, risk
      and various clinical and radiological outcomes.
