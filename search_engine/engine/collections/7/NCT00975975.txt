      which has either not responded to treatment or is not treatable by conventional/routine
      medical treatments. Bone marrow transplantation is a medical treatment that involves giving
      high doses of chemotherapy followed by the transplantation of the blood-forming and immune
      cells from a relative or from a "matched" unrelated person through the National Marrow Donor
      Program, in an attempt to cure disease in the recipient (the person receiving the donated
      cells). Nonmyeloablative (bone-marrow preservation) bone marrow transplantation is a
      relatively new technique in which lower than usual doses of chemotherapy are given before
      transplantation, in hopes of reducing adverse side effects of the chemotherapy in transplant
      patients. Nonmyeloablative bone marrow transplantation has several advantages which doctors
      have determined are beneficial for this condition.

      This research is being done because the complication of graft-versus-host disease can be bad
      for a person and there is no completely safe and effective way to prevent this complication.
      We know that cyclosporine helps but would like to know if the addition of basiliximab, given
      with cyclosporine, will decrease the incidence and/or severity of graft-versus-host disease
      after a transplant known as nonmyeloablative or "mini" transplant.
