      Department of Cengiz Gokcek Obstetrics and Children's Hospital between January 2020 and June
      2021. The authors will be recruited 50 subjects with idiopathic POI, and 50 healthy patients
      were selected for the control group. All patients will be given their oral and written
      informed consent before their inclusion in the study. The protocol was approved by the Ethics
      Committee for Clinical Research of Gaziantep University (Reference number: 2020/320). The
      study strictly will be adhered to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.

      Women between the ages of 18-39 will be included. A volunteer group of healthy women who will
      be visited the gynecology clinic for routine examinations and women who will be admitted for
      pre-pregnancy tests will be invited randomly to this research as a control group. Healthy
      women, who will be returned during their early follicular phase of the menstrual cycle, will
      be recruited as the control group subjects. The exclusion criteria will be as follows: women
      with evidence for karyotypic, metabolic, toxic, or iatrogenic cause of the ovarian
      insufficiency and any women who use any medication for POI treatment. At enrollment, for both
      groups, the authors will be collected data about age, height, weight, BMI, age of menarche,
      obstetrics history, history of smoking, regular exercise and family history of POI. At
      enrolment, all patients will be underwent vaginal ultrasonography for the assessment of
      antral follicle count (AFC) and venous blood sample from the antecubital veins for measuring
      plasma concentration of Lead (Pb), Cadmium (Cd), Gadolinium (Gd), Arsenic (As), Mercury (Hg),
      Cobalt (Co), Vanadium (V), Titanium (Ti), Sulfur (S), Chromium (Cr), Silver (Ag), Molybdenum
      (Mo), Boron (B), Lithium (Li), and Nickel (Ni), Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), E2,
      anti-mullerian hormone (AMH) and complete blood count (CBC). In control subjects venous blood
      samples and AFC will be collected during the early follicular phase of the menstrual cycle.
      Urine and hair samples will be collected at the same time. The plasma and urine samples will
      be stored in aliquots at -80Â°C prior to the analyses of Lead (Pb), Cadmium (Cd), Gadolinium
      (Gd), Arsenic (As), Mercury (Hg), Cobalt (Co), Vanadium (V), Titanium (Ti), Sulfur (S),
      Chromium (Cr), Silver (Ag), Molybdenum (Mo), Boron (B), Lithium (Li), and Nickel (Ni). Hair
      samples will be stored in envelopes at room temperature. The plasma/urine/hair Lead (Pb),
      Cadmium (Cd), Gadolinium (Gd), Arsenic (As), Mercury (Hg), Cobalt (Co), Vanadium (V),
      Titanium (Ti), Sulfur (S), Chromium (Cr), Silver (Ag), Molybdenum (Mo), Boron (B), Lithium
      (Li), and Nickel (Ni) level will be measured using inductively coupled plasma-mass
      spectrometry. Then, this study will be determined plasma/urine/hair Lead (Pb), Cadmium (Cd),
      Gadolinium (Gd), Arsenic (As), Mercury (Hg), Cobalt (Co), Vanadium (V), Titanium (Ti), Sulfur
      (S), Chromium (Cr), Silver (Ag), Molybdenum (Mo), Boron (B), Lithium (Li), and Nickel (Ni)
      levels in women with POI (n=50) compared to those of volunteer healthy women (n=50). Then,
      these microelements levels will be compared in both group.
