      (baseline, T0), 30 min after the induction of general anesthesia (T1), 30 min after applying
      CPB (T2), 10 min after injection of protamine (T3), and after sternal closure (T4). Before
      induction of anesthesia, an NIRS sensor (INVOS® 5100C Cerebral/Somatic Oximeter; Medtronic,
      Minneapolis, MN, USA) was placed on the thenar eminence and an automated tourniquet (A.T.S®
      3000 Automatic Tourniquet System; Zimmer Inc., Warsaw, IL, USA) was placed around the upper
      arm. The arterial catheter was placed in the contralateral radial artery and the baseline
      blood pressure was measured. When the baseline tissue oxygen saturation (StO2) was
      stabilized, the automatic tourniquet was inflated to 50 mmHg over the patient's baseline
      systolic blood pressure and maintained for 5 min. After the 5-min ischemic period, the
      tourniquet rapidly deflated to 0 mmHg. StO2 data were continuously recorded during the VOT
      procedure. Baseline StO2, minimum StO2 during the 5-min inflation of the tourniquet, and
      maximum StO2 during deflation of the tourniquet were obtained. The occlusion slope and
      recovery slope were calculated based on the measured StO2 data. The occlusion slope, which is
      related to oxygen extraction, was defined as the slope of the StO2 descent to the lowest
      value. The recovery slope, which is related to microvascular reactivity, was calculated from
      the deflation of the tourniquet until the recovery of StO2 to the highest value.
