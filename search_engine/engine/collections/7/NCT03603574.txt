      sensitive Epidural waveform analysis (EWA) provides a simple confirmatory adjunct for LOR.
      When the needle (or catheter) is correctly positioned inside the epidural space, pressure
      measurement at its tip results in a pulsatile waveform synchronized with arterial pulsations
      Currently, there exist two different methods for EWA. Since local anesthetic (LA) is
      administered through the catheter, pressure transduction through its tip ensures that it is
      properly positioned inside the epidural space prior to LA injection. Alternately, EWA can be
      performed through the needle prior to blind advancement of the epidural catheter.

      Thus, in this randomized trial, the aim is to compare epidural waveform analysis through the
      needle (EWA-N) and through the catheter (EWA-C) for thoracic epidural blocks. The hypothesis
      is that, compared to EWA-C, EWA-N will result in a shorter performance time.
