      release DA in brain areas mediating reward and motivational processes. Although imaging
      studies show that release of DA follows smoking, little is known regarding how common some
      genetic polymorphisms proposed to play a role in nicotine dependence (e.g. DRD2, DAT and the
      serotonin transporter or SERT) interact with smoking status (non-smoker, ex-smoker, light
      smoker, present smoker) and modulate individual differences in nicotine-induced DA release
      and dopamine receptor occupancy, in vivo. Individual differences in dopaminergic tone could
      result in an under-stimulation of reward circuits which could put subjects at greater risk
      for seeking drug stimulation (that releases DA) as a means to compensate for this deficit and
      to temporarily activate these reward circuits. The current proposal combines brain imaging
      and genomics towards unraveling the complex relationship between smoking phenotype and common
      polymorphisms. Understanding whether genetic factors contribute to inter-individual
      variability is crucial for interpreting imaging results in the context of disease pathology.

      Nicotine dependence is a complex process including initiation of smoking, persistence and
      difficulty in quitting. By comparing receptor occupancy, nicotine-induced DA release, and
      common genetic polymorphisms across smoking behaviors we will better understand the complex
      interactions between genetic makeup, personality and the several stages of nicotine
      addiction.
