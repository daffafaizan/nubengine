    
      Ventral hernia is a frequently occurring complication following liver transplantation, with a
      reported risk in the literature ranging from 5% to 25%.

      This study aims to evaluate if the risk of developing ventral hernia after liver
      transplantation can be reduced through the prophylactic implantation of a synthetic mesh
      "Phasix" in the course of liver transplantation.

      PHASIXâ„¢ Mesh is a fully resorbable mesh implant prepared from poly-4-hydroxybutyrate (P4HB).
      Absorption of the mesh material occurs within 12 to 18 months.

      Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either Phasix mesh in the course of
      liver transplantation or standard surgery without the use of Phasix.

      Ultra-sound examinations of the wound area will be performed 14 days, 3, 6 and 12 months
      after liver transplantation. Furthermore, presence of infections, seroma, pain and other
      problems in the wound area will be assessed.
