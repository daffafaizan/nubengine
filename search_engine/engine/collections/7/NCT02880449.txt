      The intervention will utilize existing weekly community group sessions. A stepped wedge
      design, with a delayed intervention, shall be used to allow a randomised controlled trial to
      be conducted and to control for seasonal weather effects on PA levels. Two community groups
      from each centre shall be identified. One group from each centre shall receive the
      intervention from week one for 6 weeks; the second group shall receive the control condition
      from week one for 6 weeks and then receive the intervention at week 7 for 6 weeks. The
      intervention will consist of three educational sessions, encouragement to enlist the support
      of a partner or 'buddy' (e.g. a spouse, partner or friend), an information pack (containing
      information on the local area, walking routes, points of interest) and the option of weekly
      telephone contact. At each weekly meeting, participants will be given the opportunity to
      discuss their progress and share feedback with the rest of the group to gain peer social
      support. The intervention was developed using findings from a literature review, systematic
      review and interviews with stakeholders. The intervention is underpinned by constructs from
      the Social Practice Theory, a model that facilities behaviour change through the three
      elements of: materials (information on the local area, telephone calls, interactive group
      sessions), meanings (benefits of increasing PA, improving physical health and mental
      well-being) and competencies (encouragement to seek social support, knowledge of how to
      increase PA, knowledge of the local area).
