      and other nutrients are important for maintaining beneficial microbes in the gut. The
      presence of beneficial microbes in the gut may mediate the subclinical inflammation
      experienced in metabolic disease. In this project, overweight or obese participants with low
      intakes of fruits and vegetables or whole grains will increase their intake of these foods to
      recommended levels. Changes in markers of inflammation and gut microbiota composition will be
      determined to assess and compare the potential impact of these foods on metabolic disease.
