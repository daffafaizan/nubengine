      study may reveal how the drug works for cancer that spreads to the brain (metastases) and for
      a type of brain cancer called glioblastoma (GBM). Subjects are persons scheduled to have
      surgery to remove the tumor.This study would test how much of the new drug is present in the
      tumor, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) after taking the drug orally for 10-14 days
      before surgery. It is only given to patients who are already scheduled to have surgery to
      remove a tumor that has returned. If the drug seems to be working for a subject's tumor,
      subject will have the option to continue to receive it as part of a continuation study
      looking at the drug effect on preventing the tumor from recurring. Small samples of blood,
      tumor tissue, and CSF will be taken. These samples will be sent to and analyzed at the
      Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute (KCI) and to the Translational Genomics Research
      Institute (TGen). Subject involvement will be for 10-14 days before surgery and for 30 days
      following surgery. Patients with ALK+ solid tumors will be provided the option of continuing
      therapy until tumor progression. ALK positivity will be assessed by approved FISH test
      (Abbott Molecular Inc) using Vysis break apart probes (defined as 15% or more positive tumor
      cells), the Ventana IHC (immunohistochemistry) test, and/or NGS (next generation sequencing).
