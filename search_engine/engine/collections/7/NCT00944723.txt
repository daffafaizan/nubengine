      changes in response to additional zinc consumption, as provided by zinc-fortified
      cereal-based complementary foods fed to adult men (fortified at a level consistent with
      currently proposed levels). The following specific steps will be completed:

        1. Zinc-fortified breads prepared from zinc-fortified wheat flour will be developed with
           assistance from experts in food technology.

        2. A four-week feeding trial will be implemented to assess the change in plasma zinc
           concentration among young adult men who receive: a) bread fortified with a moderate
           amount of zinc and a liquid vitamin preparation between meals; b) bread fortified with a
           large amount zinc and a liquid vitamin preparation between meals; c) non-zinc-fortified
           bread and a liquid vitamin preparation between meals [negative control group]; and d)
           non-zinc-fortified bread and a zinc-containing liquid vitamin preparation between meals
           [positive control group].
