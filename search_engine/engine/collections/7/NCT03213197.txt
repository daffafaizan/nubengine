    
      The code status video, produced by experts in palliative medicine and end of life care, has
      been evaluated in a variety of healthcare settings to allow patients to make more informed
      decisions based on realistic information about resuscitation status. This video could be used
      as a supplement for clinical discussions and decision making. It is not meant to replace a
      careful, individualized discussion by the clinician with patients and their families, but
      appears to be a helpful tool to help educate patients in order for them to be better informed
      to make complicated decisions about their code status. The Emergency Department is an ideal
      setting to evaluate the video because they could improve patient understanding in an
      environment with inherently limited face-to-face provider time.

      Specific Aims

        1. To assess the satisfaction of patients and family members who view the video on
           cardiopulmonary resuscitation. This will be measured through use of a questionnaire
           asking them to score their comfort with watching the video and how likely they would be
           to recommend the video to others.

        2. To assess if watching the standardized video changes patients' code status. This will be
           measured as what patients' code status was before and after watching the video.
