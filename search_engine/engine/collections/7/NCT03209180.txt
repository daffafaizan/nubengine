      therapeutic efficacy of carvedilol-SR compared to carvedilol-IR in patients with heart
      failure with reduced ejection fraction. Patients with stable HFrEF will be randomly assigned
      (1:1) to carvedilol SR group (160 patients) and carvedilol IR group (160 patients).

      After randomization, patients will be followed for 6 months. The primary endpoint is the
      change in NT-proBNP level from baseline to the study end. The secondary endpoints include the
      frequency of NT-proBNP increment >10% from baseline, composite of all-cause mortality and
      readmission, mortality rate, readmission rate, changes in blood pressure, quality of life,
      and drug compliance.
