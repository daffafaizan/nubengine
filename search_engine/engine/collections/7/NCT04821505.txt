      with Transcendental Meditation (TM) in African American adults with blood pressure ranges
      ≥120/80 mm Hg and ≤140/90mm Hg.

      Methods: A total of 304 self-identified African American adults, having blood pressure
      120-139 systolic/ 80-89 diastolic mm Hg were randomized to either TM or health education (HE)
      intervention. Based on the baseline BP, participants were divided into high-normal BP (SBP
      130-139 / 85-89 mm Hg) or normal-BP (SBP 120-129 / 80-84 mm Hg) groups. BP was recorded at 3,
      6, 9, 12, 24, 30 and 36 months after baseline. The linear mixed model analysis was conducted
      to compare the BP change between TM and HE participants in the high-normal and normal-BP
      groups.

      The findings of this clinical trial may demonstrate that stress reduction using the TM
      technique could be an effective behavioral intervention for lowering blood pressure in
      African American adults in the high-normal range and for whom pharmacotherapy is generally
      not indicated but who nevertheless are at elevated risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD).
