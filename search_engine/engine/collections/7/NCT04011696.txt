    
      TYPE OF THE STUDY:

      A prospective, non-blinded, non-randomized, single eye cohort study in patients who had
      uneventful cataract surgery with a monofocal IOL.

      Potentially eligible patients will be given an invitation letter and patient information
      sheet on the day they arrive for surgery. They will then be asked if they are happy to be
      contacted by phone 2-4 weeks post-surgery with a view to booking them into an additional
      research visit at 3 months after their surgery.

      Inclusion criteria

        1. Uneventful cataract surgery

        2. Sequential recruitment

        3. Potential to see 20/40 (6/12) unaided or better postoperatively

        4. No significant macular pathology

        5. Willing to follow up at 3 months

      Exclusion criteria

        1. Patients under 20 years of age

        2. Any ocular co-morbidity, which will preclude an expected postoperative 20/40 (6/12)
           unaided, distance vision. (e.g. amblyopia, corneal pathology, age related macular
           degeneration, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, other previous ocular surgeries)

        3. Posterior capsule opacification

        4. Inability to read English text or physically or mentally unable to cooperate with the
           postoperative assessment

      At 3 months, uniocular unaided distance LogMAR acuity will be recorded. An OCT scan will be
      performed to establish macular integrity. Pupil size, manifest refraction, measurement of any
      deviations of the optical rays (called as wavefront aberrometry) will be performed using a
      iTrace (Tracy Technology) wavefront aberrometer. Unaided reading speed and critical print
      size will be measured using a Salzberg Reading Desk. Examination time per patient: 40 mins in
      total. Multivariate statistical analysis will be performed. Power calculation showed a need
      to examine 412 patients.
