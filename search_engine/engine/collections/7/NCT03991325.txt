    
      the aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of different ultrasonographic parameters
      and clinical tests to predict difficult airway assessment.

      Ultrasonographic parameters were: hyo-mental distence, tongue width, skin to epiglottis
      distence and skin to hyoid bone distence. these parameters were recorded and their predictive
      acurracy was studied.

      This study analyzed a sample size of 200 patients undergoing elective or urgent surgery under
      general anesthesia and recieving neuromuscular blocking agent before laryngoscopy.

      the correlation between ultrasonographic parameters and difficult laryngoscopy was studied
