      open-label, single arm Phase II study will investigate the clinical response rate in terms of
      both B/C findings and mediator-related symptoms.

      30 adult patients will be treated with a continuous regimen of dasatinib at a starting dose
      of 20 mg administered orally (PO) once daily (QD), that can be escalated up to 100 mg QD at
      the end of Week 3. Upon completion of a treatment induction period, subjects will be treated
      with dasatinib at a daily dose of 100 mg PO QD. Patients will remain on dasatinib treatment
      for 12 months unless disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or other reasons determine
      treatment discontinuation. Subjects may continue receiving protocol therapy as long as they
      are deriving a clinical benefit.

      Additionally, all subjects will be followed until disease progression, death, or 12 months
      beyond discontinuation from study treatment.

      The total duration of the study is estimated to 36 months.
