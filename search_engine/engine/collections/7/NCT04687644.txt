      Population and sample selection: The universe of the study consists of all midwives who work
      in the childbirth unite. The effect rate of the intervention in the research, for which the
      studies on the job satisfaction level of midwives are descriptive in the literature, is
      unknown. Therefore, Cohen standard effect rate was used. According to the sample size
      analysis performed in the G-Power program for the sampling, a total of 48 volunteers will be
      included in the study, with the power of the research being 80%, the alpha of 0.05 and the
      Cohen standard effect ratio of 0.8, as 26 for the intervention group and 26 for the control
      group. It is planned to include 52 midwives.
