      and expansion to determine the safety and tolerability, recommended phase 2 dose and
      pharmacology, and antitumor activity of RTX-321 in adult patients with persistent, recurrent,
      or metastatic, unresectable cervical cancer (squamous, adeno, or adenosquamous histology),
      HNSCC, or squamous cell cancer of the anal canal that is not amenable to curative therapy.
      Prior to study screening, all patients must be confirmed to be HLA-A*02:01 positive.
      Documentation of an HPV 16+ tumor is required at prescreening for patients with cervical
      cancer and HNSCC. RTX-321 is a cellular therapy that expresses 4-1BBL, IL-12, and HPV-16
      Antigen with the goal of harnessing the innate and adaptive immune systems for the treatment
      of cancer. The study will include a monotherapy dose escalation phase followed by an
      expansion phase.
