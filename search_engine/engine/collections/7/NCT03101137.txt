      groups; the randomization sequence was concealed in sealed envelopes. The three study groups
      were as follows:

      Group A: Caudal Dexmedetomidine block group (DEXM) (n= 16) will receive caudal block using
      the bupivacaine 0.25% and Dexmedetomidine 1 μg/kg with the conventional general anesthesia,

      Group B: caudal Dexamethasone Block group (DEXA) (n =16) will receive caudal block using the
      bupivacaine 0.25% and Dexamethasone 0.1 mg/kg with the conventional general anesthesia,

      Group C: caudal with bubivacaine (CONTROL) group (n = 16) will receive caudal block using the
      bupivacaine 0.25% and general anesthesia.

      After induction of general anesthesia, the electrodes of the electrical cardiometry will be
      applied on the child neck and chest in the supine position and a measurement for the baseline
      cardiac output, systemic vascular resistance and stroke volume will be taken using the
      electrical cardiometry. Baseline blood pressure and heart rate will be also recorded.Then,
      another measurement for the systemic cardiac output, vascular resistance, stroke volume heart
      rate and blood pressure will be taken at 5minutes, 10 minutes, 20 minutes and 30 minutes
      after caudal block. The measurements will be stored and analyzed off-line.

      The Electrical Cardiometry device that will be used is the ICON™ monitor; (the Portable
      Noninvasive Hemodynamic Monitor manufactured by Osypka Medical Company). The measurements
      will be stored and analyzed off-line. The average values during three consecutive measures
      will be considered for the analysis.
