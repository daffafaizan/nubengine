    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To assess the progression-free survival rate at 6 months after treatment with
           ramucirumab or anti-PDGFR alpha monoclonal antibody IMC-3G3 in patients with recurrent
           glioblastoma multiforme.

      Secondary

        -  To evaluate the acute and late toxicities associated with these regimens.

        -  To assess the objective tumor response rate.

        -  To estimate the overall survival of these patients.

        -  To describe the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles and immunogenicity of these
           regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are sequentially assigned to 1 of 2 treatment
      groups.

        -  Group 1: Patients receive ramucirumab IV over 1 hour on day 1. Courses repeat every 14
           days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Group 2: Patients receive anti-PDGFR alpha monoclonal antibody IMC-3G3 IV over 60-90
           minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 14 days in the absence of disease progression or
           unacceptable toxicity.
