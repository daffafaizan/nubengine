      informed consent process, they will have 30 milliliters (approximately two tablespoons) of
      blood drawn. This will be done prior to the performance of the fine needle aspiration biopsy
      of the thyroid. If the patient has indicated a desire to receive the results of their test,
      they will receive a written description, as will their physician. The patients will be
      contacted yearly for up to 5 years by the study staff to learn whether they have been found
      to have a diagnosis of thyroid or other cancer.
