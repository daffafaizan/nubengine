      cisplatin and radiotherapy in patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma.
      II. Determine the toxic effects, especially acute and long-term esophagitis and pneumonitis,
      of this regimen in these patients. III. Determine the response rate, duration to progression,
      and sites of relapse in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of irinotecan. Patients receive
      irinotecan IV over 90 minutes and cisplatin over 1 hour on day 1. Patients also undergo
      radiotherapy once daily on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 7 days for 7 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive
      escalating doses of irinotecan until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD
      is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience
      dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed every 2 months for 1 year, every 3 months for 1
      year, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 3-27 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.
