      edema manifested clinically by hypoxemia (PaO2/FiO2≤300 mmHg) and bilateral pulmonary
      infiltrates. When the hypoxemia is severe (PaO2/FiO2≤200 mmHg) it is termed the acute
      respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). It represents a significant public health issue.
      Patients with ALI or ARDS require admission into critical care units for advanced life
      support and utilize considerable health care resources.

      An immense plethora of translational knowledge has been acquired since the first description
      of ARDS in 1967. At the present, estimates of the incidence of ARDS and ALI in children are
      unknown. In adults, the estimates of ALI/ARDS incidence have varied widely, and the true
      magnitude of this health problem still remains unclear. Current estimates of the incidence of
      adult ALI/ARDS range from 15 to 80 cases per 100.000 population, or almost 40.000 cases per
      year in Spain. Combined mortality rates for adult ALI/ARDS range between 30-45% but it is not
      clear whether this figures can be translated in the pediatric population. ALI and ARDS occur
      as a complication or as the primary cause of critical illness in patients, usually after
      severe infection or trauma.

      Published epidemiological studies on ALI and ARDS in the last 20 years are difficult to
      compare. Some reports have used different definitions for ALI and ARDS and others have
      evaluated the incidence during a short period of time (from days to several weeks) and then
      extrapolated their data to estimates of a one-year incidence. Very few studies have collected
      information for an entire year, and none of them have evaluated the degree of hypoxemia under
      standard ventilatory settings, as it has been proposed recently by the HELP Network (Am J
      Respir Crit Care Med 2007; 176:795-804).
