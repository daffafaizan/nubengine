      sirolimus, in the treatment of chronic graft versus host disease in combination with
      prednisone. Graft versus host disease (GVHD) is a common complication in patients who have
      received blood or marrow transplantation from a related or unrelated donor. Chronic GVHD
      occurs approximately 100 days after transplantation and is the result of the donor immune
      system recognizing the patient's tissues as foreign and creating harmful effects on the
      patient's organs. We hope the use of sirolimus will decrease the significant disabling
      effects and deaths caused by chronic GVHD.
