    
      This study has a phase 1, randomized, vehicle-controlled, double-blind, single center design
      to explore the safety, tolerability and pharmacodynamics (PD) of topically applied CyPep-1 in
      otherwise healthy patients with cutaneous warts.

      The study will entail two parts. Part 1 will follow a target area of 5x5 cm healthy skin to
      study tolerability and safety of the formulation. During this study part also a maximum of 3
      common warts, preferably at the dorsal or palmar side of the hand / finger(s), will be
      treated. Several assessments will be done to determine pharmacodynamics and to explore
      possible efficacy after a treatment period of 1 week.

      Part 2 will evaluate the pharmacodynamics and efficacy of CyPep-1 after a treatment period of
      4 weeks. Study part 2 will commence after an interim analysis, e.g. a blind data review, of
      study part 1 has been conducted.
