      sleep apnea (OSA) in patients with Hypotonic Upper Airway Obstruction (HUAO). HUAO encompass
      conditions such as cerebral palsy, hypoxic encephalopathy, syndromic tone anomalies, and
      neuromuscular disorders, and typically share a similar pattern of multisite upper airway
      collapse. OSA is characterized by recurrent episodes of partial or complete upper airway
      obstruction during sleep with associated arousals and/ or oxygen desaturations. Of hypotonic
      patients with symptoms of sleep disordered breathing, one quarter have moderate OSA, and more
      than half have severe OSA. Thus, not only are patients more likely to have OSA, but it is
      likely to be much more severe. Currently available treatment options, ranging from palliative
      care to tracheostomy, often fail to fully meet the needs of these patients. The
      multidisciplinary team has developed a dramatically effective non-surgical nasopharyngeal
      airway stent that has demonstrated good tolerability in hypotonic patients. This initial
      phase will test an enhanced version of the device for acceptability and tolerability.
      Critically, insertion, adherence, and compliance protocols will be optimized for preparation
      of the full trial.
