      safety and efficacy of midodrine in the intensive care unit for decreasing IV vasopressor
      use. The investigators hypothesize that administration of midodrine in the early phase of
      septic shock in patients with adequate enteral access will result in a significant decrease
      in time to IV vasopressor liberation (increase in vasopressor-free days), secondarily
      resulting in decreased central venous catheter dwell times and intensive care unit length of
      stay.
