948.cardiac activity in cranio-cerebral hypothermiathe onset of hypothermia rarely alters the heartrate.  as it deepens to 35-32, therate slows, and at the level of 30-29 it usuallyamounts to only half its original va-lue.  at 28 or below, the development ofbradycardia is observed.  after warmingto 32 the normal heart rate is restored.during operations on the abdominal organsthe heart rate is only slightly modified.the appearance of solitary extrasystoles israre and is usually associated with stimulationof the diaphragm.  the most markedchanges in the heart rate are observed during operations on the heart,especially ifit is excluded from the circulation.  anidioventricular rhythm may develop beforethe heart stops beating.  after removal of theligatures from the venae cavae the nor-mal rhythm is restored.  as the temperaturefalls, the excitability of the myocardiumincreases.  conduction is more resistant.areflexia continues even during direct sti-mulation of reflexogenic zones.  in the surgicalstage of cranio-cerebral hypothermiait is clear that no significant degree of energyor hemodynamic insufficiency deve-lops, whether in experimental conditions orduring operations on patients.  at opera-tion a well-marked stabilization of the contractilepower of the myocardium may be observed.
