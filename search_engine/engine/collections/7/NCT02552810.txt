      Carbon and Aluminum traces due to lubricant used during customization) on the whole abutment
      surface, the internal connection and the screw can be found, even after the usually cleaning
      steps (steaming).

      Such debris, present at titanium/connective-bone tissues interface (gingival portion of the
      abutment), could directly or indirectly deleteriously influence the inflammatory response on
      the peri-implant tissues.

      Plasma of Argon cleaning treatment was demonstrated to have a double effect on titanium
      abutments: removal of pollutions following customization and increase of cell adhesion.
      Additionally, Plasma of Argon demonstrated very potent anti-biofilm activity. This
      prospective, match paired, triple-blinded randomized controlled trial was aimed to test if
      plasma treatment of customized abutments can affect radiographic peri-implant marginal bone
      level changes after 5 years of prosthetic loading.
