      treatment includes revision meniscal repair or partial meniscectomy.

      Purpose: To retrospectively analyze the clinical outcomes of meniscus repair with
      simultaneous anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction and explore the causes of
      failure of meniscus repair.

      Methods: From May 2013 to July 2018, the clinical data of 165 patients who were treated with
      meniscus surgery and simultaneous ACL reconstruction by the same doctor, including 69 cases
      of meniscus repair (repair group) and 96 cases of partial meniscectomy (partial meniscectomy
      group), were retrospectively analyzed. The 69 patients of the repair group were divided into
      the nonfailure group (62 cases) and the failure group (7 cases) depending on the repair
      effect. The average follow-up period was 38 (±10.5) months. Postoperative outcomes of the
      repair group and the partial meniscectomy group were compared. General conditions and
      postoperative outcomes of the failure group and the nonfailure group were compared. Seven
      patients in the failure group who underwent second arthroscopy were followed up for 30
      (±17.4) months, and their postoperative outcomes were summarized.
