      nuclei. Its increase induced obesity and it is elevated in obese rodents. In addition, in
      human, it is elevated in anorexic patients. However, no data exists in obese patients or in
      patients with diabetes. Thus, the investigators planned to measure 26RFa level in obese
      patients before and after a sleeve gastrectomy in order to study the effect of a weight loss
      on its levels. The investigators will also dose 26RFa concentrations in obese patients with
      type 2 diabetes and in healthy volunteers with normal weight. Comparison of these different
      groups will permit us to better understand the 26RFa involvement in glucose concentration
      regulation and in obesity.

      The investigators will also measure other hormones known to have a major role in glucose
      metabolism and obesity (ie. insulin, adiponectin).

      A meal test will be given to the volunteers in order to study the kinetics' of these
      molecules during and after food intake.
