      Multimodal analgesia recommended for the pain management. For these reasons, we planned a
      study involving two multimodal analgesia regimens. Patients who will undergo total knee
      arthroplasty will receive preemptive oral analgesic (dexketofrofen) 1 hour before the
      operation. Surgery will be initiated after spinal anesthesia is applied to the patients. Two
      pain control methods - the combination of Adductor Canal Block (ACB)/Infiltration of the
      interspace between the popliteal artery and the capsule of the posterior knee (IPACK) versus
      the Periarticular Injection (PAI)/ IPACK- will be applied at the end of the surgery.
      dexketoprofenand paracetamol will be added to both groups and multimodal analgesia will be
      applied. Primary outcome is NRS pain scores with ambulation on postoperative day one (24
      hours post-block administration).
