      disease (NAFLD), is difficult and its maintenance is typically unsuccessful in children,
      affirming the acute need for alternative/adjunct therapies. Although few promising approaches
      have been reported, the benefits are incongruent and mostly marginal. N-acetyl cysteine
      (NAC), a derivative of the natural amino acid, cysteine, appears to be promising as an
      adjunct therapy to PA. Animal and a few adult human studies suggest NAC-induced attenuation
      of liver abnormalities, oxidative stress, insulin resistance and inflammation. The primary
      aim of the proposal is to determine in obese children with biopsy proven NASH and elevated
      liver enzymes the effect of NAC at two different doses on liver fat using magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI), liver enzymes and risk factors of cardiometabolic disease. We hypothesize that
      NAC will produce beneficial effect on these parameters.
