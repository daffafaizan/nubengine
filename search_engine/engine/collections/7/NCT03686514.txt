      the 4 strain flu vaccine in individuals who have "imprinted" on specific influenza strains.
      It will also consider the effects of repeated prior annual influenza vaccination on the
      immune system. This trial may hopefully lead to larger trials that advance understanding of
      flu vaccines and hopefully lead to a more effective flu vaccine that does not rely on annual
      updates, provides broad protection, and is durable; i.e., a universal influenza vaccine.
