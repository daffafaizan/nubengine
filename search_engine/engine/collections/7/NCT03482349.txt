      arthritis, improvements in surgical technique remain a necessity. Contemporary designs have
      bolstered durability, but longer life expectancies have placed an even greater emphasis on
      survivorship. Additionally, patient satisfaction remains an issue.

      A prospective randomized clinical trial (RCT) is proposed to compare robotically-assisted
      versus manually executed primary (TKAs). This study is designed to address the major
      short-term clinically important issues between the two types of procedures with special
      emphasis on functional outcome. Patients will be randomized to receive either a
      robotically-assisted or a manually-executed primary TKA.
