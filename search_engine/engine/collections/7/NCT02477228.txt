      fistulotomy in cannulation of ampulla of Vater during endoscopic retrograde
      cholangiopancreatography regarding procedure-related complications as failure of
      cannulations, bleeding and perforation and postoperative complication This a prospective
      randomized controlled trial comparing two groups of patients who undergo endoscopic
      retrograde cholangiopancreatography for obstructive jaundice in Gastrointestinal Surgical
      center, Mansoura University, Egypt. From January 2014 to December 2014.

      Group A consists of 50 patients who will undergo conventional approach and group B consists
      of 50 patients who undergo needle knife fistulotomy for cannulation of the ampulla of Vater.
      Randomization was done by paramedical personnel in the ERCP unit by taking a number from an
      envelope.

      Data will be registered in a specially prepared sheet for the purpose of the study.
      Registered data will include: duration of cannulation, number of trials for cannulation,
      number of pancreatic cannulation, bleeding during cannulation and its management, need to
      convert to the other approach in cannulation.

      Data also included postoperative hospital stay, serum amylase level and postoperative
      complications as pancreatitis, perforation, bleeding and cholecystitis. Pancreatitis will be
      also graded according to its severity depending on the duration of hospital stay.
