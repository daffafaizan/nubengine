      types of exercise training, whole body and isolated single leg, on HFpEF patients with either
      central or peripheral limitations to exercise training. Subjects will undergo baseline
      maximal exercise testing and invasive right heart catheterization to define exercise
      tolerance and pulmonary and cardiac pressures during exercise. Based on the results of
      baseline testing, subjects will be divided into either centrally limited, defined as
      excessive rise in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure more than 25 mmHg that decreases after
      administration of sub-lingual nitroglycerin resulting in improved exercise tolerance, or
      peripherally limited, defined as no improvement in exercise tolerance despite reduction in
      pulmonary capillary wedge pressure after sublingual nitroglycerin. After baseline testing,
      subjects will be randomized to either whole body cycle exercise supplemented with sublingual
      nitroglycerin to improve training responsiveness or isolated single leg exercise training for
      4 months. After 4 months, subjects will repeat maximal exercise testing and invasive right
      heart catheterization to assess responses to 4 months of exercise training.
