      buprenorphine (BUP-XR) injections represent a significant development. The Community
      Long-Acting Buprenorphine (CoLAB) study aims to evaluate client outcomes among people with
      opioid dependence receiving 48 weeks of BUP-XR treatment, and examines the implementation of
      BUP-XR in diverse community healthcare settings in Australia.

      The CoLAB study is a prospective single-arm, multicentre, open-label trial of monthly BUP-XR
      injections in people with opioid dependence. Participants are being recruited from a network
      of general practitioner and specialist drug treatment services located in the states of New
      South Wales, Victoria and South Australia in Australia. Following a minimum 7 days on 8-32mg
      of sublingual buprenorphine (+/- naloxone), participants will receive monthly subcutaneous
      BUP-XR injections administered by a healthcare practitioner at intervals of 28 days (-2/+14
      days). The primary endpoint is participant retention in treatment at 48 weeks after treatment
      initiation. Secondary endpoints will evaluate dosing schedule variations, craving,
      withdrawal, substance use, health and well-being, and client-reported treatment experience.
      Qualitative and costing sub-studies will examine implementation barriers and facilitators at
      the client and provider level.
