      first blood clot. One of these tools is the use of a clinical decision rule. Clinical
      decision rules have been designed to help clinicians make diagnostic and therapeutic
      decisions at the bedside. A score is computed on the presence of some criteria from the
      patient's medical history, clinical signs and symptoms. The score provides the probability of
      a blood clot. The rules can be used in combinations with a simple blood test - called D-dimer
      - to identify patients at low risk who don't require diagnostic imaging testing. Benefits
      include reduced costs, length in hospital and radiation exposure.

      Patients with prior blood clots have been shown to be less likely to benefit from the
      non-invasive testing. Therefore, they often need to undergo imaging tests, which are
      frequently difficult to interpret in patients with prior blood clots since residual clots are
      often present and are difficult to distinguish from a recurrent clot.

      The objective of this study is to try to prospectively assess the role of existing clinical
      decision rules in patients with prior blood clots, and to attempt to improve them in order to
      increase the yield of non-invasive testing and to reduce the risk of over-diagnosis with
      imaging tests.

      With respect to this study, clots within the deep veins of the legs are called deep vein
      thrombosis (DVT), while clots in the lungs are called pulmonary embolism (PE).
