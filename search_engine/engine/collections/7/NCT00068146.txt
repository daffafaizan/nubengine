      defective lymphocyte apoptosis, which is clinically characterized by prominent non-malignant
      lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly and overt autoimmune diseases such as hemolytic anemia,
      autoimmune thrombocytopenia and neutropenia. Additionally, ALPS patients have a significantly
      increased risk of developing non-Hodgkin's and Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      The diagnosis of lymphoma is particularly troublesome in ALPS because many ALPS
      manifestations overlap with clinical features suggestive of lymphoma. Therefore, individuals
      with ALPS may undergo repeated biopsies during the course of the disease. Finding a
      non-invasive test that can predictably discriminate benign from malignant lymphadenopathy in
      ALPS, and that can help discern whether a more invasive lymph node biopsy is necessary, would
      be very desirable.

      Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography (FDG-PET) is an increasingly used
      non-invasive imaging technique for staging and monitoring therapeutic responses in patients
      with lymphoma. This technique might be able to assist us in distinguishing whether
      enlargement of lymph nodes is due to ALPS versus ALPS associated lymphoma. However, FDG-PET
      has not been studied in patients with ALPS. This study will first explore whether ALPS
      patients with lymphadenopathy show FDG uptake. If uptake is shown, the study will obtain
      initial quantitative data to compare FDG uptake in ALPS patients with lymphadenopathy, and
      ALPS patients with associated lymphoma. The ultimate goal is to assess FDG-PET as a reliable
      non-invasive method to differentiate lymphadenopathy due to ALPS versus that of ALPS
      associated lymphoma.
