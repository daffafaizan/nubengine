      Study design and control methods:

      This study is designed as a prospective, randomized, double-blinded controlled clinical trial
      to compare the effect of a fibrin spray applied to the surgical wound as compared to patients
      not receiving the fibrin spray.

      Treatment group:

      The subjects will be randomly assigned to the fibrin treatment group or to the control group
      at the time of the surgery via the opening of a randomly selected sealed envelope. The
      patient and the independent reviewer will be blinded as to which treatment group the patient
      is assigned to. This information will be linked to a confidential database for later review
      by the principal investigator.

      Treatment allocation:

      All eligible patients (i.e., meeting inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria) will be
      treated and observed per the research protocol. All patients will maintain the right to
      refuse participation and receive a specific treatment of the study if desired.

      Trial Population:

      The target sample size is 70 patients for both the treatment and control groups (140 total)
      with each group split evenly between males and females. There will be one actively enrolling
      surgeon (Dr. Brett Levine). The goal is to enroll a total of 140 subjects experiencing joint
      pain that warrants a Total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The specific diagnosis for the joint pain
      will not direct the subjects' assignment or eligibility at the time of surgery. All 140
      patients will be enrolled from the office of the primary investigator (Dr. Brett Levine). All
      indications for TKA will be included unless one of the exclusion criteria is met.
