      kidney function in 50% of patients over 10 years. Steroids, which are currently used to treat
      the disease, are effective in part of patients. Over the past decade, a number of studies
      have reported therapeutic efficacy for treatment with high-dose and over 6mo prednisone in
      patients with FSGS. These studies show that the total effective rates were only around 50%.
      But this therapy had taken some side effects of prednisone. Except these studies, in recent
      studies suggest that Tripterygium Wilfordii may be effective for passive Heymann nephritis,
      podocyte injury in nephrosis rats induced y puromycin aminonucleoside, and so on. FSGS is a
      podocytepathy. There was no-data of Prednisone and Tripterygium Wilfordii treatment of
      Chinese adult patients with idiopathic FSGS.
