      and the United States. Despite advancements made with the demonstration of improved outcomes
      for concurrent platinum based chemotherapy with radical radiation in locally advanced SCCHN,
      approximately 50% of cases will recur. The current treatment of locoregionally
      recurrent/metastatic SCCHN is palliative in intent, with a median survival in this population
      of 6-8 months. Thus improvements to the current backbone treatment of locally advanced SCCHN,
      that is platinum based chemotherapy with radical radiation, are desperately needed.

      This is a non-randomized, open-label, phase I dose escalation trial of neoadjuvant Sorafenib
      and concurrent Sorafenib, Cisplatin and radiation in locally advanced squamous cell
      carcinomas of the head and neck (SCCHN).
