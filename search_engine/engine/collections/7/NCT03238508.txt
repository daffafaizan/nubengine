      STEMI. However, it is thought that IS may cause additional myocardial injury by increasing
      distal embolization of clot and atheromatous plaque debris. Only about 35% of patients
      without cardiogenic shock can achieve optimal myocardial tissue perfusion at the
      microvascular level, even after restoration of epicardial coronary artery patency. IS in
      highly pro-thrombotic and inflammatory milieu of IRA during primary PCI would increase distal
      embolization of clot and atheromatous plaque debris, and provoke the inflammation process, so
      deferred stenting after a cooling down period of IRA for several days, have a potential to
      mitigate or prevent microvascular obstruction (MVO). Among several methods to evaluate MVO
      after STEMI, IMR has been well known as an good indicator of MVO and strong predictor for
      short and long term clinical outcomes.
