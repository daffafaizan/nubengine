    
      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the frequency of deletion 13 as detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization
           (FISH) and conventional cytogenetics in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma
           (MM) or other monoclonal gammopathies (MG).

        -  Examine the prognostic value of specific subsets of chromosome aberrations detected by
           conventional cytogenetics and FISH in relation to event-free and overall survival in
           these patients.

        -  Compare the prognostic value of cytogenetics and FISH with other MM and MG prognostic
           factors in these patients.

        -  Correlate the presence of cytogenetic and FISH features with clinical
           pathophysiological, cellular, or other molecular characteristics in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive treatment as directed by the treatment clinical trial on which they
      are registered. Patients undergo bone marrow or blood sample collection periodically for
      conventional cytogenetic analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization studies (FISH).
      Samples are analyzed for deleted 13q/monosomy 13 and chromosomal abnormalities.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 500 patients will be accrued for this study.
