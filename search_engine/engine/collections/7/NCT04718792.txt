      patients diagnosed with AUD. Following informed consent, patients will be screened for
      eligibility as per in- and exclusion criteria and baseline values will be recorded as per
      outcome measures. All patients will receive a single administration of 25 mg of psilocybin.
      As per safety guidelines patients will be monitored the entire dosing session by study staff
      familiar with the psychedelic effects of psilocybin. In addition, the patients will meet
      before and after the dosing session with a psychologist connected to the study for
      preparation and post-session debriefing, respectively. During dosing session, the
      investigators will collect blood plasma psilocin levels in order to establish
      pharmacokinetics and an estimated brain 5-HT2AR occupancy. When the effects of psilocybin
      subside, the investigators will ask the patients to fill out questionnaires encapsulating the
      psychedelic experience. One week after drug administration the patients are required to meet
      for an end-of-study assessment of outcome measures including adverse events.
