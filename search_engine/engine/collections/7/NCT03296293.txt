      FiO2. The measurements were done bedside on stabilized hemodynamics and intracranial
      pressure. The measurement was discontinued if the following situation presented and remedies
      were applied accordingly: (1) CPP < 60 mmHg (norepinephrine at 0.3~1.0μg/kg.min was used);
      (2) ICP > 25 mmHg (PEEP was restored to 0); (3) increase of pressure plateau > 35 cmH2O
      (tidal volume was decreased and PetCO2 was maintained at 30~35mmHg); (4) SpO2 < 90% (PEEP was
      restored to 0); and (5) suspicion of pneumothorax (PEEP was restored to 0 and chest
      radiography was performed). An equilibration period (at least 90 seconds) was entailed to
      ensure a normalized baseline PetCO2 through modulating tidal volume and respiratory rate.

      ICP, CVP, Pj, and MAP were measured twice or more at each level of PEEP for consecutively
      five days after admission. CPP was calculated according to the following equation:
      CPP=MAP-ICP. The difference between baseline ICP and CVP was categorized into the following
      three groups according to the previous findings: Group I,IVPD ≤ 3mmHg, Group II, 3 < IVPD ≤ 6
      mmHg, Group III, IVPD > 6 mmHg. Relationships between PEEP and ICP, CVP and MAP, CVP and Pj
      were analyzed in each group respectively.
