      study. This project will develop and test a device with the ultimate goal of providing a
      patient operated device to alleviate phantom sound perception, or tinnitus, based on
      patient-feedback for stimulus presentation.

      The device, an electrical-acoustical stimulus timing, is based on physiological findings of
      stimulus-timing-dependent plasticity in somatosensory and auditory nuclei,that when aberrant,
      contribute to tinnitus.
