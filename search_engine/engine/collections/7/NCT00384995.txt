      adverse cardiac events, and higher mortality both in hospital and in the long term.
      Deliberate administration of fluids is recommended to reduce the risk of contrast
      nephropathy. However, data to support specific recommendations are lacking and the optimal
      fluid regimen remains unclear.

      It has been hypothesized that alkalinization of tubular fluid might be beneficial by reducing
      pH dependent free radical levels. A recent trial found a lower frequency of creatinine rise >
      25% within two days of contrast with a 7 hour infusion of isotonic sodium bicarbonate than
      with saline infusion (Merten GJ, JAMA 2004). However, it remains to be proven that
      bicarbonate is superior as this trial has a number of methodological flaws.

      Comparison: IV 1/6 M sodium bicarbonate OR IV 0.9% saline, each isotonic fluid given at the
      same rate of sodium administration (3.25 ml/Kg over 1 hour pre-contrast, followed by 1.1
      ml/Kg/hr for 6 hours for bicarbonate; 3.5 ml/Kg over 1 hour pre-contrast, followed by 1.2
      ml/Kg/hr for 6 hours for saline). Total infusion time 7 hours (for both). Maximum rate of
      fluid permitted is that for a body weight of 110 Kg. Intra-vascular iso- or low-osmolality
      contrast in the minimal dose needed to complete the required imaging.
