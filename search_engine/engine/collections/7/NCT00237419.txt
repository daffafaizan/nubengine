      involves the sacroiliac joints, axial skeleton, entheses and peripheral joints. Chronic
      inflammation of entheses leads to new bone formation, syndesmophytes and ankylosis of joints,
      primarily in the axial skeleton. This leads to a dramatic loss of range of motion and to
      disability. The disease may also have nonskeletal manifestations including uveitis, carditis,
      pulmonary fibrosis and cardiac conduction abnormalities.

      Current therapy for AS is mainly with NSAIDs and physiotherapy which are often insufficient.
      Clinical outcome with conventional therapies has not been good, with 50-70% of patients
      progressing to fusion of the spine by 10 to 15 years. Treatment with the TNF-alpha blocking
      agent infliximab was shown to have definite clinical efficacy in patients with active
      ankylosing spondylitis on a short- and a long-term basis over 2 years.

      There is limited data available on the efficacy and safety of long-term anti-TNF therapy for
      3 and more years, the outcome after discontinuation of anti-TNF therapy and the effect of
      anti-TNF therapy on radiographic progression over a long period of time.

      The ASSERT trial was a 2 year international randomized placebo controlled trial to evaluate
      the efficacy and safety ot treatment with infliximab in patients with active and severe AS.
      The EASIC trial is initiated to follow the European participants of the ASSERT trial for at
      least an additional 2 years of treatment combined with systematic data collection.
