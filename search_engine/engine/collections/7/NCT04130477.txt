        -  Test and formally describe a novel method that utilizes clear aligners paired with
           computer-designed, chairside-fabricated tunnel attachments to achieve tooth movements
           that are challenging for clear aligners.

        -  Conduct a randomized clinical trial to compare the ability of a traditional clear
           aligner system InvisalignÂ® (Align Technology, Santa Clara, CA) and a clear aligner
           system incorporating wire threaded tunnel attachments in:

             -  achieving predicted outcomes; discrepancies in bucco-lingual and inciso-gingival
                positions between the virtual plan and end of treatment intraoral scan and will be
                measured in millimeters and angular discrepancies will be measured in degrees

             -  end of treatment ABO leveling and alignment objective grading scores

      Materials and Methods:

      A virtual set-up is completed by the clinician to plan the position, orientation, and
      dimension will be customized on the teeth to be moved.Generally, they are spherically shaped
      and their dimensions are approximately 2-3 mm. Vacuum-formed attachment template will be made
      to take the shape of a tube-holding spheres, in which tubes are embedded. The tubes are
      standard in size with an outside diameter of 0.032", and an inside diameter of 0.019" and 2
      mm length The template will be loaded with composite after inserting the metal tubes are
      placed in their predetermined location on the tray. Double tubes will be used when torque
      control is needed. 0.016" buccal or lingual round wires will be placed into the tunnel
      attachments along the attachments. Aligners will be delivered to patient to be worn for at
      least 8 hours a day and changed as determined by the Dental Monitoring application.
