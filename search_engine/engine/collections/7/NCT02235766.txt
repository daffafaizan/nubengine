      clips will be transmitted by using an integrated satellite transmission system. All echo
      assessments performed in accordance to the centers clinical practice will be also used to
      investigate the prognostic efficacy of echo parameters in term of response to the cardiac
      resynchronization therapy (CRT). All commercially available multi-chamber CRT-D devices from
      any manufacturers are allowed in this observational study.

      Any compatible market released right atrial, right ventricular and left ventricular lead from
      any manufacturer is allowed.

      The echocardiography device models used to perform echo imaging for all patients
      participating in this analysis are GE Vivid 7, GE Vivid 9 and GE Vivid I, according to the
      model used in the clinical practice of the hospital.
