      noncancer pain: (1) education, (2) standardized patient reported outcomes data collection,
      and (3) evidence-based brief treatment reminders. Practices will be randomized to either
      receive the three novel components (treatment group) or continue with usual care (control
      group).

      Providers in the treatment group will be asked (a) to complete a series of six online
      education modules in pain care, (b) will be given access to new patient reported outcomes
      questionnaire data collected from patients within the electronic health record, (c) asked to
      review this data and related care recommendations during the patient visit, and (d) asked to
      complete baseline and monthly online surveys related to experiences and satisfaction with
      providing care to patients with chronic noncancer pain.

      Providers in the control group will provide care as usual to patients and will be asked to
      complete baseline and monthly online surveys related to experiences and satisfaction with
      providing care to patients with chronic noncancer pain.

      Primary study outcomes include comparison of treatment and control group provider and patient
      satisfaction surveys. Secondary outcome measures include provider referral rates, patient
      outcomes, patient treatments recommended/ordered, and patient service utilization/costs.
