      were edentulous and were divided into two groups: A) with no peri-implant disease; B) with
      peri-implant mucositis affecting one or more implants. Patients with peri-implantitis were
      excluded. All patients in both groups initially received the oral probiotic Lactobacillus
      reuteri Prodentis, followed by placebo. Only the supervisor of the study knew this
      information; clinical examiner and patients were blind. Were studied: crevicular fluid
      volume, modified plaque index, probing depth, modified gingival index, and concentrations of
      interleukin 1Î², interleukin 6 and interleukin 8, and Bacterial load.
