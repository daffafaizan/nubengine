      trial of primary prophylaxis ICD therapy or ILR insertion in patients with LVEF <45% and Late
      Gadolinium Enhancement (LGE) on CMR and

      A prospective observational registry of patients with LVEF <45% and no LGE on CMR. Registry
      patients will not have an intervention but will have the same follow up frequency as the
      randomized patients.

      The Primary objective is to determine if routine CMR guided management strategy of
      implantable defibrillator (ICD) insertion reduces total mortality compared to a conservative
      strategy of implantable loop recorder (ILR) insertion and standard care.

      The secondary objectives include:

        -  To determine if routine CMR guided management strategy of ICD insertion reduces sudden
           cardiac death (SCD) compared to a conservative strategy of ILR insertion and standard
           care.

        -  To ascertain the rate of SCD in patients with DCM and LGE scar across a wide range of
           left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF).

      Statistical analysis will be performed on an intention-to-treat basis. The main analysis of
      time to death from any cause will be performed using a log- rank test.
