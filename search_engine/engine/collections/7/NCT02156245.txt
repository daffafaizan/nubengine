    
      The research will take place in 3 phases:

      PHASE 1 :

      30 healthy volunteers will be included to test tolerance to personalized exercise on an
      eccentric cycle ergometer.

      PHASE 2 :

      15 patients suffering from coronary artery disease (CAD) and 15 patients suffering from
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) will be included to test the same protocol.

      PHASE 3 :

      A total of 169 patients split into 2 parallel groups will be included: a group receiving
      conventional rehabilitation (group A) and the other group receiving eccentric exercise
      combined to conventional rehabilitation (group B).

      Coronary patients: 93 patients will be included (62 patients in group A and 31 in group B).

      COPD patients: 76 patients will be included (38 patients per group).
