pneumonia due to mycoplasma pneumoniaeits incidence in the membership of a co-operative medical groupruth mcmahan, edmund r. clarke, william a. maccoll, and j. thomas graystona total of 1051 cases of pneumonia occurred in72,992 persons who were members of a medicalco-operative in the period december 1, 1963, todecember 31, 1964.  the annual rate of pneumoniawas 12.9 per 1000.  isolation of mycoplasma pneumoniaefrom throat swabs was attempted in overhalf the cases reported, and paired blood specimenswere obtained in one third.  on the basis of laboratoryexamination of these specimens, the incidenceof clinically recognized pneumonia due to m. pneumoniaewas between 1 and 1.5 persons per 1000per year.although peak rates of pneumonia occurred underfive years of age (45 per 1000) pneumonia due to m.pneumoniae was uncommon in this age group.  itwas most common in children five to nine years old,and was frequently the cause of pneumonia in adolescents(ten to nineteen years of age).  the rates inchildren in primary school was twice the averageincidence.  m. pneumoniae pneumonia also differedfrom the pneumonias of other etiology in that itoccurred throughout the year, with no seasonal excesswhereas total pneumonia showed a predominancein winter.the typical clinical syndrome of the pneumoniasin which m. pneumoniae was isolated was one ofprominent systemic manifestations of headache andfever, but few respiratory symptoms occurred exceptcough.  upper-respiratory-tract complaints and anelevated white-cell count were much more frequentin the other pneumonias.  the patients with m.pneumoniae pneumonia were almost never hospitalizedbut suffered significant absenteeism.  theycame from larger families, usually with children ofschool age.  reporting physicians were usually correctin diagnosing these pneumonias as "atypical" or "viral."
