    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, efficacy and safety
      study in children with ADHD in a laboratory classroom setting. The study will be comprised of
      3 periods: Screening (up to 35 days) including a 3 - 5 day ADHD medication washout prior to
      Day -1; Double-blind randomized treatment with either dasotraline (2 mg/day) or placebo for
      14 days; and a final safety evaluation 7 days after last dose. Prior to the start of
      treatment (Day 1) and following the conclusion of the double-blind period (Day 15), subjects
      will undergo a full-day laboratory classroom evaluation in cohorts of up to 18 subjects. Each
      laboratory classroom day will include seven 30-minute simulated classroom sessions where
      trained observers will assess subjects using the Swanson, Kotkin, Agler, M-Flynn, and Pelham
      (SKAMP) Scale. In addition during each classroom session, a 10-minute math test (Permanent
      Product Measure of Performance [PERMP]) will be administered to evaluate sustained attention
      and effort. Seven (± 2) days after the last dose of study drug, subjects will return to the
      clinic and complete safety assessments.

      This study is designed to test the superiority of dasotraline 2 mg/day against placebo based
      on Swanson, Kotkin, Agler, M-Flynn, and Pelham Scale (SKAMP)-Combined score in pediatric
      subjects aged 6-12 years with ADHD who weigh ≤ 30 kg
