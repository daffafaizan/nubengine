    
      Outcome:

      Monitoring the efficacy and safety of PEA in the treatment of patients with ALS. Analysis of
      AChR currents and description of the composition of AChRs subunits in ALS muscles

      Design of the Study:

      A randomized controlled blinded study. Patients with sporadic ALS will receive riluzole alone
      or riluzole+PEA in order to investigate the clinical and electrophysiological effects of
      treatment. The expected number of enrolled patients will be 50.

      All patients satisfying the selection criteria will be randomized into two groups: a first
      group will be treated only with riluzole, the second group with riluzole associated with PEA
      (Normast 600 mg microgranular, 2 sachets/day). The randomization will be done stratifying
      patietns according to type of clinical onset (bulbar vs. spinal). The patients will be
      enrolled in the Department of Neurology and Psychiatry, University of Rome "Sapienza".

      The visits will be performed at 0 (randomization), 3 and 6 months. At each visit the ALS
      Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R), the percentage of predicted forced vital capacity
      (FVC%), the Medical Research Council (MRC) score for muscle strength limited to the right
      upper limbs, and the compound muscle action potentials (CMAP) from right ulnar and phrenic
      nerves will be assessed. A muscle biopsy will be done at the end of the study. The obtained
      results will be compared with those observed in muscle samples from denervated (non-ALS)
      control patients.
