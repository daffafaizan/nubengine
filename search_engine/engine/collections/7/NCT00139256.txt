      undergoing elective cesarean section (ECS) delivery at term or near term gestation (>34 and <
      40 weeks of gestation) is safe and feasible in reducing neonatal respiratory morbidity and
      the related admissions to neonatal intensive care units (NICU).

      The data from this pilot study will be used to support a NIH application for a multicenter
      randomized trial to determine, if compared to placebo treatment, antenatal betamethasone
      initiated 2-7 days prior to an ECS results in decreased occurrence of respiratory morbidity
      and NICU admissions in the newborn.

      The multicenter protocol was recently reviewed by the NICHD network for clinical trial. The
      reviewers were enthusiastic about the scientific merit and public health importance of the
      study but asked for a pilot study to determine feasibility before launching the national
      trial. Given the rise in the rate of CS deliveries, we project substantial health cost
      savings from this preventive strategy if it were found to be successful in reducing neonatal
      morbidity.
