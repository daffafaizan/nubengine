      a dose escalation phase employing a modified 3+3 design with two dose cohorts (30mg and
      45mg). After 6 patients complete the first cycle in a cohort, safety events will be evaluated
      before opening the next dose cohort. Patients will continue on treatment as long as it is
      tolerated and disease progression has not occurred. Phase 2 will occur at the recommended
      dose determined in phase 1 in an additional 25 patients. Another 3 patients will be dosed at
      15mg for collection of pharmacokinetic data. These patients may also escalate to the
      recommended dose and be assessed for efficacy and safety as phase 2 patients.

      Efficacy measures include molecular, cytogenetic, and hematologic response rates at various
      time points; time to response; duration of response; and survival follow-up. Safety measures
      include routine physical and laboratory evaluations, adverse event monitoring, and ECGs.
      Other measures include mutation testing and molecular genetic assessment. Accrual is expected
      to take approximately 12 months, and patients will be followed for survival for up to 60
      months from the last dose of study drug; therefore, the estimated duration of the trial is 72
      months.
