      I. To compare the rate of ctDNA clearance in "ctDNA detected" patients treated with or
      without adjuvant chemotherapy following resection of stage IIA colon cancer. (Phase II) II.
      To compare recurrence-free survival (RFS) in "ctDNA detected" patients treated with or
      without adjuvant chemotherapy following resection of stage IIA colon cancer. (Phase III)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the prevalence of detectable ctDNA in patients with stage IIA colon cancer
      following surgical resection.

      II. To estimate time-to-event outcomes (overall survival [OS], recurrence-free survival
      [RFS], and time to recurrence [TTR]) by ctDNA marker status and treatment for patients with
      resected stage IIA colon cancer.

      III. To estimate the rate of compliance with adjuvant chemotherapy and/or active surveillance
      for patients with resected stage IIA colon cancer.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the association of quantitative ctDNA levels with time to event outcomes (RFS,
      OS, and TTR).

      II. To characterize genomic profiles associated with recurrence using a ctDNA assay in
      patients with resected stage IIA colon cancer.

      III. To model the cost effectiveness of the use of ctDNA versus standard of care in this
      setting.

      IV. To evaluate performance of a ctDNA assay after incorporation of patient tumor and
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I (BLOOD STORED AND TESTED FOR ctDNA LATER): Patients undergo active surveillance.

      ARM II (BLOOD TESTED FOR ctDNA AT BASELINE): Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I (ctDNA DETECTED): At the discretion of the investigator, patients receive either
      oxaliplatin intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on day 1, leucovorin IV over 2 hours on day 1,
      and fluorouracil IV bolus over 2-4 minutes on day 1 and then by continuous IV over 46-48
      hours repeated every 14 days for up to 12 cycles in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity or oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1 and capecitabine orally (PO)
      twice daily (BID) on days 1-14 repeated every 21 days for up to 8 cycles in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      GROUP II (ctDNA NOT DETECTED): Patients undergo active surveillance.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 12 months and then every 6
      months for 2 years.
