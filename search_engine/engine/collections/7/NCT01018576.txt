      age, number of red blood cell transfusions during hospital stay, umbilical cord gas, first
      blood gas following delivery, blood pressure data in the first 24 hours, fluid bolus and
      inotrope requirement in the first 24 hours, incidence of intraventricular hemorrhage and
      late-onset sepsis, peak bilirubin level, length of phototherapy, and Apgar scores.
