    
      rinary incontinence (UI) is defined as involuntary urinary incontinence. In women with COPD,
      chronic coughing can often lead to UI. In this patient group, incontinence may be related to
      functional impairment, concomitant diseases and medications used. The aim of this study was
      to determine the incidence of urinary incontinence in patients with chronic obstructive
      pulmonary disease (COPD) and the factors that may be associated with urinary incontinence.
      The study included individuals who applied to the Pulmonary Diseases Policlinic of SANKO
      University Sani KonukoÄŸlu Practice and Research Hospital and followed up with the diagnosis
      of COPD. The age, sex, height, weight, education level, smoking, exercise habits, fluid
      intake, medications and accompanying diseases such as heart disease, hypertension and
      diabetes will be recorded. Any prolapse or surgery will be questioned and noted. The disease
      severity will be determined by the forced expiratory volume (FEV1) value of the first second
      obtained from pulmonary function tests. Dyspnea score will also be determined by the Modified
      British Research Council (MBRC). Symptoms will be evaluated with the COPD Assessment Test
      (CAT). For urinary incontinence, the ICIQ-SF (International Urinary Incontinence
      Consultation) Questionnaire and Urinary Distress Inventory will be applied. In addition, the
      Leicester Cough Questionnaire will be used to assess your coughing functions, and the
      Activity-Self Assessment will be performed to determine the individual activity adequacy and
      the value of activities for individuals. All evaluations will be done only once with the help
      of the physiotherapist and asking the questions and recording the answers of the individual.
