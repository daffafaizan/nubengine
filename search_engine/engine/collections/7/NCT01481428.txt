      an HIV intervention group (n = 200) or an attention control group. All clients will attend
      their regularly scheduled status hearings which are scheduled approximately every six weeks.
      Clients in the HIV intervention group will receive a brief computerized, self-administered
      HIV risk reduction intervention following each of their first three status hearings. Clients
      in the attention control condition will view a series of educational life-skill videos of
      matched length following each of their first three status hearings. The primary outcome will
      be engagement in high risk behaviors as measured by the Risk Assessment Battery (RAB).
      Secondary HIV-related outcomes will include: (1) rate of HIV testing, (2) condom procurement,
      and (3) self-reported condom use. Tertiary outcomes related to treatment court compliance
      will include: (1) drug court graduation, (2) urinalysis-confirmed drug abstinence, (3) case
      management attendance, and (4) satisfaction with case management. In addition, we will
      conduct preliminary cost and cost-effectiveness analyses on the delivery of the brief
      computerized HIV intervention. Assessments will be conducted at baseline and 9- and 15-months
      post admission.
