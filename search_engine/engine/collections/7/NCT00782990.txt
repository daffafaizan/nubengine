    
      Background: Evidence comparing effectiveness of tension-free vaginal tape (TVT) and Burch's
      colposuspension (CS) in the long term follow-up is weak.

      Objective: To compare TVT with CS as primary treatment for stress incontinence (SUI).

      Design: Randomised, open, comparative trial 3-years follow-up. Participants: 49 consecutive
      35 to 70 years old women with urodynamic SUI. Setting: Urology department of a district
      general hospital at Legan√©s (Madrid), Spain.

      Intervention: 24 patients randomised to TVT and 25 to CS. Measurements: Main outcome:
      Assessment before treatment and at 6-months, 1-year and 3-years postoperatively with the
      incontinence severity symptoms index (ISS) and the incontinence impact symptoms index (IIS)
      Secondary outcome: 3 groups to asses cure rates: cured, improved and failure.
