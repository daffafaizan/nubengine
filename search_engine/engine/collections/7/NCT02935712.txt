    
      Part A will assess the safety and tolerability of SAD of intradermal (ID) injection of
      AZD8601 (modified VEGF-A RNA) and Part B will evaluate the pharmacodynamic effects of ID
      injection of AZD8601 in forearm skin. AZD8601 is a VEGF-A modified RNA under development as a
      novel modality for local production of human VEGF-A protein and is developed for the
      treatment of diabetic patients with ulcers. Each patient in Part A will be involved in the
      study for 7 to 8 weeks. Each patient in Part B will be involved in the study for 5 to 6
      weeks.

      Safety and tolerability variables includes Adverse events (AEs), Vital signs (BP, pulse),
      ECG, Hematology, Clinical chemistry, Urinalysis.

      The study will include patients with T2DM that are on stable doses of 1 to 2 anti-diabetic
      medications. The T2DM patients may also be on medications for comorbidities such as
      hypertension, dyslipidemia, hyperuricemia, thyroid disorders, benign prostate hyperplasia
      etc. (e.g. diuretics, statins, allopurinol, thyroxin), but must be healthy otherwise.
