      symptoms in patients suffering from schizophrenia. The proposed study is set out to compare
      the MEG correlates of negative symptoms in patients suffering from schizophrenia to those of
      healthy controls in terms of both relevant ERP components and quantified (continuous) MEG.

      The presented study will include two parts: Part A will explore the electrophisological
      correlates of negative symptoms in patients suffering from schizophrenia using MEG. The study
      will do so by comparing the electrophisological correlates of schizophrenia patients
      suffering from negative symptoms and stable on psychiatric treatment to those of healthy
      controls. In the second part of the study data from part A of patients that have started new
      add-on treatments for negative symptoms will be compared to parallel data acquired after
      stabilization on the new treatment.
