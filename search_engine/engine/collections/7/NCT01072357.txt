      preventing blood vessels that often occur after a corneal transplantation which are
      considered at "high-risk" for rejection. In many cases these blood vessels lead to the graft
      rejection and eventual failure of the corneal transplant. It is hoped that this treatment
      will increase the chances of corneal graft survival.

      The medication used in this study is called bevacizumab or Avastin (Genentech, Inc). It works
      by inhibiting the action of a molecule called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). VEGF
      is a substance molecule that binds to certain cells to stimulate new blood vessel formation.
      When VEGF is bound to the drug, it cannot stimulate the formation and growth of new blood
      vessels. Growth of blood vessels into the cornea is a complication which can worsen the
      prognosis of your corneal transplant and put the transplant at a higher risk for rejection.
