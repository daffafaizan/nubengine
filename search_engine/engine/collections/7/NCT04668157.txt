      participants with hypertension aged 2 to less than 6 years. This study will look at the
      safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of long-term administration of TAK-536.

      The study will enroll 10 participants. Participants will receive the study drug (TAK-536)
      orally once daily before or after breakfast.

      The initial dose of TAK-536 will be 0.1 mg/kg (not exceeding 2.5 mg/day). After the initial
      dose, TAK-536 will be titrated to 0.2 mg/kg (not exceeding 5 mg/day), 0.4 mg/kg (not
      exceeding 10 mg/day), and 0.8 mg/kg (not exceeding 20 mg/day) if the participants do not
      achieve the target blood pressure and no concerns are found in safety and tolerability.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in Japan. The overall time to participate in this
      study is approximately 56 weeks. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic.
