      clinical evaluation for allergy at this site. Subjects will select their treatment (allergy
      immunotherapy as compared to standard medical care) prior to enrollment in this study.

      Visit 1 will include informed consent, review of inclusion and exclusion criteria and
      phlebotomy for the determination of serum interferon-gamma levels. At the end of this visit,
      diary cards to capture the frequency of symptoms of viral respiratory infections will be
      distributed. Visits 2-5 will occur 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after visit 1 and will include
      review/exchange of diary cards, and phlebotomy for determination of serial serum
      interferon-gamma levels.
