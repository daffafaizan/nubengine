    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine the immunologic response, using a PR1-HLA-A2 tetramer assay, to 4
           subcutaneous injections of PR1 leukemia peptide vaccine formulated in incomplete
           Freund's adjuvant (IFA) followed by sargramostim (GM-CSF) in patients with low- and
           intermediate-1-risk myelodysplastic syndromes.

      Secondary

        -  To determine if non-immunologic responders to 4 subcutaneous injections of PR1 leukemia
           peptide vaccine formulated in IFA followed by GM-CSF can be converted to immunologic
           responders by administering 4 additional doses of this treatment.

        -  To determine the clinical response to 4 or 8 subcutaneous injections of this vaccine.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients will receive proteinase PR1 leukemia peptide vaccine (TVC-PR1) conjugated with
      incomplete Freund's adjuvant administered subcutaneously with sargramostim (GM-CSF). Patients
      will receive a series of four vaccinations at 3-week intervals. Non-immunologic responders
      after 4 doses of vaccine are eligible to receive 4 additional doses of TVC-PR1 vaccine with
      the same dose and same dosing intervals. Patients who mount an immunologic response after 4
      doses will not receive additional doses of TVC-PR1 vaccine.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed monthly for up to 6 months.
