      that when positioning and other non drug related analgesic techniques are used, newborns
      undergoing naso-gastric tube insertion feel less pain.

      Several different techniques were used, such as skin-to-skin contact with the mother and/or
      positioning the infant using appropriate equipment, or the "four hands" technique carried out
      by two health care professionals.

      Neonatal unit staff were able to choose the method used depending on whether the mother was
      present at the time of the procedure.

      In cases where the mother was absent, the "four hands technique" was favored, but in the
      presence of the mother skin-to-skin contact was preferable.
