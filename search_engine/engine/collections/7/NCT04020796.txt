      (CVD). Among the main modifiable environmental factors of hypertension, the investigators
      highlight inadequate eating habits, such as low vegetable consumption. Clinical studies have
      shown that inorganic nitrate from beet juice intake has a protective effect against CVD due
      to reduced blood pressure, inhibition of platelet aggregation and prevention of endothelial
      dysfunction. However, there is still no consensus on its benefits of inorganic nitrate in
      vascular health. Associated with this, there are no previous studies in the literature that
      correlate the acute effects of inorganic nitrate intake on endothelial function assessed by
      microvascular reactivity through laser. The objective of the present study is to evaluate the
      acute effects (single dose) of inorganic nitrate, through the ingestion of beet juice, in the
      vascular parameters and endothelial function of treated hypertensive patients of both sexes.
