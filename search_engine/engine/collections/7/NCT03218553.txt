    
      Background :

      Postoperative complications are major healthcare problems and are associated with a reduced
      short-term and long-term survival after surgery. Corticosteroids may decrease the
      postsurgical SIRS in cardiac surgery, but this treatment is not recommended yet. The aim of
      the current study is to assess the efficiency and the safety of dexamethasone to prevent on
      postoperative complications.

      Methods :

      The PACMAN trial is a multicenter, randomized, controlled, double-blind, two-arms study. 1222
      patients undergoing major surgery (duration >90 minutes and one or more risk factor of
      postoperative complication) are randomized to dexamethasone (0.2mg/kg at the end of the
      surgery and at day1) or to placebo. The primary outcome is a composite outcome of major
      postoperative complication during 14 days after the surgery.

      Analyzes will be conducted, first, on data from the intention-to-treat (ITT) population,
      second, in the modified intention-to-treat (mITT) population as well as in the per-protocol
      population. All statistical analyzes will take into account stratified randomization (cancer
      and type of surgery) and will be adjusted on the center as random effect as.

      Discussion :

      The PACMAN trial is the first randomized controlled trial powered to investigate whether
      perioperative administration of dexamethasone in high risk patients improve outcomes.
