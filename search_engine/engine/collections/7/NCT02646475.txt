    
      This is an outpatient study that requires a screening visit and two study days in the
      Vanderbilt Clinical Research Center. Subjects will be asked to stop taking any medications
      for high blood pressure for at least 2 weeks prior to the study. Subjects will receive
      intravenous angiotensin-(1-7) or saline infusion on two separate study days, with each study
      day lasting approximately four hours. There will be at least one week of washout between
      study days. On each study day, subjects will be instrumented with two intravenous catheters
      (one for blood sampling and one for drug infusion), arm and finger blood pressure cuffs, and
      sticky patches to measure heart rate throughout the study. The investigators will take
      baseline measurements of blood pressure and heart rate and collect blood samples. The
      investigators will also perform a rebreathing test to measure the heart's pumping capacity.
      After baseline measurements, the investigators will infuse angiotensin-(1-7) or saline for 30
      minutes, with blood pressure and heart rate measured every 10 minutes. At the end of 30
      minutes, blood samples will be collected and the rebreathing test will be repeated. The
      investigators will continue the angiotensin-(1-7) or saline infusion for an additional 2
      hours while performing a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp to measure insulin sensitivity.
