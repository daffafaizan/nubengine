      identify susceptibility genes for Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and associated quantitative traits.
      This

      involves the phenotyping and DNA analysis of thousands of individuals living in Finland,
      utilizing a study design that was originally based on affected sib pairs. The majority of
      these samples have already been subjected to a genome scan using microsatellite markers and
      the original FUSION samples. Additionally, thousands of other northern European cases and
      controls have been subjected to genome-wide association (GWA) analysis and/or fine mapping as
      part of the FUSION study. More recently, the opportunity provided by the lowered sequencing
      costs have allowed targeted and/or whole genome sequencing of many of these individuals.
