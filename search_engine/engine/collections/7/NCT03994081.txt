      cortical hyperactivity and causes a clinical improvement.

      Aim 1: To investigate the physiological changes in patients with MDD over the course of a
      5-day, 40 minute stimulation protocol, specifically changes in alpha oscillation power from
      resting state EEG recordings over the course of the intervention (baseline to Day 5 of
      stimulation, to both follow-up visits).

      Aim 2: To elucidate the relationship between changes in EEG and changes in depressive
      symptoms, by comparing the changes in clinical assessments (e.g., MADRS) and the change in
      alpha oscillation power over the course of the intervention (baseline to day 5 of
      stimulation, to both follow-up visits).
