    
      Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is the most severe form of COVID-19 with a
      mortality reaching 50%. To date, no specific therapy has been shown to be effective. During
      an acute viral respiratory infection, lungs are the site of an intense neutrophil
      recruitment. Recruited neutrophils generate NETs (extracellular neutrophil traps) in the
      alveoli and bronchioles. NETs have been shown to be involved in bronchoalveolar congestion
      and amplification of the inflammatory response during viral pneumonia responsible for ARDS.
      Deoxyribonuclease 1 (DNAse 1) is an enzyme capable of cutting apart extracellular DNA
      strands, the backbone of NETs. The administration of recombinant human DNAse 1 (dornase alfa)
      leads to the loosening of the broncho-alveolar mucus and to a reduction in the inflammatory
      response within the alveoli.

      By conducting a randomized, open-label, multicenter, controlled trial, our goal is to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of aerosolized intra-tracheal dornase alfa administration in
      mechanically ventilated patients hospitalized for COVID19-related ARDS.

      This is a randomized, controlled, multicentric, open-label clinical trial to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of dornase alfa administration aerosol, intensive care hospitalized
      patients with COVID19-related ARDS.

      The comparison of D7-D0 between the groups will be carried out using a linear regression
      fitted to the stratification factors.
