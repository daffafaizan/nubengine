      stroke are limited to patients with first-ever ischemic stroke. Therefore, rehabilitation of
      recurrent stroke mainly includes physiotherapy and occupational therapy. Yet, particular
      these patients retain movement impairment relevant for activities of daily living.

      By using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), it is possible to promote
      recovery of connectivity between brain regions, particularly after stroke and thereby improve
      motor performance. Previous data indicate that intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS), a
      protocol of neuromodulation, enhances the effects of subsequent motor training in early
      rehabilitation after stroke.

      The current study aims at investigating whether daily repetitive transcranial magnetic
      stimulation over 8 days combined with subsequent physiotherapy leads to better motor recovery
      in recurrent stroke, compared to control condition, physiotherapy after sham stimulation.
      Motor function, degree of disability and quality of life are examined in order to evaluate
      the effects of iTBS in the rehabilitation of recurrent stroke patients in the first weeks and
      after three months.
