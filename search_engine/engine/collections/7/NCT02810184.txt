      Bone augmentation provides a solution for patients with a severely atrophic jaw to achieve
      immediate fixed prosthetic rehabilitation. Studies reporting total bone volume changes are
      lacking.

      Objectives

      The investigators aim to determine the level of total bone volume remodeling at 6, 24 and 36
      months post-surgery in patients who underwent immediate prosthetic rehabilitation through a
      cranial bone-grafted maxilla in combination with immediate provisional implant (IPI)
      placement.

      Study design

      A prospective, longitudinal study.

      All patients will be recruited at time of pre-surgical consultation.

      During the surgical procedure, autogenous cranial graft reconstruction of the jaw is carried
      out under general anaesthesia.

      Cone-beam CT (CBCT) scans (NewTom VGi evo, QR Verona, Italy) will be taken pre-operatively,
      and at different time-points post-operatively to evaluate the remodeling process of the bone
      after the grafting procedure with implant placements and assess the total bone volume changes
      up to 3 years post-surgically.

      CBCT scans will be send to the oral maxillofacial surgery (OMFS) Research Group within the
      Department of Imaging and Pathology (IMPATH), Catholic University Leuven (liaised with the
      clinical department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery; University Hospital Leuven) for
      analysis of the total bone volume.

      Data related to patient demographics, clinical diagnosis, the surgical procedure, IPI
      stability, and total bone volume at different time-points will be registered by a clinical
      research coordinator.

      Conclusion

      This prospective trial could add important knowledge to the field, and provide indications to
      improve future clinical pre-prosthetic management.
