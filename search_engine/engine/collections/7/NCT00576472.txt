      survivors. Study participants that meet inclusion and exclusion criteria are screened to
      ensure that they have adequate global cognitive functioning (IQ > 50) and have academic and
      attention difficulties that might be managed with MPH. Following the screening phase,
      qualifying participants take part in a two-day, in-clinic, double-blind, cross-over trial
      during which they receive MPH (0.6 mg/kg; maximum dose, 20 mg) and placebo (inert substance)
      in a randomly assigned order. Patients who do not have a significant adverse reaction during
      the two-day trial go on to participate in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      three-week home cross-over trial consisting of placebo, low-dose MPH (0.3 mg/kg; maximum
      dose, 10 mg bid), and moderate-dose MPH (0.6 mg/kg; maximum dose, 20 mg bid). Patients are
      then selected for participation in a 12-month open-label MPH trial if they show improvement
      over placebo on a parent and/or teacher rating of attention during the three-week home
      cross-over trial. The 12-month open-label MPH trial includes individually titrated MPH dosing
      to maximize clinical benefit, monthly monitoring of side effects and regular acquisition of
      parent and teacher ratings of attention and behavior. Laboratory measures of intellectual
      function, attention and memory are conducted at the end of the 12-month trial.
