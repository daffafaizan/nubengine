      evaluate the peri-implant bone loss of immediately loaded versus conventionally loaded
      implants with a single prosthesis. A split-mouth experimental design will be used, and the
      success rate of the installed implants will be determined. Twelve selected patients
      (corresponding to a minimum of 24 surgical implant sites) will receive endosseous Ti dental
      implants. The protocol for preparing the surgical sites will be based on the manufacturer's
      recommendations and bone density. Patients with an initial torque less than 30 NÂ·cm and an
      implant stability quotient (ISQ) less than 60 will be excluded from the research. Envelopes,
      indicating which site is the test site, will be opened after the implants are installed.
      Transfer impressions of the implants receiving immediate loading will be produced so that
      temporary crowns can be made. Temporary crowns will be installed a maximum of 24 hours after
      the surgery, by using the torque recommended by the manufacturer. Appropriate occlusal
      adjustment will be made to ensure minimal contact at maximum intercuspation and absence of
      contacts during protrusive and lateral excursive movements of the jaw. At baseline (time of
      implant installation) and 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after implant installation, the following
      aspects will be evaluated: the initial torque at the moment of implant insertion, Osstell
      ISQ, pain in the implant when subjected to vertical and horizontal forces, clinical mobility
      of the implant, crestal bone loss around the implant (as determined by x-ray evaluation),
      probing depth around the implant, and periodontal pain. These data will be collected for both
      the control/delayed loading group and the test/immediate loading group, followed by
      statistical analysis
