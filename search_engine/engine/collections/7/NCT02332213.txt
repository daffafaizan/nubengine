    
      Patients with established disease (cancer, precancerous lesions) as well as patients
      investigated for the lesions and having been documented lack of the lesions will be enrolled
      to the study at clinical sites in Europe (Latvia, Lithuania). In addition, group of persons
      from general population at average risk for developing the target disease will be also
      enrolled.

      Testing of volatile markers will be conducted by one of two methods: 1) gas chromatography
      coupled to mass spectroscopy (GS-MS) and 2) nanosensor technology.

      Volunteers (including patients with established disease) will be enrolled prior the removal
      of the target lesion (e.g. surgery for cancer or polypectomy in the case of a polyp).

      The study will be conducted by utilizing the experience of institutions in the European Union
      and Israel.
