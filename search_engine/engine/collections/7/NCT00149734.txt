      filtering out unimportant auditory information. They have an inability to appropriately
      inhibit, or gate, sensory information that enters the ear. Standard treatments do not address
      this problem. When the drug ondansetron is taken in addition to typical antipsychotic drugs,
      P50 auditory gating improves. However, ondansetron has not been used with some of the newer,
      atypical antipsychotic drugs. This study will evaluate the effect of combining ondansetron
      with newer, atypical antipsychotic drugs on P50 auditory gating.

      Participants in this double-blind study will be randomly assigned to receive either
      ondansetron or placebo for 3 months. Upon completion of the first 3 months, participants will
      be crossed over to receive the other treatment for an additional 3 months. All participants
      will also take an atypical antipsychotic drug, including olanzapine, quetiapine, or
      aripiprazole. Auditory gating will be assessed using computerized cognitive testing and
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at baseline and Months 3 and 6. Vital signs and
      evoked potentials will be assessed at Weeks 1, 3, and 6. Clinical symptoms and cognitive
      abilities will also be evaluated to determine the effectiveness of ondansetron.
