      alterations in Hear Rate Variability (HRV). Fluctuation in heart rate occurs over a wide
      frequency and demonstrates a broad, irregular variability that suggests that the mechanisms
      involved in cardiovascular regulation interact in a nonlinear manner. Over the past decade,
      there has been an increasing emphasis on applying nonlinear methods of analysis to
      characterize cardiac function, but the studies on the pathophysiology of mood disorders in
      general still remain under a linear and reductionist perspective. The scarcity of both
      Brazilian and international studies on the autonomic behavior in mood disorders in general
      and not only in Major Depressive Disorder, as well as the use of a non-linear reading of the
      results of this study makes an additional tool of analysis.
