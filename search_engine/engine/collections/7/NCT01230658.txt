      regimen irrespective of body mass index (BMI) or actual body weight (ABW). Clinical trials
      suggest that dosing may be inadequate for obese patients. We plan to assess anti-factor-Xa
      concentrations in patients who received prophylactic enoxaparin after bariatric surgery.

      This prospective study will examine 150 anti-factor Xa concentrations from patients 18 years
      or older undergoing primary Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery at St. Vincent Carmel Bariatric
      Center of Excellence. Patients receive varying prophylactic enoxaparin regimens at the
      surgeon's discretion. Anti-factor-Xa concentrations are obtained at steady state.
