      WMH is caused by a loss of expectancy effects, Investigators will evaluate 130 outpatients
      with LLD at baseline to determine their degree of ED (interference score on Stroop Color-Word
      Test), WMH burden (severity score on Fazekas modified Coffey Rating Scale derived from
      anatomical MRI), and white matter tract integrity (using diffusion tensor imaging [DTI]).
      Building on work from the investigators K23 Award, the investigator will manipulate
      participants' expectancy of improvement in an 8-week duration antidepressant trial by
      randomizing patients between open administration of escitalopram (i.e., high expectancy) and
      placebo-controlled administration of escitalopram (i.e., low expectancy). The difference in
      antidepressant response observed between open and placebo-controlled medication treatment is
      a measure of the expectancy contribution to outcome, which is substantial in younger
      depressed adults but investigators hypothesize this will be diminished in LLD patients with
      ED and WMH.
