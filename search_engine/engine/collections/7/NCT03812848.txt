      used correctly is anticoagulants. It is not clear if medication errors are more common with
      this category in specific compared to other medication categories, but the ramifications of a
      medication error with the use of anticoagulation agents is without a doubt detrimental to the
      patient's health and more serious than most of other drug categories.

      This prospective study evaluates the impact of implementing an anticoagulation stewardship
      program, led by clinical pharmacists, on anticoagulation therapy outcomes during patient
      hospitalization by the percent of medication errors reduction, percent of adverse drug events
      reduction, and percent of evidence-based guidelines compliance improvement.
