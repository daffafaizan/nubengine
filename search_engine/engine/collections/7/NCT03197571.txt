    
      The initial 3 subjects will be enrolled in a staggered fashion, with a 21-day interval
      between each subject to enable the assessment of any acute and subacute toxicities, unless
      data are available from other NANT cancer vaccine studies suggesting the combination therapy
      is tolerable.

      Treatment will be administered in 2 phases, an induction and a maintenance phase, as
      described below. Subjects will continue induction treatment for up to 1 year. Treatment in
      the study will be discontinued if the subject experiences progressive disease (PD) or
      unacceptable toxicity (not correctable with dose reduction), withdraws consent, or if the
      Investigator feels it is no longer in the subject's best interest to continue treatment.
      Those who have a complete response (CR) in the induction phase will enter the maintenance
      phase of the study. Subjects may remain on the maintenance phase of the study for up to 1
      year. Treatment will continue in the maintenance phase until the subject experiences PD or
      unacceptable toxicity (not correctable with dose reduction), withdraws consent, or if the
      Investigator feels it is no longer in the subject's best interest to continue treatment.
