      knee extension degree must be lower than 60 when the hip flexed to 90 degree. Exclusion
      criteria are; undergoingsurgery for knee pathologies, having a systemic and inflammatory
      disease targeting this region, having a knee disorder, pregnancy, malignancy, doing regularly
      another exercise programme. According to our criteria 60 participants will be randomised into
      four groups. Group 1 will receive 20 minutes hotpacks and will do hamstring self stretching
      exercise 3 times for 15 seconds. Participants will do self stretching hamstring exercise at
      supine position lying and they will use a band for stretching. Group II will receive 20
      minutes infrared at prone position and will do self stretching exercise 3 times for 15
      seconds. Participants will do self stretching hamstring exercise at supine position lying and
      they will use a band for stretching.

      Group III will receive 5 minutes 1MHz ultrasound therapy and will do self stretching exercise
      for 18 sessions 3 times per week. Participants will do self stretching hamstring exercise at
      supine position lying and they will use a band for stretching 3 times for 15 seconds. Group
      IV will do only hamstring self stretching exercise therapy for 18 sessions 3 times per week.
      Participants will do self stretching hamstring exercise at supine position lying and they
      will use a band for stretching 3 times for 15 seconds. Outcome measures are Range of Motion
      and hamstring flexibility. Range of Motion will be assed by using universal goniometer for
      knee and hip joints. Hamstring flexibility will be assed with active knee extension test by
      using universal goniometer. All measurements will done 3 times and average of scores will be
      taken. Outcomes will be recorded before and after the end of the treatment. All assessments
      were made by the same researcher before and after treatment.
