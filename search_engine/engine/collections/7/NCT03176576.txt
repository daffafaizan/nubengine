    
      Up to 80 participants may be recruited to this study at Moffitt Cancer Center to obtain a
      final sample size of 60 completed participants.

      Participants will be identified in consultation with the patient's primary oncologist and
      program social worker. A research assistant (RA) will verify eligibility and consent eligible
      patients.

      After completing a baseline questionnaire, participants will be randomly placed into one of
      two groups. Both groups will receive their normal care, but one group will also meet with a
      patient navigator. Participants in both groups will be asked to complete a follow-up
      questionnaire approximately 8 to 10 weeks from when they complete the baseline questionnaire.
      The follow-up questionnaire will take about 15 to 20 minutes to complete.

      Participation in the study will last about 10 weeks.
