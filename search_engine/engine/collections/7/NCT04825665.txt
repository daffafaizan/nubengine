      radiographs is common but detecting only resorption after 60-70% of the mineralized tissue is
      already lost. Moreover, they only provide two-dimensional information, identifying apical
      change primarily. Also, radiographs cannot indicate if the process of root resorption is
      still active for monitoring its progress and additional radiation exposure to the patient
      will be needed. Therefore, a safer, more reliable alternative method to clinically diagnose
      early stages of root resorption is needed and may include detecting biomarkers in gingival
      crevicular fluid. Furthermore, the relationship between the manner of orthodontic force
      application and orthodontically induced root resorption is under study. It has been suggested
      that pausing orthodontic forces during treatment may reduce the amount of root resorption,
      likely due to cementum repair during the inactive period. This is important specifically in
      individuals who are biologically and genetically prone to root resorption. The aim of the
      study is to compare the extent of root resorption between controlled continuous and
      intermittent orthodontic forces using levels of dentin phosphoprotein in gingival crevicular
      fluid.
