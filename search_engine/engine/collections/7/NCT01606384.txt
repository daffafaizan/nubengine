      screening and baseline period. Segment B was a 4-week, double-blind period. After the last
      dose of double-blind study medication in Segment B, all patients had to enter Segment C, a
      1-week drug-free, follow-up period.

      The total study duration for one patient participating in all segments of the study was 6
      weeks.
