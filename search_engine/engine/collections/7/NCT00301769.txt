      I. Establish the maximum tolerated dose of SJG-136 in patients with relapsed or refractory
      acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) myelodysplastic syndrome
      (MDS), chronic myelogenous leukemia in blastic phase (CML-BP), or chronic lymphocytic
      leukemia (CLL).

      II. Determine dose-limiting toxicities and pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive SJG-136 IV over 15 minutes on days 1-5. Courses repeat every 21 days in the
      absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of SJG-136 until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. A total of 10 patients are treated at the MTD.
