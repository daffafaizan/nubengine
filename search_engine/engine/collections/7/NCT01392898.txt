    
      Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus on short-term (≤ 12 months) insulin therapy with
      concomitant documented weight gain of ≥ 4 % body weight will be selected and treated with
      liraglutide 1.8 mg sc q.d. for 26 weeks and compared to patients receiving standard care
      (continuation of insulin therapy without liraglutide) in an open-label, randomized study.
      After 26 weeks, patients receiving standard care will subsequently be treated with
      liraglutide for 26 weeks. The group on active liraglutide treatment will continue for an
      additional 26 weeks. In this way all patients can benefit from liraglutide.

      All subjects will continue insulin therapy and oral hypoglycaemic agents (SU derivatives and
      metformin allowed) treatment. With respect to safety in order to avoid hypoglycaemic events,
      total insulin dose will be decreased by 20% when starting liraglutide. Within the first weeks
      after start of study medication patients will perform frequently self-measured capillary
      blood glucose profiles and will be instructed to adjust insulin dose if necessary. Initially,
      insulin dose will be adjusted weekly by telephone consultation. Thereafter, patients will
      perform blood glucose profiles prior to every outpatient visit. A liraglutide-insulin
      titration algorithm will be used to adjust insulin dose. Every 4-6 weeks patients will visit
      the hospital to assess body weight, to adjust insulin dose and to check for adverse events.
