      di-peptide breath tests in patients with chronic pancreatitis(CP) and show correlation with
      secretin stimulated endoscopic Pancreatic Function Test (ePFT). Furthermore, a second purpose
      is to assess the ability to differentiate between non patients with chronic pancreatitis and
      those without. Approximately 30 subjects will be tested with both methods within two weeks of
      each other.
