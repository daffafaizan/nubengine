    
      This study is a randomized, controlled trial of orthopaedic trauma patients presenting to a
      single academic level one trauma center that require an extended course of venous
      thromboembolism event chemoprophylaxis. The goal is to compare oral rivaroxaban with our
      standard-of-care, injectable enoxaparin in orthopaedic trauma patients to determine if orally
      administered rivaroxaban once daily carries greater compliance and overall satisfaction than
      enoxaparin self-administered by subcutaneous injection once daily.

      All patients included in the study would be treated with the standard enoxaparin 40 milligram
      injection while an inpatient. Upon hospital discharge, those requiring extended venous
      thromboembolism event chemoprophylaxis will be randomized to receive 20 days of either
      self-injected enoxaparin 40 milligrams or oral rivaroxaban,10 milligrams, a non-vitamin K
      oral anticoagulant. Both groups will then receive our current standard of care, aspirin 81
      milligrams once daily for the remaining 3 weeks, for a total of 6 weeks of venous
      thromboembolism event chemoprophylaxis. Routine postoperative care will be provided by the
      treating surgeon.
