      increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Oral contraceptives (OC) have been the
      mainstay of PCOS pharmacological therapy for decades. However, in non-hyperandrogenic women,
      OC use is associated with higher risk of cardiovascular disease, raising concern about a
      possible worsening of the unfavorable metabolic and cardiovascular profile of PCOS patients.
      There is lack of evidence about the impact of PCOS pharmacological therapies on
      cardiovascular risk markers and the long-term safety of these drugs in PCOS has not been
      established. The aim of this study is to compare the effect of an OC alone or associated with
      an anti-androgenic drug (spironolactone) on echografic cardiovascular risk markers, metabolic
      and hemostatic variables.
