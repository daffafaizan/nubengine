      should be more rewarding in terms of understanding the link between inflammation burst and
      muscle disease in COPD. We have recently acquired experimental data supporting a role for the
      ubiquitin proteasome pathway in the worsening of limb muscle structure and function during an
      acute exacerbation, providing a solid framework for this investigation. The overall objective
      of this proposal is to substantiate these preliminary findings and elucidate how systemic
      inflammation during acute COPD exacerbation may affect limb muscles. Ultimately, our research
      could open new therapeutic avenues to minimize the systemic consequences of an acute
      exacerbation.
