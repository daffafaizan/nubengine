    
      This is a prospective randomised study investigating the use of chromoendoscopy and confocal
      laser endomicroscopy for the detection of preneoplastic neoplasm in patients at high-risk of
      gastric cancer. Patients are randomised to undergo upper endoscopy using either confocal
      laser endomicroscopy or standard whitelight endoscopy to investigate for gastric
      preneoplastic and neoplastic lesions.Results are compared to histopathologic diagnosis made
      on biopsies obtained during endoscopy.
