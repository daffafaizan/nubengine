      States 1. Squamous cell carcinomas account for more than 90% of head and neck cancer cases.
      Patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC) usually present with
      locoregionally advanced disease. Initial presentation with distant metastasis may occur in
      about 10% of all patients. However, recurrence of disease either in local or distant sites
      after potentially curative treatment with surgery, radiation, and/or chemotherapy occurs in
      more than 50% of patients. Therefore, the majority of patients with HNSCC develop recurrent
      or metastatic disease during the course of their illness. These patients have a dismal
      prognosis with a median survival of 6-9 months 2-4.

      Active single agents in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma include methotrexate,
      bleomycin, cisplatin, carboplatin, 5-FU, paclitaxel, docetaxel, and CPT-11. A small
      randomized study showed that cisplatin monotherapy prolongs survival compared with best
      supportive care 5. Response rates for single agents range between 10-40% 2, 4, 6, 7.
      Combination chemotherapy with platinum agents, in spite of achieving higher response rates
      (about 30% in phase III trials), has not been shown to produce a survival benefit compared to
      single agents in randomized comparisons in recurrent/metastatic head and neck cancer 2, 4.
