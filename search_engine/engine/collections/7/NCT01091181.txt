      Defective healing can lead to serious complications in the next pregnancy and delivery.
      Different surgical techniques can be used for a Caesarean section.

      The aim is to compare two surgical techniques (different ways of opening the uterus), to
      investigate whether one or the other technique leads to fewer defective scars in the uterus.
      Both these techniques are in use at the clinic. After the operation, patients are cared for
      in the normal way.

      Six months after the Caesarean, patients are examined using vaginal ultrasound. Vaginal
      ultrasound allows to see if the scar after the Caesarean has healed well, or if there are
      defects in it.
