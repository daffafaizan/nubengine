    
      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of an algorithm that characterizes
      the cruro-ischiatic fingerprints used in daily life and that issues an alert in case of
      detection of a pressure sore risk defined by the literature on the occupational performance
      of the subjects.

      The resulting assumption is based on the following points:

        -  The algorithms implemented in this device are able to calculate and isolate a number of
           cruro-ischiatic fingerprints used during the day during priority activities and active
           or passive position changes.

        -  They may, in the event of a risk position, issue alerts based on the recommendations.

      This will allow us to analyze the impact of these alerts on the changes in position and
      relief actually performed by the subject, analyze the consequences on the MCRO score
      (psychosocial impact on occupational performance) and verify the impact of visual biofeedback
      on chair positioning.
