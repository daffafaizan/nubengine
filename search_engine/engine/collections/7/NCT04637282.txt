    
      This is a phase 2, open-label, within-subject, dose-titration study to evaluate escalating
      weight-based dose levels of PLX-200, provided as a solution that contains 15 mg/mL PLX-200
      and administered orally or through a gastric/jejunostomy tube using a syringe, as needed,
      twice daily (BID), 30 minutes before breakfast and dinner. Participants will enter the
      Titration Period, during which the starting dose of PLX-200 will be based on participant
      weight. Participants will receive the total daily dose in 2 equal doses approximately 12
      hours apart. Each participant's dose will be titrated upward on a weekly basis during the
      Titration Period, until he or she reaches a maximally tolerated dose (MTD) or the Week 5 dose
      for their weight category. After a participant reaches his or her MTD or the Week 5 dose is
      administered, he or she will complete the Titration Period at that dose and enter the
      Maintenance Period, during which the participant will receive the dose at which he or she
      completed the Titration Period. Safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics will be assessed
      periodically. The Maintenance Period will be dosing of PLX-200 for up to 144 weeks.
