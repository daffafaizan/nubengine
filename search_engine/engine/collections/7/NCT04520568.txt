      decreased dead space, a high concentration of inspiratory oxygen, and positive pressure in
      the oro-laryngeal cavity.Studies have shown that it improves oxygenation in various
      perioperative settings such as the apneic patients, patients with respiratory failure , and
      patients undergoing bronchoscopy
