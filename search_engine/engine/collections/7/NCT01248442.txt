    
      This is a randomized double-blind placebo controlled trial, with the aim to investigate the
      effect of a Vitamin D supplementation on parameters of the immune, endocrine and metabolic
      system in healthy humans without diabetes and obesity.

      The primary aim is to assess the effect of vitamin D supplementation of the number and
      function of peripheral regulatory T-cells (Tregs). The investigators will measure the Tregs
      at baseline and monthly for 3 months. Furthermore the investigators assess additional immune
      cells from the adaptive immunosystem.

      Furthermore the investigators will perform a standard mixed meal tolerance test at baseline
      and 3 months following the supplementation in order to assess the insulin secretion in vivo.
