      medication assisted therapy (MAT) for OUD. The study will examine the neurocognitive effects
      of MAT by comparing two preparations with different pharmacodynamic properties (extended
      release buprenorphine and naltrexone, XRBUP, XRNTX) in three key domains (incentive salience,
      executive functioning, and emotion processing) using task functional Magnetic Resonance
      Imaging (MRI). In the 1st phase of the study, forty treatment-seeking OUD patients will be
      randomized to XRNTX or XRBUP groups after detoxification. Participants will undergo
      medication induction followed by monthly injections and urine toxicology monitoring for 120
      days. Neuroimaging will follow completion of detoxification (pre-treatment) and 15 days after
      the second injection (on-treatment). The second study phase will extend the paradigm to an
      independent sample of 160 additional participants and test the explanatory value of
      MAT-induced changes in the neuroimaging signal in the classification of OUD treatment
      outcomes.
