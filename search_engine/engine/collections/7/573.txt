hypoglycemia, growth retardation, and probableisolated growth hormone deficiency in a1-year-old childa heretofore unreported association of defects, namely hypoglycemia, growthretardation, and deficiency of serum growth hormonelike activity in a1-year-old child is described.  human growth hormone (hgh), 3 mg. a day for 7days, doubled the fasting blood sugar, prevented the postprandial hypoglycemia,and reversed the sensitivity to tolbutamide and leucine.  treatment with 1 mg.of hgh 3 times a week produced a growth of 7 inches in 3 months compared to agrowth of 1 inch in the previous 13 months.  since the protein-bound-iodine andthe response to methopyrapone were normal and the blood level of growth hormonewas low, this case is presented as a probable isolated growth hormonedeficiency.
