      current methods, including web platforms and apps, are often burdensome leading to short-term
      use by the consumer. The solution uses cutting-edge speech and language understanding
      technology to streamline the food logging process. With this technology, the user simply
      describes what they ate and the system automatically selects the appropriate items and
      quantities consumed from the USDA food database, which calculates the nutrition profile of
      the entry.
