      exercise capacity, risk factors and quality of life. The use of new information and
      communication technologies (ICT) allows remote monitoring of activity and rhythm, defining a
      new model of cardiac tele-rehabilitation (CTR) and proving to be safe.

      The investigators intend to evaluate a new model of CR in Phase II in acute coronary syndrome
      (ACS), based on the implementation of the physical exercise program (PEP) in a public sports
      centre (PSC) with tele-monitoring by means of a wearable electronic device, S-PATCH3-Cardio,
      to compare the adherence of a PEP based on a CTR-PSC model with the traditional in-hospital
      program (PEP-H) maintaining the efficacy and safety of the CR program.

      Patients with recent stratified ACS of low and / or moderate risk will be included who will
      be randomly assigned to the PEP-H group who will perform 18 PEP sessions with strength
      training and cardiorespiratory resistance in a hospital, or a CTR-PSC group that performs the
      18 sessions of the PEP with strength training and cardiorespiratory resistance in the PSC.

      All patients will perform the rest of the CR program at the hospital that it includes:
      functional tests, consultations with nurse, cardiologist, rehabilitation doctor, and the
      educational program, with 10 Workshops in a Cardio-healthy Classroom.
