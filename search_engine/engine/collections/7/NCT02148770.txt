      dorsal prefrontal cortex inhibits eating behaviour.

      Study design: A parallel design. Half of the participants will learn to up-regulate activity
      of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), while the other participants will participate
      in sham-training sessions. Adherence to experimental conditions will be assigned randomly,
      based on the participants' enrolment in the study, balanced by gender and binge eating
      classification.

      Study population: 50 overweight and obese (BMI 25-40 kg/m2), but otherwise healthy
      individuals, 18-65 years old.

      Intervention: All participants will participate in a screening day, followed by one
      neurofeedback session day and a follow-up day. During the neurofeedback session, participants
      will undergo a 45 min real-time-fMRI-brain-computer-interface scan in order to learn to
      up-regulate dlPFC activation.

      Main study parameters/endpoints:

        1. The ability to up-regulate dlPFC activity.

        2. Respective effects on eating behaviour. Nature and extent of the burden and risks
           associated with participation: Participants will be scanned once (fMRI). Functional MRI
           is a safe and non-invasive technique.
