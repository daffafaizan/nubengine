      placebo-controlled acute treatment trial. Paired Associative Stimulation (PAS)-induced
      cortical evoked activity and Working Memory (WM) will be assessed in healthy non-smokers and
      non-smokers with SCZ, after five doses of varenicline tartrate (0.5 mg/dose) and placebo
      treatment. PAS will be induced by pairing transcranial magnetic stimulation with peripheral
      nerve stimulation, 25 msec apart (hence PAS-25). In part 1, motor cortex plasticity will be
      assessed as changes in motor evoked potential comparing pre to post PAS up tp 120 min after
      PAS. In part 2, DLPFC evoked cortical activity will be assessed using EEG comparing pre to
      post PAS. Effects of varenicline and PAS-25 on WM will evaluated using a computerized N-back
      task, assessed directly before the PAS testing. The whole experimental session will be
      repeated for each participant twice: once with varenicline tartrate treatment and once with
      placebo treatment, two weeks apart.
