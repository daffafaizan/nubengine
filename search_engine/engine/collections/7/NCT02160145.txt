      in ADPKD patients with late stage 2 to early stage 4 CKD (chronic kidney disease).

      This trial will compare the efficacy of tolvaptan treatment in reducing the annualized change
      in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) from pre-treatment baseline to post-treatment
      follow-up, as compared with placebo, in subjects who tolerate tolvaptan during an initial
      run-in period. The change in eGFR, calculated by the Chronic Kidney Disease-Epidemiology
      (CKD-EPI) formula, will provide kidney function data that are complementary to the data
      demonstrating the benefits previously observed primarily in ADPKD subjects with earlier
      stages of disease.

      Also, it will compare the efficacy of tolvaptan treatment in reducing the decline of
      annualized eGFR slope, as compared with placebo, in this type of subjects. Finally, it will
      compare the overall and hepatic safety profile of tolvaptan with placebo and to compare
      incidence of ADPKD complications (outcomes) during the trial
