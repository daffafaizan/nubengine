    
      A parallel randomized clinical trial was conducted involving 42 patients ages 15 to 25 years
      (mean: 19.5 years) who required orthodontic treatment including the correction of mandibular
      anterior crowding. Eligibility criteria were no active caries, exemplary hygiene, non-
      extraction in the lower arch and no significant tooth size or shape abnormalities. Outcome:
      The primary outcome was the degree of crowding measured on plaster casts using Little's
      Irregularity Index. The secondary outcome was crowding survival time until the occurrence of
      correction in a six-month period. Randomization: The patients were randomly allocated to the
      different groups using sealed opaque envelopes. Blinding: The patients were blinded to the
      group to which they were allocated. Intervention: Patients were treatment with a pre-adjusted
      appliance (0.022 in- Roth prescription). Two nickel-titanium alignment and leveling sequences
      were employed - NiTi archwire: 0.012 in and 0.019 X 0.025 in; and thermal activated NiTi
      archwires: 0.018 in and 0.016 X 0.022 in with different austenite finish temperatures (37ºC
      and 35ºC), which formed the different study groups.
