    
      This is a Phase II, randomized, open-label immunogenicity and safety study of different
      immunization schedules and delivery systems (syringe and needle vs. the Stratis™) in healthy,
      vaccinia-naïve adults 18 years to 40 years of age, inclusive. Approximately 352 subjects will
      be enrolled and randomized to one of four study arms. Study Arm A (N=88) will receive a two
      dose regimen of IMVAMUNE® (1x10^8 TCID50/0.5 mL per dose) via the SC route using a syringe
      and needle on Day 1 and 29. Study Arm B (N=88) will receive a two dose regimen of IMVAMUNE®
      (1x10^8 TCID50/0.5 mL per dose) via the SC route using a syringe and needle on Day 1 and 15.
      Study Arm C (N=88) will receive a two dose regimen of IMVAMUNE® (1x10^8 TCID50/0.5 mL) via
      the SC route using a syringe and needle on Day 1 and 22. Study Arm D (N=88) will receive a
      two dose regimen of IMVAMUNE® (1x10^8 TCID50/0.5 mL) via the SC route using the Stratis™ on
      Day 1 and 29. Immunogenicity assessments will be performed using ELISA and PRNT. Safety
      assessments will be done via solicited injection site and systemic reactions. Unsolicited AEs
      will be collected until 28 days post last injection and SAEs for the duration of the
      subjects' study participation. Safety laboratory assessments will be performed at baseline
      and 14 days after each vaccination. Primary outcome measures: For each subject, the peak PRNT
      will be defined as the highest titer among all available measurements post second
      vaccination; Occurrence of solicited local injection site reactions in subjects receiving
      vaccine via the Stratis™ compared to syringe and needle administration as collected on the
      memory aid and by in clinic assessment. Parent protocol to sub-study 13-0027.
