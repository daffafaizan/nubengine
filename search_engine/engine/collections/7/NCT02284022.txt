      objective of the study is to assess the safety and tolerance of a system for communication
      named P300 speller. The P3Speller is a brain computer interface (BCI) that records the brain
      electric activity with the use of electroencephalography (EEG) and analyzes it in real time
      in order to identify slight changes generated in relation to a visual stimulation (evoked
      potentials). The identification of such brain potentials is translated into a digital command
      for a spelling device. The secondary objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of
      this spelling device with a more traditional assisitve technology called scanner interface. A
      scanner interface uses single clicks that can be obtaines with an adequate interface which
      exploits the remaining muscular activity from a patients.

      Every patient will use each interface (P300 sepller and Scanning) with a randomized order.
      Results will bec o,pared in terms of information flow from the patient to the computer
      expressed in bit rate per minute.
