      applied (electrocardiography - pulse oximetry - non-invasive blood pressure monitor).
      Patients will receive spinal anesthesia with 500 ml rapid crystalloid co-load. Ten milligrams
      heavy bupivacaine in addition to 20 mcg fentanyl will be injected in L3-L4 or L4-L5
      interspace using 25 g spinal needle in the sitting position.

      After spinal block, patients will be randomly allocated into one of two groups:

        -  Phenylephrine group (n=100)

        -  Norepinephrine group (n=100)

      Patients who shows SBP above 140 mmHg or heart rate below 55 bpm after the first vasopressor
      dose will not receive the infusion. The infusion will stop if the SBP was above 140 mmHg or
      if the heart rate was below 55 bpm. Patients will be positioned in the supine position with
      left lateral tilt. Block success will be assessed using pinprick, patients with failed block
      will be excluded from the study. The highest sensory block level will be assessed after 5
      minutes from intrathecal injection. Co-hydration will be continued till maximum of 1.5
      litres.
