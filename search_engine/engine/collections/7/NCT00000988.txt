      drug with significant value but limited use because of toxic effects on the bone marrow. d4T
      has not been tested in humans, but it has inhibited the reproduction of HIV (the virus that
      causes AIDS) in laboratory experiments. In some studies with laboratory animals, d4T was less
      toxic against blood cells than AZT.

      A maximum tolerated dose (MTD) has been found in Phase I trials to date. An MED will be
      determined. The daily dose of d4T is divided into 2 portions and administered approximately
      12 hours apart for 10 weeks. 5 patients receive the initial dose level and successive groups
      of 5 patients enter the study at a lower dose level once 3 patients in the preceding group
      have successfully completed at least 3 weeks of dosing and shown a positive effect on CD4
      cell count and p24 antigen levels. The initial group of patients continue dosing at their
      dose level for an additional 94 weeks as long as they are doing well as measured by p24
      antigen levels and CD4 cell counts. The dose de-escalation scheme continues until a lack of
      efficacy is seen in 2 of 5 patients in any group. Patients are assigned to de-escalating dose
      level treatment groups in the order in which they are enrolled. Blood and urine samples are
      taken regularly to check for toxic effects and therapeutic effectiveness. In each dosing
      group, 3 of 5 patients will be p24 antigen positive greater than or equal to 70 pg/ml, and 2
      of 5 patients will have CDC-defined AIDS.
