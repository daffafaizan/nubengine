      disease and progression of disease is growing. Physicians are increasing using tests and
      technology, including Germline Genetic, Genomic, and Biomarker Testing, to provide insight
      into a healthy individual's risk and an affected individual's disease characteristics, in
      order to provide individualized clinical treatments. However, many barriers to widespread and
      appropriate Germline Genetic, Genomic, and Biomarker Testing persist due to complex
      guidelines for use, varied quality and cost, rapid advances, and adequate understanding of
      appropriate implementation by medical professionals. The iGAP Registry is a multi-center
      ongoing database designed to capture information on disease risk assessment, Germline
      Genetic, Genomic, and Biomarker Testing, and their utilization and impact on treatment
      practices and outcomes to help determine, over time, the most effective use of testing in
      varied patient populations and to support the increased use of precision medicine.
