      appears to be fundamental to the development of CUA especially in end stage renal disease
      patients. This phase 3 double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study is designed to
      assess the effect of SNF472 when added to background care to improve wound healing, as
      evaluated using Bates-Jensen Wound Assessment Tool (BWAT) scoring and pain as reported by the
      subject using a VAS scale. The study consists of a double-blind, randomized, placebo
      controlled period of 12 weeks followed by an open-label period of 12 weeks.. .
