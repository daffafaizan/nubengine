      agents to prevent clotting of their stents. These patients often require non-cardiac surgery
      (NCS) at some stage after their PCI. The rate of major cardiac complications (MACE)in this
      population is very high and it is unclear why they are at higher risk than the general
      population. It is possible their antiplatelet is not adequate, or that surgery causes them to
      be more clot prone. This is a prospective, multicentre observational study.
