    
      Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is an injury to the head caused by an external trauma that can
      lead to brain cell death, inflammation, edema, hemorrhage, and disruption of normal brain
      cell function. mTBI frequently results in persistent functional impairment including problems
      with cognitive function, memory, mood, and other personality disorders.

      There are currently no drugs available to reduce the brain damage or sequelae that result
      from TBI. Clearly, a safe and effective treatment for concussion injury and all forms of TBI
      would be an important development for military personnel as well as the general population.

      This study will investigate the safety and tolerability of treatment with oral administration
      of NNZ-2566 at 35 mg/kg or 70 mg/kg BID in adolescents and adults with mTBI. The study also
      will also investigate measures of efficacy during treatment.
