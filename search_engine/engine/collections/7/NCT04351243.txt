    
      Gimsilumab is a monoclonal antibody against granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor
      (GM-CSF), which is a myeloid cell growth factor and pro- inflammatory cytokine. Late stages
      of COVID-19 can be marked by a "cytokine storm" and the overactivation of inflammatory
      myeloid cells that infiltrate and damage tissue, such as the lungs. Inhibition of GM-CSF may
      be able to reverse this pathology. The anti-GM-CSF mechanism is distinct from antiviral
      therapeutic mechanisms and may provide synergistic effects when used in combination.

      Study KIN-1901-2001 will consist of a 2-week treatment period (last dose Day 8, if
      administered) and a 22-week follow-up period, for a total study duration of 24 weeks for each
      subject. A total of 270 subjects (135 subjects per arm) who have a confirmed diagnosis of
      COVID-19 with clinical evidence of acute lung injury or ARDS will be entered into the trial.

      Subjects will receive a high dose of gimsilumab on Day 1 and a low dose of gimsilumab on Day
      8, or matching placebo (saline solution) on Day 1 and on Day 8. The Day 8 dose will be
      omitted if the subject is discharged from the hospital or is no longer in need of
      supplemental oxygen or ventilatory support for >48 hours.

      The primary objective of Study KIN-1901-2001 is to evaluate the impact of IV treatment with
      gimsilumab on mortality in subjects with lung injury or ARDS secondary to COVID-19.
