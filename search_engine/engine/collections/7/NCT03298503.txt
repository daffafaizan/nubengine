      other concurrent task is being performed. In a postural-suprapostural task, appropriate
      prioritization of is necessary to achieve task goals and maintain postural stability. Some
      studies support that a "posture-first" strategy is favored by patients with Parkinson disease
      (PD) in order to secure stance stability, but this comes at the cost of reduced suprapostural
      performance. In addition, overemphasizing on postural task might deteriorate automatic
      control of posture resulting in increased postural instability, and the best task-priority
      strategy might vary with balance ability of PD patients. Therefore, regarding to impose task
      prioritization in a postural-suprapostural task, the optimal task-priority strategy for PD
      patients is still an issue of debate. With the uses of EEG, EMG and behavioral measures, the
      purpose of this 2-year research project is to investigate the differences in performance
      quality and intrinsic neural mechanisms of a postural-suprapostural task for PD patients, by
      adopting posture-focus and suprapostural-focus strategies during standing and walking. In the
      first year, we will characterize task prioritization effect on reciprocity of a
      postural-suprapostural task, with a special focus on modulation of brain and muscle activity
      patterns in standing posture for early stage (modified H & Y: 1, 1.5 and 2) and moderate
      stage (modified H & Y: 2.5 and 3) PD patients. In the second year, the appropriate task
      prioritization, walking automaticity and power/connectivity of brain areas will be
      investigated in walking for PD patients with/without freezing of gait. The present project is
      expected to have significant contributions not only to gain a better insight to neural
      correlates of concurrent postural and suprapostural tasks with different task prioritization
      under standing and walking, but to optimize treatment strategy for PD patients with balance
      or dual-tasking disturbances.
