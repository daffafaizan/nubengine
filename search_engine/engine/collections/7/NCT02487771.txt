      also numerous observational(not intervention)studies that link higher maternal DHA status
      during pregnancy to higher cognitive function. Intervention studies that increase DHA
      exposure during fetal life and that measure cognitive development of infants are lacking; and
      no study to date has systematically followed children whose mothers were randomly assigned to
      DHA supplementation to school age with regular 6 month assessments of age-appropriate
      assessments of cognitive development. The absence of such studies is a serious limitation
      because there is evidence that differences in cognitive function due to such interventions do
      not become robust until around age 4 years. Women in the US consume low amounts of DHA
      compared to other world populations, and this likely means less DHA transfer to the fetus
      than in many other populations. Prenatal DHA exposure may be more important than postnatal
      exposure, because animal studies show critical windows for brain DHA accumulation in relation
      to effects on neurotransmitters such as serotonin, dopamine and GABA.
