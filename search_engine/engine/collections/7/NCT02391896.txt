      The use of DE to improve radiological contrast was first described by Jacobson et al in 1958;
      followed by Mistretta et al and Alvarez and Macovski in the mid-1970s. With the advent of new
      digital X-ray detectors that provide high dose efficiency and rapid readout of digital X-ray
      projections, there has been renewed interest in using DE x-ray imaging for lung nodule
      detection. More recently, portable x-ray detectors have made bedside DE imaging possible.
      Jabri et. al. presented a portable DE system with novel respiratory and cardiac gating, and
      Hoggarth et. al. investigated the potential for DE subtraction in improving the visualization
      of lung tumors while performing image-guided radiotherapy.

      The investigators group is experienced in investigating DE for lung nodule detection, this
      theoretical framework was instrumental in optimizing a clinical prototype for
      high-performance DE chest X-ray. It identified optimal DE image acquisition and decomposition
      techniques, and validated the approach in comparison to human observer performance. The
      analysis further demonstrated that - given a high-performance flat plate detector, optimal
      acquisition and decomposition - DE chest X-ray is possible at the same dose as conventional
      computer radiography (CR) and digital radiography (DR) chest X-ray, while significantly
      improving conspicuity of subtle lung nodules by the reduction of overlying background noise.
      The DE work undertaken by our group is unique in terms of providing a clear theoretical
      framework for optimizing a clinical prototype for best performance in terms of image quality
      and patient exposure to ionizing radiation.
