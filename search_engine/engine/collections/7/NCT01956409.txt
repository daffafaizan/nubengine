      breast lesion diagnosis was emerging. Imbriaco et al compared the diagnostic performance of
      18F-FDG PET and MRI for suspicious breast lesions, with PET showing a sensitivity of 80% and
      specificity 100%; and MRI revealed a sensitivity of 95% and specificity of 98%. Lim et al
      studied 18F-FDG PET-CT with MRI to monitor treatment response for breast cancer patients
      receiving NAC, with a sensitivity 70% and specificity 72%, and can detect the treatment
      response earlier than conventional imaging.

      However, 18F-FDG is not tumor specific, and searching for an alternative tracer agent as a
      tumor biomarker is necessary. 18F-Fluorocholine (FCH), a choline analog, was used for
      diagnosis of prostate cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), bronchioloalveolar carcinoma,
      brain tumor, since malignant tumors show higher choline metabolites than benign lesions; it
      was reported that FCH PET showed higher sensitivity (88-94%) than 18F-FDG PET (59-68%) in
      detecting HCC. FCH PET was used for staging for prostate cancer, with FCH PET-CT can provide
      sufficient information for management with an accuracy of 88%.
