    
      This is an exploratory study to assess the influence of an opioid antagonist on the
      pharmacokinetics of a strong painkiller when co-administered in a fasted and fed state.

      Determination is by measurement of drug concentrations in the blood at serial collection time
      points pre-dose until 32 hours post-dose, following an administration of a single oral dose.
      Pharmacokinetics parameters of AUC and Cmax are the primary endpoints.
