    
      This is a prospective, multi-center, two-arm, unblinded, randomized controlled trial to
      evaluate the impact of a closed incision negative pressure dressing (PREVENA™ PEEL & PLACE™
      Dressing Kit) on incidence of post-operative wound complications in patients undergoing
      above-the-knee (AKA) or below-the-knee (BKA) amputation. Up to 440 subjects at approximately
      five (5) participating sites will be randomized to receive either the Prevena dressing or a
      standard care dressing. The incision will be assessed for complications at post-op day 5 or
      day 6 and at approximately 30 days after discharge. The primary outcome of this study is
      reported wound complications, including dehiscence (opening of the incision), seroma, lymph
      leak, infection (deep or superficial), hematoma (blood clots), ischemia (decreased blood
      supply), and necrosis (tissue death) A major complication is defined as any wound
      complication requiring intravenous or oral antibiotics, reoperation and/or hospital
      readmission. All data (demographics, medical history, and clinical outcomes) will be
      collected via medical record review
