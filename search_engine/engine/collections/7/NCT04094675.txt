    
      PTEN is a tumor suppressor gene that regulates the cell cycle through the phosphoinositide
      3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mTOR pathway. When germline mutations in PTEN occur, the result is Cowden
      syndrome (or less commonly one of several related disorders collectively called the PTEN
      hamartoma tumor syndrome). This is characterized by the growth of hamartomas and a high risk
      of cancer in multiple organ systems. This includes colon polyps in 92.5% of Cowden syndrome
      patients and 64% with an estimated 50 or more polyps. Although outcomes of this are under
      reported, series suggest 20-38% of patients will receive colectomy.

      Current clinical practice for Cowden syndrome is based on close surveillance for the
      development of cancers. Sirolimus (also known as rapamycin) is a specific inhibitor of mTOR
      that is FDA-approved for immunosuppression and use in several types of cancers as
      chemotherapy. It has also been used successfully in other hamartomatous syndromes including
      lymphangioleiomyomatosis. There is also a completed pilot clinical trial for adults with
      Cowden syndrome in which some had reduction in the number of colon polyps with the use of the
      medication sirolimus for a very short time period.

      This will be an open-label pilot trial to determine whether sirolimus reduces colon polyp
      burden in Cowden syndrome. Sirolimus will be administered for one year. Colonoscopy with
      polyp estimation will be performed at trial entrance and at study completion.
