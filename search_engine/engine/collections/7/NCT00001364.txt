      adults in their most productive years. They cause progressive myelopathy, ultimately causing
      paraplegia or quadriplegia if untreated. Because they are rare lesions, experience with
      treating them in sufficient numbers to permit classification of them, investigation of the
      pathophysiology of myelopathy, and the introduction of new techniques for treatment has been
      possible in only a very few centers in this country. One essential element of investigation
      of them is selective spinal arteriography. Since selective spinal arteriography was first
      introduced for these lesions here at the NIH in the mid 1960's by Drs. John Doppman and
      Giovanni DiChiro, the NIH has been such a center of expertise for patients with spinal
      arteriovenous malformations. Because of this, NIH has been, and is, a national referral
      center for these patients. However, there has never been an approved protocol at the NIH for
      investigation or treatment of these patients. The purpose of this proposal is to present a
      plan of investigation and treatment which will serve as a protocol under which to admit these
      patients and to permit continued accrual of clinical experience with them that will serve to
      guide others in the management of these patients.
