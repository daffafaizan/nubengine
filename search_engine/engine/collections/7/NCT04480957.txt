    
      Randomized, double blinded (study site staff, subjects and Sponsor), placebo controlled,
      adaptive, ascending dose study evaluating administration of ARCT-021 in healthy adult
      subjects. 0.9% sterile saline will serve as a placebo control. Study drug (ARCT-021 or
      control) will be administered as an intramuscular (IM) injection. The study comprises two
      parts. In the Phase 1 part escalating dose levels given as a single injection to younger
      adults (21 to 55 years) will be evaluated sequentially. Two dose levels will be further
      evaluated in the Phase 2 part of the study in two expansion cohorts in younger adults (21 to
      55 years) and in two elderly subject (56 to 80 years) cohorts.
