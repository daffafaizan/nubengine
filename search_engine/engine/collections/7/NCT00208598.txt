    
      This is a body composition analysis study of people self-identifying Maori and non-Maori
      participants from both Dunedin and Invercargill. The study consists of a clinical visit for
      anthropometry and oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), followed by a single Dexa Scan visit.
      Participants meeting all the inclusion criteria were invited to participate in the study.

      Outcome will be determined by examining Dexa Scan data and surrogate clinical endpoints. The
      clinical endpoints include: anthropometric measurements, Dexa analysis, bioelectric
      impedance, and BP measurements, and the biochemical measures of: lipid profile, fasting
      insulin and glucose, liver functions and uric acid levels.
