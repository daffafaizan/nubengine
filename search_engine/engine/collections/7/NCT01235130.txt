      prevalence of AF in the general population has been estimated to be just below 1%, or 300,000
      Canadians, and rising. Current strategies in AF to preserve normal sinus rhythm include
      pharmacological therapy with agents that demonstrate intermediate efficacy and significant
      adverse effects. Newer non-pharmacological strategies such as pulmonary vein ablation are
      suitable for only a minority of patients and are an expensive method of treatment. As a
      result, simple, safe, inexpensive and effective strategies to treat AF and preserve sinus
      rhythm are required given the great health and financial burden that this condition
      represents to our society.

      Omega-3 or "n-3" polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 fatty acids) represent a novel approach to
      the prevention and treatment of AF. N-3 fatty acids have known anti-arrhythmic properties and
      are associated with a lower risk of sudden (arrhythmic) death. Additionally, n-3 fatty acids
      have significant anti-inflammatory properties and potential anti-oxidant effects. Higher
      consumption of non-fried fish was recently shown to confer a lower incidence of new onset AF
      in elderly adults. N-3 fatty acids might therefore represent a useful strategy for
      maintenance of sinus rhythm in patients with AF, given their potential to act on several
      mechanisms simultaneously. We seek to test this hypothesis in the current clinical trial
      proposal.
