      effects, it is necessary to find other adjuncts to combat the disease that are an alternative
      to the use of antibiotics. The use of probiotics has been proposed in the literature as an
      adjunct therapy for the treatment of periodontal diseases, however, few controlled and
      randomized clinical studies have been performed. The objective of this double-blind
      randomized controlled trial will be to evaluate the response of clinical and immunological
      periodontal parameters to the comparison of two different adjuvant therapies (antibiotic and
      probiotic) for the treatment of stages II and III grade B periodontitis. Patients will be
      randomized into 3 groups: Group 1 (n=15): periodontal debridement, Group 2 (n=15):
      periodontal debridement associated with antibiotic (Metronidazole 400 mg + Amoxicillin 500mg)
      and Group 3 (n=15): periodontal debridement associated with probiotic (Lactobacillus
      reuteri). Clinical (plaque index, gingival index, probing depth, gingival recession, relative
      clinical attachment level and periodontal inflamed surface area (PISA) index) and
      immunological data obtained before and after periodontal therapy (baseline, 30 and 90) will
      be consolidated and made available on average ± standard deviation and normality tested using
      the Shapiro-Wilk test. For statistical analysis, the software BioEstat 5.0 (Belém, PA,
      Brazil) will be used, with p-value < 0,05.
