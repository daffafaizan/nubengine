      treatments, 02 seuqences and 02 periods. The objective is to confirm if two formulations of
      topiramate 100 mg, coated tablet, are bioequivalent, after oral, single-dose administration
      under fasting conditions. The test product is topiramate 100 mg produced by Dr. Reddy's
      Laboratories Ltd. and the reference product is Topamax® marketed by Janssen-Cilag
      Farmacêutica Ltda. Twenty-eight healthy male volunteers were evaluated. The volunteers
      received, in each period, the test or the reference formulation, according to the
      randomization list. In each period, blood samples are collected in the following times: 00:00
      (prior to the administration of medication); 00:20; 00:40; 01:00; 01:30; 02:00; 02:30; 03:00;
      03:30; 04:00; 05:00; 06:00; 08:00; 12:00; 16:00; 20:00; 24:00; 48:00; 72:00; 96:00; 120:00;
      144:00; 168:00; 192:00. The comparative bioavailability of the two formulations was evaluated
      based in statistical comparisons of relevant pharmacokinetic parameters, obtained from data
      of drug concentrations in blood.
