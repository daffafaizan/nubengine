    
      Comparison of Ventricular Tachycardia Ablation Strategies in Patients With Ischemic
      Cardiomyopathy (EPI VT) is a prospective multicenter randomized controlled study that is
      planned as a pilot study to include 100 patients. The aim of our study is to assess whether
      endocardial or endocardial-epicardial ablation is superior to the standard approach (i.e.,
      Antiarrhythmic drugs) in the achievement of long-term ventricular tachycardia (VT) treatment
      success. Patients will be stratified into two groups depending on the history of taking
      antiarrhythmic medications (AAD) and each group will be further randomized 1:1 for
      endocardial and epicardial ablation vs endocardial only ablation in group who failed AAD. And
      in the group who didn't fail AADs patients will be randomized 1:1:1 into 3 groups:
      endocardial and epicardial ablation, endocardial only ablation or antiarrhythmic medications.
      Follow up planned at 3, 6 and 12 months, if VT recurrence is noted, repeated procedure
      (according to initially allocated group) or adjustment of medications (if AAD group) will be
      performed. Follow up at 3, 6 and 12 months is also planned after a repeat procedure/
      medications adjustment.

      Primary endpoints include freedom from documented VT episodes (> 30 seconds) at 12 months
      after the first ablation procedure or on antiarrhythmic medication and freedom from
      documented VT episodes (>30 seconds) at 12 months after the second ablation procedure or on
      two antiarrhythmics combined.
