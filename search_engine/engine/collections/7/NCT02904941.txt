    
      Patients with burns that compromise 5% or more of total body surface area will be randomised
      to receive a membrane made out of human amnios or a synthetic cover for the acute phase of
      care. Eligible participants will be children with acute burns (<24 hours) due to hot liquids
      that compromise 5% or more of total body surface area.

      Patients with burns due to fire, hot surfaces or chemical agents, those with delayed
      presentation to the emergency department (>24 hours), and patients with burns that compromise
      the head or scalp (exclusively or in cases where this compromise exceeds 50% of the total
      body surface area affected by the burn). Patients whose parents do not authorise
      participation in this trial will also be excluded.

      Randomisation will be performed by a statistician unaware of the clinical management of
      included patients. The specific allocation sequence will be kept hidden from other
      investigators. Patients, outcome assessors and statisticians will also be kept unaware of
      treatment allocation. Blinding will be achieved by using image analysis software to assess
      the primary endpoint. Due to the intervention's characteristics, it will be impossible to
      perform blinding of the attending surgeon. Analyses will be performed under the intention -
      to - treat principle.

      Amniotic membrane samples will be collected by personnel that shall not provide care for
      included participants. Samples suitable for donation will come from elective caesarean
      sections. Once obtained, amniotic membranes will be stored in sterile containers and then
      sent for irradiation at a facility provided by the Comisión Chilena de Energía Nuclear
      (Chilean Nuclear Energy Comission). This sampling protocol includes exclusion of relevant
      infectious diseases as established by the Chilean Ministry of Health.
