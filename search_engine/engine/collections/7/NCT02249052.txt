      approved drug (XIAFLEX) in the treatment of lipoma (fatty tumors). The fat in the lipoma is
      like normal fat except that it is enclosed in a balloon-like structure which is made of
      collagen (fibrous tissue). Treatment of the lipoma with an injection of XIAFLEX (a protein
      that breaks down collagen fibers) may dissolve the collagen/fibrous strands thereby
      decreasing the size of the lipoma or removing it. Each subject must have two lipomas; one
      lipoma to be treated with placebo and one lipoma to be treated with study drug, both to be
      observed similarly throughout the trial.
