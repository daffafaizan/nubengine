      and impairs the patients' quality of life profoundly. Steroid is one of the conventional
      treatment methods for TLN. However, its response rate was still not so satisfactory (about
      30%-35%).The mechanism of TLN is under exploring and not completely understood. It has been
      proposed recently that chronic oxidative stress and inflammation involve in the pathogenesis
      of radiation-induced late normal tissue injury.

      Edaravone(3-methyl-1-phenyl-2-pyrazolin-5-one), which is proved to be an excellent free
      radical scavenger, has been applied to a wide range of oxidative stress-related
      diseases.Thus, it may exert a therapeutic effect on radiation-induced temporal lobe necrosis.
      To support this hypothesis, the investigators carried out a randomized study of combining
      edaravone with common fundamental management versus common fundamental therapy in patients
      with TLN, and analyzed the Late Effects of Normal Tissues -Subjective, Objective, Management,
      Analytic (LENT/SOMA) scale before and after treatment.
