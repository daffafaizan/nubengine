      diagnosed and treated for cancer. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) is
      considered to be the preferred treatment but until now, there has been limited access for
      most people to CBT-I because it has required an in-person visit with a trained therapist.
      This research study is to test a mobile CBT-I app called MI Sleep Coach to deliver CBT-I. The
      goal of this study is to understand if people are willing to use the app, if they find it
      useful in helping with sleep difficulty and if they are satisfied with using it. The
      investigators hope to use information from this small feasibility study to study the
      effectiveness of the app in a larger group of cancer survivors and ultimately to help cancer
      survivors with sleep difficulties to sleep better.
