      breakdown, with the rise in synthesis greater in magnitude and duration. The time course of
      rates of muscle protein synthesis increase dramatically 24-72h following eccentric exercise,
      even in a non-exercised control leg. This data is consistent with a much larger increase in
      muscle protein breakdown than previously thought. However, the response of muscle protein
      breakdown following damaging eccentric exercise, and its relationship with muscle protein
      synthesis, has not yet been elucidated. Moreover, it is unclear whether a protein and
      polyphenol nutritional intervention influence rates of muscle protein breakdown to accelerate
      recovery. This study will allow us to test the hypothesis that eccentric exercise increases
      rates of muscle protein breakdown independently of muscle contraction per se. If this
      hypothesis is supported, it will highlight that recovery strategies from muscle damage should
      also target supporting muscle protein breakdown.
