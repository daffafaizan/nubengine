      to treat people who have advanced solid tumors or lymphomas for which standard curative or
      life-prolonging treatment did not exist or was no longer effective or tolerable. This study
      evaluated the safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) profile, and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and
      recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of alisertib, as well as any antitumor activity.

      The study enrolled 36 patients. Participants were assigned to one of the two treatment groups
      and received:

        -  Alisertib 30 mg

        -  Alisertib 40 mg All participants took two enteric-coated tablets every 12 hours each day
           for 7 days followed by a 14-day rest period in a 21-day cycle for up to 16 cycles.

      This multi-center trial is conducted in East Asia. The overall time to participate in this
      study was 24 months, unless it was determined that a participant would derive benefit from
      continued therapy beyond 24 months. Participants made multiple visits to the clinic, and were
      contacted up to a maximum of 30 days after last dose of study drug for a follow-up
      assessment.
