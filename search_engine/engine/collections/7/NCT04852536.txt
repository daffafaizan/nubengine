      characteristics related to baseline EEG predict the response of patients with neuropathic
      pain after BPI to the effectiveness of HD-tDCS treatment. An observational, retrospective
      cohort study will be carried out, of predictive response with a quantitative approach, of an
      applied nature, of an exploratory and open-label type, related to the efficacy of HD-tDCS4x1
      in patients with neuropathic pain due to BPI, from an analysis of data obtained from a pilot,
      placebo-controlled, triple-blind, randomized, crossover type clinical trial, in accordance
      with the CONSORT guidelines, which will investigate the effectiveness of treatment with
      HD-tDCS.
