    
      The study design is a prospective, placebo-controlled, randomized controlled trial using a
      convenience sample of 96 pediatric patients presenting for care in the emergency department
      who require an oropharyngeal examination as part of their evaluation. Examinations will be
      performed utilizing either traditional (unflavored) or flavored tongue depressors in a random
      fashion. . Physician/provider investigators will complete a brief survey after each exam as
      to the ease of the exam and the perceived emotional discomfort the exam experienced by the
      subject, both recorded on a visual analog scale. The age and sex of the subject, and the
      education level of the investigator will also be recorded. A single question survey will also
      be provided to the parent/caregiver as to their perception of the discomfort of their child
      during the posterior oropharynx exam using a visual analog scale. Additionally, a single
      question survey will be posed to the subject asking for their discomfort level during the
      exam using the Oucher pediatric pain scale.
