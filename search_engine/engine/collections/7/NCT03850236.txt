      from the gastroduodenal artery and branches of the superior mesenteric artery running in the
      pancreatic head.

      The neck arterial blood supply is probably reduced after pancreatoduodenectomy due to the
      ligation of gastroduodenal artery and collaterals of superior mesenteric artery.

      Postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) is the main complication after pancreatoduodenectomy.
      POPF has an estimated rate of 15 to 30%. So, this complication is frequent and could be
      lethal. Several studies have been driven to identify risks factors of POPF but there are no
      actual data on the impact of the neck division level and neck vascularization on POPF.

      By considering the level of neck division is variable, the investigator hypothesize that a
      long remnant neck, is a risk factor of POPF after pancreatoduodenectomy with pancreatojejunal
      anastomosis.

      The aim of the present study is to integrate this new variable in a logistic regression model
      in addition to well known risk factors of POPF.
