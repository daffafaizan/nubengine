      the foveal avascular zone(FAZ),perifovea vessel density,parafovea vessel density,macular
      thickness,perifovea thickness,parafovea thickness in superficial and deep layers of retina
      with OCT Angiography after cataract surgery,and analysis on the differences of
      EGF,IFN-γ,IL-10,IL-12,IL-1β,IL-6,IL-8,IP-10,MCP-1,VEGF in aqueous humor before surgery
      between diabetic and non-diabetic patients and to explore the potential correlations between
      postoperative complications occurred in retina and diabetes.
