        1. Clinical Trial, Patient Enrollment and Design of Schedule

           The Inclusion criteria and aims are as followings:

             1. Patients with oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (n=180), with age at diagnosis ≥
                20 years, will be enrolled before surgery at Ear-Nose-Throat department inpatient
                or outpatient service by Dr. Liao, Dr. Hsieh, Dr. Wang and co-PIs.

             2. All patients will be subgrouped by pathologic features and risk factors Group A
                (n=90): OSCC, post-surgery, no need for any adjuvant therapy Group B (n=90): OSCC,
                post-surgery, with major risk factor(s) or 2 minor risk factors Stratification by
                Risk factors, alcohol, betel nut chewing and cigarette use status

             3. Testing: Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) (x4) and NGS for WGA and transcriptomes
                (x4)

             4. Endpoints: Loco-regional recurrence, one-year distant metastasis rate, death,
                second primary tumor occurrence.

             5. Exclusion criteria are: (1) Patient's refusal; (2) Poor compliance, cannot
                cooperate for blood sampling for CTCs isolation as time schedule or clinical
                treatment or follow-up (3) Difficult blood sampling; (4) No more needs for CTCs
                evaluation, decided by clinicians.

        2. Whole-Genome Analysis for Cancer Tissue Samples/Circulating Tumor Cells When needed,
           OncoScan™ FFPE Express Extraction will be performed

           Requirements need to be observed when submitting FFPE slices:

           Slices should be sent in 1.5mL conical vials Tumor samples in sections should have a
           surface area of 100 square mm (Minimum) to 1000 square mm (Maximum).

           Normal samples in sections should have a surface area of 200 square mm (Minimum) to 1000
           square mm (Maximum).

           Section thickness should be 10 micron. The range of sections acceptable per sample is
           2-6. Slices for OncoScan analysis and immunohistochemistry study are separated; and will
           be doubly charged by the Dep. of Clinical Pathology.

           The QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue Kit is optimized for purification of DNA from FFPE tissue
           sections.

           OncoScan™ Express Samples will be performed in Chang Gung Memorial Hospital 1J GMRCL
           CoreLab or Chang Gung University Labs for whole-genome analysis.

        3. Negative Selection Method

        4. Positive Selection method (Dynabeads)

        5. ODEP devices

        6. Flow Cytometry and Sorting System
