      in the study. The patients were randomly assigned into 2 groups according to root canal
      instrumentation technique used. In group 1; ProTaper Next (Dentsply Maillefer, Ballaigues,
      Switzerland) instruments with rotational motion, in group 2 TF Adaptive (SybronEndo, Orange,
      CA) instruments with adaptive motion were used for root canal treatments. Root canal
      treatment was carried out in a single visit and the severity of postoperative pain was
      assessed via a four-point pain intensity scale. All the participants were called through the
      phone at 12, 24 and 48h to obtain the pain scores. Data were analyzed using the Mann
      Whitney-U, Friedman and Wilcoxon tests.
