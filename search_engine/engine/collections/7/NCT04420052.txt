      PNIF middle term evolution:

      If the two groups can be compared regarding their socio-demographics characteristics, a
      student's t-test will compare evolution (day 0 before treatment to day 30 before treatment)
      of the PNIF between groups.

      If characteristics are different, a multivariate linear model will be applied.

      PNIF long term evolution:

      The same tests will be made. The evolution will be assessed between day 0 (before treatment)
      and day 180.

      PNIF short term evolution:

      The same tests will be made. The evolution will be assessed before and after treatment at day
      0 and day 30.

      SNOT-22 evolution:

      Mixed effect model will assess the evolution of symptoms from day 0 to day 180

      Response Shift detection:

      For the SNOT-22, an Oort procedure will be performed in order to detect Response shift among
      individuals.
