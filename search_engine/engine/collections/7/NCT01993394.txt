      peacetime flight in combat aircraft, and included 10-min exposure to +1.4 - +3.5 Gz. Subjects
      were exposed three times to this sequence, breathing air, 44.5% O2 or 100% O2.

      Ten volunteers wearing anti-G trousers participated in the study. The Ethics Committee
      Ile-de-France III and the French National Agency for Drug Safety (ANSM) approved the protocol
      (number 2009-A01092-55).

      Three different imaging techniques, electrical impedance tomography (EIT), pulmonary
      ultrasound and chest SPECT/CT were used and compared. EIT enabled ventilation monitoring in
      the human centrifuge, whereas pulmonary ultrasound and SPECT/CT gave functional and
      topographical information before and after exposure to +Gz accelerations. EIT analysis
      focused on regional ventilation, SPECT on global lung ventilation and perfusion, CT on the
      presence of atelectasis, and pulmonary ultrasound analysis looked for comet tails in 64 chest
      areas. Arterial blood pressure was recorded continuously by finger photoplethysmography.
      Cardiac output and stroke volume were computed from these recordings, using three different
      algorithms. Echocardiography was used as reference non-invasive technique for stroke volume
      determination and performed before and after exposure to +Gz accelerations.
