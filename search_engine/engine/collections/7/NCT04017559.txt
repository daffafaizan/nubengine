      Interviewing (MI) is increasingly used to address this, but its effectiveness is unknown. We
      investigated the clinical impact of an MI intervention, delivered by a specifically trained
      pharmacist, on adherence to inhaled antibiotics (IA).

      Adults with CF were recruited through the Regional CF Centre. A pharmacist trained in MI
      delivered three recorded MI sessions over 2 months, with follow up at 3, 4 and 6 months.
      Demographics, ppFEV1, BMI, adherence (IA collection rates) and additional antibiotic use were
      collected during the study and for 6 months prior. Treatment Quality and Satisfaction (TQSM),
      self-reported adherence (Moriskey Medication Adherence Scale-8 (MMAS-8)), Quality Of Life (CF
      Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R)) and sputum Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) density were assessed
      at each study visit. Statistical analysis compared outcomes pre and post-intervention and
      variation during the intervention period.
