      (BCM) are needed to aid understanding regarding the relationship between beta-cell mass and
      function during the course of type 2 diabetes (T2D). This study will provide critical
      information necessary to validate the applicability of exendin-based imaging techniques in
      patients with T2D. The characterization of beta-cells is currently limited to pancreatic
      specimens available at autopsy, as in vivo pancreatic biopsy is associated with complications
      unacceptable in clinical studies. To date, only measurements of circulating C-peptide and
      insulin levels can be obtained, but these measures do not reflect beta-cell mass, only total
      beta-cell function. Reliable imaging biomarkers for non-invasive characterisation of beta
      cell mass are therefore needed. These biomarkers could also be used to validate novel
      therapeutic strategies aimed to increase or preserve BCM or identify whether patients are
      eligible for a certain therapeutic strategy (e.g. when certain amount of beta-cells is
      required). One can also think of identifying early responders to therapies, to avoid
      unnecessary drug use and the accompanying costs.

      The objective of this study is to determine the specificity of Exendin-4 during the course of
      T2D and to examine the role of glycemic control on the correlation between pancreatic
      Exendin-4 uptake, BCM and GLP-1R expression in patients with T2D undergoing (partial)
      pancreatectomy. This will allow examination of the role of glycemic control on exendin uptake
      in humans, but also implementation of clinical guidelines for the interpretation of clinical
      exendin-based scans in patients with T2D to avoid false interpretation of the scans.
