      window of implantation, which is thought to occur from day 22 to 24 of an idealized 28-day
      cycle. Early studies have suggested that assessing endometrial thickness with the use of
      ultrasound may be an alternative to invasive techniques such as endometrial biopsy for
      attempting to determine a receptive endometrium for frozen-thawed embryo transfer (FET).

      A preovulatory endometrial thickness of 7 mm or more is considered to be the cutoff for
      endometrial receptivity, below which many physicians would cancel an embryo transfer.
      However, in most studies in the literature, endometrial thickness was measured either on the
      day of hCG in fresh embryo transfer cases or on the last day of estrogen treatment in thawed
      embryo transfers. There are a limited number of studies evaluating the luteal period, embryo
      transfer day and endometrial thickness.

      Accordingly, in this prospective cohort study is to assess the effect of endometrial
      compaction caused by progesterone effect on pregnancy outcomes
