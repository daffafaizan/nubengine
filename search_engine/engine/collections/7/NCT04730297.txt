      surgical removal of one bony impacted mandibular third molar were enrolled in this,
      single-center, prospective, randomized, triple-blind parallel-group, placebo-controlled,
      clinical trial. Study participants were randomly assigned to three treatment arms. According
      to the concealed allocation, each patient 30 minutes before surgery received paracetamol 500
      mg plus codeine 30 mg (group A), ibuprofen 400 mg (group B) or placebo (group C). Rescue
      therapy allowed in the postoperative period was paracetamol 500 mg plus codeine 30 mg in
      groups A and C and ibuprofen 400 mg in group B. Patients recorded on Numerical Rating
      Scale-11 (NRS-11) the pain intensity, total number of postoperative-supplement medications
      and time of the first intake, until 12-hours after surgery and over extra two days
