      potential to improve anxiety and depression symptoms in people who otherwise would not have
      access to behavioral health care. In this pilot study, participants will include patients who
      present to an orthopedic specialist for chronic musculoskeletal pain and who also endorse
      elevated anxiety and/or depression symptoms. Patients who otherwise do not have access to
      adequate behavioral health resources will be eligible to enroll in the study. Through the
      study, participants will have two months of full access to a commercially available
      smartphone wellness application which offers resources such as cognitive behavioral therapy
      via an artificial chatbot, mindfulness and deep breathing training, and text-based access to
      a human well-being coach. Participants' baseline and 2-month follow-up anxiety and depression
      symptoms will be compared. Qualitative feedback regarding the user experience with the
      smartphone application will also be collected.
