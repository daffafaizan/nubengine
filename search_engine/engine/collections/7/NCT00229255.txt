      defined weight maintenance diet: one group will be given meals twice a day and other group
      will be given eight meals (snacks) per day. At the beginning of the study period and after 4
      weeks following the specified frequency of meals, the study subjects will have their whole
      body insulin sensitivity and hepatic fat content measured by the euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic
      clamp and MRI of the liver, respectively.
