      TMC joint. Different implant designs are included in the study both cemented and uncemented
      implants. Also the influence of patient factors and surgical technique on implant survival is
      investigated. The primary outcome is implant migration and loosening. Evaluation is done by
      monitoring migration and loosening of different implant types using RSA evaluation of the
      implants. Secondary outcomes are patient reported function evaluated with the Disability of
      the arm, shoulder and hand score (DASH) and visual analog pain score (VAS). Tertiary outcome
      is range of movement (ROM) plus grip strength.
