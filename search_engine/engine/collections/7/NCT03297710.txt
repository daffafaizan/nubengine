      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxicity of TAS-102 when
      administered in combination with concurrent radiation therapy in patients with locally
      recurrent or metastatic rectal cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the overall response rate (ORR) to concurrent TAS-102 and radiation therapy
      in patients with locally recurrent or metastatic rectal cancer.

      II. To determine the progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with locally recurrent or
      metastatic rectal cancer who receive concurrent TAS-102 and radiation therapy.

      III. To determine the overall survival (OS) in patients with locally recurrent or metastatic
      rectal cancer who receive combined TAS-102 and radiation therapy.

      IV. To determine quality of life (QoL) among patients with locally recurrent or metastatic
      rectal cancer who receive concurrent TAS-102 and radiation therapy.

      V. To determine the number of patients who are able to undergo surgical resection following
      concurrent treatment with TAS-102 and radiation therapy. Of this subset of patients, the
      investigators will assess rates of pathologic complete response (pCR), tumor regression grade
      (TRG) and rates of R0 resection.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of trifluridine/tipiracil hydrochloride combination
      agent TAS-102.

      Patients receive trifluridine/tipiracil hydrochloride combination agent TAS-102 orally (PO)
      twice daily (BID) and undergo radiation therapy in 10 fractions on days 1-5 and 8-12 in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4-6 weeks, and at 3 and 6
      months.
