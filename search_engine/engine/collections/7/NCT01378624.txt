      in immune cells that are derived from bronchoalveolar lavage in patients with allergic asthma
      following segmental allergen challenge. The goal of this study is to elucidate the pro-
      versus anti-inflammatory function of SP-D molecules and to identify motifs of SP-D that have
      treatment potential in allergic asthma and to assess local inflammation induced by segmental
      allergen challenge by magnetic resonance imaging.

      In addition to the patients with allergic asthma a subgroup of five healthy subjects will be
      included into the study to elucidate the specificity of the SP-D (surfactant protein-D)
      effect on the allergic inflammation in the invitro models.

      The primary objective of this study is to isolate BAL cells for different invitro experiments
      and to assess local inflammation after segmental allergen challenge by MRI in response to the
      applied allergen dose.

      Therefore, following a baseline BAL, allergen (2× individual dose, 1× one tenth of individual
      dose) and saline (1×) will be instilled into four different lung segments during a first
      bronchoscopy. After 24 hours during a second bronchoscopy BAL will be collected in these
      challenged segments to harvest invaded cells for invitro experimentation. In addition,
      bronchial biopsies and epithelial brushes will be taken to assess the degree of local
      inflammation in bronchial mucosa and to study the activation of airway epithelium following
      allergen challenge.
