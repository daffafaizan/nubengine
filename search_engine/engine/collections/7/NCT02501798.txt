      developmental disorder. Besides the behavioural symptoms of ADHD, many children with ADHD
      experience problems with academic activities. More specifically, these children show problems
      with math, spelling and reading. The most common treatment for ADHD is medical treatment with
      methylphenidate (MPH). This treatment is effective in the reduction of ADHD symptoms.
      However, it is unclear whether treatment with MPH can also improve academic activity. If MPH
      improves academic activity, it is of great interest to understand which variables influence
      or mediate this effect. The results from this study can give more insight in the working
      mechanisms and effectiveness of MPH in reducing the academic problems commonly observed in
      children with ADHD.

      Objectives: The main objective of this study is to assess the impact of MPH on academic
      activity and to estimate the role of three putative mediators in this relation.

      Study design and population: This study is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      cross-over design with a patient group and a control group. Main study parameters/endpoints:
      The main study parameters are changes in academic activity (ability, effort and engagement).
      In addition, changes in putative mediators are assessed.
