      status, incidence of peritonitis, and quality of life in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients.
      Therefore, RRF is an important determinant of mortality and morbidity in PD patients.

      Previous studies have suggested that dietary protein restriction supplemented with α-keto
      acids may slow the loss of RRF in chronic kidney disease patients. However, these trials are
      small sample and short-time research. In PD patients, there is very few reports to indicate
      the effect of α-keto acid with restricted protein diet on RRF.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of α-keto acid with restricted
      protein diet on protecting residual renal function in continuous ambulatory peritoneal
      dialysis (CAPD) patients.This is a prospective, double blind randomized, parallel control,
      and multi-center clinical study. 160 patients who meet Inclusion/Exclusion criteria will be
      randomized into α-Keto Acid group or control group at the ratio of 1:1. The α-Keto Acid group
      will use compound α-Keto Acid plus restricted protein diet, while control group will use
      placebo plus restricted protein diet.The α-Keto Acid dosage is 100mg/kg/d daily. The
      restricted protein dosage is 1g/kg/d. The safety and efficacy of α-Keto Acid with restricted
      protein diet on RRF will be evaluated after 1 year treatment.
