      bipolar individuals typically spending three fold as much time depressed as manic or
      hypomanic. Clinicians treating bipolar disorder often struggle to provide relief from
      depressive symptoms that are more often treatment resistant than in unipolar depression. To
      complicate matters further, the risk/benefit ratio of currently available antidepressants is
      a source of debate within the field of psychiatry.

      S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAMe) is a dietary supplement with well-established antidepressant
      properties. SAMe's mechanism of action remains unclear, but it appears to be distinct from
      that of conventional antidepressants. The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of
      these properties on the mood of bipolar subjects with persistent major depression that has
      been unresponsive to standard pharmacotherapy.

      An unusual aspect of the current study design is the schedule of SAMe dosing. SAMe tablets
      will be administered intermittently and in steadily increasing dosages. The purpose of this
      gradual and intermittent dosage titration is to lessen the risk of antidepressant-induced
      mania by seeking the minimum effective oral dose of SAMe.
