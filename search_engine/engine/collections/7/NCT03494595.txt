      thrombotic complications. Studies in both pediatric and adult cohorts estimate an incidence
      of thrombotic events in up to 26% of cases. Hepatic artery and portal vein thrombosis (PVT)
      are reported at rates of 5-15% in pediatric cohorts, which is three to four times the
      incidence in adults. Bleeding estimates are harder to quantify given variability in the
      definition of major bleeding, but range from approximately 5 to 9%.The contribution of
      bleeding to morbidity is difficult to quantify, but thrombotic complications are known to
      reduce graft survival and contribute significantly to adverse outcomes, with mortality rates
      approaching 50% in those with hepatic artery thrombosis.

      Thromboelastometry offers rapid, comprehensive, and global clinical assessment of the
      patients' coagulation status, as demonstrated by several studies.

      Little data exists in the use of thromboelastography (TEG) in pediatric liver
      transplantation. In 2011, Curiel et al implemented pre-transplant TEGs for patients listed
      for liver transplantation. The invistigators sought to examine if there were any correlations
      with preoperative hypercoagulable indices on the TEG and postoperative thrombotic
      complications.The invistigators have identified that a preoperative hypercoagulable TEG
      portends to thrombotic complications in pediatric liver transplant patients. Further studies
      are needed to explore perioperative management strategies for high risk patients to prevent
      the development of postoperative thrombotic complications based upon preoperative TEG
      studies. That's why the invistigators will study the perioperative thromboelastometry as a
      predictor of thrombotic complications during pediatric recipient liver transplantation.
