    
      This is a multicenter, open-label, randomized phase III study to investigate whether
      therapeutic vaccination with IMA901, a mult-peptide cancer vaccine (TUMAP), can prolong
      overall survival in patients with metastatic and/or locally advanced RCC when added to
      standard first-line therapy with sunitinib (primary endpoint).

      Secondary endpoints include a subgroup analysis of overall survival in patients who are
      positive for a prospectively defined primary biomarker signature (identified as being
      predictive for improved clinical outcome in IMA901-vaccinated patients in the previous phase
      II study), progression-free survival (PFS), best overall response, cellular immunomonitoring
      in a subset of patients, and safety. Safety analysis will be based on adverse events (AEs),
      physical examinations, vital signs, hematology, clinical chemistry, urinalysis and ECG
      changes.

      Further endpoints include subgroup analyses of overall survival in patients who are positive
      for further prospectively defined biomarkers (identified in the previous phase II study), and
      exploratory screening of new biomarkers (to be investigated in patients' blood and paraffin
      sections from tumor tissue) to predict better clinical outcome as response to vaccination
      with IMA901. Biomarker sets will not be used for patient selection in this study.
