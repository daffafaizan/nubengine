      anesthesia，and It is closely related to the type of surgery, the length of surgery, and the
      patient's physique.Because head and neck maxillofacial radical surgery requires free flap
      transplantation and longer duration,and hemorrhage is more when the primary focus is
      removed，Intraoperative blood pressure reduction is needed to reduce bleeding，therefore,
      hypoperfusion of craniocerebral blood flow will occur.Low cerebral perfusion is closely
      related to the occurrence of postoperative delirium.Patients undergoing this type of surgery
      have more preoperative complications，hypertension is particularly common.Therefore, this
      study mainly studied the correlation between the preoperative blood pressure level and the
      controlled hypotension level in patients with radical head and neck and maxillofacial tumors
      and the incidence of postoperative delirium.
