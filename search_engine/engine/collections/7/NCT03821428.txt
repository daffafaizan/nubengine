      because of active gagging reflex, which sometimes preclude the performance of TEE and
      requires additional medication. According to existing literature, needling of acupoint CV24
      effectively prevents gagging during dental procedures. We are going to use this phenomenon in
      patients scheduled to TEE in order to reduce discomfort during insertion of TEE probe and
      reduce the need for additional sedative medication. Within this investigation the patients
      will be randomly assigned to receive either verum acupuncture of CV24 and P6 acupoints or
      placebo procedure immediately before TEE examination. As outcome the incidence and intensity
      of gagging, total dose of additional sedative medication and hemodynamic parameters will be
      recorded.
