differentiation of explanted fragments ofearly chick blastodermii. culture on protein-deficient mediumenriched with rnaposterior fragments of head processblastoderms were cultured in vitro for twodays on a protein-deficient medium sup-plemented with various rna's, after whichthey were grafted over the chorio-allantoicmembrane for eight to nine days.pancreatic (adult) rna enhancedthe development of the entodermal epi-thelium.heart (adult) rna caused hyper-plasia of the epidermis with, in some cases,keratinized papillary projections.brain (embryonic) rna produced apapillomatous epidermis with giant epi-dermal cysts that were keratinized andfibrillar as in feather formation.liver (embryonic) rna had no vis-ible tissue modifications.in the controls there was no keratini-zation, nor papillary formation of the epi-dermis.  the epidermal cysts were verysmall, unkeratinized and devoid of fibrillarorganization.the results are discussed in terms ofrelationships of proteins from brain, mus-cle and skin.
