      habit, flatulence and bloating and can sometimes result from slower intestinal transit and
      other digestive irregularities. Digestive discomfort may lead to health issues in the
      long-term. In a recent survey of over 1,000 women in the UK, 88% reported having experienced
      digestive discomfort from time to time, but the majority of them (70%) had never consulted a
      doctor or nurse. Digestive discomfort is often a source of embarrassment for people; they
      therefore may be reluctant to address these issues with a healthcare professional.

      Aquamin is a seaweed-derived mineral source, which is rich in calcium, magnesium and 74 other
      trace minerals including zinc, iron and selenium. It is produced from the red algae,
      Lithothamnion Calcareum, which is found in just three locations in the world, including the
      south-west coast of Ireland and Iceland. During a five-year life span, these algae absorb
      essential minerals from the sea - this gives Aquamin its unique multimineral content. The
      algae then break down naturally and settle on the sea bed. These calcified skeletal remains
      are harvested, washed, dried and milled and provided in a capsule formulation. Aquamin is
      proven to deliver digestive health benefits. In a recent study, mice feed on a high-fat
      'Western-style' diet (HFWD) and Aquamin, suppressed colon polyp formation and a reduction in
      systemic inflammatory changes in comparison to those not receiving Aquamin.

      The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of consuming Aquamin (as AquaCal and
      AquaPT) on digestive discomfort and symptoms amongst adults without diagnosed
      gastrointestinal disorders.
