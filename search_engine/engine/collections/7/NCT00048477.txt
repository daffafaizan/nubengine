      contributes importantly to vasodilator tone of the coronary and systemic circulations by
      activating guanylyl cyclase in vascular smooth muscle, causing relaxation. Although regional
      synthesis of NO by the endothelium contributes to local vasodilator tone, we have shown
      previously that NO may be transported in blood, and have biological effects at a distance
      from the site of entry into the circulation. Thus, we found that NO may be transported bound
      to heme iron in red blood cells and released at vascular sites of deficient NO synthesis,
      restoring vasodilator tone. Another potential source of bioactive NO is via nitrite, formed
      by the auto-oxidation of NO. This study is designed to determine the contribution of nitrite
      transported in blood to forearm microvascular dilator tone in healthy subjects at rest and
      during regional hypoxia associated with forearm exercise stress, with measurements made
      before and after regional blockade of endothelial NO synthesis. Findings in this study may be
      relevant to understanding the physiological contribution and therapeutic potential of nitrite
      in the regulation of vasodilator tone in diseases and conditions associated with regional
      endothelial dysfunction and reduced endothelial NO bioactivity (e.g., hypertension, diabetes
      mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, cigarette smoking, estrogen deficiency).
