      in subjects with moderately to severely active RA who have responded inadequately to TNFi
      therapy. The primary endpoint of the trial is at Week 12. Olokizumab is expected to reduce
      the disease activity and improve physical function. The study is expected to provide safety
      information in a large group of subjects over at least a 24 week period.
