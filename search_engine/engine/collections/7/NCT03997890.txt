      uncomplicated cataract surgery with binocular implantation of either Symfony (ZXR00) or
      Symfony toric (ZXT) IOLs.

      Methods: The postoperative examinations were performed at 4-8 weeks, and 4-6 months
      postoperatively. Binocular corrected (CDVA) and uncorrected (UDVA) distance visual acuity was
      assessed at 4 m using a Snellen chart. Binocular uncorrected intermediate visual acuity
      (UIVA) at 70 cm and binocular uncorrected near visual acuity (UNVA) at 40 cm were assessed
      using the Rosenbaum near vision card.

      A subjective questionnaire on spectacle use, photic phenomena, and satisfaction was
      administered to all patients. Patients were asked how often (never, occasionally, 50% of the
      time, frequently) participants wear spectacles for near, intermediate, and distance
      activities. Non-directed and directed questions were used with regard to visual symptoms.
      Photic phenomena (halos, glare and starbursts) were graded as none, trace, mild, moderate, or
      severe. Patients were asked to rate their level of satisfaction with distance, intermediate,
      and near vision on a scale from 0 (completely dissatisfied) to 10 (completely satisfied).
      Additionally, participants were asked whether participants would choose the same IOL again
      and if participants would recommend the IOL to their friends and family. Surgeons were also
      asked to rate their level of satisfaction on a scale from 0 to 10 in terms of the ease of
      manipulation and implantation of the IOL and the visual performance of the IOL.
