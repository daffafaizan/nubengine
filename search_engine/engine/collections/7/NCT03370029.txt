      healthy individuals will be included. Respiratory muscle strength, anaerobic and aerobic
      exercise capacity, physical activity, pulmonary functions, peripheral muscle strength, cough
      strength, respiratory muscle endurance, activity dyspnea perception, quality of life and
      depression will be evaluated. Primary outcome measurements are respiratory muscle strength,
      exercise capacity, physical activity; secondary outcomes are pulmonary functions, peripheral
      muscle strength, cough strength, respiratory muscle endurance, activity dyspnea perception,
      quality of life and depression.
