      (10-year and longer) results are, however, still disappointing. Where most research has
      focused on immunosuppression and infections, the investigators hypothesize that in renal
      transplant recipient, amongst others overweight, obesity, chronic use of immunosuppressive
      drugs and impaired renal function contribute to insulin resistance and chronic low-grade
      inflammation, which pose the renal transplant recipients at increased risk for cardiovascular
      disease, decline of function of the transplanted kidney and other complications, including
      post-transplant diabetes. To investigate this hypothesis we have detailedly phenotyped 606
      renal transplant recipients who at the time of inclusion all were one year or more after
      transplantation, therewith providing a representation of stable outpatient renal trannsplant
      recipients late after renal transplantation. At the time of these baseline measurements, we
      also created a biobank with plasma, serum and aliquots of 24h urine collections. Beyond
      baseline, we have a regular update on adverse events, including all-cause mortality,
      cause-specific mortality, graft failure and development of new-onset diabetes after
      transplantation (NODAT).
