      the clinical and therapeutic progress of sarcoidosis, in particular in cases of severe
      sarcoidosis refractory to the various therapeutic lines. The main objective of this proposal
      is to evaluate the presence and stage of activation of the JAK/STAT pathway in PBMCs from
      inactive and active sarcoidosis patients. The second objective will be to determine the role
      of the JAK/STAT pathway in the formation and maintenance of granulomas and their association
      with the severity of sarcoidosis and fibrogenesis.
