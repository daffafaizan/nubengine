      intervention modified for a pediatric population. The researchers will modify the
      intervention prior to the evaluation by the 15 typically developing children.

      The second stage of the project will evaluate the effectiveness of an emotional processing
      intervention to improve performance on tests of emotional processing in individuals with TBI.
      Emotional processing includes both facial affect recognition and social perception measures.
