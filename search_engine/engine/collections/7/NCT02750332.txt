    
      The specific aim is to conduct a randomized, single dose, two-period crossover
      bioavailability study in at least 16 healthy male and female subjects at a single study
      center to evaluate the in vivo performance of Test Product, Nitisinone 10 mg Tablet, under
      fasting and fed conditions.

      The study in healthy male and female volunteers is designed to establish a pharmacokinetic
      (PK) profile under fed and fasting conditions for the orally administered Test Product,
      Nitisinone 10 mg Tablets.

      A total of 20 healthy female and male volunteers (age 18 to 55 years old) will be entered
      into the study. Volunteers will be determined to be free of significant medical conditions as
      assessed by medical history, physical examination, and blood and urine tests. Volunteers will
      be randomly allocated to receive the Test Product under fasting or fed conditions.

      There will be a minimum 23 calendar days washout between treatments. Blood samples will be
      collected at pre-dose (0 hours) and at 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 2 hours and
      30 minutes, 3 hours, 3 hours and 30 minutes, 4 hours, 5 hours, 6 hours, 7 hours, 8 hours, 10
      hours, 12 hours, 24 hours, 36 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, 96 hours and 120 hours post-dose
      (total: 21 samples per treatment period).
