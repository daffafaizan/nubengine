    
      This study will be a multicenter, open-label, randomized, comparative, cross-over study of
      high-dose Melphalan HCl for Injection (Propylene Glycol-Free) and Alkeran for Injection
      conducted in 24 patients who have symptomatic MM and qualify for ASCT.

      During the Study Period, patients will be randomized to receive 100mg/m2 of either Melphalan
      HCl for Injection (Propylene Glycol-Free) or Alkeran for Injection on Day -3 and the
      alternate drug product on Day -2. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic (PK) evaluation will be
      withdrawn through an indwelling i.v. cannula each day of melphalan dosing (Day -3 and Day
      -2).

      Following one day of rest after the myeloablative conditioning (Day -1), patients will
      receive an autologous graft.
