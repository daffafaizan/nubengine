    
      Aim: The current study aims to investigate the acute effects of commercially relevant
      interesterified 'hardstock' versus the corresponding un-interesterified blend on 8 h
      postprandial fat metabolism.

      Hypothesis: Interesterification of a palm kernel and palm stearin fat blend, to produce a fat
      with a higher proportion of palmitic acid in the middle position of the triglyceride (TAG;
      but the same fatty acid composition), will alter postprandial lipid metabolism.

      Subjects: Participants will include 24 healthy male and female (postmenopausal) volunteers
      aged between the ages of 45 and 75 years (since during this age metabolic changes start to
      take place).

      Power calculation: Based on previous studies carried out by our group at King's College
      London, a sample size of 10 males and 10 females is required to detect a (clinically
      relevant) difference (for males and females separately) between means of 0.3 mmol/L maximal
      difference in 8 h plasma TAG concentration (standard deviation 0.33 mmol/L, significance
      level (alpha) of 0.05 and 80% power). 12 males and 12 females will be recruited to allow for
      a 20% drop out rate.

      Expected value:The study will provide novel information on the acute effects of commercially
      relevant processed fats on postprandial lipaemia.
