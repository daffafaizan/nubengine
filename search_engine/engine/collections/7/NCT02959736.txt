      diagnosed as Minimally Conscious or Vegetative State, will be recruited. All participants
      will be assessed using the Music Therapy Assessment Tool for Awareness in Disorders of
      Consciousness (MATADOC) standardized protocol. Assessment intervention will take place in
      four individual clinical contacts, over a 16 day period. Data will be collected using the
      MATADOC rating form and scored according to the MATADOC manual. Participants will
      concurrently be assessed with Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R).

      The MATADOC is implemented by Music Therapists who have been trained in its use and who are
      experienced in working with adults with PDOC. CRS-R data will be collected by members of the
      treatment team who are experienced or trained in its use. MATADOC and CRS-R assessors will
      remain blinded to the data collected.

      Analysis will compare diagnostic outcomes of the two measures as well as explore the function
      of comparable items of each measure across similar domains (e.g. auditory, visual).
