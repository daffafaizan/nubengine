    
      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study. Patients are
      stratified by age (over and under 60). Patients are randomized to receive either sham surgery
      or tissue implantation.

      Embryonic tissue is prepared. While patients are awake, but sedated, bilateral incisions are
      made in the skin and burr holes drilled in the skull. A cannula is inserted into the brain to
      the posterior putamen. Implant patients receive embryonic neural tissue or sham patients have
      no needles penetrate the brain. After 1 year, patients who receive the sham operation in the
      first operation may receive embryonic neural tissue in a second operation.

      Patients are followed every 4 months during the first year and every 6 months thereafter.
