      participants will receive a standardized battery of neuropsychological tests and will undergo
      genetic testing. The investigators will provide standardized periodic longitudinal assessment
      of the research participants. Autopsies to establish neurohistopathological diagnoses in
      clinically well-characterized patients with dementia, patients with mild MCI, and cognitively
      normal elderly control subjects will also be conducted.
