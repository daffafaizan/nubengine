      stabilization of the vertebral column, is currently performed by using large amounts of
      autologous bone graft or autograft. A substitute for this patient own bone would eliminate
      the graft harvesting morbidity that is currently one of the main disadvantages. Recently, a
      promising synthetic graft substitute has been developed that has shown favorable results in
      pre-clinical studies. This product is AttraX速 Putty (CE-557130), a bioresorbable tricalcium
      phosphate (TCP), mixed with a fast resorbing polymer carrier to improve surgical handling.
      The aim of the current study is to clinically investigate AttraX速 Putty as an alternative to
      autologous bone graft in adult patients qualified for instrumented posterolateral fusion of
      the thoracolumbar spine (T10-S1).

      The study design is a patient and observer blinded, controlled, randomized, multi-center
      clinical trial with intra-patient comparisons. This means that each patient is it owns
      control. According to a randomization scheme, one side of the spine will be grafted with
      AttraX速 Putty the other side receives bone harvest from the iliac crest, which is currently
      the gold standard.

      The primary outcomes of this study are the posterior spinal fusion rate after one year (based
      on CT-scans), and potential serious adverse events related with AttraX速 Putty. Secondary
      outcomes are the resorption characteristics during the first year, volume of bridging bone
      mass after one year, evaluation of iliac crest pain, correlation of the posterior fusion rate
      to the presence of interbody fusion after one year and the posterior spinal fusion rate after
      two years.
