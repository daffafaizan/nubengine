      the in vivo estrogenic activity of BPA (Bisphenol-A), when BPA is being leached into the
      circulation by the Fresenius 160NR dialyzer as opposed to the same biochemical changes when
      there is no BPA being leached, as with the non-BPA containing Nipro Elisio-15H dialyzer. The
      estrogen dependent biochemical end points in humans include free testosterone, sex hormone
      binding globulin (SHBG) and thyroid binding globulin (TBG).
