      research centers in China. All participants met the inclusion criteria will be 1:1 randomized
      to 3 months or 12 month of DAPT after implanting Firehawkâ„¢ coronary stent.Clinical follow-up
      will be carried out at 30 days, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, 2 years and 3 years
      after index procedure.The primary study endpoint is Net Adverse Clinical and Cerebral Events
      (NACCE), a composite of all-cause death, myocardial infarction (MI), cerebral vascular
      accident (CVA) and major bleeding (academic research consortium [ARC] definition and GUSTO
      definition) at 18 months. Subjects that complete of 18 months follow-up will be regarded as
      having completed the primary endpoint. The secondary study endpoints contain ARC defined
      stent thrombosis (ST) at all study time-points; NACCE at 30 days,6,12,24 and 36 months of
      follow-up;major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE),major adverse cardiovascular and
      cerebral events (MACCE),target lesion revascularization (TLR),target lesion failure(TLF),ST
      at 30 days,6,12 ,18,24 and 36 months of follow-up; major bleeding at 1, 3, 6, 12 ,18,24 and
      36 months of follow up; as well as cost-effective at 18 months of follow-up.
