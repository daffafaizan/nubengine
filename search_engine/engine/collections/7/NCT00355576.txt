      and inflammation likely all contribute to neurodegeneration in ALS. Past trials may have been
      negative in part because they tested single agents, usually influencing only one mechanism of
      cell death. Combinations of agents that affect different and multiple mechanisms of
      neurodegeneration may be necessary to reach meaningful outcomes in trials of ALS.

      This trial has several unique features. First, it compares the neuroprotective potential of
      two combinations of agents that impact multiple mechanisms of cell death. The combinations of
      minocycline/creatine and celecoxib/creatine are the only agents that have had additive
      effects in the mouse model of ALS, reducing neurodegeneration and prolonging survival more
      than individual agents alone. Second, it uses an important new phase II selection trial
      design to determine which combination is superior. Not only does this trial test combination
      therapy, but there is no placebo, so everyone who enrolls in the trial will receive active
      treatment.

      Minocycline, creatine and celecoxib have been tested individually and have been shown to be
      safe in patients with ALS. This will be the first time human trials will be conducted with
      combinations of minocycline/creatine and celecoxib/creatine.

      We will compare combinations of drugs in a phase II trial design to determine which
      combination is superior. If successful, this trial will lead directly to a phase III trial of
      the selected combination. If the design is found useful, this trial will lead to larger phase
      II selection trials assessing greater numbers of agents simultaneously, thereby improving the
      efficiency of drug screening in ALS.
