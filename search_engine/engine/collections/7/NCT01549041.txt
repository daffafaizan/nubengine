      Hospital (CRH) for a psychotic exacerbation of schizophrenia or schizo-affective disorder to
      14 days of treatment with either asenapine 5 mg BID or asenapine 10 mg QHS.

      The investigators will assess patient and staff acceptance on day 14. The investigators will
      assess staff acceptance on day 14. The investigators will assess changes in psychopathology
      (Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale) from baseline to day 14.

      The investigators propose to achieve the following specific aims:

        1. To compare the patient acceptance of once daily versus twice daily asenapine; The
           investigators hypothesize that patient acceptance will be better for asenapine 10 mg QHS
           than for asenapine 5 mg BID at day 14

        2. To compare the staff (medication nurses) acceptance of once daily versus twice daily
           asenapine; the investigators hypothesize that staff acceptance will be better for
           asenapine 10 mg QHS than for asenapine 5 mg BID at day 14

        3. To compare the changes in psychopathology with once daily versus twice daily asenapine;
           the investigators hypothesize that changes in psychopathology from baseline to day 14
           will be similar for the two dosing strategies
