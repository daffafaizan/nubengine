      leucocyte activation seem to be involved in the pathogenesis. The aim of our study is to
      compare SIPA, platelet activation and platelet-leucocytes aggregates on the onset of the ACS
      and 3 months later in 2 groups of patients scheduled for a first episode of ACS or recurrent
      ACS .
