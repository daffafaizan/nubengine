      as this time is when young individuals begin to transition to independence and thus are
      adopting health behaviors that will be carried into later adulthood. Unfortunately, this time
      period is often marked by decreases in physical activity and dietary quality. Working with
      young adults as they establish their first independent living situation can help set the
      foundation for behaviors that may aid with lifelong weight management and chronic disease
      prevention. Foundations for Health is the first study to examine the effect of a web-based
      lifestyle modification program in combination with culinary skills or lifestyle skills
      training sessions on weight loss, dietary intake, and meal preparation behaviors using a
      reduced energy dense diet in young adults with a family history of diabetes. Foundations for
      Health will provide a 12-week weight loss intervention for overweight and obese young adults,
      aged 18 to 35 years. Study participants will be randomly assigned to one of two conditions:
      1) a web-based behavioral intervention that decreases dietary energy density and increases
      physical activity; and 2) the same intervention combined with a hands-on culinary skills
      training program designed to increase food purchasing and meal self-preparation and
      consumption of meals low in energy density. The primary aims of this feasibility study are:
      1) determine if the web-based plus culinary training condition has a greater increase in food
      purchasing, meal preparation/cooking behaviors, and intake of self-made meals; and a greater
      decrease in consumption of "convenience meals" than the web-based condition at 3 months; and
      2) determine if the web-based plus culinary training condition has a greater decrease in
      dietary energy density and percent energy from fat and a greater increase in fruit and
      vegetable consumption than the web-based condition at 3 months.
