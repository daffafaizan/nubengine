      vocal tics often associated with psychiatric comorbidities (obsessive compulsive disorder,
      anxiety and depressive syndrome, impulsivity). The pathophysiology of Gilles de la Tourette
      syndrome remains unclear. It would involve an alteration of striatal-cortico-thalamic
      cortical circuits resulting in dopaminergic dysfunction. But glutamaergic hypothesis is also
      discussed from pharmacological, biochemical and genetic arguments. Exploration of
      glutamatergic system can be done in humans in vivo using a new radiotracer: the [18F] FNM
      (Fluoroéthylnormémantine), a derivative of memantine. In the present study, aim of the study
      1) to show the glutamatergic system "in vivo" in patients with Tourette's syndrome and 2) to
      perform correlations between various motor and behavioral symptoms and the pattern of brain
      fixation for this radiotracer. To do that, a pilot study will be conducted in 12 patients
      with Tourette's who will be evaluated in terms of motor (tics) and behavioral (OCD, anxiety,
      depression, impulsivity) symptoms. Each patient will have a PET-scan exam and a brain MRI
      exam. Data analysis will be carried out from two different approaches: first by region of
      interest, and secondly, without topographic a priori with the SPM software.
