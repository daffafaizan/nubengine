    
      This is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, comparative two-group clinical study to
      observe two vasopressor drugs, phenylephrine and noradrenaline, in the ability to maintain
      systemic arterial pressure in pregnant women after spinal anesthesia for cesarean section;
      based on the hypothesis that, since noradrenaline has a predominant alpha-adrenergic action
      and a weak 1- beta-adrenergic beta action, it could be as capable of maintaining blood
      pressure effectively as phenylephrine, but with a lower frequency of bradycardia; patients
      who meet the inclusion criteria will be randomly assigned to one of the groups to be studied:
      group F - phenylephrine at a dose of 100mcg bolus and N - noradrenaline at the dose of 5mcg.
      One of these drugs will be used whenever systolic blood pressure drops below 10% of the
      baseline, additional doses will be allowed whenever necessary, aiming at maintaining the
      systolic blood pressure at baseline values; the blood pressure will be measured
      non-invasively and the heart rate by pulse oximeter and electrocardiogram.
