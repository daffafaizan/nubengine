      pressure, which is called septic shock. The main treatments for septic shock are intravenous
      antibiotics and intravenous fluid.

      There are many different intravenous fluids available for doctors to use. Each one of these
      fluids has potential advantages as well as potential disadvantages. Doctors will often look
      at many things when deciding which fluid to give including the results of bloodwork and the
      clinical characteristics of the patients themselves. There is limited direction from research
      studies taht using one fluid type is better than another. Some preliminary research in the
      field has suggested that one specific electrolyte, call chloride, may be harmful when given
      to patients in high concentrations. Animal research has shown that the administration of high
      chloride fluids may be harmful to the lungs, kidneys, gastrointestinal and muscle cells. Some
      intravenous fluids have higher concentrations of chloride than others.

      The investigators plan to study the impact of giving patients with severe infection
      intravenous fluids with either a high chloride concentration (normal saline or high chloride
      albumin) or a low chloride concentration (Ringers Lactate or low chloride albumin). Although,
      the investigators plan for a larger trial looking at patient-important outcomes such as rate
      of death, kidney failure and length of stay in the ICU the investigators think it's important
      to start with a feasibility study. If the investigators are able to show a larger trial is
      feasible then the investigators will apply for further funding and use the lessons learned
      from this pilot to optimize the larger study. The larger study has the potential to guide the
      care of critically ill patients with infection worldwide.
