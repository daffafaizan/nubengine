      patients with glioblastoma multiforme. II. Determine the overall response, duration of
      response, and progression free survival of these patients after this treatment.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive nitrocamptothecin orally daily on days
      1-5. Treatment continues every 7 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients are followed every 6 weeks until disease progression in the absence of
      further treatment.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-25 patients will be accrued for this study.
