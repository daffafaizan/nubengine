      comparator or sodium lauryl sulfate (a product that is expected to produce a slight skin
      irritation) will be placed on the same spot of your skin every day for 21 days. The skin will
      be examined every day.

      The Sensitization Study (200 total subjects) place patches containing CHG, vehicle, saline,
      CHG comparator on the skin 3 times a week for 3 weeks. Following a two-week rest period the
      patches will be reapplied for 48 hours and assessed out to 72 hours thereafter.
