      retromammary and partial retropectoral implant placement while minimizing the tradeoffs of
      other pocket locations. Traditionally, dual plane augmentation has been performed using
      transareolar or inframammary fold approach. However, the approach is unacceptable to Chinese
      patients because of the front scar formation. For aesthetic reasons, the axillary incision is
      more acceptable approach for augmentation mammoplasty.

      The endoscope assistant technique has been widely used in transaxillary breast augmentation.
      It provides the feasibility to perform dual plane breast augmentation by axillary approach.

      In this research, at least 40 patients with light degree of glandular ptotic and constricted
      lower pole breasts are selected to receive soft cohesive gel microtextured anatomic style
      silicone implants. Portions of the pectoralis major muscle is split without its release from
      the costal margin with the help of a 10mm, 30Â°endoscope and endoscopic diathermy scissors
      through a 4-cm incision in the axilla each side. Bleeding during surgery is kept to the
      minimum. The results of outcomes, operative time, bleeding volume, drainage volume,
      complications are observed.
