      trial. Patients received this combination chemotherapy repeated every 28 days until
      progression disease. Starting dose (dose level 1) were docetaxel 30 mg/m2 on day 1, fixed
      dose intravenously cisplatin (15 mg/m2/day) and continuous infusion 5-FU (800 mg/m2/day) on
      day 1-4. DLT was defined as follows (according to NCI-CTC version 2.0); Grade 4 neutropenia
      lasting for more than 4days, Grade 4 anemia and thrombocytopenia, Grade 3 neutropenia
      accompanied fever (>38â„ƒ) , and Grade 3 non-hematological toxicity (except for nausea,
      appetite loss , general fatigue). Maximal Tolerated Dose (MTD) is determined when the
      incidence of critical toxicity exceeds 50% at a certain dose level. Response rate will be
      calculated according to RECIST criteria.
