      dysfunction and sexual dysfunction which lead to decrease quality of life. Recently,
      nerve-sparing surgery has been introduced. But it is difficult to establish standard surgical
      procedure for nerve-sparing. And it is the concern that performing nerve sparing surgery may
      reduce radicality of surgery which influence prognosis.

      Through pelvic autonomic nerve monitoring system (PAMS I), this trial is expected to raise
      the possibility of nerve-sparing with maintaining radicality of surgery.

      Pressure sensor of PAMS I and needle prove of IOM are very thin and these instruments have
      been used clinically. Taking this into consideration, additional risk by nerve monitoring is
      considered to be minimal.
