      with cancer. Strategies are needed to help AYAs manage symptoms. The investigators developed
      the Computerized Symptom Capture Tool (C-SCAT), a novel way to assess symptoms where AYAs
      create a picture of their symptoms using images and text on an iPad app. The resulting image
      shows symptoms/symptom clusters, priority symptoms and relationships between symptoms and has
      potential to support AYA's symptom self-management. Facilitating the self-management process,
      including self-efficacy, self-regulation behaviors, and patient-provider communication, is
      essential for improving symptom outcomes.
