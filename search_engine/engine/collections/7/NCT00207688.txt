    
      This is a long term, multicenter, international safety study to evaluate targeted long-term
      safety information on patients who have participated in infliximab(Remicade) clinical studies
      in ulcerative colitis that require long-term safety follow-up. All patients who received at
      least one dose of study drug (infliximab or placebo) in the primary studies (C0168T37
      ,C0168T46, C0168T72) are eligible to participate in this long-term safety follow-up study
      (C0168T62). Patients will begin participation in C0168T62 at the time of their last safety
      visit in the primary study and will be followed for 5 years. No study agent will be
      administered. Information on deaths, serious infections, new malignancies (including
      colorectal cancer) and new autoimmune diseases and surgical procedures (including colectomy)
      and hospitalizations for the treatment of ulcerative colitis will be collected. Information
      about possible delayed allergic reactions (possible fever, rash, fatigue, joint pain) will
      also be collected if patients received infliximab after the end of the primary study. In
      addition, data on dysplasia of the colon will be collected from patients who were identified
      in the primary study to be at high-risk for colon cancer and were required per protocol to
      undergo a follow-up colonoscopy as part of long-term safety follow-up. All adverse events,
      including non-serious adverse events, will also be collected.
