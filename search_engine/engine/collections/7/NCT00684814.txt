    
      The purpose of this study is to compare the bioequivalence of a test formulation of zolpidem
      tartrate tablets to an equivalent oral dose of the commercially available reference drug
      product Ambien® (zolpidem tartrate tablets) in adult subjects under fasted conditions.

      Thirty-eight healthy, non-smoking, non-obese male and female volunteers at least 18 years of
      age will be randomly assigned in a crossover fashion to receive each of two zolpidem tartrate
      dosing regimens in sequence with a 7 day washout period between dosing periods. On the
      morning of Day 1, after an overnight fast of at least 10 hours, subjects will receive either
      a single oral dose of the test formulation, zolpidem tartrate (1 x 10 mg tablet) or a single
      oral dose of the reference formulation, Ambien® (1 x 10 mg tablet). After a 7 day washout
      period, on the morning of Day 8 after an overnight fast, subjects will receive the alternate
      regimen. Blood samples will be drawn from all participants before dosing and for 12 hours
      post dose at times sufficient to adequately define the pharmacokinetics of zolpidem tartrate.
      A further goal of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of this regimen in
      healthy volunteers. Subjects will be monitored throughout the confinement portion of the
      study for adverse reactions to the study drugs and/or procedures. Blood pressure and pulse
      rate will be obtained prior to dosing and at 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 12 hours post-dose. All adverse
      events whether elicited by query, spontaneously reported or observed by clinic staff will be
      evaluated by the investigator and reported in the subject's case report form.
