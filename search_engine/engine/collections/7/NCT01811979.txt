      Administration of oral sucrose with and without non-nutritive sucking is the most frequently
      studied non-pharmacological intervention for procedural pain relief in neonates.The purpose
      of this study was to determine the effectiveness of local anesthetic eye drops and a
      pacifier, plus repeated doses of 24% sucrose, to relieve pain associated with eye
      examinations for retinopathy of prematurity.
