      brachial plexus block. Patients will be randomized to one of two groups.

      The first group - extrafascial injection group - will receive an ultrasound-guided
      supraclavicular brachial plexus block whereby the local anesthetic will be deposited at the
      exterior of the fascial sheath that surrounds the nerves.

      The second group - intrafascial injection group - will receive an ultrasound-guided
      supraclavicular brachial plexus block whereby the local anesthetic will be deposited at the
      interior of the fascial sheath that surrounds the nerves.

      All patients will receive the same type and amount of local anesthetic: 30 ml of a mixture of
      ropivacaine 0.5 % + mepivacaine 1 %.

      The primary outcome is the rate of hemidiaphragmatic paresis 30 minutes after the block
      procedure, assessed with ultrasound. Secondary outcomes are: rate of hemidiaphragmatic
      paresis 2 hours after surgery, assessed with ultrasound, bedside spirometry before the
      supraclavicular block, 30 minutes after the block and 2 hours after surgery, rate of
      successful block 30 minutes after the block , duration of sensory and motor block, pain
      scores at rest and on movement at 24 h postoperatively, cumulative postoperative opioid
      consumption at 24 hours postoperatively and patient satisfaction with overall anesthetic
      management.

      These outcomes are further defined in the section below.
