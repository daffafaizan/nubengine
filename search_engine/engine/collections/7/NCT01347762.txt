      effective pharmacotherapies are available to treat these disorders. The investigators intend
      to test a novel agonist pharmacotherapy, nabilone, for cannabis dependence and to study the
      relationship of this treatment with the brain using BOLD fMRI measures. The behavioral and
      physiological effects of nabilone and Î”9-THC overlap, suggesting that nabilone may ameliorate
      cannabis withdrawal symptoms while allowing treatment-seeking outpatients to benefit from
      medical management (MM) sessions when they are trying to stop using cannabis. The
      investigators propose to assess the relationship of nabilone, when added to MM, on cannabis
      use patterns in cannabis-dependent patients. The investigators also aim to determine the
      effects of nabilone on performance on neuropsychological tests and to assess the correlation
      of neuropsychological performance to brain changes using BOLD fMRI measures.

      In this pilot study, subjects will receive either nabilone or placebo in addition to medical
      management (MM) over a 10-week treatment period. Subjects' responses to neuropsychological
      testing carried out while the subject is receiving fMRI scans at 3 time points: at baseline,
      4 weeks, and 10 weeks. Following treatment completion, subjects will have a follow-up visit
      at 14 weeks. This pilot study will evaluate the feasibility of nabilone treatment for
      cannabis dependence and will establish effect sizes for a larger trial in which subjects will
      receive high-dose nabilone, low-dose nabilone, or placebo in addition to MM.
