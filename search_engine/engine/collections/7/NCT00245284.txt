      (>20%) 10-year Framingham global cardiovascular risk in approximately equal proportions.

      Subjects will be enrolled from each of the three risk levels at each study site (6 total in
      the US). Subjects will be enrolled in a consecutive manner until there are 200 subjects from
      each risk level. We will track the number of subjects from each risk stratum. We will also
      ensure adequate representation of women (at least 33%) and African Americans (at least 25%)in
      the study.

      We will test the subjects with 2 non-invasive skin cholesterol tests and will take a sample
      of blood that will be tested for serum cholesterol values and other markers of CAD. Subjects
      will also undego a carotid IMT scan.

      The primary objective of the study is to see if skin cholesterol correlates with CAD, as
      measured by CIMT.
