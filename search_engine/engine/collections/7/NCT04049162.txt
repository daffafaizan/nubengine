      administered in sedentary older (>60 years) women and men randomized to either lyophilized
      blueberry powder, rehydrated and consumed as a beverage twice daily with meals (BB-EX; n =
      25), or an indistinguishable placebo powder, taken in the same manner (placebo control; P-EX;
      n = 25).

      Vascular function (primary outcome), 24-hr ambulatory blood pressure, cognitive performance,
      and related secondary measures will be assessed at 0 and 12 weeks; berry and nutrient intake
      and function are assessed every 4 weeks; and physical activity as step counts will be
      continuously monitored using a mobile device (Garmin). Blood, urine (12-hr), and stool
      samples will be collected at 0 and 12 weeks and archived for later analysis.

      The 12-week study duration is based upon the timing of vascular responses seen in other
      trials, as well as the minimal time needed to expect a change in cognitive performance in an
      older adult population. The blueberry dose of 36 grams per day in a split dose consumed with
      meals is based on (1) a 33% increase in dose over that previously used in a longer (6-month)
      trial; (2) delivering the most effective dose of blueberry bioactives; and (3) reduced
      likelihood of any gastrointestinal symptoms.
