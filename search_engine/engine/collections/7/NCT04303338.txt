      (masotherapy with neural tension and masotherapy with non-neural tension) in patients with
      Parkinson disease based on the improved of pain, tremor, functional and life quality.

      The investigators are going to divide the number of volunteers in two groups. The first group
      is going to be treated during 8 weeks with conventional (non-neural tension) masotherapy in
      the upper limb, the other group is going to be treated with radial neural tension masotherapy
      during 8 weeks also. To apply the neural tension, the investigators position the patient's
      upper limb lowering the scapula, elbow extended, internal rotation glenohumeral, forearm
      pronation, bend and cubital deviation of the wrist, fingers bended and thumb adduction, and
      finally glenohumeral abduction.

      To compare the results between the different groups, the investigators are going to value the
      patients 4 times, the first one before the beginning of the treatment, the second one and the
      end of the treatment, the third one after one month completing the treatment, and the last
      one after three months completing the treatment.
