      diagnosis of trigger finger will be recruited and enrolled from Taipei Veteran General
      Hospital PM&R outpatient clinic. Subjects will be randomized into two groups; hyaluronic acid
      and triamcinolone acetonide injections, both via ultrasound-guided with one injection only.We
      hypothesize that through the anti-inflammatory property of the hyaluronate acid, the
      treatment effects will be as effective as the traditionally used steroid injections with
      equal or even lower recurrence rate for treatment of trigger finger. We expect that
      injections of hyaluronate into tendon sheath could become a new treatment option for trigger
      finger.
