      patients with TC < 5.18 mmol/l belong to normal TC (NTC) group, 5.18 ≤ TC < 6.19 mmol/l is
      borderline-high TC (BHTC) group, those with TC ≥6.19 mmol/l belong to high TC (HTC) group,
      and the correlation between the TC and the degree of coronary artery stenosis is evaluated.
      With or without hypertension will be further stratified to assess the effect of with or
      without hypertension on the correlation between TC levels and the degree of coronary artery
      stenosis. The 6 subgroups are: NTC/-HTN group, NTC/+HTN group, BHTC/-HTN group, BHTC/+HTN
      group, HTC/-HTN group, HTC/+HTN group.

      The investigators refer to the recent diagnostic guidelines for coronary heart disease angina
      pectoris at home and abroad. The diagnosis can be given if it meets any one or more of the
      following:

        1. There was a clear history of old myocardial infarction.

        2. Previous coronary angiography or coronary CTA examination showed that at least one major
           branch of coronary artery has a lumen diameter stenosis ≥50%.

        3. Those with ST-segment depression or T-wave inversion on ECG after coronary
           revascularization.

      The investigators will redefined hypertension as systolic blood pressure ≥130 mmHg or
      diastolic blood pressure ≥80 mmHg according to the recently published 2017 ACC/AHA
      guidelines.
