      cancer to those with any solid malignancy - as well as patients with schwannoma, a
      non-malignant solid tumor that also over-expresses GCP II. Using our first generation imaging
      agent, [18F]DCFBC, we have shown that we could detect GCP II in tissue specimens of patients
      with a variety of cancers, and vestibular schwannoma. We have also shown that GCP II may not
      only be present in the neovasculature of solid (non-prostate) tumors, but also reside within
      the tumor epithelium itself. We have shown that to be the case for melanoma, in particular.
      Our goal is to leverage the broad utility of our GCP II targeted imaging agents for managing
      other cancers. In addition to schwannoma, the cancers we intend to target include but will
      not be restricted to: head and neck cancer, salivary gland tumors, renal cell carcinoma,
      transitional cell carcinoma, colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, neuroendocrine cancer,
      glioblastoma, melanoma, pancreatic cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, soft tissue sarcoma,
      breast cancer, endometrial cancer, ovarian cancer, lymphoma and multiple myeloma.
