      effect of chronic spice consumption on postprandial vascular function, lipid levels, immune
      and inflammatory markers. Participants will consume three test diets containing different
      amounts of spice. Each treatment period will last for 4 weeks. At baseline and after each
      diet period a postprandial test will be conducted. Flow mediated dilation (FMD) will
      conducted in the fasting state and a catheter will be inserted for blood sampling.
      Participants will consume a control test meal containing low spice at baseline and after each
      diet period the test meal will contain a level of spice that corresponds to the amount of
      spice consumed during the diet period. Blood samples will be taken at 30, 60, 120, 180 and
      240 minutes after meal consumption, and FMD will be performed at 120 and 240 minutes.
