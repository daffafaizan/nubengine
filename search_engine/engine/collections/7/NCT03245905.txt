      These patients cannot be treated successfully or tolered with the conventional chemotherapy.
      Epigenetic changes in B-cell lymphoma. Thus, epigenetic agents may offer potential improvment
      of clinical outcomes. Chidamide is a new type of oral histone deacetylase inhibitor. Our
      exploratory research found that Chidamide was effect in some relapsed /refractory B cell
      lymphoma patients

      . Thus, we will evaluate the efficacy and safety of Chidamide in the patients with aggressive
      relapsed refractory B cell lymphoma failed from second line chemotherapy.
