      glands. One of the most troublesome manifestations of SS is severe salivary gland
      dysfunction. There is no accepted treatment for the underlying autoimmune reactivity or the
      salivary gland dysfunction in SS. SS, as well as many other autoimmune diseases,
      predominantly affects women. Although sex hormones do not cause SS or other autoimmune
      disease, they appear to influence immunological responses and ultimately the severity of
      disease. We propose to test the effects of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), a mildly androgenic
      adrenal hormone, on lacrimal and salivary gland function in SS. In a randomized,
      double-masked, outpatient protocol, patients will receive DHEA for 6 months. Efficacy of
      treatment will be assessed by monitoring salivary and lacrimal function, serological markers
      of autoimmune activity, and subjective reports of local and systemic symptoms.
