      United Kingdom) is a minimally invasive monitor for measuring stroke volume (SV) using two
      different algorithms. The PulseCO (PulseCO â„¢, Cambridge, United Kingdom) is based on analyses
      of the the arterial pressure wave giving nominal values. The LiDCO uses lithium-dilution for
      calibration to give absolute values. In this trial, the investigators will use the PulseCO
      looking at relative changes in uncalibrated hemodynamic variables. Continual changes in
      systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), mean arterial blood pressure
      (MAP), heart rate (HR), stroke volume (SV), cardiac output (CO) and systemic vascular
      resistance (SVR) will be measured.

      Earlier studies have shown that propofol 2.5 mg/kg induction without opioid reduces CO
      (-15%), SV (-5 %), MAP (-33%) and SVR (-11%) and a slight reduction i HR. High-dose
      remifentanil anesthesia (2 microg/kg/min), in coronary patients reduced cardiac index (-25%),
      SV (-14%) and MAP (-39%) in a similar manner as propofol/remifentanil (propofol target 2
      microg/ml and remifentanil 0.5 microg/kg/min), but systemic vascular resistance index
      decreased (-14%) in propofol/remifentanil combination.

      Several procedures have been proposed to minimize the negative hemodynamic changes during
      induction. Administration of a crystalloid or a colloid did not prevent the decrease in MAP
      after induction of general anesthesia with propofol and fentanyl.

      The hemodynamic effects in propofol-fentanyl anesthesia of preoperative ephedrine 0.07-0.15
      mg/kg vs phenylephrine 1.5 microg/kg in valve surgery and concludes that ephedrine 0.07-0.1
      mg/kg is safe and effective in counteracting hypotension. A dose of 0.15 mg/kg ephedrine is
      suggested for preventing hypotension during anesthesia induction with propofol 2.5 mg/kg and
      remifentanil 3 microg/kg.
