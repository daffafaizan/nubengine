    
      To compare the change in renal function between CsA or MMF withdrawal from before to 12
      months after drug withdrawal in renal transplant recipients on triple immunosuppressive
      therapy.

      Secondly to examine safety following withdrawal of CsA or MMF, respectively, by the following
      parameters:

        -  Biopsy verified acute rejection episodes, time to first rejection and number of steroid
           resistant rejection episodes within 12 months.

        -  Hematology (Hb, WBC, platelets) abnormalities within 12 months.

        -  Graft and patient survival at 12 months and 5 years. Absolute difference in renal
           function between withdrawal groups at 12 months. Three monthly changes in renal function
           from drug withdrawal to 12 months. Change in dyslipidemia frequency from drug withdrawal
           to 12 months. Change in hypertension frequency from drug withdrawal to 12 months. Change
           in glucose tolerance from drug withdrawal to 12 months. Cumulative incidence of clinical
           infections resulting in hospitalization within 12 months.

      Sub protocols will also examine the following aspects:

      Cardiovascular: Homocysteine. Lipid peroxidation. Microvascular function and vasoactive
      parameters Quality of life (QoL): ESRD SCL-TM, SF-36 (short version) and EQ-5D (GI-checklist
      extended) questionnaires will be used.

      Pharmacoeconomical evaluation.
