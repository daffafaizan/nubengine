      supplementation of a probiotic on gut microbiota balance, the gut immune system and quality
      of life (intended as functional and muscular capacity, physical qualities and emotional
      state) in breast cancer survivors .

      A randomized controlled pilot study has been designed in three parallel groups. Breast cancer
      survivors will be randomly assigned to each of the 3 groups: a) probiotic supplementation +
      supervised combined physical exercise (PEF), b) probiotic supplementation and habitual
      sedentary lifestyle (P), and c) control group will follow their usual lifestyle and will
      receive a placebo (C).

      The exercise intervention will last 12 weeks. It will include three weekly sessions of
      programmed physical exercise of ~ 60 min duration (combined training). The exercise program
      will be individualized and will follow the rules of the world reference institutions for
      aerobic training. Each session will be held in a qualified fitness center and it will be
      supervised and individualized for each subject by professional experts .The two supplemented
      groups will take 3 capsules (Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus
      acidophilus, Bifidobacterium bifidum) a day (at night before bedtime) for 12 weeks.

      The variables gut microbiota, fecal levels of immunoglobulin A, cardiorespiratory capacity,
      anthropometry variables, lifestyle, muscular capacity, quality of life, anxiety, depression
      and stress levels will be analized at the beginning (baseline dose) and after 12 weeks of
      intervention.
