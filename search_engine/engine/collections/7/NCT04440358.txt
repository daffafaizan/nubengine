      safety and feasibility of blood-brain-barrier disruption (BBBD) combined with intravenous
      carboplatin for the treatment of rGBM using the Exablate Neuro Model 4000 Type 2 system.
      Adult glioblastoma subjects that are planned for carboplatin chemotherapy will be considered
      for study enrollment. Eligible subjects will undergo up to 6 cycles of Exablate BBBD
      procedures in conjunction with carboplatin chemotherapy.
