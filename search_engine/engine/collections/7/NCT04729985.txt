    
      Patients admitted to a community hospital with diabetes will be evaluated for being high risk
      for rehospitalization. High risk patients will be identified and those that are found to be
      high risk will be evaluated for entrance to the study and consented.

      Those that consent will be randomized to two arms, an intervention arm and a standard care
      arm with CGM monitoring.

      Intervention will include a brief 15 minute diabetic education session and a 15 minute brief
      education on how to use the Freestyle Libre CGM. A sensor will be placed and initiated before
      discharge. They will also sign up for a Freestyle Libre View account and grant access to the
      intervention team. The will receive a handout of reasons to call the principal investigator
      during the first 15 days and will be told to access the PI through the hospital operator. The
      PI will call the patient on day 3-4, day 5-6, day 9-10 and day 14-15 after reviewing their
      CGM data. The PI will review their glucoses and also any concerns from their hospitalization.
      The team can then help bridge any treatment or care gaps with the patients PCP or care team.
      The CGM data will be recorded for the first 14 days and data will be sent to the PCP.

      The standard treatment arm will get 15 minutes of education on how to use the Libre Pro
      blinded CGM sensor and the sensor will be placed before discharge. The sensor will be sent
      back the the team and downloaded. After 30 days the data will be sent to the patients PCP.

      Outcomes will be measured for 30 days from discharge.

      Patient satisfaction will be measured by a phone interview in both groups once after 31-40
      days from discharge
