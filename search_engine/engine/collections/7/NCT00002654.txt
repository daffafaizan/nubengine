      moderately advanced and advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (no distant
      metastases) when treated with hyperfractionated radiotherapy with vs. without 2 courses of
      simultaneously administered cisplatin. II. Assess the time to distant metastatic relapse,
      overall survival, and toxicity in patients receiving these treatments. III. Evaluate whether
      the potential tumor-doubling time is an indicator for risk of treatment failure in patients
      receiving these treatments.

      OUTLINE: Randomized study. Arm I: Radiotherapy plus Single-Agent Chemotherapy followed, as
      indicated, by Surgery. Hyperfractionated external-beam tumor irradiation using photon
      energies of 4-6 MV or electrons of 6-12 MV (interstitial brachytherapy boost to lesions of
      the oral cavity allowed); plus Cisplatin, CDDP, NSC-119875; followed, in patients with
      persistent disease (at the discretion of the surgeon), by resection of primary tumor or
      involved nodes. Arm II: Hyperfractionated radiotherapy followed by Surgery. Tumor irradiation
      as in Arm I; followed by resection as in Arm I.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: At least 400 patients will be accrued over 5 years. Interim analyses to
      allow for early stopping will be carried out after entry of 50 and 100 patients.
