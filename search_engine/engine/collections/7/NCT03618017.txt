      early-stage breast cancer who are finishing primary treatment. Participants will be
      randomized either to the intervention arm (CCC website that provides information on
      team-based follow-up care for both cancer surveillance and preventive care) or the control
      arm (static online survivorship care plan template, adapted from the ASCO breast cancer
      survivorship template). The feasibility and acceptability of the tool and correlations with
      patient-reported outcomes will be assessed 3 months following the completion of a baseline
      survey via an online follow-up survey.
