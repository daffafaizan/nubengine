    
      This study is examining changes in insulin resistance and glucose tolerance following 3
      months of treatment with oral, once daily tadalafil.

      The investigators primary hypotheses are that measurable decreases in insulin resistance (as
      measured by HOMA-IR) and increases in insulin sensitivity (as measured by the Matsuda index)
      will occur following 3 months of treatment with oral tadalafil 20 mg daily compared to
      placebo.

      The investigators secondary hypotheses are that improvements in average glycemia (as measured
      by hemoglobin A1C), pancreatic beta cell function (as measured by the oral disposition
      index), and body composition (including weight, waist circumference, body mass index, and
      waist-hip ratio) will occur as a result of tadalafil-mediated changes in the cGMP pathway.
