      discussions (FGDs) of YMSM will be conducted to assess the feasibility and acceptability of
      social media intervention. In the second specific aim of the study, a quasi-pre-post
      experimental study will be conducted to examine the effect of social media intervention on
      PrEP uptake (primary outcome) and PrEP use intention, HIV testing, PrEP knowledge,
      self-efficacy and social support (secondary outcome). In the third specific aim of the study,
