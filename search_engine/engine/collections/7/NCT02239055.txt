      staff nurses took part in a semi-structured exploration of BPD in AMH. Participants discussed
      challenges with patients and the impact of MBT skills training and Clinical Supervision (CS).
      The focus groups were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data was examined using a
      thematic analysis.
