      between 15-40 years with at least two primary caries lesions radiographically assessed as the
      same size were recruited. In each patient one cavity was excavated with rotary bur and one
      with Er:YAG laser technique after a randomized allocation of the lesions to one of the
      intervention methods. The time requested for excavation to hard/firm dentin and local
      anaesthesia were measured. Directly after each treatment a questionnaire focusing on the
      experiences of the current treatment and if the laser method will be chosen in the future was
      answered. Postoperative pain was measured with a questionnaire one week after the treatment.
      Six, 12 and 24 months after the fillings were made an evaluation of pulpal status and the
      quality of the fillings will be performed.
