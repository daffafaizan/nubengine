      Neonatal and maternal sepsis are major contributors to the high burden of mortality in
      sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Bacterial infections are leading causes of neonatal deaths,
      representing 1 out of 3 deaths in this age group (1).

      Neonatal sepsis is the consequence of bacterial infection during early life. Newborns may be
      infected during labour (through the birth canal) or during the first days/weeks of life, when
      they may become infected because of the close physical contact with the mother, if the latter
      carries bacteria (i.e. in the nasopharyngeal tract), a common occurrence in resource-limited
      settings, particularly in SSA. Streptococcus pneumoniae and group A Streptococcus are
      important in the late neonatal period (from the second week of life), while group B
      Streptococcus (GBS), Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli occur often in both the early
      and late neonatal periods (2).

      AZI is a semi-synthetic azalide macrolide that is structurally related to erythromycin but
      has a broader spectrum of antibacterial activity, improved tissue penetration and a more
      favourable pharmacokinetic profile (3). Azithromycin is a cheap, wide spectrum, oral
      antibiotic that is safe to use in mothers and newborns, does not require special storage
      conditions, and can be delivered at the most peripheral level of care.

      Between 2013 and 2015, we conducted as first proof-of-concept, a double-blind randomized
      trial on the effect of 2g of AZI administered to Gambian women in labour on maternal and
      neonatal bacterial carriage (4). The primary endpoint was bacterial carriage at day 6 in the
      newborn (i.e. S.aureus, GBS or S.pneumoniae). The rationale for the study was that this
      intervention would decrease bacterial carriage of the study bacteria both, in the mother and
      the newborn and consequently the risk of invasive bacterial disease or sepsis. We found that
      the intervention substantially reduced the prevalence of carriage of each of these three
      bacteria, both in the newborn and the mother, during the entire neonatal/puerperal period
      (4).

        1. Newborn (b) Mother1

             1. Maternal nasopharyngeal swab at day 0: collected before the intervention was given.

      Our study also showed that women in the AZI group had a lower prevalence of the study
      bacteria in the breast milk during the entire neonatal period (day 6: 9.6% vs 21.9%, RR=0.44,
      p<0.001) and in the vaginal tract (8-10 days: 13.2% vs 24.2% RR=0.55 - p<0.001).

      Although the study was not designed to evaluate clinical endpoints, prevalence of these
      endpoints decreased significantly in the AZI group (5). The use of antibiotics, and the
      occurrence of fever, mastitis and puerperal infections were significantly lower in the AZI
      group (Table 1). Newborns in the intervention group had fewer infections (skin infections,
      umbilical infections, ear infections, conjunctivitis or mild sepsis) during the neonatal
      period (Table 2). There were also fewer neonatal deaths due to severe infections in the AZI
      group (0.4% versus 1.4% excluding neonates with severe congenital malformations).

      p-values from the log-rank test (mothers p=0.001, newborns p=0.04) AZI was safe for both the
      mothers and the newborns. Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (HPS) was not observed in any of the
      study children during the 2-month follow up period (4).

      Azithromycin is a cheap, wide spectrum, oral antibiotic that is safe to use in mothers and
      newborns, does not require special storage conditions, and can be delivered at the most
      peripheral level of care.

      In the trial presented here, we want to assess the impact of using AZI during labour on
      neonatal mortality as well as maternal and neonatal sepsis and infant growth. If successful,
      this simple intervention could be easily implemented through the health system at the most
      peripheral level of care. It has the potential to achieve wide coverage in SSA where low-cost
      interventions aiming at reducing neonatal mortality are urgently needed. In addition, the
      intervention should concomitantly protect women and newborns. Azithromycin resistance will
      also be monitored as the former trial showed high rates of AZI resistance for S. aureus.
      However, AZI is not widely used in SSA for clinical treatment and therefore any short-term
      resistance arising from the intervention would have little impact on clinical care.

           TRIAL DESIGN

           This is a multi-country phase III, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised trial in
           which 12,500 women in labour will be randomised to receive either a single dose of 2g of
           oral azithromycin or placebo (ratio 1:1). Pregnant women (age ≥16 years) will be
           identified during antenatal clinic visits in several health facilities in The Gambia and
           Burkina Faso; and will be asked to provide written informed consent. Recruitment will
           take place when these women attend the study health facilities in labour.

           INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA Pregnant women (age ≥16 years) will be identified
           during antenatal clinic visits and asked to provide written informed consent. During
           labour they will be screened and recruited unless they have any of the following
           exclusion criteria: planned caesarean section, ante-partum haemorrhage, known allergy to
           macrolides, confirmed intrauterine death or a known severe congenital malformation. The
           randomisation number will only be assigned after the screening.

           TRIAL OBJECTIVES

           The primary objective of the study is to assess the effect of one oral dose of AZI (2g)
           given to women in labour on neonatal mortality (from birth to 28 days). Exclusion
           criteria include: severe birth asphyxia (Apgar score <3 at 1 min); severe congenital
           malformations and very low birth weight (VLBW) (<1.5Kg). Note: Those deaths excluded
           from the primary objective are considered in some of the secondary objectives below.

           Secondary objectives of the trial include the effect of the intervention on other
           clinical endpoints (for both neonates and mothers) and on microbiological endpoints
           (prevalence of carriage and resistance of different bacterial pathogens):

                PARTICIPANTS AND SAMPLES We will recruit 12,500 women and their newborns.
                Approximately half of this number of women will be recruited in The Gambia and half
                in Burkina Faso. However, the recruitment will be competitive and if one country
                does not reach the numbers within the time period expected, the other will increase
                the recruitments.

           Figure 3. Length of follow-up of study participants and visits.

           *Visit at Day 0/1 (recruitment at the health facility and discharge from the health
           facility) and visit at Day 28 is the same for all the study participants. The additional
           active visits are only for participants included in one of the sub-studies.

           All study participants will be followed for 28 days. During this follow-up period,
           samples will be collected if they are hospitalized with suspicion of sepsis (mothers and
           newborns). Clinical samples to conduct sepsis work up will be collected. For newborns
           hospitalized with clinical suspicion of sepsis, we will also collect nasopharyngeal
           swabs (NPS), oropharyngeal swabs (OPS) and rectal swabs (RS).

           For 250 participant pairs recruited in the carriage sub-study. Samples will be collected

           sub-study. These children will be followed for 1 year but no additional samples will be
           collected. Anthropometric information will be collected during the additional visits at
           6, 9 and 12 months; and information of AE will be collected.

           CENTRES INVOLVED IN THE TRIAL

           In The Gambia, we will conduct the trial at Bundung Maternal and Child Health Hospital
           and Serrekunda Health Facility. Bundung Maternal and Child Health Hospital is where the
           proof-of-concept trial was conducted. The hospital delivers approximately 5,000 babies
           each year and is located on the Gambian coast, 15 km from the MRC The Gambia
           headquarters. Pregnant women usually have 2-3 antenatal visits during the second and
           third trimester and they are kept in the health centre for approximately 6 hours after
           delivery. Serrekunda Health Facility is located approximately 15Km from both the Bundung
           Maternal and Child Health Hospital and the MRC The Gambia headquarters. Approximately,
           2,000 deliveries take place per year. In The Gambia, maternal mortality ratio is 461
           deaths/100,000 live births (4) and infant mortality rate is above 50 deaths/1,000 live
           births (5).

           In Burkina Faso, the study will be carried out at the Clinical Research Unit of Nanoro
           (CRUN) located in the rural central west region of the country. In 2013, the total
           population of the Nanoro Health district was estimated at 158,127 people. There are 14
           peripheral health facilities (covering 70 villages) around the referral hospital, all
           with maternity and extended program of immunizations (EPI) services. Seven to 10 of
           these health facilities will be part of the trial. The epidemiological profile of
           diseases remains dominated by communicable infectious diseases. Maternal mortality rate
           is 300 deaths/100,000 live births and infant mortality rate is 78.3 deaths/1,000 live
           births. A Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS), which covers a total
           population of about 60,000 people in 24 villages (7 health facilities) was set up in
           2009 by the CRUN within the Health district catchment area.

           ALLOCATION OF PARTICIPANTS Randomisation lists based on permuted blocks will be created
           independently for each country, and blister packs will be numbered according to the
           list. The trial will comply with Good Clinical Practices (GCP).

           RISK TO THE SAFETY OF THE TRIAL

             1. Hyperpyloric stenosis (HPS). Azithromycin is associated with HPS in infants (6)
                although it is uncertain in the context of azithromycin treated breast feeding
                women (7). Typically, infants with HPS do not show any symptoms at birth but they
                develop projectile vomiting and other metabolic abnormalities during the first few
                weeks of life. Data generated in our pilot study showed that azithromycin reaches
                the breast milk and traces are still detectable in samples collected at day 28 (8).
                There is some evidence that HPS is less frequent in SSA (9). In our pilot study
                none of the 419 children whose mother received azithromycin developed HPS (8).
                Nevertheless, newborns will be carefully followed up for signs of HPS.

             2. Azithromycin resistance. Azithromycin is not routinely used for clinical care in
                SSA and has a wide antimicrobial spectrum (10). For these reasons it has been used
                in several successful mass drug administration (MDA) campaigns, including trachoma
                and yaws control and elimination (11;12), and in clinical trials for the prevention
                of malaria in pregnancy and preterm births (13). Most studies have shown to varying
                degrees that resistant bacteria can be selected after a single dose. Nevertheless,
                in the absence of antibiotic pressure, resistance disappears due to the lower
                fitness of resistant bacteria (14). Studies that have used azithromycin for MDA, in
                which thousands of people were treated at the same time, have shown that
                S.pneumoniae resistance is only maintained for more than a few months in
                communities where the baseline prevalence of resistance is high (15). In The Gambia
                azithromycin resistance after MDA for trachoma elimination reverted to baseline
                levels 6 months after the intervention (16). In our pilot study, resistance of
                S.aureus was high 28 days after treatment but decreased to baseline levels 12
                months after treatment (Bojang et al in prep). As azithromycin is not used in
                standard clinical care, there would be little selective pressure on resistant
                bacteria. In addition, it is interesting to note that in our pilot trial women in
                the azithromycin group used other antibiotics less often than women in the placebo
                arm (2). This suggests that the intervention might decrease selective pressure on
                the few antibiotics available for standard clinical care in the region. Resistance
                to azithromycin and other antibiotics among the trial participants will be assessed
                in the proposed study.

           SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION In our proof-of-concept trial, the prevalence of bacterial
           carriage in the azithromycin group decreased by more than 50%, and there were 6 neonatal
           deaths (1.4%) (primary endpoint as defined above) in the placebo arm compared to 2
           (0.4%) in the azithromycin arm (70% reduction).

           We assume that mortality in the placebo arm will be at least 1.4% - this is a
           conservative estimate as in the proof-of-concept trial neonates were closely followed up
           during the first week of life and this probably decreased the risk of death. Assuming
           the intervention reduces neonatal mortality by 40%, we would need 5,800 women per arm to
           show a significant difference at 80% power and 5% significance level. And allowing for
           8% loss to follow-up, we would need to recruit a total of 12,500 women (Table 6).

           Table 6. Power with a sample size of 12,500 women by mortality in the placebo arm and
           effect of the intervention.

           Mortality in the placebo arm Effect of the intervention Power 1.4% 50% 40% 35% 96% 80%
           72% 1.7% 50% 40% 35% 30% 99% 90% 80% 65% 2.1% 50% 40% 35% 30% 99% 95% 88% 75%

           Approximately half of the women will be recruited in The Gambia and the other half in
           Burkina Faso. Maternal and infant mortality rates in these two countries are similar.

           This sample size will provide reasonable power for the secondary endpoints of maternal
           and neonatal infection, hospitalization and antibiotic use, since their occurrence is
           higher than neonatal death.
