      Hospital (BCH). EM are single and multi-user biofeedback games designed to enhance executive
      control of emotion. The intervention and EM in CALMS were adapted from those used in Anger
      Control Training (ACT) with Regulate and Gain Emotional Control (RAGE-Control). In a
      randomized controlled trial at BCH, ACT and RAGE-Control relative to "sham" video-game play
      without biofeedback led to significantly greater reductions of aggression in adolescents and
      greater improvement in family functioning.

      In this feasibility study, family dyads will participate in 12 sessions aimed at

        1. enhancing engagement through the use of video and other games,

        2. enhancing stress resilience through biofeedback, education, and individualized
           stress-reduction practice, and

        3. harnessing the power of the family to enhance contextual learning and the generality and
           duration of effects.

      Clinical, self-report, and heart rate measures will be assessed at baseline, 4, 8, and 12
      week assessments.
