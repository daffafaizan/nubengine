      postoperative adverse outcomes in surgical patients with untreated Obstructive Sleep Apnea
      (OSA). It is a multi center open label, randomized clinical trial of nasal high-flow vs.
      usual care in patients with untreated moderate-to-severe OSA undergoing major non cardiac
      surgery. It is a proof of concept trial to show that nasal high-flow reduces severe
      desaturation, the causal mechanism for OSA-related adverse events, and to collect key
      feasibility data for a large international multi center trial with enough power to detect
      effects on the clinical outcomes. Eligible patients undergoing major non cardiac surgery with
      high-risk OSA will have a home sleep study. One hundred and ninety patients with
      moderate-to-severe Sleep Apnea will be randomized into either nasal high-flow or usual care
      group. Sleep studies, oximetry, electrocardiogram (ECG), and Troponin will be done
      preoperatively. Postoperatively, ECG and Troponin will be determined daily for the 1st three
      days, and nocturnal oximetry for the 1st 3 nights. Patients will be followed during their
      hospitalization and for 30 days postoperatively to ascertain any adverse outcomes. A blinded
      clinical events committee will adjudicate all components of the composite outcome.
