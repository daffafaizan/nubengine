      rehabilitation protocol has been developed. The literature is not yet conclusive about the
      optimal anesthestic technique. The optimal technique should support fast mobilization by
      giving good pain relieve with minimal side effects such as nausea, drowsiness and muscle
      weakness. If pain relieve is optimal, the patient mobilizes fast and length of stay is
      shortened. But does fast recovery lead to better functional outcome? The objective of this
      study is to determine whether either a femoral nerve block (FNB) or local infiltration
      analgesia (LIA) is a better anesthetic technique to achieve optimal functional outcome after
      one year in patients receiving a total knee arthroplasty and following a fast track
      rehabilitation protocol.
