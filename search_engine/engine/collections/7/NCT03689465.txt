      allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). Currently, the strategies for
      graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis mainly include ex vivo and in vivo T-cell
      depletion (TCD) in haploidentical HSCT (haplo-HSCT). In vivo TCD modalities have become
      mainstream including granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)+antithymocyte globulin
      (ATG)-based protocols and posttransplantation cyclophosphamide (PTCy) protocols. The ATG
      strategy has been widely used. Nevertheless, severe acute GVHD remains an obstacle for
      haplo-HSCT. In addition, infections, especially viral infections, remain an important
      drawback of this strategy. This study is aim to evaluate the efficacy of a modified protocol
      that includes PTCY and ATG in recipients of haplo-HSCT.
