      advanced pulmonary parenchymal and pulmonary vascular disease. Currently, over 10,000
      patients have received lung transplantation with approximately 1200 transplant operations
      performed worldwide each year. Short term survival after lung transplantation has continued
      to improve since the widespread application of this procedure and one-year survival at most
      centers now approaches 80%. Unfortunately, long-term outcomes after lung transplantation are
      disappointing with five-year survival below 50%. Most posttransplant deaths are due directly
      or indirectly to the development of chronic allograft rejection, which affects approximately
      50% of all five-year survivors. Acute rejection is the major risk factor for the development
      of chronic rejection. Chronic lung rejection leads to a condition of irreversible fibrosis
      and obliteration of the small to medium size bronchioles known as obliterative bronchiolitis
      (OB). Very little is known about the pathogenic mechanisms that lead to the development of
      OB. Furthermore, it is unclear why acute rejection leads to the development of chronic
      rejection in some but not all patients. In order to better understand the mechanisms of OB we
      propose a series of experiments designed to evaluate differences in airway gene expression in
      a series of lung transplant recipients with and without acute rejection.
