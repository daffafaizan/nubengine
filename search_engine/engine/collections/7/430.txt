2045. the effect ofunilateral limb shield-ing on the haemopoieticresponse of theguinea-pig to gammairradiationguineapigs were exposed to150 r  -irradiationwhilst approx. 1/5 of the total bonemarrow was protect-ed by shielding 2 limbs.  quantitativecell counts of boththe shielded and irradiated marrowwere combined withobservations on the thymus, spleenand blood during therecovery period, and comparedwith the effects of whole-body irradiation.  followingwhole-body irradiation(150 r) the thymus shows adelayed secondary cellulardepletion coinciding with amarked splenic hyperplasia.both phenomena were eliminatedby limb shielding.  thelymphocytes in the irradiatedmarrow of partially shiel-ded animals continued to showboth the overshoot and thesecondary fall in numbers whichcharacterize recoveryfrom whole-body irradiation(150 r).  after an initial fallin numbers of erythroid andgranulocytic precursors,the shielded marrow showeda temporary increase ingranulocytopoiesis coincidingwith an abortive phase ofgranulocytopoiesis in the irradiatedmarrow.  there wasno evidence of any effective colonizationof irradiatedmarrow by cells from the shielded marrow.the signi-ficance of these findings is discussed.
