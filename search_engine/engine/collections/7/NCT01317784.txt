      testing" for "HIV/AIDS and AIDS-related co-infections" such as "hepatitis C virus (HCV),
      other sexually transmitted infections (STIs)" that are part of PA-07-307 Drug Abuse Aspects
      of HIV/AIDS. The only rapid tests that are approved for use in the US currently are for HIV
      infection. Tests for other conditions such as hepatitis C (HCV) and syphilis are in use in
      other countries. In response to an Opportunity that the CDC published in the Federal
      Register, there are now candidate rapid test kits for HCV and syphilis available for
      experimental use in the US. Different combinations of rapid and standard tests will be
      offered to participants in a four-arm trial to assess which tests are accepted by the
      participants. Only a minority of clients at CBRS who have been offered the rapid test for HIV
      have accepted it. Those who chose rapid HIV tests were more likely to be male, educated, gay,
      young and White. They were less likely to be Black, or injection drug users. The proposed
      study has the potential to have a significant impact upon screening for HIV, syphilis, and
      HCV. Rapid tests have the potential to increase the receipt of test results, particularly
      among groups that are less likely to return for their results using traditional testing. The
      candidate tests are designed for Point of Care (either oral fluid and/or whole blood), and
      thus will require real-time testing, so the trial will be able to evaluate both the accuracy
      of the tests in settings of intended use and their acceptability to potential clients in
      real-world situations.
