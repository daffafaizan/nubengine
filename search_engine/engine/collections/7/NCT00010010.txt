      hormone receptor positive metastatic breast cancer after tamoxifen failure. II. Determine the
      toxicity of this regimen in these patients. III. Determine the hormonal profile of patients
      treated with this regimen. IV. Determine the predictive value of HER-2, epidermal growth
      factor receptor, and estrogen receptor for response in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral exemestane daily on days 1-28 and goserelin subcutaneously on
      day 1. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 22-40 patients will be accrued for this study.
