      employment. The goal of the study is to determine the effectiveness of IPS in helping persons
      with SUD obtain ordinary employment. A pragmatic, two-arm, parallel, superiority, randomized
      controlled trial will be conducted. The project is financed through innovation funding from
      the South Eastern Norway Regional Health Authority, the Norwegian Directorate of Health and
      internal resources from OUS. Participants will be allocated randomly to either an employment
      specialist whom they will have individual contact with for the coming 13 months or shorter
      (intervention), or to a self-help and four-sessions work shop intervention (control
      comparison). The intervention fidelity will be assessed by external evaluators according to
      the Norwegian translation of the IPS Fidelity Scale. Patients will be recruited to the study
      over a period of two years, and followed for 18 months my data collection and up until 10
      years in national registries.
