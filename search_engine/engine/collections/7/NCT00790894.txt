      neo-adjuvant setting with chemotherapy will be considered for this study. Subjects must not
      have received cytotoxic chemotherapy for locally recurrent/metastatic disease. Patients who
      fulfil the eligibility criteria, and have signed inform consent for the trial will be
      centrally randomized by electronic means to one of two ixabepilone treatment arms.
      Stratification factors will include: time to recurrence from adjuvant treatment, calculated
      from the date of the last dose of adjuvant treatment to the date of relapse (≤ 1 year vs. > 1
      year); and previous chemotherapy with taxane regimen in the neo-adjuvant or adjuvant setting
      (yes vs. no). Randomization will be balanced by site.Treatment Protocol· Arm A [standard once
      every three weeks schedule]:Ixabepilone [BMS-247550] will be administered on Day 1 (D1) every
      three weeks as a 3-hour infusion at a dose of 40 mg/m2. · Arm B [weekly schedule]:Ixabepilone
      [BMS-247550] will be administered weekly for three weeks as a 3-hour infusion at a dose of 20
      mg/m2, followed by one week-off.Treatment can be continued until consent withdrawal by the
      patient, intolerable toxicity or documented disease progression.
