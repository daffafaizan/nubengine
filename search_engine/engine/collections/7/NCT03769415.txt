    
      Primary Objectives:

        1. To determine if clinical:molecular subtypes differ from expected results 15% of time

        2. To determine if molecular information alters treatment plans, as perceived by treating
           physican through survey

      Subjects will be consented to the trial and archival tissue from primary tumor will be
      obtained. Stored tissue from metastatic sites will also be obtained. The physician will be
      asked what the preferred medications for next two lines of treatment. PAM50 testing to
      determine molecular subtype will be determined on primary and metastatic tissue. The
      molecular subtype results of the primary tissue will be returned to the physician, and the
      physician will again be asked the preferred medications for the next two lines of treatment.
      The number of times these medications change between the first and second surveys will be
      determined.

      Subjects active participation will only last as long as the consent process.
