      NAFLD by assessing with fibroscan in both newly diagnosed and known pediatric patients with
      NAFLD. This will be done by performing a fibroscan during each visit and comparing patient
      ALT and fecal microbiome at various intervals.

      The primary endpoint is to assess the effect of probiotic treatment in liver steatosis and
      fibrosis by assessing with fibroscan using CAP score and TE staging. The higher the CAP score
      (S1, S2, S3) so worse the steatosis. TE staging (F0-F4), higher the staging indicates
      worsening of fibrosis.

      Secondary endpoints include:

        -  The rate of decline of ALT over 3 month time interval and through whole study starting
           at initial diagnosis.

        -  The rate of decrease in hepatic steatosis and BMI

      This study will target pediatric patients with NAFLD. Participants will be new and previously
      diagnosed NAFLD patients between the ages of 5 years and 18 years.

      This is single center study. Investigators will enroll patients from The Division of
      Pediatric Gastroenterology, Liver Disease and Nutrition.

      Participants will be blindly randomized into one of two groups: probiotic or placebo.

      Investigators expect the study to run for 1 year from 09/15/2020 to 09/14/2021. Investigators
      will enroll patients over a 6 month period. After randomization into two separate groups
      (probiotic vs placebo), Investigators plan to collect data for the subsequent 6 months
      following enrollment.
