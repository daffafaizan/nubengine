      prevent obesity in young Chinese American children from low-income families with overweight
      mothers. The proposed study framework is based on the Information Motivation Behavioral
      Skills Model, which includes the mothers' gained knowledge/information, increased personal
      and social motivators, and acquired behavioral skills towards behavioral changes. The
      intervention will be developed with a Community Advisory Committee and validated for cultural
      appropriateness through a beta-testing process. The validated intervention will be
      implemented thereafter. Eligible overweight mothers with young Chinese American children
      (ages three to five years) will be recruited from local day care settings, low-income housing
      and Head Start programs to participate in the study. Participants will be randomized into
      either the intervention (N=15) or control group (N=15). Participants in the intervention
      group will receive the 8-week online interactive sessions and activities delivered through
      tablet computers. Participants in the control group will receive general health promotion
      topics relevant to preschool-age children via mailing materials weekly for eight weeks.
