      written informed consent form. The clinical effectiveness of two different periodontal
      surgical techniques (gingival unit graft and connective tissue graft) in gingival recessions
      will be evaluated. Periodontal measurements (gingival recession, keratinized gingiva height)
      and patient-reported outcomes (intra and post-operative pain, patient satisfaction and
      hypersensitivity) are defined.
