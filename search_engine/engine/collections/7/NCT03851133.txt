      of Florida have formed a partnership known as the Florida Pancreas Collaborative. The goals
      of the Florida Pancreas Collaborative team are to find better ways to diagnose and treat
      pancreatic cancer and improve quality of life. Recent research suggests that pancreatic
      cancer affects people of various racial and ethnic groups differently, with some groups
      having more aggressive disease and a poorer prognosis than other groups.

      In this research study, the investigators want to partner with individuals known or suspected
      to have pancreatic cancer to build a 'biobank' dedicated to minimizing disparities and
      personalizing care for individuals affected by pancreatic cancer. A biobank is a valuable
      resource that involves collection, processing, and storage of blood, other bodily fluids, and
      tissue (obtained during biopsy or surgery) to improve the investigator's understanding of
      health and disease. When combined with information and medical images obtained through
      routine care, the investigators will be able to investigate biological processes that may
      underlie differences and poor outcomes and target them with more effective therapeutic
      strategies tailored to the individual.
