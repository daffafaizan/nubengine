      from peritoneum and the inside of the jejunum. A swab will also be taken from the rectum.

      The peritoneum is regarded as a sterile place until today. We try to either verify this, we
      also could find a scientific base for theories like leaky gut or other forms of bacterial
      migration through the intestinal wall.

      Many of these patients undergo bariatric surgery. Many of them do have a dramatic change in
      glucose metabolism immediate after surgery. Therefore stool swabs will be taken before and 5
      days after surgery.
