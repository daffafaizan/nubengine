      hemidiaphragmatic paresis in patients who undergo the double injection ultrasound-guided
      supraclavicular block. Diaphragmatic dysfunction will be determined by intercostal diaphragm
      thickening measured using ultrasound. The available image will be saved.

      Patients having below the elbow surgery will be be approached by someone from the research
      team for consent and possible inclusion in the study. This will be done in the anesthesia
      preoperative assessment clinic, or in the pre-op area on the day of surgery (if a patient was
      not seen in clinic).

      A baseline ultrasonographic diaphragmatic assessment will be completed. Study participants
      will then receive supraclavicular brachial plexus block as per standard of care.
      Ultrasonographic diaphragmatic assessment and dyspnea score (using modified Borg dyspnea
      scale) will be performed every 5 minutes for 30 minutes, or until the patient is transferred
      to the operating room, whatever comes first. Patients will also undergo an ultrasonographic
      diaphragmatic assessment and dyspnea score in the recovery room after their surgery.
