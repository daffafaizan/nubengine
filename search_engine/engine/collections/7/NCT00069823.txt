      Gastroesophageal reflux (GERD) is frequent in asthmatics with poor asthma control, often
      occurs without symptoms, and can induce bronchoconstriction. Poorly controlled asthmatics are
      often treated for GERD with drugs that suppress gastric acid, but this treatment is expensive
      and the benefit of such treatment is not established. Proton pump inhibitors are a relatively
      new class of medications that provide highly effective treatment for GERD and associated
      problems. This success has led many doctors to begin PPI treatment in their asthma patients
      in an attempt to achieve better asthma control.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      The randomized, placebo-controlled trial will enroll 400 asthmatics, ages 18 or older, who
      have poor asthma control on inhaled steroids, defined on the basis of excessive
      bronchodilator use, nocturnal awakenings, or frequent exacerbations. Participants will be
      randomly assigned to treatment with either a proton pump inhibitor, esomeprazole (Nexium) 40
      mg twice a day, or matching placebo. The presence, severity, and temporal relationship of
      GERD to asthma symptoms will be documented with 24 hour ambulatory esophageal potential
      Hydrogen (pH) probe monitoring, but participants will be enrolled irrespective of the
      severity of GERD. The primary outcome measure is the proportion of participants who have
      exacerbations of asthma within a 6-month period defined by asthma diaries and interviews.
      Secondary outcome measures include asthma symptom and control scores, asthma-specific and
      generic health-related quality of life, GERD symptoms, health care use, pulmonary function,
      and airways reactivity. Pre-specified subgroup analyses will be conducted to determine if
      there are clinical or demographic characteristics that predict benefit from treatment of GERD
      in asthma.
