      I. To determine if NAFLD patients with advanced fibrosis will demonstrate a change in PRO-C3,
      a marker of liver fibrosis, following 24 weeks of treatment with lisinopril.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Noninvasive measures of fibrosis and steatosis:

      Ia. Change from baseline in XM-PRO-C3 (cross-linked multimeric PRO-C3). Ib. Change from
      baseline in steatosis, as measured by magnetic resonance imaging-proton density fat fraction
      (MRI-PDFF).

      Ic. Change from baseline in steatosis, as measured by controlled attenuation parameter (CAP),
      determined with transient elastography (Fibroscan).

      Id. Change from baseline in liver stiffness as measured with magnetic resonance elastography
      (MRE).

      Ie. Change from baseline in liver stiffness as measured with transient elastography
      (Fibroscan).

      If. Changes from baseline in Fibrosis-4 score (FIB-4) and NAFLD fibrosis score (NFS).

      Ig. Change in inflammatory markers (caspase cleaved cytokeratin 18 [CK-18], NF-kappaB,
      TGF-beta, TNF-alpha, IL6 and IL8).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive lisinopril orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 24 weeks in absence of
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed up at 32 weeks after the start of study medication.
