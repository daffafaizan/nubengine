    
      Purpose and design: This study will answer the following research questions:

        1. What is the prevalence of glaucoma within the NICOLA cohort and which systemic and
           socioeconomic factors influence its prevalence?

        2. What is the diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity and specificity) of Retinal Nerve Fibre
           Layer (RNFL) thickness measurements in the diagnosis of glaucoma?

        3. What is the diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity and specificity) of macular thickness
           analysis in the diagnosis of glaucoma?

        4. What is the agreement between intraocular pressure measurement by Ocular Response
           Analyser (ORA) and Goldmann tonometry?

        5. What is the correlation between structural (circumpapillary RNFL or macular Ganglion
           Cell Complex thickness) or functional measurements (retinal oximetry or perimetry) and
           Optical Coherence Tomography angiography parameters (% vessel density and vessel
           calibre) in the assessment of glaucoma?
