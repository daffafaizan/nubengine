      diagnosed and treated for soft tissue sarcomas (STS) will increase. The dilemma is that
      surgeons and medical oncologists may be hesitant to treat elderly patients in a comparably
      intensive manner as is used in the treatment of younger patients; factors such as decreased
      performance status, significant comorbidities, and disease natural history may erode
      enthusiasm for aggressive STS resection. To this end, a less invasive way of treating soft
      tissue tumors would be helpful in younger patients to minimize morbidity and in the elderly
      to provide less aggressive treatment options. The InSightec ExAblate 2000 magnetic
      resonance-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound (MRgHIFU) system is a non-invasive thermal
      ablation device fully integrated with an MR imaging system and used for the ablation of soft
      tissue (5-10). The ExAblate combines a focused ultrasound surgery (FUS) delivery system and a
      conventional diagnostic 1.5 T or 3 T MRI scanner. It provides a real-time therapy planning
      algorithm, thermal dosimetry, and closed-loop therapy control.
