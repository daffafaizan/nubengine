      comprise cavities treated by ART, following the protocol proposed by Frencken and Holmgren
      (1999), while the experimental group will comprise cavities treated by HT, according to the
      guideline published by Innes and Evans (2011). The allocation of patients in each group will
      be carried out by a random list generated by a specific computer program. To ensure the
      allocation concealment, the sequence generated by randomization will be distributed in
      opaque, sealed envelopes, which will be opened by the operator during the treatment, only
      after the patient is ready to receive treatment.

      Operators will be two undergraduate students in dentistry and one experienced specialist in
      pediatric dentistry that will be trained on how to prepare and fill the cavities according to
      the original procedures of ART (Frencken and Holmgren, 1999) and also according to HT (Innes
      and Evans, 2011). The training will include a lecture about the techniques used in this
      study, as well as a workshop held in the laboratory for students to train handling and
      application of treatments to be tested. They will also undergo a week of training with
      patients, to apply the different techniques before starting the study, the latter phase held
      at the Faculty of Dentistry, University of SÃ£o Paulo, under the supervision of an experienced
      dentist in ART and HT.

      Each child will be allocated for one of the operators with the aid of a random list. All
      treatments will be performed on the school premises, in field conditions without the use of
      dental chair or other facilities from a clinical environment.
