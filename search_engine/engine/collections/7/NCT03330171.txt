      African children aged 6 months. Only one study has examined the safety and immunogenicity of
      the recommended CAM-70 measles vaccine strain in children under 9 months of age. In addition,
      there are limited data on the safety and immunogenicity of varicella vaccine (VV) and
      Hepatitis-A vaccination (Hep-AV) in HIV-exposed and HIV-unexposed children in Sub-Saharan
      Africa.

      This is a prospective, observational cohort study nested within a larger randomized,
      open-label trial on pneumococcal-conjugate vaccine (PCV) titled PCV1+1. 70 HIV-exposed and
      200 HIV-unexposed children will be enrolled at Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital
      (CHBAH) and neighbouring primary health clinics.

      Immune responses to the vaccines will be measured as rate of seroconversion, rate of
      seroprotection, and geometric mean titres (GMT) one month post primary immunization (MV1, VV,
      Hep-AV) and one month post booster dose (MV2). In addition, pre-vaccination and medium
      long-term antibody levels at 4.5 months, 12 months and 18 months will be evaluated. Number of
      adverse events in all immunized infants will be recorded throughout the study duration and
      compared between groups. Long-term antibody levels at 3, 4 and 5 years of age will be
      measured during annual follow-up visits.

      This study will add to the current evidence on immunizing infants with MV (CAM-70) at 6 and
      12 months of age. Data will be stratified by HIV-exposure and HIV-infection, thereby offering
      insight in the influence of HIV on post-vaccination immune responses. The findings on
      VV/Hep-AV safety, immunogenicity and seroprevalence will be useful to informing future
      immunization policies in Sub-Saharan Africa.
