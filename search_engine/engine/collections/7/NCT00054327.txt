        -  Determine a standard approach to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation with matched
           unrelated donors in patients with hematologic malignancies.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the relapse rate and survival rate in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Correlate incidence and severity of graft-versus-host disease with relapse and survival
           in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive 1 of the following preparative regimens:

        -  Regimen A: Patients receive cytarabine IV over 1 hour twice daily on days -9 to -7 and
           cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours on days -6 and -5. Patients also undergo total body
           irradiation (TBI) twice daily on days -4 to -1.

        -  Regimen B-1: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV and TBI as in regimen A.

        -  Regimen B-2: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours on days -5 and -4.
           Patients also undergo TBI twice daily on days -3 to -1.

        -  Regimen B-3: Patients receive TBI on days -7 to -5. Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV
           over on days -4 to -3.

        -  Regimen C: Patients receive oral busulfan 4 times daily on days -8 to -5 and
           cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours on days -4 to -2.

        -  Regimen D: Patients receive TBI on days -6 to -4. Patients receive etoposide infusion on
           day -3.

      All patients undergo stem cell transplantation from a matched, unrelated donor on day 0.

      Patients are followed weekly for 100 days, at 6 months, and then every 6 months for 2.5
      years.
