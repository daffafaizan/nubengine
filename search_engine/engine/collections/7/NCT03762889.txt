      anesthesia. Corneal abrasion is the most common ocular injury during general anesthesia,
      surpassing case incidence of damage caused by patient movement in ophthalmologic surgery.
      Causes of ocular injury include corneal drying due to the suppression of tear ducts from
      anesthetic agents, direct physical trauma, or agitation from the volatile anesthetic used.
      Ocular injury may also occur due to bacterial infection with MRSA, preventative methods, or
      rubbing of the eyes postoperatively due to agitation. Agitation may be caused by corneal
      drying or by shift or disruption in rapid eye movement sleep cycle from light penetration
      through the eyelids. Attempts at prevention of corneal abrasion have been used, including
      taping the eyelids shut, manual eye closure, paraffin-based ointment application into the
      conjunctival sac, and the use of hydrophilic contact lenses, although only a few studies have
      validated the comparison of these methods' effectiveness.

      Eyeprotxâ„¢ Protective Goggles have been designed specifically for use in the operating room or
      in any scenario where general anesthesia must be used, such as intubation in an emergency.
      Current ocular protective measures such as tapes during anesthesia have been associated with
      injury and infection. With this study, we hope to find a safer preventative technique against
      ocular injury during the perioperative period.
