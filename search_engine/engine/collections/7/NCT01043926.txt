      This study plans to enroll 16 participants in Part I (8 participants with moderate hepatic
      insufficiency and 8 healthy participants) and 16 participants in Part II (8 participants with
      mild hepatic insufficiency and 8 healthy participants).

      Part II will be conducted only if the primary hypothesis is not met and there is a
      significant difference in the PK of suvorexant between healthy participants and moderate
      hepatic insufficiency participants in Part I.
