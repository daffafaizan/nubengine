      metabolism) that progressively affect most organ systems in the body, usually beginning in
      childhood. Recent treatment advances have produced amelioration of some of these
      malfunctions, but notably brain and bone have been difficult to effectively treat. This
      research addresses the brain abnormalities in the MPS disorders, about which little is known.

      The objectives of this research are:

        1. to identify abnormalities of central nervous system (CNS) structure and function as well
           as to measure quality-of-life (QOL) in both treated and untreated MPS patients over
           time. The investigators will accomplish this through longitudinal studies of enrolled
           patients in designated centers in North America.

        2. to develop quantitative measurements of change, including direct measurement of
           neuropsychological function; surrogate MRI markers; and biomarkers to measure stage of
           disease and treatment outcomes.

        3. to examine the degree to which independent variables have an impact on both functional
           and structural outcome. Independent variables may include, but are not limited to: age
           at first treatment, severity of disease, types of medical abnormalities, nature of
           genetic mutation, medical events, and sensory abnormalities.

        4. to examine how treatments such as Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT), Hematopoietic Cell
           Transplant (HCT), substrate reduction, and other palliative and rehabilitative therapies
           differentially affect CNS structure and function, as well as the subject's quality of
           life.
