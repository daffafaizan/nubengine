      efficacy of systemic lycopene (8 mgms Daily for two months) as an adjunct to scaling and root
      planing in chronic periodontitis patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The primary outcome
      measures were Serum MDA, CRP and Hb1AC. The secondary outcomes were modified gingival
      index(GI), Probing pocket depth(PPD), and Clinical attachment level(CAL). All the outcomes
      were measured at baseline, 2 months and 6 months.

      The results were that the Lycopene with scaling and root planing group gave:

      Statistically significant results in reducing Mean serum MDA levels at 2 months and 6 months
      respectively.
