      I. To estimate the proportion of patients who have objective tumor response (complete or
      partial).

      II. To determine the frequency and severity of adverse events associated with treatment with
      veliparib (ABT-888) as assessed by the Active Version of the National Cancer Institute (NCI)
      Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the duration of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).

      II. To determine the proportion of patients who survive progression-free for at least 6
      months.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair genes (e.g., breast cancer [BRCA]1, Fanconi) and clinical
      characteristics, response, and patient outcome (PFS and OS).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive veliparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every
      28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.
