      the control group received the usual tray services.

      Hypothesis: We hypothesized that the intervention program had a positive effect on quality of
      life, food intake, body weight, physical performance, and biochemical data (hematocrit,
      hemoglobin, leucocytes, ferretin, albumin, homocysteine and folate) among the residents in
      the intervention group, while these outcome measures would regularly decline among the
      residents in the control group.

      Site and participants: Nursing homes volunteered to participate in the study. In each nursing
      home there was a control and intervention ward. Only residents with a chronic somatic
      disorder were included. Residents were excluded when they were in a terminal phase of a
      disease, had total parenteral feeding or were not able to give informed consent due to their
      physical or mental condition. The ethical committee and the client board of the nursing homes
      and the medical ethical committee of Wageningen University approved the study protocol.

      Intervention: The intervention program lasted for six months and was based on an inventory
      research of mealtime ambiance models in the Netherlands. The program consisted of five
      aspects: table dressing, food services, staff protocol, residents' protocol, and mealtime
      protocol. Before the start of the meal, tables were set with tablecloths, full cutlery and
      plates. The cooked meal was served in dishes and residents had the opportunity to choose
      between two kinds of vegetables, two kinds of meat and potatoes.
