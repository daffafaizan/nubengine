      days prior to the dose administration. Subjects will be admitted into the Clinical Research
      Unit (CRU) on Day -1 and be confined to the CRU until at least Day 8. On Day 1, subjects will
      receive a single oral dose of [14C]-saroglitazar magnesium. Subjects will be discharged if
      the following discharge criteria are met: plasma radioactivity levels below the limit of
      quantitation for 2 consecutive collections and ≥ 90% mass balance recovery, or ≤ 1% of the
      total radioactive dose is recovered in combined excreta (urine and feces) in 3 consecutive
      24-hour periods in which both are collected. If discharge criteria are not met by Day 8,
      subjects will remain in the CRU up to Day 12.
