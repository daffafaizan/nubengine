      years beyond the FDA approved duration. Participants enrolled in the current study, EPIC
      (Evaluating the Prolonged Use of IUD and Implant for Contraception, NCT02267616), will be
      contacted via telephone, screened and scheduled to enroll in person. After the signed consent
      is obtained participants will be asked to complete a brief questionnaire on demographic
      information and bleeding patterns. Participants will undergo a blood draw to assess serum
      etonogestrel and serum progesterone levels.

      Follow up visits will include a weekly blood draw for three weeks to assess serum
      progesterone levels. Participants will also complete a bleeding diary to assess daily
      bleeding patterns for the 30 day study period.

      The investigators will enroll participants at seven time points; at method expiration (3
      years of use), and in six-month intervals through six years of use.
