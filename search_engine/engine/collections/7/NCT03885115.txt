      LUAM are to: (1) to increase the percentage of youth who meet 60 minutes of daily MVPA per
      week; (2) to improve the quality of sleep patterns (i.e., sleep efficiency and duration); and
      (3) to reduce percent body fat (%BF). It is hypothesized that compared to the control group
      (CG) participants, the experimental group (EG) participants will exhibit: (a) greater
      increase in percentage of children who meet 60 minutes of daily MVPA per week; (b) greater
      increase of sleep efficiency and duration; and (c) greater decrease in sleep latency and (d)
      greater decrease in %BF.
