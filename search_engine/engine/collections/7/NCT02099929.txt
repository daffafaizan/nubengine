      adults, who were enrolled five treatments: coffee with sugar, coffee without sugar,
      decaffeinated coffee without sugar and two controls (water with and without sugar).

      The stable isotope minimal model protocol with oral glucose administration (Oral Dose
      Intravenous Label Experiment - ODILE) was performed. The use of ODILE methodology permits
      separation of the glucose absorbed and removed from the circulation increasing the accuracy
      and the effectiveness of glucose uptake and insulin sensitivity (Bluck et al., 2006).
