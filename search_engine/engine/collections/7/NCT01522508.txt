      and has not become clinical routine yet. Recently, for the Surgical Pleth Index SPI a benefit
      for the patient in terms of reduction of remifentanil use, less unwanted effects and shorter
      recovery from anesthesia was reported. However, there are new variables like the ANI that are
      developed to measure antinociception during anesthesia.

      In the present study the investigators want to evaluate, whether ANI detects a painful
      tetanic stimulus during general anesthesia using propofol or sevoflurane and different
      concentrations of remifentanil.
