      Morbidity and mortality from pediatric asthma have been increasing in developed countries
      over the past three decades, making asthma the most common chronic disease of children. A
      joint session at the American Thoracic Society meeting in May 2000 was titled "Childhood
      Asthma: Is Change in Lifestyle the Key"? During this session, the hypothesis was advanced
      that a lack of physical exercise and higher levels of childhood obesity may be contributing
      to an increased incidence of asthma among United States children.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      Data from physician diagnosed pediatric asthma were assessed for relationships with the
      potential risk factors body mass index, percent fat and lean tissue, obesity, and physical
      activity. The data pertained to a large population-based multi-ethnic cohort of school
      children (n=826) from the Detroit area for whom, using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry,
      precise measurements of whole body bone mass, and soft tissue composition were collected
      along with height and weight measurements in 1992-1993, when the children were nine years
      old. Detailed data on physical activity, collected with consultation with an exercise
      physiologist, and prevalent asthma diagnosis and symptoms, collected under the direction of a
      respiratory disease/pediatric epidemiologist and a pediatric allergist, were obtained at the
      same time.

      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the "End Date" entered in
      the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record
