    
      A comprehensive questionnaire will be used to evaluate the environmental, biological,
      physical and behavioral risk factors of associated with the recurrence after pterygium
      excision.

      Slit lamp digital color photographs will be taken on primary and recurrent pterygium and
      pterygium will be graded in three levels of severity, based on relative transparency of
      pterygium tissue; grade 1 (transparent), grade 2 (intermediate), and grade 3 (opaque) to see
      whether the risk factors correlate to the morphology of the pterygium.

      Tear samples will be collected before surgery using schirmers strip.Proteins in tear samples
      will be analyzed using the iTRAQ method.

      The transcriptional differences in pterygium and conjunctival tissue samples will be analyzed
      using western blot, qPCR and immunohistochemistry assays.
