      is safe and improves the time to repeat paracentesis. In patients with non-draining malignant
      peritoneal effusion, published data suggests that the average time to repeat paracentesis in
      malignant ascites is 10-13 Days. The investigators' treatment will be considered potentially
      efficacious if the median time to repeat paracentesis is greater than 14 days.
