    
      This is a prospective, Phase 2, single center study of participants with Neuroendocrine
      Tumors (NETs). Study participants will receive 68Ga-DOTATOC. DOTATOC is a somatostatin
      analogue that localizes on the somatostatin receptors expressed by NETs and is attached to a
      radioactive material called Gallium 68. Participants will undergo a PET/CT imaging study to
      investigate 68Ga-DOTATOC's suitability as a positron emission tomography (PET) imaging agent
      for NETs. The radiation (imaging) dose will be 111-185 megabecquerel (MBq) (3 - 5 mCi) ± 25%.
      All doses after labeling will be presented in buffered solution for intravenous injection.
      Imaging will start 90 ±30 minutes after injection.

      Sensitivity and specificity of this imaging technique will be compared with those of
      conventional imaging modality including CT, MRI and In-111 Octreoscan performed within 6-12
      months before or after PET/CT.
