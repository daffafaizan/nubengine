      approximately 2 weeks prior to surgery. The second dose will be administered about 3-4 weeks
      following surgery. A booster dose of the vaccine will be given 6 months after the 2nd
      vaccine. The tumor tissue and serum will be studied for immunological responses following
      therapy with the vaccine. Patients are allowed to receive adjuvant chemotherapy if indicated.
      The choice of the chemotherapy regimen will be at the discretion of the treating physician,
      preferably 3-4 cycles of platinum combination regimen. The vaccine should be administered at
      least 2 weeks before chemotherapy is initiated.
