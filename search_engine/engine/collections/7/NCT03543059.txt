      median age in Chinese women than in western white women. About 60% of breast cancer patients
      are still in premenopausal status at the time of diagnosis in China. Chemotherapy is one of
      the important treatments for breast cancer, but it brings a series of adverse effects. It is
      a multicenter prospective observational study. The premenopausal breast cancer women patients
      who are planning adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy are enrolled in the study after signing
      the informed consent form and passing the screening. We collect their basic information,
      medical history, chemotherapy-related adverse reactions, and the results of hormone, blood
      lipid, and bone density test before, during and after chemotherapy. The aim of the study is
      to evaluate the effect of adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy on ovarian function and
      fertility and the protective effect of GnRHa by investigating the menopausal symptoms,
      pregnancy, menstruation condition, hormone levels, blood lipid, bone density, and the usage
      of GnRHa in the premenopausal women with breast cancer. In addition, the collected
      information of the subjects are analyzed to provide suggestions for the relevant prevention
      strategy.
