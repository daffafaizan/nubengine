      following the lack of demonstration of efficacy in the completed DIM14 (CONNECTION) Study.
      The study was not terminated due to any safety findings. Dimebon has been well-tolerated in
      clinical trials. Demonstration of efficacy for dimebon in Alzheimer's disease is pending
      completion of the ongoing DIM18 (CONCERT) Study.
