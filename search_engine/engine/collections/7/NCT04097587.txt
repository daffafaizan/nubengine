      (receiving parental education, n=63), and control group (daily activities, n=66). Data were
      collected before and after intervention. Instruments included screen time, Children's Sleep
      Habits Questionnaire, and Pediatric Symptom Checklist-17. A linear mixed model analysis was
      used to examine the efficacy of education intervention.
