      regular inpatient medical treatment. Participants in the experimental arm will receive laser
      treatments once daily for 4 days. Treatments will be delivered to the patients in a prone
      position using a 10 by 25 cm laser field across each lung with 7j/cm2 at 1500 Hz. Standard
      nursing protocols would be used to identify participant's pulmonary status throughout
      treatment.
