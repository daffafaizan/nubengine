      with early inflammatory back pain in order to set up a database to facilitate several
      investigations on diagnosis, prognosis, epidemiology, pathogenesis and medico-economics in
      the field of early inflammatory back pain and spondyloarthritis.

      The Patients were recruited if they had inflammatory back pain of more than 3months and less
      than 3years. Patients will be followed every 6months during the first 2years then every year
      during at least 5years. Apart from information collected on a Case Report Form (demographics,
      disease activity, severity, co-morbidities, socio-economics, treatments, radiological and MRI
      evaluation of the spine and the pelvis according to the local investigators, and for some
      centers bone densitometry and ultrasonography of entheses), the digital X-rays and MRI of the
      spine and pelvis are stored using a specific software (Carestream) and the biological samples
      (DNA, RNA, sera, urines) are centralized at the Biological Resources Center (Bichat
      Hospital).

      This large cohort should facilitate the conduct of researches in different areas (clinical,
      medico-economics, translational) in order to improve our knowledge on the pathogenesis and
      natural history of axial spondyloarthritis
