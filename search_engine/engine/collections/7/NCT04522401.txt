    
      Monocentric prospective non-randomized observational study with subgroup analysis on the
      assessment of the day hospital at the Aging Biennial Hospital of Saint-Etienne.

      The main objective is to investigate the factors limiting or encouraging adherence to
      recommendations in a population aged over 65, fragile or pre-fragile, autonomous and living
      at home or in a shelter.

      Patients will benefit from a multidisciplinary assessment including a geriatric assessment
      standardized by a geriatrician, an evaluation by a dietician, an evaluation by an
      occupational therapist. They will then be exposed to a personalized plan of care in the form
      of a recommendation.

      Patients will be followed at home to evaluate the implementation of their personalized care
      plan at 3 months of their assessment day at the day hospital, then at 6 and 9 months. The
      study will take place over a period of approximately 24 months.
