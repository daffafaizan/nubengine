    
      This is a phase 1 open label study of the safety, PK, and PD of single-dose 10 mL IQP-0528
      through rectal administration. Pharmacokinetics (PK) will be assessed in multiple
      compartments: plasma, rectal tissue, vaginal tissue, rectal fluid and cervicovaginal fluid.
      The luminal distribution of DuoGel in the rectum will be evaluated with Single Photon
      Emission Computed Tomography/ X-ray Computed Tomography (SPECT/CT). Pharmacodynamics (PD)
      will be assessed in an ex vivo HIV explant challenge of rectal and vaginal tissue biopsies.

      After completing the screening evaluation (Visit 1) and establishing participant eligibility,
      16 eligible participants will be enrolled: 8 men and 8 women. A subsequent baseline visit
      (Visit 2) safety assessment and tissue ex vivo HIV explant challenge will be performed as
      baseline for comparison with later post-drug evaluation. Participants will receive a single
      10 mL rectal dose of 99mTechnetium (99mTc) -radiolabelled DuoGel (Visit 3), followed by
      safety assessments and PK and PD sampling over three days (Visits 3, 4, and 5). Finally, a
      follow-up safety phone call is performed a week after all PK sampling and biopsies are
      collected.
