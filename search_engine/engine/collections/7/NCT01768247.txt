      be recruited. The investigators sought to investigate the possible role of adding low dose
      HCG in the follicular phase, on the endometrial growth and development. The investigators
      constructed this hypothesis based on the fact that LH/HCG (luteinizing hormone/human
      chorionic gonadotropin) receptor is present in endometrium and therefore a positive
      interaction could be anticipated when HCG is administered in the proliferative phase of
      endometrial growth. Furthermore, in a previous study, where human menopausal gonadotropin
      (hMG) -well known that renders its luteinizing hormone (LH) capacity due to low dose HCG
      contain- was compared to recombinant-follicular stimulating hormone (rec-FSH) during ovarian
      stimulation, endometrium was more likely to be iso-echogenic and hypo-echogenic in the hMG
      group, also anticipating a possible positive role of HCG activity.
