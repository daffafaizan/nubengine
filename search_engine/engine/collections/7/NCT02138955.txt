    
      Patients with solid tumors who either failed to initially respond to approved chemotherapy or
      who have progressive solid tumor cancers following initial response to approved chemotherapy,
      are eligible for treatment in this phase 1b trial of ascending doses of intravenous liposomal
      curcumin following a four week period without previous chemotherapy.The escalating dose range
      of liposomal curcumin will be from 100mg/M2 to 300 mg/M2 in cohorts of three to 6 patients,
      and administered over eight hours by a syringe pump weekly for eight weeks. Safety and
      tolerability will be determined by drug related adverse symptoms(if any), hematologic and
      serologic signs at each clinic visit and by electronic communication between visits.
      Pharmacokinetic profiles following infusion of drug will be compared with any adverse
      changes, and any beneficial subjective or objective responses. When the maximum tolerated
      dose level is reached in any cohort , another three patients will be accrued at a preceding
      dose level to assure tolerability in subsequent phase 2 clinical trials.
