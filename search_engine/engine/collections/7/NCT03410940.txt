    
      The CLS Brevius Stem with Kinectiv Technology (also referred to as CLS Brevius Kinectiv Stem)
      is a straight, cementless stem which is based on the successful anchoring philosophy of the
      CLS Spotorno Stem. In order to be more bone-conserving, the stem was distally shortened by
      20% compared to the CLS Spotorno Stem. To restore individual patients' anatomies more
      accurately, the CLS Brevius Stems are fused with the existing Zimmer Kinectiv Modular Neck
      Technology.

      The objectives of this study are to confirm the safety and performance of the CLS Brevius
      Kinectiv Stem when used in primary total hip arthroplasty. Safety will be evaluated by
      monitoring the frequency and incidence of adverse events. Performance will be determined by
      analyzing the implant survival, overall pain and functional performances, subject
      quality-of-life and radiographic parameters of study subjects who received the CLS Brevius
      Kinectiv Stem.

      In addition, metal ion levels (titanium and aluminium) will be analyzed pre-operatively and
      at 6 months, 1, 2 and 5 years in a subset of 70 to 80 patients (30 to 35%).

      The primary endpoint is defined as the implant survival at 10 years. Indication: Patients
      suffering from severe hip pain and disability requiring total hip arthroplasty and who meet
      the inclusion/exclusion criteria.

      Study design: multi-center, prospective, non-controlled. Length of Study: 12 years (20 months
      enrollment plus 10 years follow-up): follow-up visits at 6 months, 1,2,3,5,7 and 10 years
      post-operatively.

      A maximum total of 230 patients will be enrolled in the study.
