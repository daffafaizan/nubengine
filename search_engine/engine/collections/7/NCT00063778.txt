      HIV subtype C gag vaccine. This vaccine utilizes a propagation-defective replicon vector
      system derived from an attenuated strain of Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis (VEE) virus. The
      vaccine replicon expresses the gag gene from a South African subtype C isolate of HIV-1.

      This study evaluated the AVX101 vaccine in healthy, HIV uninfected volunteers in both the
      United States and South Africa. Participants will be randomized to receive either vaccine or
      placebo at study entry and again at Months 1 and 3. The study was originally designed to
      enroll four groups of participants in both the US and South Africa, with successive groups
      receiving increasing doses of the vaccine, but was later amended to enroll only two groups.
      Twelve US participants (US Group 1) were randomized to receive either vaccine or placebo.
      After a review of initial safety data from this group, 12 South African participants (SA
      Group 1) were randomized to receive the same vaccine dose as US Group 1 or placebo, while 12
      US participants (US Group 2) were randomized to receive the next higher vaccine dose or
      placebo. Review of safety data from SA Group 1 and US Group 2 was used to inform the decision
      to begin enrollment into SA Group 2 .

      Participants had nine study visits over 12 months. Study visits included clinical evaluation,
      urine and blood tests, and HIV tests. After each injection, participants were asked to record
      their temperature and any symptoms each day for 7 days and report them to the clinic staff.
