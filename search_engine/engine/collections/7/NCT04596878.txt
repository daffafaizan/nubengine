      75 women who are pregnant and do not have HIV will randomly receive two 0.5 mL intramuscular
      injections of GBS-NN/NN2 vaccine (60 women) or placebo (15 women).

      Participants will be screened at 24 to 28 weeks gestation (Days -14 to Day -1) and the groups
      will be dosed in parallel. The first dose of vaccine or placebo will be administered at Day 0
      and the second dose will be administered 28Â±2 days later. Delivery is anticipated to be
      approximately 10 to 14 weeks after the first dose of vaccine.

      For the analysis of the immune response, the placebo groups will be combined. For safety, the
      placebo groups will be analysed separately and will be combined for comparison with the
      potential vaccine groups.
