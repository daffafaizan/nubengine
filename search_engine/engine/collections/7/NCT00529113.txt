    
      Phase I will be conducted to determine the MTD of RTA 402 (administered orally Days 1-21 or
      Days 1-28 of a 28-day cycle) in combination with gemcitabine (1000 m/m2). Gemcitabine will be
      administered as an intravenous infusion on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle.

      The phase II portion of the study will be randomized, and double-blinded. Phase II will
      utilize the RTA 402 MTD determined in Phase I; Arm 1 will consist of gemcitabine + RTA 402.
      RTA 402 capsules will administered orally Days 1-21 of each 28-day cycle (or Days 1-28 if
      appropriate, based on phase I results); gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2) will be administered as an
      intravenous infusion on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle in each Arm. Arm 2 will
      consist of gemcitabine + placebo, placebo capsules will be taken orally Days 1-21 of each
      28-day cycle (or Days 1-28 if appropriate, based on phase I results). Both treatment arms are
      4-weeks in length.
