    
      Multicenter, multinational, randomized, double-blind study designed to compare the safety and
      efficacy of telbivudine (600 mg/day) versus lamivudine (100 mg/day) for 104 weeks in adults
      with decompensated chronic hepatitis B and evidence of cirrhosis. Patients were
      pre-stratified by screening Child-Turcotte-Pugh score (CTP score < 9 or â‰¥ 9) and ALT level
      (within normal limits (WNL) or > 1.0 x ULN) to help assure similar degrees of hepatic
      insufficiency and liver inflammation on both treatment arms. After 104 weeks of treatment,
      participants were followed-up with for an additional 16 weeks.
