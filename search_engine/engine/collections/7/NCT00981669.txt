      against rotavirus for infants in its immunization schedule since 2006. Its introduction
      increased the Brazilian Ministry of Health budget because the vaccination in Brazil is free
      of charge. An agreement between Path Foundation and Butantan Institute has made possible the
      transfer of technology to Butantan Institute to produce, at a reduced cost, a pentavalent
      rotavirus vaccine including the the rotavirus serotypes more frequent in Brazil.
