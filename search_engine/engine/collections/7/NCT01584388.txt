      sites are the Massachusetts General Hospital (Boston, MA) and the Mayo Clinic (Rochester,
      MN). All patients will receive rituximab 1 gram intravenously times two doses, separated by
      approximately 15 days. The primary efficacy outcome - disease remission and successful
      completion of the glucocorticoid taper - will be assessed at six months. Patients will be
      followed on the protocol for an additional six months after measurement of the primary
      outcome.
