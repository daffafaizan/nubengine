      specifically binds to EGFR and acts as a competitive antagonist at the ligand binding site of
      EGFR.

      Gatipotuzumab (PankoMab-GEX®) is a novel glyco-engineered humanized monoclonal antibody,
      which recognizes the tumor-specific epitope of mucin-1 (TA-MUC1). Gatipotuzumab targets and
      binds to the TA-MUC1 epitopes on the surface of tumor cells, which may potentially activate
      the immune system to induce antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) against the TA
      MUC1 expressing tumor cells.

      Based on the compelling preclinical evidence suggesting a complex interaction between EGFR
      and TA-MUC1 expressed on the tumor cell surface in driving cancerogenesis, this study aims to
      assess the tolerability, safety and preliminary activity of targeting EGFR and TA-MUC1 with
      glyco-engineered antibodies.

      After enrollment of the first 20 patients, as no DLT was observed and there were no safety
      concerns, an expansion cohort of 30 additional patients was conducted.
