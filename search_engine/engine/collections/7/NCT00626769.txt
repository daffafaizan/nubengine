      389 osteopenic, postmenopausal women for 24 months. After the 24-month visit, a
      sub-population (138 patients) accepted to continue the intervention until 36 months, thus
      generating a follow-up study.

      SETTING: 3 Italian university medical centers. INTERVENTIONS: Participants received 54 mg of
      genistein, daily, (n=71) or placebo (n=67). Both intervention and placebo contained calcium
      and vitamin D3. All patients also received dietary instruction in an isocaloric fat-reduced
      diet.

      MEASUREMENTS: Mammographic breast density at baseline and after 24 and 36 months was assessed
      by visual classification scale and by digitized quantification. BRCA1 and BRCA2 molecular
      message, sister chromatid exchanges and endometrial thickness were also evaluated at the same
      time points. Measurements of lumbar spine and femoral neck BMD and QUS t-score were assayed
      in our patients. Secondary outcomes were serum levels of B-ALP, IGF-I, sRANKL,
      osteoprotegerin and urinary excretion of CTX, pyridinoline and deoxypyridinoline. Furthermore
      insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), glucose levels, homocysteine and hot flushes were also
      evaluated. In addition for thyroid safety TSH, fT3, fT4, thyroid autoantibodies, and mRNA for
      thyroid and retinoid receptors were evaluated.
