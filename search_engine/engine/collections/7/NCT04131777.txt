      radio frequency (RF) ablation treatment malignant lung lesions prior to surgical resection.
      Up to 15 patients will be treated at the participating sites.

      Patients identified for the study will have been scheduled for surgical resection as part of
      their treatment for lung lesions. The RF ablation procedure will be performed during a
      standard-of-care bronchoscopic procedure at minimum of 24 hours prior to resection. The
      patients exits the study following surgical resection. The resected tissue will undergo
      pathological evaluation for tissue viability.
