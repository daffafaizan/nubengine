    
      Patient undergoing surgery for primary paraesophageal herniation, are randomized to either
      conventional suturing of the diaphragmatic crura only or with the addition of a diaphragmatic
      incision "lateral release".

      The patients are examined by computed tomography before surgery and at 1 and 3 years after
      surgery.

      SF-36 (global quality of Life instrument), GSRS (Gastrointestinal Symptoms Rating Scale),
      Reflux frequency issues and Watson's dysphagia score are completed before and at 3 and 6
      month as well as 1 and 3 years after surgery.

      Patients undergoing laparoscopic repair for paraesophageal hernia Type II-IV are eligible for
      inclusion in the study. Included patients will be randomized to either reconstruction of the
      hiatus by suturing of the crura alone or in combination with an approximately 4 cm incision
      of the anterior aspect of the left diaphragma "lateral release" before crural suturing. The
      incision will be covered with a synthetic patch after crural closure is finished. All other
      aspects of the surgical procedure are similar in the two groups including complete
      mobilization of the hernia sac before and a total fundoplication after hiatal restoration,
      respectively.
