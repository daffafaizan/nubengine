    
      This is a multi-center, open-label, switchover trial to assess the safety of taliglucerase
      alfa in 30 patients with Gaucher disease who are currently being treated with imiglucerase
      (CerezymeÂ®) ERT. Eligible patients will enter a 12-week Stability Evaluation Period to
      establish the stability of their disease. Patients with stable disease will then be switched
      from their imiglucerase treatment to receive intravenous (IV) infusions of taliglucerase alfa
      every two weeks for a total of 20 IV infusions. The dose of taliglucerase alfa will be equal
      to each patient's previous imiglucerase dose. The infusions will be administered at the
      selected investigational site (clinic/hospital), infusion center, or at home. At the end of
      the 9-month treatment period (20 visits, 38 weeks) eligible patients will be offered
      enrollment in an open-label extension study.
