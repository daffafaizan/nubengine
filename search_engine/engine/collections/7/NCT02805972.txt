      and mortality, and is a heterogeneous condition with various causes and thus a diversity of
      intervention targets. Compulsive overeating afflicts 30% of people seeking obesity treatment
      and increases risk for CVD factors. This trial involves two participant visits to test
      whether opioid blockade (Day 1 or 2, depending on randomization), compared to placebo (Day 1
      or 2, depending on randomization), will elicit common symptoms of opioid withdrawal,
      including nausea. Participants will receive each condition on separate days.
