      shown to reduce symptom burden and rates of institutionalization for individuals with
      dementia. However, there remain a variety of factors that complicate dementia care management
      in primary care settings. Patient-centered, integrated care management programs that involve
      caregiver (CG) education and psychosocial support may help facilitate access to and use of
      services and improve outcomes. The aims of this pilot were to examine 1) whether, relative to
      usual care (UC), a dementia care management program is associated with improved CG (e.g.,
      mastery, burden, affect) and patient (e.g., behavioral symptoms) outcomes, 2) if, relative to
      UC, participants enrolled in the program have greater perceived access to and use of medical,
      social, and community/VA services, and 3) whether the dementia care management program is
      feasible and acceptable to participants.
