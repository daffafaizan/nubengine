      regarding safety and efficacy of many drugs are scarce. It is known that xenobiotics across
      the placental barrier but studies regarding quantity and mechanisms of this transfer remain
      insuffisant. Among the different methodologies to evaluate drug transfer, perfusion of human
      cotyledon is one of the most relevant ones. The two sides of the cotyledon, fetal and
      maternal ones, are perfused within the hour after delivery with EARLE medium in a double
      closed circuit. The studied drug (it can be any drug given to pregnant mothers) and
      antipyrine (the control molecule) are added at the beginning of the three hours perfusion
      realized at 37Â°C, with maternal flow rate of 12ml/min and fetal one of 6ml/min. Samples are
      collected along the perfusion and the drugs dosage will be done in the pharmacology
      department of Cochin Hospital. Tissues of the cotyledon will be also collected to study the
      proteins, and ARNs expressed. The drug concentrations will be analyzed by calculating fetal
      to maternal concentrations ratios and a fetal transfer rate (fetal drug quantity on total
      drug quantity at the end of the perfusion). Then modelling on Monolix software will be done
      to estimate the transfer constants across the two compartments. Modelling will allow to
      estimate the interindividual variability and to test covariables like sex, gestation
      duration, genetics, or protein expression. Proteins will be studied by an appropriated method
      (western blot, or proteomic analysis). The genetics study will consist in candidate gene
      approach. Polymorphisms will be chosen in genes coding for transporters or enzymes or their
      regulators.
