      spread and is no longer responding to hormonal therapies. This research study involves
      testing tumors for evidence of increased HER2 signaling, and treating those who do have
      increased HER2 signaling with a targeted therapy.

      The research study procedures include: screening for eligibility and study treatment
      including evaluations and follow up visits.

      - The names of the study drug involved in this study is neratinib. It is expected that about
      14 people will take part in this research study.

      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety
      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a
      specific disease.

      "Investigational" means that the drug is being studied. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration
      (FDA) has not approved neratinib for this specific disease but it has been approved for other
      uses.
