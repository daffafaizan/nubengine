      those patients who meet inclusion/exclusion criteria informing them of the study and that
      they will be contacted by the research associate in 1-2 weeks. The research associate will
      telephone the patient to discuss the study and answer any questions they may have. Dr.
      Goodspeed will also be available to answer any questions. The research associate with obtain
      verbal consent and proceed by asking questions from the Short Musculoskeletal Function
      Assessment Injury and Arthritis Survey, and the Foot and Ankle Outcomes Questionnaire. The
      medical student will then perform a chart review to extrapolate information including sex,
      height, weight, date/time admitted to HMC, injury data, comorbidities, fracture pattern,
      antibiotic usage, surgical history, wound history, fracture healing, and length of time to
      return to work. Dr.'s Goodspeed and Reid will conduct a radiographic review independently for
      each subject, classifying all fractures according to the Orthopaedic Trauma Association
      classification guide. If a discrepancy in classification is found, then both will discuss
      together and come to a consensus.

      Functional outcomes data will be measured by the Short Musculoskeletal Function Assessment
      Injury and Arthritis Survey and the Foot and Ankle Outcomes Questionnaire. Radiographic
      Classifications will be determined according to the Orthopaedic Trauma Association's
      classification guide.
