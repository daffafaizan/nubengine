        -  Reduction in spatial hearing

        -  Significant difficulty in background noise and social situations

        -  Exhaustion from the extra effort required to hear

        -  Reduced confidence

        -  Reduced ability to enjoy music

        -  Isolation

        -  An emotional burden linked to the onset of the hearing loss and associated symptoms

      The investigators have established a specialised clinic to address the consequences of SSD,
      and assess treatment options including the provision of counselling and wired CROS
      (Contralateral Routing of Signal) hearing aids.

      The investigators use a range of questionnaires, completed pre and post treatment, to assess
      outcomes and would like to analyse this data to see what drives handicap and whether there is
      any observable improvement post treatment. The investigators would like to find out more
      about the impact of SSD on patients' ability to enjoy music and propose to do this using a
      questionnaire developed in-house.

      The investigators have been awarded a grant to fit some of their patients with wireless CROS
      aids, which are not routinely available under the NHS in Cambridge, but are widely available
      in other areas and in the commercial sector.

      The investigators will utilise retrospective data in the form of questionnaires completed by
      SSD patients attending the Audiology clinic between 2009 and 2012. Prospective data will also
      be collected and from existing SSD patients, to whom the investigators intend to post the
      music appreciation questionnaire, or ask them to complete in clinic.

      A prospective cross over design study will compare wired and wireless CROS hearing aids in 13
      new patients a cross-over design trial to investigate whether residual handicap and
      satisfaction are any better with these devices than with standard wired versions.
