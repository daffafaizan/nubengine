      risk factor for corneal graft failure. Current standard of care to prevent graft rejection
      includes use of topical steroids and immunosuppressants. These do not address corneal
      neovascularization. The cornea is kept in its avascular state by a complex interaction of
      signal proteins and host receptors, with a vital role played by the soluble VEGF-receptor 1.
      In any condition of chronic corneal inflammation or hypoxia, the balance may tip in favour of
      pro-angiogenic factors, and neovascularization will ensue. Early and limited studies have
      examined the effect of subconjunctival or intracorneal administration of monoclonal
      antibodies to VEGF (bevacizumab, ranibizumab) in combating corneal neovascularization. Most
      report subtotal or temporary regression. The development of aflibercept (also known as VEGF
      Trap-Eye) offers new hope of more effectively combating the problem. In this study, research
      will be conducted to investigate and assess safety of subconjunctival aflibercept injection
      in patients with corneal neovascularization undergoing corneal transplantation.

      This is a phase 1, prospective, randomized, open label clinical trial that will enroll 10
      corneal transplant patients with corneal neovascularization in one or more quadrants crossing
      more than 0.5 mm over the limbus at the time of corneal transplantation.
