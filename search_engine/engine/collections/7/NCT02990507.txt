      their able-bodied peers (Boslaugh et al. 2006, Preventing Chronic Disease). Much of the
      reason for the low rates of activity among this population come from the presence of
      barriers. Lack of motivation, lack of transportation, lack of accessible facilities and
      equipment, and cost are all factors that discourage exercise participation among those with
      disabilities (Rimmer et al. 2008, JRRD; Barfield and Malone 2013, JRRD). Based on these
      factors, there is a need for accessible enjoyable exercise options for people with physical
      disabilities. The AVEED is comprised of an ergometer with foot and hand pedals, and a visual
      display in front of the user that can show a variety of scenic pathways.

      The AVEED builds on previous work that demonstrates the potential benefit of interactive
      exercise for those with physical disabilities. The present study will establish the potential
      of this device to provide an engaging moderate intensity exercise opportunity for persons
      with disabilities.
