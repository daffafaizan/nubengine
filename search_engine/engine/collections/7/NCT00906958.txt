    
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is characterised by a partial or complete collapse of the upper
      airway during sleep. The treatment of choice for OSA is Continuous Positive Airway Pressure
      (CPAP). CPAP acts as a positive airway splint, delivering a fixed or auto adjusted positive
      pressure to the upper airway via a tube and mask. The modified device to be assessed in this
      study will act in a similar way to the existing device, VPAP Auto, but utilizes an improved
      algorithm which should maintain or enhance the effectiveness of the treatment.
