      significant costs to the healthcare system. Recent treatment guidelines describe a new
      subtype of pneumonia, healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP), to identify those patients who
      present to a hospital from the community and are thought to be at greater risk for developing
      pneumonia due to multidrug resistant organisms (MDRO).

      The HCAP categorization scheme is intended to improve the prescription of initial appropriate
      empiric antibacterial agents and minimize the morbidity and mortality associated with
      inappropriate empiric selection.However, one of the chief criticisms of the guideline
      recommendations is that the criteria used to define HCAP is overly broad, which may result in
      greater use of broad-spectrum antibiotics.

      The prevailing notion is that many patients in the community will be at the lowest risk for
      experiencing MDR pneumonia and can be treated with a less broad anti-infective regimen.
      Patients with increasing exposure to the healthcare system will receive initial
      anti-infective therapy that is more broad in an effort to target MDROs. The investigator
      group believes that it is not simply exposure to the healthcare system that predicts the
      incidence of MDR pneumonia (i.e., criteria for HCAP), but rather, the "intensity" of exposure
      to the healthcare system that is predictive of MDR pneumonia. The aim of this study is to
      identify risk factors for MDR HCAP pneumonia in critically ill patients. .
