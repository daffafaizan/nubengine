    
      This is a Phase I inter-patient dose-escalation study assessing weekly doses of Interleukin-7
      (CYT107) in adult patients infected by Genotype 1 Virus of Hepatitis C and resistant to
      standard treatment with Peg-Interferon and Ribavirin (biotherapy)after 12 weeks of this
      standard bi-therapy.

      The dose escalation is aimed at establishing the safety of a biologically active doses of
      CYT107 added to the combination therapy of pegylated interferon-alpha and ribavirin. At each
      dose level, study patients will receive a subcutaneous administration of CYT107 per week for
      a total of 4 administrations.

      Groups of 3 to 6 patients will be entered at each dose level of CYT107. Four dose levels are
      planned.

      Eligible patients will a cycle of four weekly injections at a defined dose level in addition
      to the bi-therapy. Standard bi-therapy will continue 4 weeks after CYT107 treatment
      discontinuation. The duration of study is approximately 11 weeks including screening period.

      Participants have 1 hospitalization overnight and 8 clinic visits. The four administrations
      are sub-cutaneous and are given as a shot under the skin in the arm or abdomen or leg.

      During the study visits the following may be done:

        -  Medical history, physical examination, blood tests every visit.

        -  Electrocardiogram (EKG)

        -  Chest x-ray study

        -  Liver/spleen imaging

        -  Blood sample collections at frequent intervals

        -  Urine tests several times during the study.
