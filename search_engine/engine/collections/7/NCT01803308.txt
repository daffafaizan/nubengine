      ascending dose study in fed or fasted subjects and Part B is a randomized, placebo-controlled
      multiple ascending dose study. The study is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability
      of ascending doses of SB 9200 given as monotherapy for up to 14 days to subjects with chronic
      Hepatitis C infection, and to determine the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic relationship
      over this dose range.
