      post-menopausal period is also increasing. In order to have a healthy menopause, which is an
      important part of women's life, it is thought that the adoption of yoga practice without
      health risks by women and its implementation as a lifestyle may be effective in reducing the
      symptoms of menopause experienced by women. In line with this information, it is aimed to
      determine the effect of yoga training on menopausal symptoms. The research will be carried
      out with menopausal women between the ages of 40-60 in Famagusta region. Women will be
      divided into two groups as intervention and control. Personal information form and menopause
      rating scale will be used in the research. The intervention group will be given yoga practice
      two days a week for 10 weeks. Menopause rating scale will be applied to the intervention and
      control group before and after the research.
