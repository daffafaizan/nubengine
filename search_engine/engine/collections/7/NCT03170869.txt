      This protocol standardizes DEB-TACE delivery with the Surefire Precision Infusion System.
      This protocol does not change patient therapy. All patient safety monitoring, treatment
      procedures and follow-up procedures will be performed in accordance with standard clinical
      practice.

      Fifty (50) subjects will be enrolled in the prospective arm. Data from one hundred (100)
      historical randomly sampled control subjects (1:2 ratio) will be selected.

      Subjects will be followed at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, then every 3 months, following the
      initial DEB-TACE procedure until the subject receives a liver transplant or death. The study
      will be concluded upon completion of enrollment and follow-up of the 50 patients. It is
      estimated that the time to complete patient enrollment and follow-up is 24 months. The
      estimated date for study completion (complete primary analyses) is June 2018. This is based
      on the average survival vs. time to transplant at this center. If there are individual
      patients that extend beyond this period the time may be slightly extended.
