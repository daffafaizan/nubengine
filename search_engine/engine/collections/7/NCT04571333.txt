      speech understanding. However, CI systems rely on external parts, namely Behind-the-Ear (BTE)
      audio processors with coils or single-unit processors to function. This can have several
      disadvantages: for instance, the hardware is exposed to external trauma and to the effects of
      head movement and gravity. The device is also put at risk by humid, dusty, or dirty
      conditions as well as by physical activities that lead to water exposure such as swimming or
      sports in general (e.g. perspiration).

      In addition, some patients are concerned with the cosmetic appearance of the external parts
      which are visible (more so than modern behind-the-ear hearing aids), something that may not
      be desirable to many potential candidates.

      This clinical investigation aims to collect data on the use of the Mi2000 system, a totally
      implantable cochlear implant system, for the first time in human subjects.
