    
      In a prospective case-control study, 140 medical students (,novices') and 10 senior
      gynecologists (,experts') will watch a demonstration detailing how to perform a hysteroscopy
      on a training model. All probands will perform a hysteroscopy themselves within 1 hour after
      the demonstration. Their performance will be judged using an Objective Structured Assessment
      of Technical Skills (OSATS) assessment. Using metrical and non-metrical measurements,
      construct validity of the hysteroscopy training model to distinguish between experts and
      novices will be assessed. Secondary endpoints are differences in OSATS scores within the
      group of novices based on gender and handyness, as well as satisfaction of the novices with
      the learning experience.
