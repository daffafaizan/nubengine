      distal to the maxillary canines in need of closure through sliding mechanics. The sample
      consists of adolescent patients regardless of Angle's molar malocclusion who are receiving
      comprehensive full fixed appliance orthodontic treatment. Preformed conjoint archwires half
      being GUMMETAL and the other half SS, will be utilized. Each patient will have one side of
      the maxilla randomly allocated into the SS or GUMMETAL treatment group. The study will follow
      a split-mouth design to reduce the confounding variables from patient to patient on space
      closure mechanics. The maxillary arch in each subject will be randomized into a SS side or GM
      side using a random number generator. Spaces will be measured at; T0 is initial records, T1
      is initiation of space closure, T2 will be 4 weeks after the initiation of space closure, T3
      is another 4 weeks of space closure evaluation and T4 will be the final evaluation of space
      closure after 4 weeks from T3, via 3D intraoral scans of maxillary arches. Space measurement
      and calculations will utilize 3Shape software to measure the distance of canine movement
      based off the distal surface. Sliding mechanics will be activated through NiTi coil springs
      from the maxillary canines to the maxillary molars. The force will be standardized to 150 gms
      and will be measured each visit. The same provider will activate the NiTi coil spring for
      retraction, along with data collection. Superimposition of scans will be utilized to assess
      outcome measures.
