      patients with HF, mostly HFrEF. However, almost half of HF patients present with HFpEF, and
      less studies have been performed in those patients. It has been recently demonstrated that
      HFpEF induces significant molecular, mitochondrial, histological, and functional alterations
      in the diaphragm and soleus, which were attenuated by exercise training . In cardiac disease
      and aging, several authors have shown a significant reduction in heart rate variability (HRV)
      in the frequency ranges associated with breathing, by using spectral analysis of heart rate
      (HR) and respiration.Therefore, the present randomized clinical trial (RCT) will be conducted
      in order to test the hypothesis that an program of yôga and specific breathing techniques
      with different ventilatory rhythms could be associated with improvement in inspiratory muscle
      responses, functional capacity, oxygen uptake efficiency slope (OUES), circulatory power,
      oscillatory ventilation, kinetics of oxygen consumption in the recovery period, distinct
      features of the autonomic nervous system, natriuretic peptides, echocardiographic
      measurements, and quality of life (QoL) in patients with HFpEF, with and without inspiratory
      muscle weakness (IMW).Therefore, the present randomized clinical trial (RCT) will be
      conducted in order to test the hypothesis that an 8-week program of yôga and specific
      breathing techniques with different ventilatory rhythms could be associated with improvement
      in inspiratory muscle responses, functional capacity, oxygen uptake efficiency slope (OUES),
      circulatory power, oscillatory ventilation, kinetics of oxygen consumption in the recovery
      period, distinct features of the autonomic nervous system, natriuretic peptides,
      echocardiographic measurements, and quality of life in patients with HFpEF, with and without
      IMW.
