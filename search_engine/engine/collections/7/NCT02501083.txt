      muscle function and left ventricular function. Medical management of patients with
      cardiomyopathy relies mainly on angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors and beta blockers.
      Respiratory management relies on home mechanical ventilation and couph assist.

      The investigators aim

        -  to analyze cardiac and respiratory function over time in patients with muscular
           dystrophies followed at the home mechanical ventilation unit.

        -  to determine the long term impact of the home mechanical ventilation on cardiac and
           respiratory events and to define the predictive factors associated.

      Patients will be included retrospectively. Tissue Doppler imaging and Tricuspid annular plane
      systolic excursion were used for the assessment of the right ventricle. Left ventricular
      ejection fraction was used for the analysis of the left ventricle. Respiratory function was
      assessed using the vital capacity, the maximal inspiratory pressure, the maximal expiratory
      pressure, the peak couph flow rate.
