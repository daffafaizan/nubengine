      carried out in accordance with the guidelines of the Human Subjects Protection Committee of
      the University of California, Los Angeles. All subjects will give written informed consent
      before the study begins. Subjects will consume 1.5 serving of almonds (~ 1.5 oz/d for
      246kcal) or isocaloric pretzels (~ 2.0 oz/d for 216kcal) daily for 12 weeks and will undergo
      skin assessment at weeks 0, 4, 8 and 12. The assessments include skin radiance, sebum, and
      hydration/moisture. In addition the study will evaluate the effect of almond consumption on
      skin inflammation and aging by assessing UV-induced changes. Each group will have 20
      subjects.
