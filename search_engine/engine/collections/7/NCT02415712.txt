    
      Clinical studies for fomepizole intravenous infusion have not been conducted in Japan, and
      there are few reports of data on drug-use, including in the literature, in Japanese patients;
      therefore, an evaluation of the safety and efficacy of fomepizole intravenous infusion is
      required.

      This specified drug-use survey for fomepizole intravenous infusion (Fomepizole Intravenous
      Infusion 1.5 g "Takeda," hereinafter referred to as "the drug") was planned to evaluate the
      safety and efficacy of the drug in patients with ethylene glycol and methanol poisoning in
      daily medical practice.
