      dilution of serum proteins and destruction of vascular endothelial glycocalyx cause
      extravasation of the fluids. We cannot avoid this phenomenon but we can try to restore the
      excess fluid into the intravascular space where it can be excreted via the kidneys.

      Hypertonic saline (HS) creates an osmotic gradient across the cellular membrane, causing a
      fluid shift from the intracellular space into the extracellular space and from the
      extravascular space into the intravascular space. The intravascular hypertonic benefit is
      short-lasting as a result of redistribution of fluid between the intravascular and
      interstitial spaces. The effect can be lengthened by adding colloid component into the
      solution.

      The aim of the study is to describe the effects of hypertonic saline/hydroxyethylstarch
      solution in comparison to saline solution for 25 + 25 patients undergoing coronary bypass
      grafting surgery (CABG) using CPB. The study fluid will be given into the venous reservoir of
      the CPB circuit after aortic declamping. Primary endpoints are the changes in body weight and
      extracellular water from baseline to the first postoperative morning. Secondary endpoints are
      the need of fluids and diuretic medication during the perioperative period.
