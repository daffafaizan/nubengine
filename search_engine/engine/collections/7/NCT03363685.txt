      metastasis under the oversight of hospital's ethics committee, and investigators found that
      the use of EGFR-TKI, KPS, Age, SCC, CA125 and smoking history had significant association
      with survival. Then investigators built a simple, easy to use scoring system based on the
      features mentioned above. The score was calculated as 1 (for patients didn't receive
      EGFR-TKI), +2 (for KPS <50%), +1 (for KPS 50-70%), +1 (Age >60years), 2 (SCC ≥1.5ng/ml), +3
      (CA125 ≥35 U/ml), +1 (smoking history 1-10/day), +2 (smoking history >10/day), and 0
      otherwise. This algorithm was used to divide the patients into low risk (0-3), intermediate
      risk (4-6), high risk groups (7-10) to predict survival and determine which patients are
      suitable for palliative therapy. Now investigators wish to register this study to do a
      further research, in order to verify the accuracy and sensitivity of this algorithm.
