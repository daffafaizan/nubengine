      sample size. In order to determine the necessary sample size, we need to obtain estimates of
      the incidence of DVT and the prevalence of PE using MRV in each treatment group. Descriptive
      statistics and 95% confidence intervals will be calculated to determine the incidence of DVT
      and the prevalence of PE using MRV in obese patients who have received treatment to prevent
      DVT and PE associated with bariatric surgery.

      Anti-factor Xa levels will be used to help determine if treatments are reaching appropriate
      levels.
