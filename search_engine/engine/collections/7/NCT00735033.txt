      definite, leading to motor, psychological and social alterations. It's the third cause of
      death in the industrialized world, of which 90% of the survivors have some residual deficit
      and 30% become disabled. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of the
      Swiss ball on patients with hemiplegia due to CVA. An intervening and controlled study was
      conducted on 12 patients of both genders and over 50 years old with chronic hemiplegia, all
      undergoing treatment at the Beneficent Rehabilitation Association of Cear√°. The patients in
      the experimental group (EG) underwent treatment with the Swiss ball added to conventional
      physical therapy and the control group (CG) went through conventional physiotherapy sessions.
      The treatment was done twice a week, consisting of 14 sessions altogether. The data were
      collected in an evaluation form at the beginning and at the end of the treatment. Most
      patients were found to be males; they had typical walking ability, tonus, and posture of
      chronic hemiplegia patients. The patients in the experimental group showed significantly
      greater muscular strength on the lower limbs than the control group (p < 0,05, Student t
      test), however, the same did not happen in the case of the other parameters, such as strength
      on the upper limbs, coordination, and balance. We can conclude that the treatment with the
      Swiss ball can promote increased strength, which will allow for a more efficient recovery in
      the studied population.
