      forward-viewing, ultrasound (US)-based device with needle guide for vascular access.

      Access to large arteries is an indispensable step of any trans-arterial catheterization
      procedure. Surface US-guided vascular cannulation greatly improves first-pass success and
      reduces complications and is recommended as the preferred technique by numerous specialties
      and governmental agencies. Surface US-guided cannulation has several key limitations,
      including dependence on operator skills and experience. Safety and success of vascular access
      could be vastly improved with a single integrated imaging/interventional device with a small
      footprint that enables a single-hand operation of the US probe and visualizes the operating
      needle in real-time.

      Reliable and accurate real-time image guidance for vascular access has the potential to
      appreciably impact public health by enhancing patient safety and convenience, improving
      procedural accuracy and increasing procedure throughput. Successful implementation has the
      potential to reduce care and complication costs across millions of vascular access
      procedures.

      Vu-Path™ is a small footprint, US-based device with needle guide. It is a dual-lumen
      instrument with parallel US imaging and interventional lumens. The forward-viewing US
      transducer is located at the catheter tip and focused such that the tip of the needle in the
      interventional lumen, and all proximate structures, are always clearly visualized in real
      time throughout the procedure.

      This is a first-in-human pilot study of the Vu-Path™ device, aiming to its establish clinical
      feasibility and safety for exemplary use.
