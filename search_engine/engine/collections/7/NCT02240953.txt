      non-obstructive thrombosis have been described. Patients are included in each group randomly.
      In the first arm only warfarin is given to the patients with a target INR level of 2.5-4. In
      the second arm 100 mg acetylsalicylic acid and a proton pump inhibitor are added to treatment
      in combination with warfarin. In the third arm 300 mg acetylsalicylic acid and a proton pump
      inhibitor are added to treatment in ombination with warfarin. Also there is an observational
      follow-up group of patients who do not have prosthetic heart valve thrombosis. These patients
      also are followed under only warfarin therapy with INR level of 2.5-4 . All patients are
      followed by serial transesophageal echocardiography performed every 6 months. Follow-up
      period is at least 6 months (range 6-60 months). Informed consent is taken from all patients.
