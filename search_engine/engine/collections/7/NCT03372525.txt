      critically ill neonates. It can result in severe hypoxemia refractory to mechanical
      ventilation. Usually, invasive ventilation with low parameters is enough for neonates with
      mild and moderate ARDS. And extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is used to neonates with
      severe ARDS. However, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation can also lead to high death rate
      and need more technique and conditions. Mechanical ventilation with higher parameters was a
      substitute for such situations, but the death rate, complications and injuries of higher
      parameters is unknown. The purpose of the present study was to compare HFOV with CMV as
      invasive respiratory support strategies on decrease the mortality and morbidities in neonate
      with ARDS.
