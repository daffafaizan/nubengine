      patients will maintain an adequate performance status and be able to tolerate a second-line
      therapy. A recent phase III trial randomized patients to either 5-flurouracil (5FU), folinic
      acid or to the addition of weekly oxaliplatin to the same regimen of 5FU/folinic acid. The
      interim results showed a statistically significant survival advantage for the oxaliplatin
      containing arm (26 versus 13 weeks, P= 0.014). However the outcome of patients who have
      progressed on a first-line gemcitabine regimen is still poor with median survival of about
      2-6 months.

      Almost all patients with advanced APC, treated with gemcitabine alone or a gemcitabine based
      combination therapy will exhibit resistance to therapy. In patients treated with gemcitabine
      alone, the time to progression (TTP) is about 3-4 months. Thus most patients will exhibit
      progression and /or toxicity and will require second line therapy at 4-6 months into first
      line therapy. The best one year survival reported in a phase II trial is only 24%. However
      there is no standard second line therapy for APC, a rapid progression of tumor is seen in
      this setting, and new strategies based on rational target identification are needed. In this
      study we propose to select therapy based on the molecular profiling of each patients tumor.
