    
      This is an open-label (identity of assigned study drug will be known) study to evaluate the
      safety, tolerability, and dose of daratumumab when administered in combination with various
      treatment regimens for different settings of multiple myeloma. The various treatment regimens
      to be combined with daratumumab in this study include Velcade-dexamethasone (VD),
      Velcade-melphalan-prednisone (VMP), Velcade-thalidomide-dexamethasone (VTD),
      pomalidomide-dexamethasone (Pom-dex), carfilzomib-dexamethasone (CFZ-dex) and
      carfilzomib-lenalidomide-dexamethasone (KRd). Approximately 250 patients (approximately 12
      subjects per VTD and VMP backbone treatment regimen, 6 for the VD regimen, up to 100 subjects
      in the Pom-dex regimen, 80 for the CFZ-dex regimen [10 subjects will receive a single-dose of
      daratumumab and the remaining subjects will receive a split-dose of daratumumab], and up to
      40 for the KRd regimen) will be enrolled in this study.The study will consist of screening,
      treatment, and follow-up phases. Treatment will extend to either the planned treatment
      duration for a maximum of 1 year (in Velcade-dexamethasone, Velcade-melphalan-prednisone,
      Velcade-thalidomide-dexamethasone regimens and KRd regimens), or until disease progression
      (in the Pom-dex and CFZ-dex regimen). Follow-up will continue until the study ends
      (approximately 15 months after the last patient receives the first dose of daratumumab).
      Serial pharmacokinetic (study of what a drug does to the body) blood samples will be
      collected. Clinical efficacy outcomes and safety will be monitored throughout the study.
