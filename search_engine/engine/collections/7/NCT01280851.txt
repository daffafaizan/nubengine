      the donor & optimize the results for the recipient.

      The current preoperative assessment includes Ultrasound, CT & Renal Scintigraphy. The latter
      two tests subjects the patient to the risk of a high radiation dose. Moreover, the use of
      iodinated contrast media during CT angiography may increase the risk of renal & systemic
      toxicity.

      MRI can be a "one-stop shop" modality for preoperative assessment of living kidney donors.
      MRI also eliminates radiation exposure and the injection of potentially nephrotoxic iodinated
      contrast material.

      The purpose of this study is to test the feasibility and evaluate the accuracy of a single
      MR-based examination, allowing for the comprehensive assessment of renal anatomy, function
      and vascular status in potential live kidney donors.
