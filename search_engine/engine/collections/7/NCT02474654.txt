      blinded study, each participant will have all three interventions (Femoral Nerve Block (FB),
      Periarticular Injection (PI) and Intrathecal Opioid (IO)) performed during their visit.
      Normal saline (NS) will be substituted for opioid or local anesthetic in cases where a
      control is required.

      Specific 5 arms include:

        -  Using all three anesthetics:

           o PI + FB + IO (arm 1)

        -  Using a combination of two anesthetics + normal saline substitute for control:

             -  NS + FB + IO (arm 2)

             -  PI + NS + IO (arm 3)

             -  PI + FB + NS (arm 4)

        -  Control:

             -  NS + NS + IO (arm 5)

      The control arm would include IO as the sole intervention as this is simply added to the
      spinal anesthetic used for the surgery itself. It is felt that having a study arm without any
      long-acting analgesic medication (opioid or local anesthetic) as the "control" arm following
      a spinal anesthetic would not meet current standard of care and cause harm to the participant

      The investigators hypothesize that the combination of three forms of long acting analgesia
      (PI, FB, IO) will result in the greatest outcomes compared to a combination of any two or
      control. Our aim is to demonstrate that this optimal analgesic combination will have an
      additive pain control effect and will minimize side effects thus translating to less acute
      pain, improve patient mobility, and attaining "readiness to discharge" quicker.
