      enhanced bioavailability of carotenoids and flavonoids compared to a commercially available
      processed red tomato product in humans. This primary objective will be accomplished by
      quantifying carotenoids from post-prandial triglyceride-rich lipoprotein (TRL) fractions of
      plasma and flavonoids from whole plasma and urine, after subjects consume a meal containing
      Tangerine or red tomato juice. A secondary goal is to examine if short-term delivery of
      bioactives from Tangerine and red tomatoes impact markers of inflammation in humans. This
      secondary objective will be accomplished by analyzing plasma for both interleukin-6 (IL-6), a
      marker for inflammation, and RNA to assess alterations in transcription of genes that
      regulate inflammation.
