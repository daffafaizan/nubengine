      accelerated and blast phase MPN do not respond well to treatment This is a phase II
      open-label study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of combined ruxolitinib and enasidenib
      in patients with accelerated/blast-phase myeloproliferative neoplasm or chronic phase
      myelofibrosis with high risk features and IDH2 mutation.

      Ruxolitinib (Jakafi/Jakavi) is FDA approved for myelofibrosis and was shown to reduce
      splenomegaly and improve symptoms. Enasidenib is a potent inhibitor of the IDH2 mutant enzyme
      and is FDA approved for relapsed refractory AML where it showed effectivity.

      Pre-clinical studies indicate increased disease mitigating effects with the combination of
      enasidenib and ruxolitinib.

      This study will enroll up to 32 patients. Ruxolitinib and enasidenib will be given orally in
      28-day cycles.
