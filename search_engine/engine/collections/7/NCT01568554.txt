      heme, an essential component of hemoglobin and other proteins, leading to either acute
      (neurologic) and/or chronic (cutaneous) symptoms. Acute porphyria is often difficult to
      diagnose because symptoms may not be specific and, unless the patient is in an active attack,
      laboratory values typically may not be useful for diagnosing porphyria. The purpose of this
      study is to test whether a focused questionnaire and laboratory evaluation tool can better
      define risk factors associated with possible genetic porphyria. The goals of this study are:

        -  To determine the presence and number of abnormal lab tests and porphyria-like symptoms
           in adult family members of the first person in a family who has been diagnosed with a
           disease of acute porphyria, 50% of whom are expected to carry the same genetic defect of
           the index case.

        -  To devise a Genetic Carrie Profile that could be used to screen people in whom the
           diagnosis of porphyria is being considered.

        -  To test the Profile in patients with symptoms suggestive of HCP and/or urine tests
           showing some elevation of porphyrins.

        -  To explain other possible causes of minor increases in porphyrin levels in patients with
           recurrent abdominal pain who have not been diagnosed with porphyria
