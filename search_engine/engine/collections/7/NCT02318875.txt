      scares. Two epidemiological French studies recorded patients consulting their GP for
      widespread pain, whatever the cause. The most often cited pain localization was the
      musculoskeletal system (36-59% of the cases). In Europe the situation is similar, with
      arthritis and osteoarthritis representing the 42% of pains. According to the WHO (World
      Health Organization) the musculoskeletal system's disorders are the first cause of handicap
      in the worldwide population.

      Krill oil is low in both saturated fatty acids and monounsaturated fatty acid and high in
      polyunsaturated fatty acid including a high proportion of (n-3) fatty acids and particularly
      EPA and DHA. There are strong evidences that krill oil may improve the comfort of sensitive
      joints thank to its n-3 fatty acids and phospholipids content. Particularly, after a
      supplementation with a dietary product containing pure krill oil, a reduction of systemic
      inflammation, trough reduction of CRP, was concomitantly accompanied by improvement of
      various clinical scores associated with joint flexibility, comfort and function. Despite
      this, there are no studies yet on healthy volunteers complaining the symptoms of
      rheumatologic pathologies, without being ill.

      Here we performed a clinical trial on 154 subjects complaining functional discomfort
      associated to joints and muscles disorders. The principal objective was to test Kritech
      efficacy in reducing these symptoms.

      Subjects were split in two groups, with one receiving Kritech and the second one the placebo
      for 12 weeks.
