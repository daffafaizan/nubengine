    
      This is a Phase III multi-center, randomized, two-arm parallel-group, double-blind, placebo
      controlled study of MBG453 or placebo added to azacitidine in adult subjects with
      intermediate, high or very high risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) as per IPSS-R, or Chronic
      Myelomonocytic Leukemia-2 (CMML-2).

      The primary objective of this study is to compare overall survival (OS) in the MBG453 plus
      azacitidine arm versus placebo plus azacitidine arm where OS is the time from randomization
      until death due to any cause.

      Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to treatment arms as follow: MBG453 800 mg IV Q4W
      plus azacytidine, Placebo IV Q4W plus azacitidine The randomization will be stratified into 4
      groups: intermediate risk MDS, high risk MDS, very high risk MDS and CMML-2.

      All subjects who discontinue both study treatments will enter a long-term post-treatment
      follow-up including response and PRO assessments, and/or survival follow-up for up to 5 years
      after the last subject was randomized.

      Subjects will be treated until they experience progression of disease (including
      transformation to acute leukemia per WHO 2016 classification), experience unacceptable
      toxicity or discontinue the study treatment for other reasons.

      Continuation of study treatment beyond progression (excluding transformation to acute
      leukemia: continuation in this case is not possible) may be possible in selected subjects.
