      sham-controlled pilot study Sample Size: Up to 60 subjects Number of Sites: Up to 10 sites
      Anticipated Study Duration: 8 months

      Number of Study Visits: Three:

        1. Screening Visit

        2. Treatment Visit 1 - treatment with AlphaCore (active or sham) after exercise challenge

        3. Treatment Visit 2 - Prophylactic treatment with AlphaCore (active or sham) prior to
           exercise challenge

      There will be a telephone follow-up call within 12-24 hours after the treatment visits occur
      as well as a 7-day (+/- 3 days) final phone call after Treatment Visit 2.

      # of Study Arm(s): Two Arms

        1. Active Treatment with the AlphaCore Device

        2. Sham Treatment with an inactive sham device Blinding Double blind. The subject will be
           blinded to treatment assignment. Due to the treating Investigator's or designee
           designee's ability to detect differences in muscle effects between the active and sham
           device, the treating Investigator or designee cannot be blinded. Data assessors will be
           blinded.
