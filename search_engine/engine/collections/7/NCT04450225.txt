      properties of the Italian version of the RNLI: complex patients, caregivers and stakeholders.

      Phase_1: to test the Content validity. The content validity will be tested on 10 complex
      patients and 10 stakeholders, who will assess the clarity and relevance of the RNLI items,
      respectively. In this phase, complex patients are hospitalized in the PMR unit.

      From this first phase, the investigators will obtain the preliminary Italian version of the
      RNLI to test its psychometric properties.

      Phase_2: to test the Reliability, Construct validity and Responsiveness. During the
      hospitalization in the PMR unit, 138 patients and their caregivers will be recruited. During
      this phase, the investigators will detect the important occupational activities of complex
      patients enrolled through a semi-structured interview conducted in person.

      After discharge, the investigators will contact the patients and their caregivers by
      telephone at different times (T0, T1 and T2) to test the following psychometric properties
      through the administration of the Italian version of the RNLI and the Canadian Occupational
      Performance Measure (COPM). Caregiver will have to answer to the RNLI as a proxy for the
      patient.

      The contact times and the psychometric properties that will be tested are:

      T0_ 2 weeks after discharge

        -  internal consistency

        -  inter-observer reliability

        -  convergent construct validity

      T1_ 10-14 days after T0

      - test-retest reliability

      T2_ 6-8 weeks after T0

        -  discriminant construct validity

        -  responsiveness
