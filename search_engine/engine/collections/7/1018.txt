metabolism and excretion of bilirubin c in experimental obstructivejaundice.bile duct ligation was carried out in a series ofrhesus monkeys.  the time required for the serum bilirubinto stop rising and achieve a relatively stable level,and the average serum bilirubin reached, paralleled closelythat seen clinically.  after the serum bilirubin levelshad stopped rising and a 'steady state' had been reached,radioactive bilirubin was injected i.v.  the radioisotope wasdistributed principally extravascularly and not in the sameratio as albumin, as in other forms of jaundice.  daily turnoverof bilirubin was found to be double that anticipatedfrom normal hb breakdown, suggesting increased bilirubinproduction in obstructive jaundice.  in animals followed for2 wk nearly 80% of injected radioactivity was excreted in theurine, indicating that in obstructive jaundice the kidneytakes over entirely from the liver the function of bilirubinexcretion.
