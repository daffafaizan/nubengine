      identify lesions. PEG can provide a rapid orthograde peroral approach to colonic lavage
      without producing significant fluid or electrolyte changes. Thus PEG is now commonly used for
      bowel preparation. However, large amounts and unsatisfactory taste of PEG solution are
      generally poorly tolerated, especially in hospitalized patients who had comorbidity and
      restricted ambulation. Recently, a new PEG-based bowel cleansing agents became available. It
      combines PEG with a high dose of ascorbic acid or bisacodyl. Although many studies reported
      the efficacy of these combined solution for colonoscopy, but efficacy in hospitalized
      patients was under-recognized.
