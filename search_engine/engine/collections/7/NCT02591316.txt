      intake, body composition and cognition in breast cancer cancer survivors and age-matched
      women without a previous cancer diagnosis. Additionally, we will measure blood inflammatory
      markers to explore the relationship between lifestyle factors and inflammation.

      The study involves two, 1hr appointments at Texas State University. The first visit will
      include cognitive testing and body composition assessment. Participants will be given an
      activity monitor to wear for one week and a packet of questionnaires to complete at home. At
      the second visit, a fasted blood sample will be collected, and participants will complete a
      food frequency questionnaire.
