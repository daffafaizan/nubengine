      endarterectomy as the standard treatment for severe symptomatic carotid artery stenosis.
      Compared to endarterectomy, stenting with or without cerebral protection has the advantage of
      avoiding general anesthesia and incision in the neck that could lead to nerve injury and
      wound complications. The costs may be less than those of surgery, mainly because of a shorter
      hospital stay. However, stenting also carries a risk of stroke and local complications.
      Unlike endarterectomy, which has known long-term benefits, stenting does not remove the
      atheromatous plaque, and the long-term efficacy of this technique needs also to be assessed.
      Several trials are in progress in Europe and the United States.

      We established this trial to evaluate whether stenting is not inferior to endarterectomy
      concerning (a) the risk of stroke or death within 30 days of procedure and (b) the long-term
      risk of ipsilateral stroke, in patients with recently symptomatic, severe carotid stenosis.
