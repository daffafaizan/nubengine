      for catheter based renal sympathetic denervation. Patients with larger (>5.5 mm) renal
      arteries are randomized to a treatment with a radiofrequency based catheter of the main renal
      artery, the main renal artery, its side-branches and accessories or an ultrasound-based
      denervation of the main renal artery only. The primary endpoint is the change in daytime
      blood pressure acquired in ambulatory blood pressure measurement at 3 months.
