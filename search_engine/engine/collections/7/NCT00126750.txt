      Myocardial Infarction (MI) survivors. To date, most guideline interventions focus on a single
      patient condition, but ambulatory post-MI patients are frequently more complex, multiple
      comorbidities, and conflicting guidelines applicable to them. For example, whereas JNC-6
      guidelines for the treatment of hypertension suggest pharmacological treatment at blood
      pressures above 140/80 mm Hg, to be initiated with diuretics or beta-blockers as first line
      agents, other guidance suggests that for post-MI patients with diabetes, treatment cut-offs
      should be lower and ACE-inhibitors may be considered as optimal first-line agents. On October
      1, 2002, the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) began a study funded by the National
      Heart, Lung, and Blood institute (NHLBI) as an RO1 (Kiefe, PI (25%), Weissman, co-PI (20%))
      to conduct a randomized trial, MI-plus to increase provider adherence to guidelines for
      post-MI patients. That NHLBI-funded study targets Medicare beneficiaries and their primary
      care providers in Alabama. Its primary goal is to develop and test with a randomized
      controlled trial, an Internet-based multimodal guideline implementation strategy. The
      investigators propose, herewith, to extend and adapt this study to a nationwide sample of VA
      post-MI patients and their primary care providers in the VA.
