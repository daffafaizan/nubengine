      no cure. A substantial body of evidence implicates the neuroimmune system in ALS
      pathophysiology. Of relevance to this study, microglia activation in the brain has been found
      to correlate positively with faster rate of disease progression. In addition, studies of
      blood cells in people with ALS have shown an increased activation of two of the major
      inflammatory cell types in the body, monocytes and T cells. Among T cells, regulatory T cells
      (Tregs) have been recently proposed to play a role in ALS progression.

      RNS60 is an electrokinetically altered aqueous fluid. Chemically, RNS60 is composed of saline
      and oxygen. The electrokinetic processing of RNS60 in Revalesio's patented Revalesio Pump
      (RP) produces charge-stabilized nanostructures (CSNs) that exhibit electrical fields. RNS60
      is available for intravenous administration and inhalation. RNS60 has been extensively tested
      in preclinical toxicological studies and has shown very little to no side effects. In
      addition, RNS60 was well tolerated in three phase I human safety studies, one after
      intravenous administration and two after inhalation.

      Preclinical in vitro and in vivo studies in multiple disease models have demonstrated that
      RNS60 has broad anti-inflammatory effects. These effects include reduction of microglia
      activation, increase of the Tregs subpopulation of lymphocytes, and neuroprotection in
      several disease models.
