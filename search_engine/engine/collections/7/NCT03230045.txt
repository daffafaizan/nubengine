      incidence could be as high as 30~50% in those undergoing abdominal surgery. Stimulation at
      acupoints have been to alleviate inflammatory response,improve pain management and decrease
      consumption of opioids, indicating a beneficial effect on pulmonary complications. In this
      study the investigators tend to verify the effect of dual acupoints stimulation on pulmonary
      complications after abdominal surgery in aged patients.
