      relieving dry mouth due to the ongoing use of an opioid for cancer related pain at 2 weeks by
      comparing proportion of patients with at least one response during the 2 week period, time of
      first response, and duration of first response. II. Evaluate the adverse effects of
      pilocarpine in these patients. III. Evaluate whether constipation, sedation, poor appetite,
      and nausea are ameliorated by pilocarpine in these patients. IV. Evaluate the effect of
      pilocarpine on quality of life of this patient group. V. Determine the timing and duration of
      the effect of pilocarpine in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, multicenter study. Patients receive either oral
      pilocarpine four times daily (arm I) or oral placebo four times daily (arm II) for 4 weeks.
      At the end of the 4 weeks, all patients are given the option to receive oral pilocarpine.
      Quality of life is assessed 2 days prior to randomization, after 2 weeks of treatment, and
      after 4 weeks of treatment.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: There will be 60 patients accrued into this study within 18 months.
