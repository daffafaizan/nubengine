      not have a specific treatment. Research on the neutrophilia mechanisms, new neutrophil (NEU)
      types and bronchial microbiome, can provide an opportunity to better understand the NA
      pathogenesis.

      OBJECTIVES: 1. To describe the clinical characteristics of NA and its sub-phenotypes
      (SUBSTUDY 1); 2. To determine the NEU types associated with the NA and its sub-phenotypes
      (SUBSTUDY 2); and 3. To identify the bronchial microbiological flora of the NA, specifically
      related to lung microbiome and the immune response against Chlamydia Pneumoniae (SUBSTUDY 3).

      METHODS: Multicenter prospective study including 100 patients with severe asthma (GINA/GEMA
      criteria): 50 with non-neutrophilic asthma (<65% NEU in induced sputum [IS]); and 50 with NA
      (> 64% NEU in IS). SUBSTUDY 1: clinical variables (years of evolution, exacerbations, ACT,
      miniAQLQ), comorbidities (GERD, nasal polyposis, obesity, ASS), pulmonary function (FEV1,
      FENO, TLC, Aspergillus), prick-test and CT scan chest; SUBSTUDY 2 (in IS and plasma):
      apoptotic index by means NE culture and flux cytometer (Annexin-V-FITC), NEU phenotype by
      surface markers (CD16, CD66b, CD62L, HLA-DR, CD177, CD11b, CD63, CXCR2, CXCR4) with density
      gradient study and determination of cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, IL-17, IL-1, IL-22) by ELISA;
      SUBSTUDY 3 (in IS): bronchial microbiome for 16S rRNA by PICRUSt, and anti-Chlamydia
      Pneumoniae IgA by ELISA.
