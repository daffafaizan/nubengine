    
      The AnemEE study is a population-based cross-sectional survey of children (6-59 months),
      adult women of reproductive age (15-49 years) and adult males (15-49 years) in six regions of
      Ethiopia (Afar, Amhara, Tigray, Oromia, Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples' Region
      and Addis Ababa). The study will enroll approximately 5,100 participants and will be
      conducted in two survey rounds; one survey round in the Belg season and one survey round in
      the Meher season. All participants will have hemoglobin assessed and will have standardized
      questionnaires administered to assess sociodemographic, diet, morbidity, and other
      health/nutrition factors. All participants will also have assessments of anthropometric
      measures, malaria, and soil transmitted helminth infection. A subset of participants will
      also have serum ferritin, CRP, AGP, vitamin B12, and folate concentrations assessed. The
      study data will be used to determine the relative contributions of risk factors for anemia.
