      mobile device, tablet and/or personal computer PC) asthma action plan application to best
      practice/usual care within an asthma program. A third external comparator arm will compare
      participants to all patients with asthma in Ontario using data obtained from the Ontario
      Asthma Surveillance Information System (OASIS) cohort, created from administrative data sets
      within the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences (ICES). Subjects will be randomly
      assigned in blocks of four, stratified by site to, in a ratio of 1:1 intervention or control
      arms. The study will enrol approximately 400 patients in total at all study sites.
