      patients they care for, as well as reducing illness and absenteeism in the healthcare workers
      themselves, and healthcare worker vaccination programs have been shown to be cost-effective
      for hospitals because of the reduced absenteeism. Although influenza vaccination programs
      based on nurse-administered intramuscular vaccination are effective, easy access to
      vaccination for hospital staff remains a challenge, in part because of large numbers of staff
      working evening, night and weekend shifts. In addition, in the Canadian setting, increasing
      the efficiency of all hospital programs is a priority. If regular recipients of seasonal
      vaccine became accustomed to the practice, self-administration may significantly improve the
      efficiency of pandemic mass vaccination campaigns.
