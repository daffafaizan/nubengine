    
      Tomographic radionuclide angiography is a simple, rapid and reproducible method of cardiac
      function measurement, including left (LVEF) and right (RVEF) ventricular ejection fractions.

      In addition to cardiological indications, this examination is often performed as part of
      cardiac toxicity screening during the various oncological treatments. This indication is all
      the more true since the arrival of CZT gamma cameras dedicated to cardiological studies has
      made it possible to reduce injected activities, as well as examination times.

      The multipurpose CZT camera allows tomoscintigraphic acquisitions to be carried out using CZT
      technology as well. Unlike the CZT gamma cameras dedicated to cardiological studies, this
      system can be used for the exploration of different organs, and also allows the realization
      of CT slices for attenuation correction.

      Patients included in this study will be double scanned both on a dedicated cardiac CZT camera
      and on multipurpose CZT camera, with CT. LVEF and RVEF will be then compared.
