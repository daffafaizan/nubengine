      microvascular disease will be recruited from among the patients of the Duke Eye Center and/or
      its associated satellite clinics. Following informed consent, subjects undergo imaging, per
      established standard operating procedure, at the Duke University Medical Center/Duke Center
      or at one of the Duke Eye Center satellite clinics. Pharmacologic dilation of eyes will not
      be necessary for completion of imaging and will not be used for the purposes of this study.
      The resulting images will not be used in the clinical care of any of the subjects recruited
      for this project.

      Subjects will be identified from patients presenting for ophthalmologic consultation at the
      Duke Eye Center and/or its satellite clinic locations.
