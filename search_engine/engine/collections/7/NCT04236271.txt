      case of simple follow-up, the median discharge is eight days postoperatively, whereas by day
      4 after surgery, hospitalization is only necessary for medical supervision of the occurrence
      of complications (scar infection, atrial fibrillation, pericardial effusion), waiting for a
      downstream bed in cardiac rehabilitation.

      Some studies have shown the feasibility of a return home from day 4 after CABG in the United
      States and England under some conditions of selection and monitoring of patients.

      However, there is currently no validated telemonitoring tool for patients in early
      postoperative coronary bypass surgery.

      This is a prospective pilot study, monocentric, open. The intervention consists of the use of
      connected devices for the monitoring of physiological parameters and functional signs.The use
      of the connected objects by the patient will take place during hospitalization, in parallel
      of a standard medical and paramedical follow-up (usual care), from day 4 after coronary
      bypass a to discharge (or until day 12 maximum, ie 8 days of follow-up).

      A combination of connected objects for the measurement of physiological parameters and for
      clinical self-evaluation by the patient, during early postoperative coronary bypass surgery
      will be evaluated.

      The results of this project will be used as a basis for a future larger study in which an
      early home discharge can be proposed to patients.
