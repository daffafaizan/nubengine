      I. To determine the objective response rate to trametinib in children with recurrent or
      refractory juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To further define and describe the toxicities of single agent trametinib in children with
      recurrent or refractory JMML.

      II. To further characterize the pharmacokinetics of trametinib in children with recurrent or
      refractory JMML.

      III. To prospectively evaluate mutant allele burden as a marker of disease activity in JMML.

      IV. To measure the rate of complete responses in children with recurrent or refractory JMML.

      V. To measure the duration of response among responders.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To describe the distribution of JMML diagnostic criteria in children with recurrent or
      refractory JMML.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive trametinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every
      28 days for up to 12 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up annually for up to 5 years.
