      have increased risk of treatment related cardiovascular morbidity. The risk of cardiac
      morbidity and mortality is increased when a patient receives radiation following adjuvant
      chemotherapy and Herceptin. The dose-volume histogram (DVH) parameters associated with
      increased cardiac toxicity include volume of heart irradiated, total radiation dose received
      by the left ventricle (LV), V25 and mean cardiac dose. Even though modern RT treatments like
      3DCRT and IMRT can reduce the mean dose to the heart, the maximum dose to the left side of
      the heart/LV may not be reduced if the target is close to the heart. The hypothesis is that
      DIBH RT can safely and effectively reduce the heart dose, especially the dose to the LV, that
      could lead to reduction in the incidence of radiation induced cardiovascular morbidity and
      mortality.

      Radiotherapy has detrimental effects on cardiac function due to remodeling of the cardiac
      tissue that receive radiation. We believe that the radiation related acute effects on heart
      tissue can be detected with cardiac functional MRI. The study will quantify the acute RT
      related effects. To our knowledge, cardiac MRI has not been explored as a non invasive
      technique to quantify RT +/- chemotherapy related effects.
