    
      Despite the progress in treating PTSD in the general population and the elevated prevalence
      of PTSD in people with severe mental illness (SMI), there are no empirically validated
      treatments designed for patients with comorbid PTSD. The cognitive behavioral treatment
      provided in this study may improve knowledge of PTSD, decrease distorted beliefs, reduce PTSD
      symptoms, and improve quality of life.

      Participants are randomly assigned to receive either a cognitive behavioral treatment plus
      standard care for SMI or standard care alone. The cognitive behavioral treatment incorporates
      several common features, including psychoeducation, relaxation training, and cognitive
      restructuring. Standard care for SMI includes medication, case management, and psychosocial
      treatment. PTSD, psychiatric symptoms, health, quality of life, and substance abuse outcomes
      are measured. Participants' knowledge of PTSD and beliefs about the world are also measured.
      Participants are assessed at baseline, post-treatment (16 weeks), and at 3- and 6-month
      follow-ups.
