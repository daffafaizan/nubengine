      that was previously recruited from a population-based RA survey. All participants were
      enrolled prospectively in Taiwan's national health insurance between Jan 1, 1999, and June
      30, 2009, and had follow-up data until Dec 31, 2009. RA was diagnosed based on the 1987
      American College of Rheumatology diagnostic criteria. The investigators matched RA and non-RA
      subjects by propensity score in a 1:1 ratio. The primary outcome was the risk of developing
      HCC. Cox proportional hazards regression was applied to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) and
      95% confidence interval (CI) of HCC for RA and non-RA cohort.
