      carcinoma to explore the safety and efficacy of sequential local radiotherapy combined with
      endodontic therapy.Plan to enroll 60 cases.For those who meet the inclusion criteria, medical
      history collection, physical examination, hematological examination and general imaging
      examination shall be completed before inclusion.Radiotherapy was performed with a cyberknife
      or accelerator stereotactic radiotherapy, which lasted 3-10 days.After the end of
      radiotherapy,S1 60mg, BID, day 1-28, as taken orally, and repeated every 6 weeks, with
      concurrent Endostar therapy: 210mg was used by intravenous infusion for 7 consecutive days
      during each cycle of chemotherapy, and 30mg was used every 24 hours.Treatment-related
      toxicity, treatment response and survival were followed up during treatment.Drug treatment
      until the tumor progresses, or there is an intolerable treatment-related toxicity, or no
      tolerance to further treatment.The treatment lasts for up to 3 years with good toxicity
      tolerance.During the treatment, the dose of teggio and endu is not adjusted. If serious
      adverse reactions occur, the drug should be treated actively and delayed.If the investigator
      determines that the treatment-related toxicity cannot be tolerated, the treatment is
      discontinued.
