    
      Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is the most common fatal genetic disorder diagnosed in
      childhood, affecting approximately 1 in 3,500 lives male births. DMD patients suffer from a
      relentless decline in muscle strength that impairs the ability of walking and breathing,
      resulting in their lives with wheelchairs and then loss of upper body function. The main
      objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy after 24-week repeated oral doses of
      TAS-205 in patients with DMD in an exploratory manner. The objective of this study is also to
      evaluate the safety, the dose-response and the urinary excretion of pharmacodynamic (PD)
      marker after 24-week repeated oral doses of TAS-205 in DMD patients.
