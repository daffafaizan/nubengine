      antagonist, will acutely improve oxygen (O2) supply to the heart during small muscle mass
      exercise in adults with and without peripheral artery disease (PAD). β1 selective antagonists
      (or "β1 blockers") are used to lower heart rate and improve O2 supply-to-demand balance in
      patients with coronary artery disease. It was recently reported that coronary exercise
      hyperemia (in response to fatiguing handgrip or plantar flexion exercise) is attenuated in
      patients with PAD. Preliminary data further show that in healthy young subjects, Esmolol
      infusion lessens the rise in the rate pressure product (an index of myocardial O2 demand)
      during handgrip exercise without negatively affecting coronary artery blood velocity. The
      current project will evaluate how Esmolol infusion affects coronary blood velocity (an index
      of coronary blood flow) and myocardial demand at rest, during handgrip exercise, and during
      post-exercise cuff occlusion in 1) young healthy adults, 2) older healthy adults and 3) older
      adults with PAD. Understanding how beta-1 selective blockade influences coronary and systemic
      vascular function may aid in the development of therapies to reduce myocardial ischemia in
      this population, which is a population at heightened coronary event risk both at rest and
      during blood pressure-raising tasks.
