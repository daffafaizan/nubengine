      system (CareTRx) for the self-management of asthma, including daily and rescue medication
      use, among children with asthma. The study objectives will be achieved using a pre-post
      design for the participants. The investigators aim to enroll at least 26 participants for a
      3-month intervention period. With this pilot study, the investigators hope to examine the
      impact of self-management behaviors on health outcomes including asthma symptoms and quality
      of life measures.
