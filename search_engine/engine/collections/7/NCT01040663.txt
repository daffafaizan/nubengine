      (the DASH diet) and the low glycemic index diet (low GI diet), may be useful in the treatment
      of individuals with the metabolic syndrome, even if body weight stays the same. Novel
      findings from our own pilot study suggest that these dietary patterns may improve insulin
      resistance and some other features of the metabolic syndrome, even after just two weeks and
      in the absence of weight loss. In this important follow-up study, the metabolic effects of
      the DASH diet and the low GI diet will be compared to those of an Western-style control diet.
      At least 39 overweight, insulin-resistant volunteers with the metabolic syndrome will be
      studied during a 32-day inpatient admission. All food will be provided, and body weight will
      be kept stable throughout the study. Subjects will first undergo testing after consuming a
      Western-style diet for two weeks. They will then be randomized to one of three study diets:
      the DASH diet, the low GI diet, or the Western-style diet. Testing will again be conducted
      after 2 weeks of weight stability on the study diet. Testing will include the assessment of
      insulin sensitivity and other metabolic parameters, such as blood sugar and cholesterol
      levels, blood pressure, and inflammation. This study will provide important information about
      the effects of these promising dietary patterns on features of the metabolic syndrome, in the
      absence of weight loss.
