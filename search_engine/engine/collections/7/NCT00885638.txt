      hormone is the incretin hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). GLP-1 is rapidly degraded
      and inactivated after its release by the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4). Inhibition of
      DPP-4 therefore increases the concentration of active GLP-1 after meal ingestion, which
      augments insulin secretion. How this process is regulated after ingested of different
      individual macronutrients is not known. Therefore, this study examines the influence of
      ingestion of fat, protein, glucose or mixed meal on the concentrations of incretin hormones
      and insulin secretion with or without concomitant administration of a DPP-4 inhibitor
      (sitagliptin).
