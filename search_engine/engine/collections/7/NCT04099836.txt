      stage 4 NSCLC patients with EGFR mutations and who have progressed on osimertinib.

      Although both atezolizumab and bevacizumab are approved for the treatment of NSCLC, the
      combination of atezolizumab and bevacizumab has not been approved by the FDA for the
      treatment of specific non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

      Patients who have one of the following EGRF mutations: exon 19 or exon 21 L858R with
      progressive disease on osimertinib may be eligible to participate in this study. If enrolled
      into the study, the study team will give the patient atezolizumab (1200 mg) combined with
      bevacizumab (15 mg/kg) every 3 weeks intravenously. As part of this study, the patient will
      have blood samples, other tests, exams, and procedures done for study purposes and their
      standard of care. Patient participation in the study will last for up to 2 years after
      completion of the last dose of the study drug or until your condition worsens or intolerable
      adverse events as deemed by the study doctor.

      There are possible patient risks to this study that include but are not limited to diarrhea,
      itching, rash, and a feeling of weakness.
