      resources in rural India has impeded improvement in rates of maternal mortality and
      morbidity. Most births take place at home, and local auxiliary nurse midwives are not trained
      or certified to administer injectable uterotonics. Reduction in postpartum hemorrhage may
      decrease other adverse maternal outcomes such as the need for additional uterotonic agents,
      blood transfusion, surgical intervention or death. The main hypothesis of the study is that
      misoprostol administered orally during the third stage of labor will significantly reduce the
      incidence of acute postpartum hemorrhage. The advantages of misoprostol are: that it is
      relatively inexpensive, is an oral preparation of 600 mcg with a long shelf life, and does
      not require refrigeration. One thousand six hundred women giving birth in selected sites in
      Belgaum District, Karnataka, India will be randomly assigned to misoprostol or placebo. The
      primary outcome is the incidence of acute postpartum hemorrhage; secondary outcomes include
      incidence of delayed postpartum hemorrhage and secondary infection; transport to higher-level
      facility; use of uterotonic agents; blood transfusion; and maternal mortality for 42 days. A
      nested case-control analysis of women who experience acute severe postpartum hemorrhage,
      compared to women who do not, will identify socioeconomic, behavioral, cultural, and systems
      factors associated with postpartum hemorrhage. For purposes of this study, acute PPH is
      defined as blood loss equal to or greater than 500 ml within 2 hours of delivery and acute
      severe PPH as blood loss equal to or greater than 1000 ml within 2 hours of delivery.

      The sample size was based on a decrease of 50% PPH in the treated versus the control group;
      20% rate of non-compliance, power of 96%, and a two-tailed type I error of 0.05
