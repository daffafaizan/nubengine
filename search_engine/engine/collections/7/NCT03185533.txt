      principles can display the process of the ED patient flow. Six sigma, a complementary
      strategy, has the merit to compensate the potential weakness of Lean through a data-driven
      process. Currently, a combination of Lean and Six sigma methodologies develops to solve the
      problems of workflow.

      It became clear that concurrent multifaceted interventions were needed to reduce EDLOS.
      Therefore, the investigators assembled a multidisciplinary quality improvement team for
      improvement of the ED process, to undergo assessments of ED patient flow with the spirit of
      lean-sigma methodologies. The objectives of this study were to evaluate a Lean-sigma-based
      initiative to lessen EDLOS.
