      All participants (patients, family and clinical caregivers, control group women with no
      cancer) in this study will take part in an interview to see how they feel about the different
      side-effects of chemotherapy. The interview will involve reading short descriptions of the
      side-effects and then answering some questions that ask for an opinion. The actual interview
      will take about 30-45 minutes to complete. The interviews will either take place in private
      conference rooms in the clinic or in private rooms at the Ambulatory Treatment Center (ATC).

      Patients will also be given quality of life and symptom assessment questionnaires. The
      questionnaires are simple to read and quick to answer. The questionnaire takes about 15
      minutes to complete.

      The participant's involvement in this study is limited to the questionnaire/interview. Once
      that is done, the participant is finished with the study.

      This is an investigational study. A total of 288 people will take part in this study. All
      will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.
