      single/two-level XLIF procedure and will receive MagnetOs Putty at the diseased level(s).
      They will be followed up at discharge, Week 6, Month 3, Month 6 and Month 12 post-surgery.
      The primary endpoint will be analyzed at Month 12.

      In this study, MagnetOs Putty will be applied according to the latest Instructions For Use
      (IFU) approved in Europe. Specifically, MagnetOs Putty will be used as bone void filler in
      Degenerative Disc Disease patients with up to grade 1 spondylolisthesis requiring treatment
      with single or two-level lateral lumbar interbody fusion (XLIF). In the context of filling of
      intervertebral implant (e.g. interbody cage), the choice of implant should be appropriate to
      enable successful fusion but will be left to the investigator discretion.

      The extreme lateral interbody fusion surgical procedure will be left to the investigator
      discretion.

      Radiographs will be taken at Screening, Day 0, Month 3 and 12, while CT-scans will only be
      taken at Month 6 and Month 12.
