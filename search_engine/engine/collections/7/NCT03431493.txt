      symptoms and physical impairments that last for years after intensive care unit discharge.
      Notably, depressive symptoms are independently associated with subsequent development of new
      impairments in physical functioning. There is a lack of treatment options to address these
      impairments in ARF survivors, with past research suggesting combining treatment for mental
      and physical health might be more successful.

      Therefore, this study is designed to evaluate:

        1. The feasibility (primary outcome) of participant recruitment and retention in a pilot
           randomized controlled trial (RCT) of an intervention combining Behavioral Activation (an
           evidence-based psychological treatment for depression) and physical rehabilitation
           delivered via telephone and 2 home visits over 12-weeks versus a "usual care" control
           group.

        2. The efficacy (secondary outcome) of this Behavioral Activation-Rehabilitation
           intervention to reduce depressive symptoms and improve physical functioning.

        3. Modifiable psychosocial risk factors for depressive symptoms in ARF survivors and the
           association between the intervention and these modifiable factors.
