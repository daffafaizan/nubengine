      national standard for post operative pain control would be intravenous narcotics. In addition
      to the use of intravenous narcotics, there are two alternative methods used during the
      surgery in order to potentially decrease the pain post-operatively. These methods are
      hematoma block or a femoral nerve block. Both are proven safe and effective in children,
      however little research has been done to look at the effectiveness of these various methods
      compared to one another.
