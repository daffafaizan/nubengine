    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the expression of 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (PGDH) messenger
      ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and protein levels in tumor tissue at baseline and after treatment
      with 25-hydroxy (OH)-vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol).

      II. To compare the expression of 15-PGDH mRNA and protein levels in normal colorectal mucosa
      at baseline and following treatment with 25-OH-vitamin D3.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the expression of cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and COX-2 mRNA in tumor tissues at
      baseline and after treatment with 25-OH-vitamin D3.

      II. To compare levels of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in tumor tissue at baseline and after
      treatment with 25-OH-vitamin D3.

      III. To compare the expression of COX-1 and COX-2 mRNA in normal colorectal mucosa at
      baseline and after treatment with 25-OH-vitamin D3.

      IV. To compare levels of PGE2 in normal colorectal mucosa at baseline and after treatment
      with 25-OH-vitamin D3.

      V. To evaluate the tolerability of a single 100,000 international unit (IU) dose of
      25-OH-vitamin D3.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive cholecalciferol orally (PO) 7 days prior to scheduled surgery or endorectal
      ultrasound. Patients are only followed through surgery or endorectal ultrasound. In case of a
      vitamin-D-related toxicity, the patient will be followed for resolution of the toxicity, up
      to 6 months.
