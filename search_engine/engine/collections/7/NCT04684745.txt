    
      This is a Phase 2, multicenter, open-label extension (OLE) study of BION-1301, a
      first-in-class humanized IgG4 anti-a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL) monoclonal
      antibody.

      Patients who previously participated in Study ADU-CL-19 (NCT03945318) will receive open-label
      treatment with BION-1301 for up to approximately 2 years. Study participants will receive
      BION-1301 at the same dose, route, and dosing schedule as they received in ADU-CL-19. Dose,
      route, and/or dosing schedule may be changed during the OLE study based on a review by the
      Safety Review Team of all available PK, PD, and clinical activity data from previous and
      ongoing studies of BION-1301.
