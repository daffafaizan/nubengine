      Phase I studies using short intravenous infusion schedules, the predominant drug toxicities
      have been gastrointestinal, such as diarrhea, and myelosuppression. In animal studies,
      prolonged infusion schedules followed by short drug-free intervals have resulted in
      preservation of antitumor activity and decreased drug toxicity. Therefore, we propose to
      examine a 96 hour infusion schedule of irinotecan alternating with 72 hour drug-free
      intervals in patients with solid tumors in order to determine the maximum tolerated dose of
      this regimen. The duration of these treatments will be escalated in our Phase I study until
      patients are receiving therapy for 2 out of every 3 weeks. Standard Phase I drug toxicity and
      tumor response information will be monitored and the pharmacokinetics of irinotecan and its
      active metabolite, SN-38 will also be examined. We will also attempt to monitor the
      intracellular molecular effects of SN-38 therapy in blood, bone marrow, and, whenever
      possible, tumor tissue.
