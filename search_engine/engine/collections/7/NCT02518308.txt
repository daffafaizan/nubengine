    
      Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 Arms.

      ARM I (INTERVENTION): Patients undergo an 8-week MBSR course, comprising weekly 2.5 hour
      classes and one 6-hour Saturday class at week 6 or 7. The MBSR program involves instruction
      in mindfulness meditation and yoga, and gives homework assignments involving practicing the
      well-being techniques taught in class. Patients are required to record and report time spent
      on home practice in a journal daily, and receive a weekly reminder to report their home
      practice.

      ARM II (WAIT-LIST CONTROL): Patients do not participate in the intervention, but are given
      the option to be placed on a waitlist for the MBSR course and may complete it within 6 months
      after the final study visit.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 8 weeks (at completion of study) and 5
      months (3 months from study completion).
