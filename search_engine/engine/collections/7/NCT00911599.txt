      are lower at one year in patients who receive a metal on polyethylene total hip as compared
      to CONSERVE® A-Class Total Hip with BFH® technology. Secondary aims include the gathering of
      clinical data regarding survival and dislocation rates at two years post surgery, as well as
      the assessment of pain, physical function, radiographic and clinical outcome at the two year
      interval.
