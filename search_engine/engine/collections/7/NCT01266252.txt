      (FDA) for short-term analgosedation (<24h) in mechanically-ventilated critical care adult
      patients and sedation of non-intubated adult patients prior to and/or during surgical and
      other procedures. Trials are underway to investigate its pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy
      and safety in long-term use. Clinical experience with dexmedetomidine in the paediatric
      population is limited. Moreover, during childhood many developmental changes take place with
      consequences on drug exposure and drug response. Finally, critical illness itself can affect
      drug pharmacokinetics and -dynamics. Therefore, the investigators cannot simply extrapolate
      adult data for use in children but the investigators are in need of data on pharmacokinetics
      and pharmacodynamics in every paediatric subpopulation.
