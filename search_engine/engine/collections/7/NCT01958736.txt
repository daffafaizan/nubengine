    
      Research Aims:

        1. To establish the feasibility of ballistic strength training in stroke and

        2. To evaluate the effects of ballistic strength training exercises on mobility outcomes,
           strength and quality of life when compared with usual care.

      Methods:

      This wil be a prospective, randomized, controlled, assessor-blinded pilot study. It will be
      conducted 3 x per week for 6 weeks (i.e. a total of 18 sessions lasting 30 minutes).

      Primary outcome measure: Feasibility

        -  Recruitment

        -  Retention/Attrition

        -  Clinical Feasibility

        -  Safety

      Secondary outcome measures - measured at baseline and completion

        -  Ten metre walk test (10MWT) comfortable pace

        -  10MWT maximum safe pace

        -  High level mobility assessment tool (HiMAT): Only in participants where 10MWT is <12.5s
           at baseline

        -  Timed up and go test (TUG)

        -  Functional Ambulation Category (FAC)

        -  Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) via AQoL-4D

      Description of intervention:

      Control Group:

      The control group will complete a suite of exercises based upon existing rehabilitation
      practices that aim to improve mobility after stroke. The supervising physiotherapist will
      select and progress the exercises, recording the performance of exercises in an exercise log
      and detailing incidence of adverse events. Exercise selection will include: gait retraining,
      cardiovascular fitness, lower limb strengthening, static and dynamic balance

      Experimental group:

      The experimental group will complete jump squats on the leg sled, single leg toe push offs
      (or bilateral where unable to complete single), alternating legs (i.e. bounding), mini tramp
      jumping, progressing to jogging, quick hip flexion and bounding on land.
