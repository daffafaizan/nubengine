      endobronchially, not large enough to be visualized by x-ray fluoroscopy for transbronchial
      biopsy (TBBx), and/or do not lie within an accessible airway. In this study, investigators
      hope to evaluate new technologies to aid in PPN biopsy using navigation bronchoscopy (NB)
      combined with navigation transthoracic needle aspiration (N-TTNA) sampling of a PPN.

      Patients meeting inclusion criteria who consent will undergo a convex Endobronchial
      Ultrasound (EBUS) bronchoscopy for evaluation and sampling of the mediastinum and hilum.
      Following this, NB will be performed with an ultrathin bronchoscope (4mm outer diameter with
      a 2 mm working channel) with R-EBUS and fluoroscopy. If the lesion is localized by NB and/or
      radial EBUS in conjunction with NB, TBBX will be taken. At the conclusion of TBBX sampling, a
      fluoroscopic evaluation to assess for the presence of pneumothorax will be performed and if
      one is present, appropriate clinical measures will be taken at the discretion of the treating
      team (tube thoracostomy, observation, etc.) and no further sampling techniques will be
      utilized. If the lesion was not able to be localized via NB and/or the physician feels
      insufficient sample was acquired for diagnosis and there is no evidence of pneumothorax, the
      patient will undergo N-TTNA at the same PPN during the same procedure time. It is envisioned
      that between 8-12 patients will require a N-TTNA to complete diagnosis.
