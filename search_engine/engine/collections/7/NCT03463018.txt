    
      Echinacea angustifolia root extract (AnxioCalm), standardized for the content of echinacoside
      and its alkamide profile, is intended to be used for 'amelioration of sub-threshold and mild
      anxiety which are risk factors in the development of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) and
      depression' in symptomatic people 'who are not eligible for anxiolytic medication.' Existing
      medical interventions, which require long periods of repeated administration, have
      significant safety concerns.
