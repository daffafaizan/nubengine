      temporarily reduces their visual acuity until corneal edema resolves over several weeks
      Brimonidine drops are a well known and safe Anti-glaucoma medication, used to lower intra
      ocular pressure.

      there have been several clinical observations that patients receiving Brimonidine drops had a
      faster resolution of their corneal edema even in the presence of normal intra-ocular
      pressure.

      The investigators postulated that administering topical Brimonidine to patients with
      significant post operative corneal edema will hasten their recovery and visual improvement.

      In order to prove that Brimonidine drops contribute to faster resolution of cornel edema and
      visual improvement, the study will randomly compare 50 post cataract surgery patients (group
      A)who will be administered Brimonidine to 2 control groups (50 people in each group):

      group B will be given topical timolol drops 0.5% (another well recognized anti glaucoma
      medication which reduces intra-ocular pressure by different mechanism than Brimonidine.

      Group C will not be given any test drug. All 3 groups will receive the regular post operative
      medications which include corticosteroids and antibiotics.
