      blood loss following total knee arthroplasty (TKA) but its safety regarding venous
      thromboembolic events (VTEs) remains in question. The direct, local application of TXA may
      reduce systemic toxicity whilst maintaining good or better bleeding control compared to IV
      TXA. The topical application of TXA via Hemovac drains has been reported previously with good
      results. However, there are no data on peri-articular TXA injections during TKA.
