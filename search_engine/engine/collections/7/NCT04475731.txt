    
      This is a phase II interventional multicenter study for adult patients with Ph+ALL who:

        -  Are MRD+ (i.e. BCR-ABL1/ABL1 >0.01) (or loose their molecular response) after whichever
           kind of previous treatment. MRD positivity is indeed regarded as a relapse/resistance,
           since it represents the early recognition of cases who will eventually experience an
           hematologic recurrence of disease.

        -  Are in hematologic relapse after whichever kind of previous treatment.

        -  Have never achieved an hematologic remission at least after one month of treatment.

      Patients will be treated with Ponatinib at a dose of 45 mg/die per os for 28 days for 3
      cycles and - if in hematologic and extra-hematologic relapse/refractoriness, clinically fit
      and according to medical decision - with concurrent systemic chemotherapy. In case of CMR
      achievement, dosing will be reduced to 30 mg. In case of toxicity, Ponatinib will be reduced
      to 30 (or 15) mg daily.
