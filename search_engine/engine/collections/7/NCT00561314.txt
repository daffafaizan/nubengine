      Primary

        -  To evaluate feasibility, side effect profile, and patient acceptability of
           high-intensity focused ultrasound ablation in patients with organ-confined, MRI and
           histologically proven adenocarcinoma of the prostate.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the effectiveness of therapy via biopsy, MRI, PSA level and estimated time
           to PSA nadir, and by recording the need for secondary or adjuvant treatment following
           therapy.

      OUTLINE: A probe is inserted into the rectum. High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) energy
      using the Sonablate system is delivered to the prostate tissue over approximately 2 hours.
      Patients are then evaluated over a 12-month period.

      Patients undergo multi-sequence MRI within 10-20 days after HIFU to assess the extent and
      volume of tumor necrosis and again at 6 months to assess for disease recurrence. Blood is
      collected for PSA levels at baseline and then at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Patients also
      undergo transrectal ultrasound biopsy at 6 months to evaluate disease response.

      Patients complete questionnaires at baseline and at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months to evaluate
      erectile and sexual function, urinary flow and continence, and quality-of-life.
