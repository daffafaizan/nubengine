      Part I - to identify the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) compared to placebo in elderly
      participants (adults ≥50 years) with asymptomatic or mild COVID-19. These patients will be
      treated with 120 and 240 µg/kg efineptakin alfa, given on Day 1 (Baseline), respectively. The
      study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacodynamics variable (ALC) of
      efineptakin alfa against COVID-19.

      Part II - to assess the safety and efficacy of efineptakin alfa single treatment compared to
      placebo in elderly participants with asymptomatic or mild COVID-19.
