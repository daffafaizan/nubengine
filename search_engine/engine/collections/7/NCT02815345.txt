      10 seconds for an acquisition). Measurement of nasal resistance is performed by
      rhinomanometry earlier (about a minute to a measure). They may be made to wakefulness or
      sleep since they do not require their participation. These measures will be carried at birth
      and then every 7 to 10 days (before the age of 28 days), if the child is still hospitalized.

      During these measurements, the heart rate and oxygen saturation are collected by a measuring
      sensor transcutaneously.
