    
      This is a prospective, single-center, single-arm (non-randomized), interventional cohort,
      non-significant risk (NSR) study designed to investigate the efficacy and safety of
      Rotational Fractional Resection (skin resection and focal lipectomy) in patients with
      moderate to severe submental skin laxity. The total duration of study participation for each
      subject is approximately up to 4 months for each subject from the screening visit to the exit
      visit. The follow-up period will be approximately 3 months after the procedure. Eligible
      subjects will complete a total of 11 study visits: screening, procedure, and follow-up visits
      at 1, 4, 7, 14, 21, 30, 45, 60, and 90 days post-procedure.
