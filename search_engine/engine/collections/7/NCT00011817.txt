    
      This "Evaluation and Treatment Protocol" will allow the geneticists and ophthalmic genetic
      specialists at the NEI to identify, follow and provide "standard of care" treatment to
      patients with genetic eye disease. The primary purpose of the protocol is to accumulate a
      cohort of patients with genetic eye disease for possible participation in NEI studies. A
      secondary purpose is to provide long-term follow-up and treatment for a variety of genetic
      eye diseases so that the genetic specialists at NEI will be better able to identify research
      hypotheses about these diseases in addition to maintaining their clinical skills. The
      availability of cohorts of patients with a spectrum of genetic disorders will be valuable for
      the training of fellows in ophthalmic genetics, an important mission of the NEI. Finally, the
      ability to provide long-term follow-up and care will also facilitate referral efforts for new
      NEI protocols.

      The genetic specialists at the National Eye Institute will be free to choose those genetic
      conditions that interest them. However, the total number of patients that can be enrolled in
      the protocol will be restricted. This protocol is not designed to test any new treatments.
      Any evaluations or treatment under this protocol will be based on the current standard of
      care for each genetic condition.

      Participants in this patient evaluation and treatment protocol will be evaluated for
      potential eligibility in any new NEI clinical studies as they are developed. If eligible,
      patients may be asked to participate in the new protocol. However, they will not be required
      to enter any protocol and their decision to participate will be entirely voluntary. No more
      than 150 patients will be accepted in this "Evaluation and Treatment Protocol."
