      review(2005) that determined features of high-fidelity simulation training that lead to
      effective learning. It this review, it is mentioned that the validity of the simulator
      (realism) is essential to help learners to increase their skills and sharpen their responses.
      It is essential to get and maintain engagement during high-fidelity simulation and it pass by
      an increase in realism and situation awareness. The purpose of this study is to evaluate if
      the use of identification badge (physical and conceptual realism) during high-fidelity
      simulation as an impact on situation awareness and engagement.
