           current analgesia-sedation procedure used in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU),
           associated with the collection of medical and socio-demographical data about mechanical
           ventilation duration, sedation complications, PTSD development. The severity of
           pathology can be evaluated using PIM2 and POPC scores. The sedation deepness will be
           determined using COMFORT-B scale. Eight weeks after hospitalization, families will be
           phoned to assess children memories, anxious troubles, and PTSD symptoms for the patients
           of more than 18 months old.

        2. During the transition period (6 months), nurses and physicians develop the protocol and
           undergo training in its use.

      During the third period, a nurse-implemented sedation is used. The collected data are the
      same that the collected data during the first period
