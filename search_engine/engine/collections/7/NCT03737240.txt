      long-term complications. Sustained hyperglycemia, also known as glucotoxicity, leads to
      progressive loss of beta-cell function and is considered a key pathophysiological process in
      the development of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Patients with severe hyperglycemia may respond
      poorly to oral anti-diabetic agents (OAD) alone initially and frequently require insulin to
      achieve glycemic targets. Current guidelines recommend to initiate therapy with basal insulin
      and progressively step up to basal-bolus insulin in patients with high HbA1c >9%,
      particularly if symptomatic or with catabolic symptoms.

      A basal-bolus insulin regimen increases the risk of hypoglycemia, weight gain and glycemic
      variability, which are limiting factors in achieving glycemic targets. A basal-bolus insulin
      regimen is also labor intensive and often requires multiple daily injections, further
      increasing the burden of diabetes care and decreasing patient adherence. In contrast,
      simplified treatment plans may improve adherence, leading to glycemic targets achievement.
      Thus, there is a critical need for simpler regimens that could overcome clinical inertia,
      improve patient adherence, and decrease glycemic variability in patients with poorly
      controlled type 2 diabetes. This prospective randomized control trial will compare IDegLira
      to basal-bolus insulin regimen in achieving glycemic control, while reducing hypoglycemia,
      glycemic variability, and weight gain in patients with uncontrolled T2D and HbA1c â‰¥9%.
