        -  Determine if epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation exists in the peripheral
           blood of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

        -  Estimate the frequency of EGFR mutation in these patients.

        -  Correlate the presence of EGFR mutation in blood with EGFR mutation in primary or
           metastatic NSCLC tumor block.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo blood collection for analysis of epidermal growth factor receptor
      mutation by DNA sequencing.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study.
