        -  Compare the population pharmacokinetics of docetaxel in Caucasians and African American
           patients with solid tumors.

        -  Compare the pharmacodynamic effect of a single dose of docetaxel in relation to
           hematological toxicity in these patient populations.

        -  Determine the CYP3A4 genotype and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) expression and their
           relationship to docetaxel clearance in these patient populations.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1. Patients may receive additional
      courses beginning 21 days after the first docetaxel dose at the discretion of the physician.
