    
      This is a multicenter, randomized phase II trial with an initial safety run-in to test the
      safety and efficacy of neoadjuvant pembrolizumab with image-guided radiotherapy and adjuvant
      pembrolizumab compared to radiation therapy alone in patients with clinically localized
      extremity soft tissue sarcoma at high risk for developing metastatic disease (tumor size > 5
      cm, intermediate- to high-grade; approximately 50% risk for distant disease at 2 years).
      Histologies will be limited to undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma and
      dedifferentiated/pleomorphic liposarcoma based on preliminary data from SARC028. Other terms
      for undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma may include, but are not limited to. pleomorphic
      undifferentiated sarcoma, unclassified spindle cell sarcoma, spindle cell sarcoma not
      otherwise specified, pleomorphic spindle cell sarcoma, pleomorphic fibroblastic sarcoma,
      undifferentiated high-grade pleomorphic sarcoma, pleomorphicsarcoma with prominent
      inflammation, pleomorphic sarcoma with giant cells, malignant fibrous histiocytoma (including
      storiform-pleomorphic and inflammatory subtypes), fibrosarcoma, and myxofibrosarcoma (located
      deep to the fascia in muscle). Radiation therapy with three cycles of pembrolizumab will be
      administered as neoadjuvant therapy for patients randomized to the experimental arm. These
      patients will also receive up to fourteen cycles of adjuvant pembrolizumab after surgical
      resection. Patients in the standard of care arm will receive neoadjuvant radiotherapy (50 Gy
      in 25 fractions) followed by surgical resection as in RTOG 0630.
