      the stomach and large intestine. Because of its anatomical position, the small intestine was
      named as a "blind area" leading to difficulty in diagnosis of small bowel disease. The advant
      of ballon-assisted enteroscopy facilitates the management of the small bowel diseases. There
      are several causes of obscure small intestinal disorders, which are Angioectasia (20-55%),
      small bowel tumours (10-20%), Cameron erosions (5-15%), NSAID enteropathy (5%), Dieulafoy
      lesion (2-3%), Crohn's disease (2-10%), Coeliac disease( 2-5 %), Meckel's diverticulum
      (2-5%), duodenal varices (1-5%), gastric antral vascular ectasia (GAVE) (1-2%), Ectopic
      varices (1-2%), Portal hypertensive enteropathy 1-2% (but 60-70% in those with portal
      hypertension), Radiation enteritis (<1% ). Obscure gastrointestinal bleeding (OGIB) was the
      most common indication for enteroscopry and is defined as a bleeding from an unknown site
      after a negative evaluation of the GI tract with esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and
      ileocolonoscopy. OGIB represents about 5% of patients presenting with GI bleeding. OGIB isthe
      most common indication for enteroscopry, whatever the age groups, but the proportion of
      patients performing enteroscopy for OGIB was higher in elderly patients. Young patients were
      indicated for enteroscopy for other complains, such as abdominal pain, or suspicious
      small-bowel tumor. Egyptian study was done and identified that the source of OGIB in the
      small intestine represents 69.2%, with negative DBE ﬁndings in 30.8% and the most common
      lesions were angioectasias followed by GI tumours (30.8%, 19.2%, respectively).
