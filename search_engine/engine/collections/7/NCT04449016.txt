      sessions of HIIT over a 3-week period which consisted of eight to ten 1-minute bouts of
      cycling at 85% PPO with 75-second recovery between bouts at 10 % PPO. This protocol is
      well-tolerated in inactive individuals. Continuously during each session, heart rate was
      monitored using telemetry. On days 1, 3, 6, and 9 of training, the physical activity
      enjoyment scale (PACES) was completed. VO2max and cardiac output max were assessed prior to
      training, as well as post.
