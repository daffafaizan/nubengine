      excitability and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) imposed itself as one of the best
      noninvasive methods to study cortical excitability in human subjects.

      Based on several recent studies, we hypothesize that measuring TMS parameters in the patients
      suffering from epilepsy can rapidly predict the effectiveness of the newly given AED and,
      ultimately, guide the optimization of the AED therapy. Characterizing the neurophysiological
      properties of innovative AEDs such as retigabine with TMS will allow 1) to better understand
      how AEDs modulate, in vivo, cortical excitability in humans in relation to their mode of
      action and 2) to establish TMS as a tool for assessing individual responsiveness to a
      particular AED treatment and for antiepileptic treatment monitoring.

      The effects of most AEDs on cortical excitability have been investigated. The modifications
      of the excitability parameters are related to the specific mode of action of each AED. For
      the new AED retigabine, at least two modes of action are known: 1) increase in cellular
      potassium efflux by changing conformation of the KV7.2-7.3 channels and 2) enhancement of
      GABA-A activity.
