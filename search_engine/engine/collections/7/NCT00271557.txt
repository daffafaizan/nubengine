      agent for the treatment of acute congestive heart failure (CHF) with a unique combination of
      desirable effects on the flow of blood throughout the body; the hormones secreted by the
      nervous system; and support of copious salt outputs by the renal system not provided by
      currently available therapies. The purpose of this safety study is to evaluate NATRECOR® hBNP
      in subjects with symptomatic, decompensated congestive heart failure for whom inpatient
      intravenous therapy with medications that influence the tone and caliber of blood vessels
      (other than, or in addition to, IV diuretics) is deemed appropriate. This is a multi-center,
      randomized, open-label, safety study designed to compare two doses of NATRECOR® hBNP for the
      treatment of decompensated congestive heart failure. One treatment group receives NATRECOR®
      hBNP fixed-dose infusion IV bolus of 0.3 µg/kg followed by a 0.015 µg/kg/min infusion; group
      two receives IV bolus of 0.6 µg/kg followed by a 0.03 µg/kg/min infusion. The duration of
      NATRECOR® hBNP therapy is determined by the attending physician. The study hypothesis is that
      doses of NATRECOR® hBNP in the range of 0.015 to 0.03 µg/kg/min provide an optimal
      safety/efficacy profile for the treatment of decompensated CHF. One treatment group receives
      NATRECOR® hBNP fixed-dose infusion IV bolus of 0.3 µg/kg followed by a 0.015 µg/kg/min
      infusion; group two receives IV bolus of 0.6 µg/kg followed by a 0.03 µg/kg/min infusion. The
      duration of NATRECOR® hBNP therapy is determined by the attending physician.
