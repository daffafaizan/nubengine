      surgery for pelvic organ prolapse and/or urinary incontinence.

      Participants who need transurethral catheterization postoperatively will be randomized to
      cranberry capsules or nitrofurantoin prophylaxis. Randomization will be performed the day of
      discharge. Both participants and surgeons will be blinded to treatment allocation. All
      participants will receive routine perioperative intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis.

      Participants who fail their voiding trial after surgery and require transurethral
      catheterization upon discharge from the hospital will be randomized to either one cranberry
      capsule (TheraCran oneÂ®, Theralogix, LLC, Rockville, Maryland) or one 100 mg capsule of
      nitrofurantoin by mouth daily beginning postoperative day #1. Participants randomized to the
      cranberry capsule group will continue to take one cranberry capsule daily for 28 days.
      Participants randomized to the nitrofurantoin group will continue to take 100 mg of
      nitrofurantoin each day transurethral catheterization is needed for up to 28 days. All
      participants will be scheduled for a repeat voiding trial within 48 hours to 1 week after
      discharge.

      All participants will complete a daily catheterization and medication diary to record the
      type of catheterization used (indwelling or intermittent) and to confirm they are taking the
      study medication for the duration of the study period. They will also be asked to record any
      urinary symptoms they experience and will be encouraged to contact the office immediately if
      they experience urinary symptoms consistent with a UTI.
