      For this purpose, etch & rinse (ER) and self-etch (SE) systems have been used for many years.
      Compared to SE systems, which are simplified and very easy to use, requiring less technical
      precision, traditional ER systems are still very popular and preferred by dentists. However,
      current researchers indicate that ER systems are more effective on enamel than dentin and
      that this effect is better than SE systems. SE systems are approaches in which the acid
      application and washing step are eliminated clinically and the possibility of making mistakes
      during the application and manipulation is reduced. An important advantage of these systems
      is that demineralization and resin infiltration occurs at the same time. Clinically, the
      application times are shorter than traditional systems. Two-steps SE systems have been used
      for a long time. In this system, the need for a separate acidic primer application has needed
      clinicians reason to search for single-steps bonding agents. And, in recent years,
      single-step SE systems also called "all in one", have been developed that include all steps
      of pickling, primer application, and adhesive agent application. However, there are studies
      showing that these systems do not perform as well as two-step SE systems. While many in-vitro
      studies have been conducted in the literature comparing three adhesive systems, the number of
      clinical studies is less and inadequate. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate
      the effect of 3 different adhesive systems commonly used in clinics on the success of class I
      composite restorations using the criteria of the World Dental Federation (FDI) and the United
      States Public Health Service (USPHS).
