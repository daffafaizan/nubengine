      in this single visit clinical study. Participants will rate their pain with pressure to the
      heel, leg and elbow, climb stairs and perform a novel task in a motion capture system, and
      complete questionnaires on how pain affects their daily life. All subjects will complete
      these measures twice, and for participants with AT they will complete this battery of tests
      before and after an anesthetic injection to the area of pain. This study has 2 aims:

      Specific Aim 1 compares measures of altered central processing in patients with chronic AT to
      adults without chronic pain; we hypothesize that patients with chronic AT will demonstrate
      signs of altered central processing, including central sensitization (lower pressure pain
      threshold), psychosocial factors (higher kinesiophobia), and/or altered motor control (lower
      ankle power during stair ascent).

      Specific Aim 2 determines which indicators of altered central processing persist after a
      local anesthetic injection to the Achilles tendon in patients with chronic AT; we hypothesize
      chronic AT pain is perpetuated by altered central processing that persists in the absence of
      continued peripheral nociception.
