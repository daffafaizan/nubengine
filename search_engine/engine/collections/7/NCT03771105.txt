      (XLH), when matched for duration and dose of phosphate (Pi) therapy to patients with
      hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets with hypercalciuria (HHRH), will evidence greater
      cardiovascular and vascular debility than patients with HHRH. The overall objectives of this
      project are to utilize our existing longitudinal databases for individuals with XLH and HHRH
      through an interdisciplinary collaboration between pediatric and adult endocrinology to: i)
      quantify the impact of exposure to Pi therapy across the lifespan on cardiovascular and renal
      complications, which are key aging endpoints, ii) determine the acute response to Pi loading
      in XLH and HHRH by studying the changes in surrogate markers of cardiovascular and renal
      function.
