      endemic. HIV infected and uninfected adults were assigned to receive daily CTX if CD4 cell
      count was <350, or daily multivitamin if CD4 cell count was >= 350 or if the client was HIV
      negative. All clients were then followed for a total of 6 months. At specified scheduled and
      sick visits, clients received a physical exam, blood smears, nasopharyngeal swabs and stool
      samples or rectal swabs. Samples collected at baseline and during follow-up were used to
      measure the change in CTX resistance among P. falciparum parasites, pneumococcus isolates,
      and commensal E. coli.
