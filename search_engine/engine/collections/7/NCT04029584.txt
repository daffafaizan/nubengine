    
      The effect of rifampin on the pharmacokinetics of fluvastatin will be studied in healthy
      volunteers in a two arms, two-period, randomized, unblinded, crossover clinical trial. In the
      first arm, subjects will be randomized to one of two treatment groups:

      (i)fluvastatin (Lescol速) 20mg capsule (ii) one oral dose of fluvastatin (Lescol速) 20mg
      capsule immediately following a 30-min intravenous infusion of rifampin 600mg in 10ml Normal
      Saline.

      In the second arms, patients will be pretreated with 600mg oral rifampin (two 300mg rifadin
      capsule) once daily to induce hepatic enzymes (and transporters) for 5 years. Subjects will
      be randomized to one of two treatment groups:

      (i) one oral dose of fluvastatin (Lescol速) 20mg capsule (ii) one oral dose of fluvastatin
      (Lescol速) 20mg capsule immediately following a 30-min intravenous infusion of rifampin 600mg
      in 10ml Normal Saline
