      method to quantify the intensity of this subjective symptom. In adults, the visual analog
      scale (VAS) is an accurate tool, but this has not been shown to be reliable in young
      children. By default the most common objective outcome measure used in pediatric studies has
      been the incidence and number of emetic episodes. This measure, however, correlates poorly
      with the somatic subjective symptom of nausea.

      Apfel et al have shown that 30-40% of adult patients undergoing surgery have post discharge
      nausea and / or vomiting while 12% have vomiting. These data on nausea in adults were based
      on a visual analog scale for nausea. There are no data on the incidence of postoperative
      nausea in children since the severity of symptoms are difficult to measure as younger
      children are known to be unable to use the VAS reliably.

      Recently a pictorial scale for measuring nausea, the Baxter Animated Retching Faces (BARF)
      scale, has been developed and shown to have construct, content and convergent validity as an
      instrument to measure nausea in children. The clinical usefulness of this scale in
      determining the incidence of postoperative and post-discharge nausea in children has yet to
      be determined including the lowest age where it can be used reliably, the score associated
      with a patient's perception of a need for treatment, the minimum change in the scores of
      clinical relevance and the test-retest reliability when nausea is rated as not having
      changed.
