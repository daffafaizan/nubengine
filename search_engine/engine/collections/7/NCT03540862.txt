      obstruction with chronic airway inflammation and emphysematous changes in the lung
      parenchyma, thus leading to air-trapping, as well as extional dyspnea. The mechanism
      underlying desaturation during 6MWT in patients with COPD is multifactorial involving dynamic
      hyperinflation and impaired gas exchange that worsens ventilation-perfusion mismatch.
      Previous studies have shown that oxygen desaturation during the 6MWT predicts mortality and
      increases the risk of adverse outcomes in COPD patients. However, there is a paucity of
      studies that have looked at effective treatments to counter the consequences of hypoxemia
      during exertion.

      The investigators have established a hospital-based maintenance pulmonary rehabilitation
      program together with NPV for COPD, and the investigators have shown that the benefits of NPV
      improves lung function and exercise capacity, and reduces acute exacerbation and medical
      costs. The investigators now sought to determine whether long-term maintenance NPV improves
      long-term clinical outcomes and reduces mortality in COPD.
