      important in the growth of leukemia cells. Ara-C is a chemotherapy drug that has been used
      for many years to treat AML and MDS.

      Imatinib mesylate (Gleevec) is a protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitor that inhibits the Bcr-Abl
      tyrosine kinase, as well as the receptor tyrosine kinases for platelet- derived growth factor
      (PDGF) and stem cell factor (SCF), c-Kit, and inhibits PDGF- and SCF-mediated cellular
      events. c-Kit is expressed in over 90% of patients with AML.

      The treatment of AML for patients age 65 or older with AML or high-risk MDS (age Â³ 60 if
      high-risk cytogenetics) have a poor prognosis with induction chemotherapy. Response rate is
      no more than 45% with an induction mortality of at least 25%, and 1-year survival no better
      than 20%. Indeed, most patients in these age groups are not even offered therapy and are
      managed with supportive care only. Thus, new therapies that are better tolerated are needed.

      Imatinib alone can induce response in nearly 20% of patients, and there is synergy with low
      concentrations of ara-C. In this study we plan to investigate the combination of imatinib and
      low-dose ara-C.
