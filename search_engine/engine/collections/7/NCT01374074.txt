      disparity in Barrett's esophagus, the premalignant lesion of esophageal adenocarcinoma.
      Specifically, the investigators hypothesize that environmental factors, genetic factors, and
      potentially gene environment interactions play crucial roles in the observed racial disparity
      in developing Barrett's esophagus.

      Participants: Patients aged 18-80 presenting at the Gastrointestinal (Gl) Endoscopy Clinic at
      UNC-Chapel Hill for elective upper endoscopy with a primary or secondary indication of reflux
      symptoms.

      Procedures (methods): Endoscopic biopsy, pH impedance and sampling of gastric secretions will
      be performed according to our standard protocol. A series of questionnaires assessing
      demographics, environmental exposure (e.g., smoking, drinking), markers of socioeconomic
      status (SES), body measurement, previous health history, and gastroesophageal reflux disease
      (GERD) symptomatology will be administered to our subjects.
