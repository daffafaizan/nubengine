        1. Primary Outcome Measures: evaluate the changes in the plasma pharmacokinetic parameters
           (Cmax, Cmin, AUC, t 1/2, and Cl) of Telaprevir (TVR) administered at 750 mg/8h together
           with un-boosted Atazanavir (200 mg/12h), taking as reference the pharmacokinetic
           parameters observed when TVR is administered with Atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg/day)

        2. To assess the changes in the plasma pharmacokinetic parameters of Atazanavir
           administered as 200 mg/12h with respect to its administration as 300/100 mg/day when
           administered together with TVR (750 mg/8h or 1125 mh/12h).

      Method: open labelled clinical trial with a planned duration of 24 weeks in which 14
      HIV/Hepatitis C virus genotype 1 patients under treatment with pegylated Î±-interferon,
      Ribavirin and Telaprevir will be enrolled. A 24 hours pharmacokinetic profile will be
      obtained after a supervised drug intake while taking TVR and ATV/rtv. Afterwards, the
      patients will take un-boosted ATV 200 mg bid for 7 - 10 days. Subsequently, a new
      pharmacokinetic profile will be obtained.
