      detachment and glaucoma) and systemic diseases (e.g., hypertension, diabetes and leukemia).
      The routine fundus examination is conducive for early detection of these diseases. However,
      manual conducting fundus examination needs an experienced retina ophthalmologist, and is
      time-consuming and labor-intensive, which is difficult for its routine implementation on
      large scale.

      This study will develop an artificial intelligence system integrating with ultra-widefield
      fundus imaging to automatically screen for multiple ocular fundus lesions in real time and
      evaluate its performance in different real-world settings. The efficacy of the system will
      compare to the final diagnoses of each participant made by experienced ophthalmologists.
