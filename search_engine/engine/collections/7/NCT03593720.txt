    
      After obtaining informed consent , the investigator will measure stretched penile length and
      glans size in 3 dimensions (length, width, height) in the office on patients with
      hypospadias, as well as at the time of operation, after the induction of anesthesia. Patients
      undergoing hypospadias surgery will be considered study subjects. If the patient was given
      pre-operative testosterone as part of the current standard of care, this will be noted and
      the measurements taken at each pre-operative office visit will be recorded. The investigator
      will also record corrected age, weight in kilograms and ethnicity as identified by the
      family.

      Control patients will be those male patients undergoing non-hypospadias urological surgery
      (hernia repair, orchiopexy, circumcision, re-circumcision) with a normal penis, the
      investigator will perform a single intra-operative measurement of the same glans and penile
      variables after induction of anesthesia and prior to the start of their genital surgery.
      Again, age, weight and ethnicity will be recorded.
