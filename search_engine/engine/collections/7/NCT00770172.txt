      Primary

        -  Determine the efficacy of filgrastim (G-CSF) in preventing persistent moderate
           neutropenia in patients with solid tumors while maintaining chemotherapy courses.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the tolerability of 2 regimens of G-CSF in these patients.

        -  Determine the number of courses of G-CSF needed in each regimen.

        -  Evaluate the frequency of infections.

        -  Determine dose intensity.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) once daily for 6 days
           beginning 1 week after the start of chemotherapy (days 7-12). If chemotherapy begins on
           day 8, patients receive G-CSF SC on days 9-14.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive G-CSF SC every 2 days on days 10-20 for up to 6 injections.
