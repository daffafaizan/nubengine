      or placebo (isotonic saline) for 20 min.

      The investigator here examine the effect of levcromakalim infusion on the MMA and the MCA
      circumference over several hours using a high resolution MRA technique in a randomized,
      double-blind placebo-controlled design in healthy volunteers. The investigator hypothesized
      that levcromakalim induces dilatation of cranial arteries.

      MR imaging will be performed on a 3.0 Tesla Philips Achieva Scanner (Philips Medical Systems,
      Best, The Netherlands) using an eight-element phased-array receiver head coil. We will obtain
      repeated MRA measurements covering the MMA and MCA before and after levcromakalim/placebo
      infusion
