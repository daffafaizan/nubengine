      I. To determine the effect of pharmacological doses of resveratrol on serum estradiol levels
      in post-menopausal women with high body mass index (BMI).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the effect of resveratrol on serum estrone, testosterone, and sex hormone-binding
      globulin (SHBP).

      II. Assess the effect of resveratrol on serum levels of insulin and C-peptide. III. Assess
      the effect of resveratrol on adipocytokine expression and secretion as measured by serum
      leptin and adiponectin.

      IV. Assess the effect of resveratrol on inflammatory cytokines as measured by serum
      C-reactive protein (CRP).

      V. Assess the effect of resveratrol on oxidative stress as measured by urinary
      8-isoprostaglandin F2 alpha (8-iso-PGF2 alpha) and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8OHdG).

      VI. Assess the safety of resveratrol intervention as measured by reported adverse events,
      complete blood count with differential (CBC/diff), comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), and
      lipid profile.

      VII. Assess the relationship between systemic study agent exposure and biomarker modulation.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive resveratrol orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 12 weeks.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up for 2 weeks
