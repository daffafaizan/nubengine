    
      Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) is a serious complication of assisted reproduction.

      Previous studies revealed that calcium gluconate infusion reduced the risk of OHSS. Other
      studies revealed that cabergoline (potent dopamine receptor agonist on D2 receptors)was
      effective in preventing OHSS.

      The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of calcium gluconate infusion versus
      cabergoline in the prevention of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) in patients
      pretreated with GnRH agonist long protocol who are at high risk for OHSS.
