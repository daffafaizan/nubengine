    
      This Phase I/II clinical study is designed to examine the safety of Xcellerated T Cells, an
      activated, autologous T cell product, in study subjects undergoing an autologous peripheral
      blood stem cell transplant for the treatment of multiple myeloma. Thirty-five patients will
      be treated. Patients must have undergone induction therapy prior to study registration, and
      may not have progressed following induction therapy or any other prior therapy for myeloma.

      Patients will undergo a steady state leukapheresis (Xcellerate Leukapheresis) to obtain
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells that will be used to produce Xcellerated T Cells. During
      the Xcellerate Process, T cells will be activated and expanded ex vivo by co-stimulation with
      anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 monoclonal antibodies covalently attached to super-paramagnetic
      microbeads. While the Xcellerated T Cells are being produced at Xcyte Therapies, patients
      will be treated with a standard mobilization regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide and
      filgrastim (Neupogen; G-CSF), followed by a second leukapheresis for collection of peripheral
      blood stem cells. Patients will be treated with a standard high-dose chemotherapy regimen for
      multiple myeloma consisting of single agent melphalan (200mg/m2). Patients will then receive
      their peripheral blood stem cells followed by post-transplant filgrastim for neutrophil
      recovery. Three days (Day 3) following stem cell infusion, patients will receive a single
      dose Xcellerated T Cells.
