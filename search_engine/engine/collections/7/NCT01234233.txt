      prevention from, detection and therapy of hypothermia is essential. The appropriate methods
      of temperature assessment are still under debate as well as the effect and necessary duration
      of active prewarming of patients to avoid postoperative hypothermia and shivering.

      The aim of our study is to evaluate the effect of prewarming on the rate of postoperative
      hypothermia and shivering and to compare sublingual versus tympanic temperature assessment
      during the perioperative period in patients undergoing elective minor surgery.

      The investigators plan to include patients scheduled for routine minor surgery of
      approximately 1h duration. Patients will be randomly assigned to 4 groups with different
      duration of active prewarming. Body temperature will be recorded regularly by sublingual and
      tympanic (by thermocouple) measurement. Incidence of hypothermia (temp. < 36Â°C) and shivering
      will be assessed postoperatively.
