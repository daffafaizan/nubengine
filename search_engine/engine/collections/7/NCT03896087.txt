      introduce their use in clinical practice. Only a few studies have been performed on DBS
      stored at ambient temperature, while the majority had DBS samples refrigerated or frozen
      right after collection, which does not mimic real-life settings. Additionally, due to the
      lack of standardized procedures, DBS collection and elution protocols varied across different
      studies. A large multicentre diagnostic accuracy study using standardized DBS collection and
      elution protocols validated by test manufacturers is needed to inform national hepatitis
      programmes and international guideline development groups. Test manufacturers need clinical
      evaluation data to update their regulatory claims and include DBS as an alternative sample
      type.

      FIND is preparing a trial to evaluate the performance, as measured by sensitivity and
      specificity, of four laboratory-based assays for detection of HCV RNA assays using capillary
      blood collected on DBS/PSC. This will be provisional on the manufacturers agreeing to
      participate, as well as committing to applying to stringent regulatory approval for DBS/PSC.
