      hospital setting.

      A case-control study is conducted in Helsinki Children's hospital. Altogether 70 children
      aged 4-17 years coming for a minor operative procedure including pre-operative cannula
      insertion will be included. Part of the patients will be exposed to medical clowning
      intervention and the reference group will be treated preoperatively as routinely without
      clowns. Emotions, anxiety levels, pain caused by the cannula insertion of the children will
      be monitored during the day. A survey on the emotions and expectations of the parents will be
      done.

      A novel digital survey tool will be used to measure patient experiences before and after the
      insertion of a venous cannula needed for anaesthesia.

      The research questions are as follows:

      How does engagement with a medical clown during pre-operative cannulation impact on children
      and their parents' patient experience? How feasible is a novel data collection tool for
      measuring patient experience and the impact of an intervention on the patient experience of
      families?
