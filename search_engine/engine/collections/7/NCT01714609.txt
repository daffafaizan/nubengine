    
      This is a pilot proof-of-concept study that investigates the effect of sorafenib on portal
      pressure, as determined by the hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG), in patients with
      liver cirrhosis, portal hypertension and unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) that has
      successfully responded to radiofrequency ablation and/or transarterial chemoembolization, and
      have obtained a complete response.

      The primary end-point of the study is the change in HVPG observed from baseline to three
      months after starting treatment with sorafenib. Secondary end-point is safety of sorafenib.

      The trial is structured as a randomized double blind placebo controlled study. After a
      three-month period of therapy with sorafenib or placebo (double-blind phase), patients will
      be given open-label sorafenib for an additional 3-month period (open-label phase). A total of
      44 patients will be randomized (in the initial phase) on a 1:1 ratio to sorafenib or placebo.
      Patients will be followed monthly and HCC follow-up will be according to standards of care.
      The study will be sponsored by Onyx, who will also provide the treatment medication
      (sorafenib and placebo)
