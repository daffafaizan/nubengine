      Until now, in the preoperative time, the anesthetist evaluated the need for some specific
      action such as pre-operative iron administration to avoid perioperative transfusions or the
      need to assess some of the patient's morbidities to try to optimize it. In the perioperative
      period in our hospital, the criteria of the Multimodal and Fast-Tcack Rehabilitation programs
      have been applied for a long time and there are some trajectories that allow standardization
      of patient management once they have been admitted.

      It is demonstrated in other centers and in other surgical pathologies that, in addition to
      what we are already applying to our center, modify the preoperative preparation of our
      patients and try to improve their "functional capacity" results of lower morbidity and
      mortality and the subsequent recovery of patients can greatly improve . This is called
      prehabilitation. Pretreatment consists in a change in preoperative preparation at three
      levels. The concept of preoperative preparation changes and the patient is actively involved
      in it. Three levels of the patient are controlled: functional or physical level, nutritional
      level and emotional level, by means of pots and they are encouraged to make a series of
      changes in their habitual life (exercise, dietary advice, mindfullness techniques) that
      increase its functional capacity. This is related to a decrease in morbidity and mortality
      and in addition to a better and faster postoperative recovery.
