      REGIMEN A: Patients receive fludarabine intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days -8 to -6,
      cyclophosphamide IV on days -7 to -6, and undergo total body irradiation (TBI) twice daily
      (BID) on days -4 to -1. Patients then undergo umbilical cord blood transplant on day 0.
      Between 4-24 hours after transplant completion, patients receive umbilical cord blood-derived
      hematopoietic CD34-positive progenitor cells IV over 5-10 minutes in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      REGIMEN B: Patients receive fludarabine IV over 30-60 minutes on days -6 to -2,
      cyclophosphamide IV on day -6, thiotepa IV over 4 hours on days -5 to -4, and undergo TBI
      once daily (QD) on days -2 to -1. Patients then undergo umbilical cord blood transplant on
      day 0. Between 4-24 hours after transplant completion, patients receive umbilical cord
      blood-derived hematopoietic CD34-positive progenitor cells IV over 5-10 minutes in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 28, 80, and 180 days, and
      then at 1 and 2 years.
