      exercise program in heart surgical patients. An experimental design is used. Subjects are
      selected using a purposeful sampling and are randomly assigned to the intervention or control
      group by using block size randomization method. Patients in the intervention group will
      receive a 12 week exercise program including: individual consultation, teaching exercise
      which contain walking and resistance exercise by using elastic bands and elastic balls. Data
      are collected by physical indicators and a structural questionnaire to measure frailty,
      quality of life, social support, anxiety and depression, symptom distress at baseline, 6
      weeks, 12 weeks and 24 weeks after surgery . Data analysis includes descriptive statistics,
      Pearson correlation coefficient, independent t test, chi square, one way ANOVA and
