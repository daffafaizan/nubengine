      chronic non-malignant pain was conducted in tandem with a similar protocol in patients with
      chronic cancer pain. A total of 463 patients were enrolled and evaluated in these studies.
      Patients receiving chronic opioid therapy were converted to once daily OROS hydromorphone
      using oral morphine equivalents. Supplementary immediate-release (IR) hydromorphone was
      provided for breakthrough pain. The dose of OROS hydromorphone was escalated after every 2
      days of therapy until no more than 3 doses of immediate-release(IR) hydromorphone were
      required in a 24-hour period. Once a patient could be maintained on a stable dose of OROS
      hydromorphone for 3 consecutive days, the patient entered a 2-week maintenance phase.
      Patients who completed the study were eligible for participation in an OROS hydromorphone
      long-term extension study, Study DO-109. The hypothesis is the 24-hour controlled-release
      form of oral hydromorphone may provide consistent pain relief, convenient dosing, and
      enhanced compliance while possibly decreasing the incidence of side effects associated with
      peak (high) and trough (low) fluctuations in plasma drug concentrations typically seen with
      immediate-release dosage formulations. Patients received OROS Hydromorphone HCI at Visit 2,3,
      and 4(either 8,16,32, and/or 64mg tablets) taken orally. OROS Hydromorphone HCI doses were
      titrated after every two days of therapy as necessary until dose stabilization occurred,
      followed by a two week Maintenance Therapy Phase.
