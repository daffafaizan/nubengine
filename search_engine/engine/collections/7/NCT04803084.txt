      - To evaluate serial multiparametric MRI as an early marker for tumor immune response to an
      immune checkpoint inhibitor agent

      Secondary Objective:

        -  To assess the potential of early treatment imaging changes on MRI to discern final tumor
           treatment response

        -  To assess the prognostic potential of MRI features

      Correlative:

        -  To correlate MRI features with immunophenotypes (i.e. hot and cold tumors)

        -  To evaluate the association of MRI features with other known biomarkers of immune
           checkpoint inhibitor response
