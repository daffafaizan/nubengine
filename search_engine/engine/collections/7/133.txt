chromium, lead, cadmium, nickel and titanium in mice.. effect onmortality, tumors and tissue levels .about 700 mice were given throughout their lives 5 ppm cadmium, lead,chromium, nickel or titanium in drinking water while fed a dietdeficient in cadmium and low in other metals . tissue concentrationscomparable to those of man were observed . sex differences appeared .mortality of females was unaffected . mortality of males on cadmium,lead and nickel was increased compared with that of the chromium group,and of those on cadmium and lead compared with the controls . longevityof the oldest 10 of both sexes was less in lead and titanium groups, andof males in cadmium group, compared with controls . no metal wascarcinogenic,. incidence of tumors in males on cadmium and lead, and infemales given nickel was decreased . body weights at death were greaterin titanium, chromium and lead groups . large increments of titanium,moderate increments of cadmium and nickel, and lesser increments ofchromium and lead were observed in 5 organs, compared with controls .higher concentrations of cadmium and titanium occurred in younger miceand the other metals did not increase markedly in tissues with age . allmetals except chromium exhibited one or more signs of innate toxicity .
