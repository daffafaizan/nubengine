      equipment and auxiliary devices, the collective modalities need implements that support, in
      the development of training and the game. It was developed equipment to assist in the
      training of technical fundamentals and to improve the efficiency of the motor gesture
      required for the practice of sitting volleyball in athletes with physical disabilities. Ten
      athletes, sitting volleyball players, were selected to perform a set of technical
      fundamentals and their variations. Lift the ball (with two variations), attack and serve, and
      reception. After the analysis of the movements the equipment was elaborated and constructed
      based on the measurements made with the athletes, such as contact height with the ball,
      perimeter, speed and parabola.
