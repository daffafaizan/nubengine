      units (ICU) are rarely based on controlled trials. For this reason, we compared a reinforced
      isolation precautions protocol (RIPP) with a standard precautions protocol (SPP) for the
      acquisition of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in 2 intensive care units.

      Evaluation: the risk for MRSA carriage was defined on admission if 1 of 3 criteria were met:
      hospitalization in the past year, transfer with prior length of stay â‰¥2 days, prior history
      of MRSA in the 5 past years.

      Intervention: Randomization 1/1 of a total of 500 patients to either protocol; MRSA screening
      was performed at the sites of carriage and colonization at inclusion, every week and at ICU
      discharge in all patients; the results were given to the clinicians only for the patients of
      the RIPP group.

      Protocols: the SPP was consistent with the CDC recommendations and included
      transmission-based isolation precautions to patients with clinical samples involving
      resistant bacteria (including MRSA) or highly transmissible organisms. The RIPP included the
      extension of isolation precautions (1) to patients at risk for MRSA on admission until
      screening results proved negative and (2) to MRSA-positive patients on screening or clinical
      samples until further negative samples, in whom nasal mupirocin decontamination was added.
      Compliance with the recommendations of each protocol was controlled by an audit.

      The efficacy is assessed on the proportion of patients who acquired MRSA at any site.
