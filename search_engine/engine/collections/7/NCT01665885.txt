      arrest. Via animal models hypothermia has been identified as the most promising
      neuroprotective therapy in focal cerebral ischemia as well. But the prove of clinical benefit
      in patients with acute ischemic stroke is still missing: Most likely due to the prolonged
      time window until hypothermia-induction (14 h) in previous studies. In addition, feasibility
      of the method through which hypothermia is applied is crucial for a broad implementation of
      hypothermia in stroke therapy. Surface versus endovascular cooling have never been compared
      in a prospective trial in awake stroke patients.

      HAIS-SE is evaluating for the first time ever in a randomized controlled trial efficacy,
      tolerability, practicability and safety of endovascular versus surface cooling in awake
      stroke patients.
