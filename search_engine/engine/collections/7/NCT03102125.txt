      contraindications to MRI and allergies to either regadenoson or gadolinium contrast, will be
      enrolled over 60 months. Patients will be recruited from UCSD. The investigators will
      specifically enroll all eligible heart-transplant patients.

      Brief protocol:

      Cardiac MRI is performed. Cine images in standard views are obtained. T1 and T2 mapping
      sequences are performed on short axis images pre- and post-gadolinium contrast. For stress
      imaging, intravenous regadenoson is given as a 0.4 mg bolus followed by a 5 mL saline flush.
      After 30 seconds, short-axis images are acquired for 30 consecutive heartbeats with
      administration of gadolinium. Rest imaging is performed 30 minutes after stress imaging.
      Lastly, late gadolinium enhancement images are obtained in standard views. Images are
      analyzed offline by a blinded independent reader. Patients will be followed for at least 1
      year after enrollment for MACE.

      Peripheral blood and endomyocardial biopsies will also be collected, timing as per usual
      clinical care as well as for-cause, for single cell RNAseq analyses.
