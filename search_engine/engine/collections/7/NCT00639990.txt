      and chest wall components, the functional residual capacity, the gas-exchange and alveolar
      recruitment in brain injured patients.

      The measurements will be performed under sedation at different levels of PEEP. The following
      groups will be included: a) control patients withot lung injury and brain injury; b) brain
      injured patients without lung injury within the first 72 hours; c) brain injured patients
      without lung injury after 72 hours; d) brain injured patients with lung injury. Brain injury
      was defined as primary or secondary. Respiratory functional data will be related to
      intra-abdominal pressure.
