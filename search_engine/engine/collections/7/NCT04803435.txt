      and the assessment by telemedicine by the fixed medical team of the HIAE service responsible
      for urgency / emergency. Both in face-to-face evaluation, as well as telemedicine, clinical
      data, final diagnosis, destination, total time of care, guidance and prescription will be
      computed. In the face-to-face evaluation, complementary exams and medications received in
      situ were computed. Final diagnoses will receive nomenclature according to the International
      Statistical Classification of Diseases and Problems Health-Related - ICD 10 (institutional
      medical record requirement - Cerner) and will be grouped according to equivalence of
      syndromic diagnosis. The diagnosis of the face-to-face assessment is made according to
      protocols based on extensive medical literature and approved by the institutional clinical
      staff, being representative of current medical practice and will be considered the gold
      standard diagnosis. Patients evaluated by telemedicine will be blinded to the diagnosis,
      recommended destination, guidelines and prescription performed by the medical team. UPA
      doctors will be blind to the doctor's assessment telemedicine and telemedicine doctors will
      not have access to the data obtained in the screening.
