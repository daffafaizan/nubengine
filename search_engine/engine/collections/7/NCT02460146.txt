      demonstrate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of CXA-10 and its
      metabolite(s) administered as multiple ascending oral doses over 14 days to healthy obese
      male volunteers. The pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of CXA-10 on serum biomarkers, some of
      which are elevated in the obese population, will also be investigated.
