      complications, and are associated with an increased risk in all-cause mortality. The GI
      Endobarrier Liner represents a viable alternative to other short-term weight loss methods. It
      is a minimally invasive endoscopic procedure, which may allow patients to recover faster with
      less morbidity and mortality. This study is investigating the safety and efficacy of the GI
      Endobarrier Liner in patients who are candidates for bariatric surgery.
