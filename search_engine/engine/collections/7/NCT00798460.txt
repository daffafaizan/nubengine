      for lamivudine resistant chronic hepatitis B patients. It is superior to adefovir monotherapy
      since the incidence of viral breakthrough of combination therapy used to be less than that of
      adefovir monotherapy in lamivudine resistant chronic hepatitis B patients. Clevudine, which
      is being marketed in Korea, is a nucleoside analogue of the unnatural beta-L configuration
      that has potent activity against HBV. It has demonstrated potent antiviral efficacy and
      significant biochemical improvement after 24 weeks of therapy. We hypothesized that clevudine
      plus adefovir combination therapy for lamivudine resistant patients might be as effective as
      the lamivudine plus adefovir combination therapy.

      In detail, we designed to perform this clinical study comparing the combination of clevudine
      and adefovir with lamivudine plus adefovir in lamivudine resistant chronic hepatitis B
      patient. Total treatment duration of both groups will be 12 months, and compare the efficacy
      of antiviral effects of these drugs.
