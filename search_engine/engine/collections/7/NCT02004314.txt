      study's dose of chloroquine is the same as the dose recommended for patients having
      autoimmune diseases. In these autoimmune cases, a daily dose of chloroquine at 250 mg for 12
      weeks has shown improvement in symptoms and decreases in inflammatory cytokines synthesis and
      a reduction in TLR -mediated immune activation. Study findings could help provide information
      about where and under what circumstances chloroquine treatment may reduce T cell activation
      and help restore circulating CD4 T cells.
