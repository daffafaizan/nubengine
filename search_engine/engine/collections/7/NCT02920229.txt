    
      Single-center, prospective, diagnostic trial. The primary objective of this study is to
      evaluate the sensitivity of 68Ga-PSMA PET /CT defined as the ratio between the number of
      68Ga-PSMA PET /CT positive patients and the number of prostate cancer patients with
      biochemical relapse and negative standard imaging.

      The secondary objectives are:

        -  Sensitivity for different Prostatic Specific Antigen (PSA) values (ranges)

        -  Sensitivity for different lesion sites

        -  Treatment response assessment with a second PET

        -  False positives detection during Follow Up (FUP) (with other standard methods and
           eventually optional biopsy) for patient without any treatment

        -  safety 67 evaluable patients will be injected with 100-200 megabecquerel (MBq) 68Ga-PSMA
           intravenously
