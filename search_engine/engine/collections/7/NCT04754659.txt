      treatment for infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm with stentgrafts either with active supra-
      or infrarenal fixation. Individuals are planned to be included throughout Scandinavia. After
      inclusion in the study, baseline data is collected and computerized randomization between the
      two stent graft fixation types is performed. Follow-up will be scheduled after 1 month and
      1,3 and 5 years. Analyses of blood samples to determine renal function are undertaken
      together with CT scans to detect stentgraft performance at all follow-up visits alongside
      assessments of health-related quality of life questionnaires.
