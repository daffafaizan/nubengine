      survival rate as well as the local control rate is low. If chemotherapy treatment is added it
      leads to a slightly better outcome. The radiotherapy treatment often causes pneumonitis
      and/or esophagitis. So damage to the normal tissue restricts the radiation dose that can be
      administered.

      However, several studies have shown that higher doses lead to better local control.
      Furthermore it is evident that the radiotherapy treatment should be given in a short time,
      preferably the treatment time should not exceed 32 days.

      To avoid a higher toxicity the normal tissue has to be spared, but to increase the local
      control rate the tumor dose must be as high as possible. This dilemma can only be solved by
      using very sophisticated treatment planning techniques in combination with a biologically
      superior treatment schedule. This schedule consists of delivering radiation dose twice a day
      instead of once, thus keeping the overall treatment time as low as possible.

      For the whole patient population, the mean lung dose can to a great extend predict the
      probability for developing radiation pneumonitis and the post-radiotherapy lung function. A
      logical next step is to determine the dose of radiotherapy on an individualised calculation
      of the maximum tolerated dose, being defined as the mean lung dose and the spinal cord dose.

      The objective of this trial is to investigate whether individualised radiation dose
      calculation based on a mean lung dose and the constraints of the spinal cord, in combination
      with an overall treatment time of less than 32 days, and only irradiating the primary tumor
      and the PET scan positive mediastinal areas is safe.
