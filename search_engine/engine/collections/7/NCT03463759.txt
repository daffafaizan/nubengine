      development of persistent low back pain; however, there is still debate on when changes in
      these mechanisms occur. Similarly, evoked cortical responses can reflect neuroplastic changes
      in pain processing regions, which are also thought to play a role in the transition to
      persistent pain, but there is also debate on when these neuroplastic changes develop relative
      to low back pain. Therefore, this study will use patients with an intermediary clinical pain
      state, recurrent low back pain, and matched healthy control participants, to investigate
      within and between subject differences in pain inhibitory, facilitatory and neuroplastic
      mechanisms.
