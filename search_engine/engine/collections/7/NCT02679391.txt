      Sweden. Approximately 30 % of these patients require abdominoplasties for functional
      disabilities being a total of 2,300 patients. Today the plastic surgeons of the departments
      of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery do not have the capacity to accommodate this demand. A
      Department of General Surgery started to perform abdominoplasties.

      This is a retrospective cohort study. Charts were retrieved from 69 consecutive patients
      operated by general surgeons at Capio S:t Görans Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden (group A) from
      13th of May to 19th of December 2011. Charts from 70 consecutive patients operated by plastic
      surgeons at the Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Karolinska University
      Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden (group B) were studied from 14th of January 2010 to 7th of
      December 2012. Collected data consist of patient demographics, operation methods, and
      complications observed at 30 days' follow-up. The outcome of a third group of about 70
      patients operated between 22th of January 2013 to 3th of June 2014 at S:t Görans Hospital
      (group C) are compared to the outcome of groups B and A. Guidelines for the surgical
      technique as well as pre-and postoperative care were refined between the operations of group
      A and C.

      Statistics Anova and regression analysis will be applied. And for dichotomous data Chi-Square
      test and Fischers exact test will be calculated. Power was calculated with the test of
      proportion for two independent groups and 5 per cent significance.
