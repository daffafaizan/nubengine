    
      The aim of this study is to determine whether the treatment of elderly patients with an
      undisplaced femoral neck fracture (uFNF) can be improved by decreasing reoperation rates
      through replacing the hip instead of trying to preserve it. Patients â‰¥75 years with an uFNF
      will be included and randomized within the Swedish Fracture Register (SFR) platform to
      internal fixation (screws/pins) or arthroplasty (choice of hemi or total is at the surgeon's
      discretion). The primary outcome will be a composite variable that combines two variables
      (reoperations and mortality) into a single variable.
