      investigational product, DN24-02, or to standard of care. Subjects randomized to the
      experimental arm received DN24-02 at 2-week intervals, for a total of 3 infusions. The study
      evaluated survival, disease-free survival, safety and the magnitude of the immune response
      between these 2 subject groups.
