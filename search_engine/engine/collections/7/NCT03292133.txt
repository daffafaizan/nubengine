    
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety
      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a
      specific disease or patient population. "Investigational" means that the drug or drugs are
      being studied and have not been approved together for patients.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved gefitinib as a treatment option
      for EGFR mutation-positive lung cancer.

      The FDA has not approved EGF816 as a treatment for any disease at this time.

      In this research study, the investigators are studying the safety and efficacy of the
      combination of the study drugs EGF816 and gefitinib.

      Both EGF816 and gefitinib are inhibitors which target a specific mutation in cancer and may
      stop tumors growing and multiplying.
