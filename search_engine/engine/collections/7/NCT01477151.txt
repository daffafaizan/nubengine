      cardiac surgery when compared to total intravenous anesthesia with propofol. However, there
      is no evidence to suggest that sevoflurane is superior to isoflurane for myocardial
      protection during cardiac surgery. Sevoflurane may potentially reduce the rate of
      post-cardiac surgery atrial fibrillation and the time to tracheal extubation compared to
      isoflurane, but the literature is equivocal on these two important outcomes.
      Anesthesiologists still frequently use isoflurane for maintenance of cardiac anesthesia, and
      this is likely because there is substantial uncertainty about whether or not sevoflurane is
      superior to isoflurane, given the lack of head-to-head RCTs. A large, prospective, pragmatic
      RCT can ultimately assist clinicians by providing evidence of the non-inferiority (or,
      possibly the superiority) of one anesthetic compared to the other on important patient
      outcomes such as ICU length of stay, mortality, renal dysfunction, time to tracheal
      extubation after cardiac surgery, rates of clinically-important atrial fibrillation, and
      myocardial damage.
