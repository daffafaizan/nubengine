      block are routine in modern anaesthesia, whereas monitoring of analgesia still requires
      further studies. Recently, the Surgical Pleth Index (SPI) was added as a surrogate variable
      showing the nociception-antinociception balance into abovementioned parameters constituting a
      novel approach in monitoring patients intraoperatively, known as adequacy of anaesthesia
      (AoA) or tailor-made anaesthesia.

      Different options of local anesthetic mixtures used for peribulbar block result in different
      analgetic potency. PBB is supposed to reduce requirement for intraoperative narcotic
      analgesics when used together with general anaesthesia and therefore may reduce the rate of
      PONV, OCR and perception of postoperative pain.

      The aim of the study is to investigate the influence of different PBBs on abovementioned
      outcomes.
