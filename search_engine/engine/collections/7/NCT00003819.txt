      hemocyanin (KLH) conjugate plus adjuvant QS21 that induces an antibody response in patients
      with prostate cancer. II. Determine the safety of the TF(c)-KLH conjugate prepared using an
      MBS heterobifunctional linker plus QS21. III. Assess postimmunization changes in prostate
      specific antigen levels and other objective parameters of disease in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive TF(c)-KLH conjugate with adjuvant
      QS21 subcutaneously weekly for 3 weeks, then once during weeks 7 and 19. Cohorts of 5
      patients each receive escalating doses of TF(c)-KLH vaccine until the optimal dose, based on
      antibody response, is reached. Patients are followed monthly for 6 months, then every 3
      months for 1 year.
