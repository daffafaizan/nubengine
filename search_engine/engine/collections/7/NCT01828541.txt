    
      This is a randomized, controlled study comparing two groups of subjects, those in the control
      (standard care) group and those in the experimental group (hypnosis).

      Control subjects will receive treatment as usual, which consists of a standardized protocol
      for treating post-burn itch. This protocol is based on past research and combines medications
      in a stepped approach that establishes therapeutic decisions based on clearly defined
      criteria.

      Subjects randomized to the experimental group will undergo four sessions of live hypnosis
      completed over a two month period. They will be provided with a Compact Disk (CD) of each
      session and instructed to listen to it daily. Post-hypnotic suggestions will address
      uncomfortable sensations, with additional suggestions for improved sleep and well-being.
      Subjects may be inpatient or outpatients.
