      patients with T2DM are still in a persistent state of poor glycemic control and unable to
      meet target goals. Inertia surrounding insulin initiation and titration is a specific
      problem. Various approaches have been proposed to help overcome clinical inertia, including
      support of patient self-management, and education for both physicians and people with
      diabetes. Presently, paper-based guides are available in which clinicians/educators rely on
      to help their patients in determining and recording appropriate insulin doses. Unfortunately,
      this process often sets the stage for reluctance and fear of insulin initiation and delays
      titration with implications for long-term poor self-management and adherence. Therefore,
      Sanofi developed the My Dose Coach electronic app to assist with optimizing titration of
      basal insulins and a clip-on insulin dose recording device for use with insulin pens that can
      capture a patient's insulin dose and time of injection and transmit it to My Dose Coach for
      proper insulin maintenance as part of Sanofi's Connected Ecosystem. The primary objective of
      this two phase study is to demonstrate that patients who are trained on the My Dose Coach app
      to titrate insulin will have greater improvements in hemoglobin A1c and will be more likely
      to achieve glycemic control at three months as compared to usual care practice, and those who
      do attain glycemic goals will be able to maintain glycemic control for an additional six
      months using the Connected Ecosystem. The secondary objective of this study is to examine the
      feasibility of integrating digital solutions into clinical workflow and user acceptability of
      My Dose Coach and the Connected Ecosystem.
