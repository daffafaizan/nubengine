      interventional prospective study of CX-4945 in patients with severe COVID-19. Up to
      approximately 40 patients will be enrolled into this study. A screening evaluation will occur
      within 7 days prior to Day 1. All qualified patients will be randomized at Day 1 in a ratio
      of 1:1 to one of the following two treatment arms:

      Arm A: SOC/ best supportive care in combination with CX-4945 1000 mg BID PO or Arm B: SOC/
      best supportive care alone The standard of care (SOC) is not pre-specified, may vary among
      patients, and may include agents with anti-viral activity, such as remdesivir, among others.
      Investigator discretion is to be applied for any established SOC. Active concomitant
      treatment with other investigational antivirals or immunomodulators are not permitted Best
      supportive care is defined as intensive care therapy according to current guidelines,
      evidence, and best practice, including but not limited to lung protective ventilation,
      thrombosis prophylaxis, renal replacement therapy when indicated, and access to advanced
      therapies including extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.

      The total duration of the treatment will be 14 days. Patients will be followed up at 28, 45
      and 60 days from the start of the treatment. The total duration for each patient in the study
      (including the screening) will be up to 67 days.
