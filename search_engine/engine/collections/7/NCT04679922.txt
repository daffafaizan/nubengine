    
      The aim of this, randomized clinical trial is to determine the clinical efficacy of fascia
      lata allograft in terms of peri-implant mucosal augmentation, as compared to autologous sub
      epithelial connective tissue graft, clinically and histologically in human adults .

      The hypothesis of the study is that a similar gain in peri implant mucosal thicknesses will
      be obtained in sites treated by either a sub epithelial connective tissue graft or a newly
      developed fascia lata allograft in clinically and histologically in human.

      The objective of this study will be to evaluate the efficacy of the peri-implant mucosal
      thickness enhancement following either subepithelial connective tissue grafts or human Fascia
      Lata Allograft placed simultaneously with dental implant placement.

      Sixteen sites that are indicated for peri-implant mucosal augmentation at the time of implant
      placement will be selected. Participants will be randomized to the control (simultaneous
      SCTGs) or test (simultaneous FLA) group.
