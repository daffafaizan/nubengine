    
      Description of treatment for Phase I:

        -  Patients will be offered, if medically indicated, tumor resection or needle aspiration
           of malignant effusion in order to make additional doses of DCVax-L vaccine.

        -  If subjects have not received DCVax-L vaccination within the last 3-4 weeks, and if
           DCVax-L is available, subjects have the option of receiving one dose of DCVax-L after
           enrolment, to boost the frequency of vaccine-primed T cells.

        -  Subjects will receive a single course of outpatient lymphodepleting chemotherapy with
           intravenous cyclophosphamide (300 mg/m2/d for 3 days) and intravenous fludarabine (30
           mg/m2/d for 3 days) both administered on days 8 to 10.

        -  Ex vivo CD3/CD28-costimulated lymphocytes will be infused ~2 days after last day of
           fludarabine infusion.

        -  Patients will receive DCVax-L vaccine ~24-48 hrs after T cell infusion.

        -  Subjects will be contacted every 6 months for 5 years for survival.

      Description of treatment for Phase II:

      In ARM-IIA:

        -  Patients will be offered, if medically indicated, tumor resection or needle aspiration
           of malignant effusion in order to make additional doses of DCVax-L vaccine.

        -  Subjects will receive intradermal vaccinations with DCVax-L every 8 weeks, for four
           cycles total. The first vaccine will be administered on day 0, which can be no sooner
           than 4 weeks from previous DCVax-L vaccination related to clinical study UPCC-11807.

        -  Subjects will receive oral cyclophosphamide at metronomic schedule and dose (50 mg
           daily) every other week, starting ~3 weeks after DCVax-L in every vaccine cycle.

        -  Patients will be offered (with the right to refuse) CT-guided needle biopsy or needle
           aspiration of malignant effusion after the second vaccine.

      In ARM-IIB:

        -  Patients will be offered, if medically indicated, tumor resection or needle aspiration
           of malignant effusion in order to make additional doses of DCVax-L vaccine.

        -  Subjects will undergo ~10-15 liter leukapheresis to derive vaccine-primed peripheral
           blood lymphocytes (PBL) on day 0. The apheresis material will be transferred to the Cell
           and Vaccine Facility at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn CVPF) for T cell
           manufacturing.

        -  If subjects have not received DCVax-L vaccination within the last 3-4 weeks, and if
           DCVax-L is available, subjects have the option of receiving one dose of DCVax-L after
           enrolment, to boost the frequency of vaccine-primed T cells.

        -  Subjects will receive a single course of outpatient lymphodepleting chemotherapy with
           intravenous cyclophosphamide (300 mg/m2/d for 3 days) and intravenous fludarabine (30
           mg/m2/d for 3 days).

        -  Ex vivo CD3/CD28-costimulated lymphocytes will be infused ~2 days after last day of
           fludarabine infusion.

        -  Patients will receive DCVax-L vaccine boosts every 8 weeks for a total of four vaccines.
           The first DCVax-L will be given ~24-48 hrs after T cell infusion.

        -  Following DCVax-L, subjects will receive oral cyclophosphamide at metronomic schedule
           and dose (50 mg daily) every other week x 3 cycles, starting ~3 weeks after DCVax-L in
           every vaccine cycle.

        -  Patients will be offered (with the right to refuse) CT-guided needle biopsy or needle
           aspiration of malignant effusion ~1-2 weeks after the second vaccine
