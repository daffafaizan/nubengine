      reduced dose-rate radiotherapy in the initial treatment of maximally safely resected
      glioblastoma. The primary endpoint will be progression-free survival at six months. Patients
      with pathologically confirmed GBM who are planned for six weeks of adjuvant chemoradiation
      followed by six to12 months of adjuvant chemotherapy will be screened and enrolled after
      surgery.
