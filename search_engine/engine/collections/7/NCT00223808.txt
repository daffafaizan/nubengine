      robot-assisted training to improve motor performance in patients with hemiplegia following
      stroke. These hypotheses will be tested: 1) subjects receiving robot-assisted upper limb
      therapy with MIME in the initial phase of recovery from stroke experience greater functional
      gains than a control group receiving additional conventional therapy of equal intensity and
      duration, 2) robot-assisted therapy results in a dose-dependent response, and 3)
      robot-assisted therapy promotes greater control of movement, greater recovery of strength,
      and greater reduction of co-contraction than the control intervention. Research Plan - A
      multi-site clinical trial is in progress at the Houston VA Medical Center (VAMC), the VA
      Greater Los Angeles Health Care System (GLAHCS), the VA Palo Alto Rehabilitation Research and
      Development Center (RR&DC), and the Central Texas Veterans Health Care System (CTVHCS).
      CTVHCS serves as the coordinating site. The RR&DC provides training and technical assistance
      for the other sites. Methods - Subjects with hemiparesis due to a stroke are randomly
      assigned to 3 groups. Group 1 receives 1 hour/day of robot-assisted upper limb therapy in
      addition to usual physical and occupational therapy. Group 2 receives a total of 2 hours/day
      of robot-assisted therapy. Group 3 receives 1 hour/day of additional upper limb therapy that
      includes exposure to, but no manipulation by the robot. Outcome measures include assessment
      of strength, motor control, functional status, and patient satisfaction at intake, discharge,
      6 and 12 months.
