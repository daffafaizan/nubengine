    
      Assessment of the antileukemic activity and toxicity of the FLAG-Ida regimen as a second
      induction course in patients with bad response to the first induction cycle and/or with a
      high risk karyotype.

      Optimization of the late consolidation therapy in standard risk patients (SR) by a
      prospective randomized trial comparing a high-dose cytarabine/daunorubicin (HD-Ara-C/DNR)
      based late consolidation therapy with an autologous peripheral blood stem cell
      transplantation (PBSCT)

      Assessment of the antileukemic activity of the different treatment elements by monitoring
      residual disease (MRD) after induction, early and late consolidation by Real-time PCR

      Assessment of the prognostic relevance of minimal residual disease by quantification of the
      residual leukemic burden in haematological remission by Real-time PCR during follow-up
