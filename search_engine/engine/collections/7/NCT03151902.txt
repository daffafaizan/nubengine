      amplified with random primer/ Amplification products will be pooled and sequenced/ After
      substruction of sequences of vertebrates and highly repetitive sequences, contiguous
      sequences will be assembled and compared with motifs represented in databases of viruses.
      which will enable identification of putative protein sequences consistent with viruses
