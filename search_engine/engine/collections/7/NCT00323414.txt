      chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA's) may be beneficial. This suggestion is
      based on three previously reported observations: first, patients with NASH consume less PUFAs
      and more saturated fats than subjects without NASH. Second, PUFAs are beneficial in patients
      with hypertension and hypertriglyceridemia. Third, PUFAs decrease lipid peroxidation and
      ameliorate hepatic steatosis in animal models of NAFLD.

      We therefore hypothesize that the administration of these PUFAs, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)
      and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) will reduce hepatic fat content, inflammation and hepatic
      injury in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who have NASH.

      Aims

      To determine in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who have NASH if dietary
      supplementation with purified omega-3 fatty acids (EPA and DHA) will:

        1. Decrease the histologic severity of NASH.

        2. Alter the expression of genes important in the pathways of hepatic lipid synthesis and
           oxidation.

      Study design:

      Patients who meet the inclusion criteria will be randomized to receive omega-3 fatty acids or
      placebo. Stratified randomization will be done based on the NASH Clinical Research Network
      pathology score of 5.
