      clinic, a tertiary care academic hospital, for two years. It will be double-arm, open label,
      randomized controlled trial comparing two different methods of medical therapy following ESS.
      The allocation ratio is intended to be approximately equal for each arm. The two arms
      consisted of: a control arm (group A) of generic saline irrigation alone, irrigating with 20
      mL per nostril tid for a total of 120 mL daily irrigation; and intervention arm (group B),
      which included generic N-Acetylcystine of 200 mg dissolved in 200 mL saline irrigated as per
      group A, 20 mL per nostril given tid daily (for a total of 120 mg). All medications will be
      used daily for the 3 months duration of the post-operative follow up. Patients will be
      instructed as to correct irrigation technique prior to discharge home from the hospital, and
      will be reminded of this technique at each postoperative clinic visit.
