      1, and ADME, and mass balance of TAK-906 after single oral administration in Period 2 in
      healthy adult male participants. Plasma and urine samples will be collected for PK
      determination; plasma, whole blood, urine, and feces samples will be collected for total
      radioactivity (TRA) determination; and plasma, urine, and feces samples will be collected to
      characterize the metabolite profiles of TAK-906.

      The study will enroll approximately 6 participants. The study is designed to consist of 2
      periods: Period 1 (ABA study period) and Period 2 (ADME study period). In Period 1 (ABA study
      period), all participants will receive single unlabeled oral 50 mg dose of TAK-906 as capsule
      followed by microdose of 100 mcg (approximately 1 mcCi) [14C]-TAK-906 as intravenous infusion
      followed by a washout period of at least 7 days before the dose in Period 2. In Period 2
      (ADME study period), all participants will receive a single dose of 50 mg (approximately 100
      mcCi) [14C]-TAK-906 as an oral solution.

      This single center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to
      participate in this study is approximately 65 days including screening period. Participants
      will be contacted approximately 30 days after the last dose of study drug for a follow-up
      assessment.
