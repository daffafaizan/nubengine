      Primary

        -  Compare the efficacy of palifermin vs placebo, in terms of burden of acute mucositis
           (defined to be 105 days [15 weeks] or less from the start of treatment), in patients
           with squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, or larynx
           undergoing concurrent radiotherapy and chemotherapy.

      Secondary

        -  Compare incidence and time to onset of Grades 3 or 4 oral mucositis in patients treated
           with these regimens.

        -  Compare overall and progression-free survival and time to second primary in patients
           treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients
      are stratified according to disease stage (III vs IVA or IVB), tumor site (oral cavity or
      oropharynx vs hypopharynx or larynx), and radiotherapy technique used on study
      (intensity-modulated radiotherapy [IMRT] vs 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy [3D-CRT]).
      Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      Mucositis, pain, and symptom burden are assessed at baseline, during radiotherapy, and post
      radiotherapy. Xerostomia is assessed at baseline, during radiotherapy, and several times
      after completion of study therapy.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically for 10 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 298 patients will be accrued for this study.
