      plasma insulin has been used as a surrogate marker but insulin levels often do not correlate
      well with beta cell mass and development of means to assess BCM would provide an important
      endpoint. For example, high-risk individuals could be monitored prior to onset of diabetes or
      patients could be monitored prospectively to determine the progression of their disease and
      response to therapy.

      Both Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) develop when there
      is impaired insulin production. The amount of insulin that can be produced, the amount of
      insulin producing beta cells in the pancreas and level of insulin and glucose in the blood
      are, however, imperfectly correlated. The development of a reliable method to noninvasively
      quantitate the beta cell mass (BCM) would be of great benefit by providing an important
      endpoint for the development of new treatments of T1DM and T2DM. The investigators have
      previously identified a specific marker on islet cells called vesicular monoamine transporter
      2 (VMAT2) that they now propose to use in positron emission tomography (PET) scanning to
      determine islet cell mass. This radioligand, [11C] Dihydrotetrabenazine (DTBZ), has been used
      previously in human subjects in clinical trials evaluating PET scanning of the brain in
      patients with bipolar illness and schizophrenia compared to healthy control subjects.
