    
      Single Ascending Dose: Three single ascending dose cohorts are planned. A total of 10
      subjects will be enrolled in each cohort and will be randomly assigned to receive a single
      oral dose of NKT (n=8) or a matching placebo (n=2). A Safety Review Team (SRT) will review
      all available safety data in a blinded manner following the completion of each cohort to
      determine the next dose level to be evaluated in the next cohort.

      Multiple Dose Cohort: A total of 10 subjects will be enrolled and will be randomly assigned
      to receive multiple oral doses of NKT (n=8) or a matching placebo (n=2) once daily for an
      adequate number of days to reach steady state (the number of days will be determined based on
      the half-life of NKT in Part A). The dose of NKT to be evaluated will be determined by the
      SRT.
