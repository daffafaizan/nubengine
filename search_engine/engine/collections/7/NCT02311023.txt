      treatment options. The classical ketogenic diet and its variants have been shown to help some
      of these people. However, these diets require significant medical and dietician
      supervision,and is frequently not well tolerated. There is a need to develop other diet
      therapy that is easier to administer and more acceptable to the patient. This trial
      undertaken in adult overweight UCLH outpatients examines the effect of an intermittent
      fasting diet on seizures. Subjects may consume their normal diet for 5 days a week. On 2 days
      in a week, they consume only 25% of their daily calorie requirement. Subjects will continue
      on the diet for 6 months. Intermittent fasting has been shown in animal studies to activate a
      number of signalling pathways which are thought to reduce seizure thresholds. Has
      intermittent fasting in humans might be expected to reduce seizures.
