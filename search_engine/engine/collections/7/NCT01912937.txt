      Catheter in the treatment of de-novo occluded/stenotic or re-occluded/ restenotic superficial
      femoral or popliteal arteries. The proposed clinical study will be a prospective,
      non-randomized, single arm, multi-center, pharmacokinetic study. The objective of the study
      is to describe the pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel in the blood delivered from the CVI
      Paclitaxel-coated PTA Catheter as a result of de novo occluded/restenotic or
      re-occluded/restenotic lesion(s).
