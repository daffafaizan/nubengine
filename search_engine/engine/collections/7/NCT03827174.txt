      with chronic pain.

      Return to work coordination means external and internal coordination regarding sick leave by
      help of a rehabilitation coordinator from health care. The goal is to establish a common
      return to work plan between employer and employee as dictated by Swedish law. The hypothesis
      is that return to work coordination is not sufficient. Additional effects on return to work
      and work ability from a behaviour change ability programme aiming to enhance work ability by
      targeting context at the workplace, physical and psychological functioning, and behavioral
      skills at work are expected.

      The hypothesis is tested in a randomised controlled trial. Before the start of the trial a
      series of 3-6 experimental single case studies will be performed to study the implementation
      of the interventions more thoroughly.
