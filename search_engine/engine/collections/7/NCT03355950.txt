      The investigators' ultimate goal is to draw a conclusion about the effect of the type of
      surgery on spermatic duct integrity. The investigators are going to collect serum samples
      from inguinal hernia patients before and after surgery. The investigators aim to assess the
      effect of surgery on antisperm antibody levels of patients who undergo Licthenstein and TEP
      repair. Preoperative antisperm antibody levels will serve as control levels for each patient
      group.
