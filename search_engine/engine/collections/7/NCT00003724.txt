      isolated pulmonary metastases treated with minimally invasive (video assisted) resection or
      open resection. II. Compare patterns of recurrence in these patients after these treatments,
      and determine what factors are predictive of recurrence. III. Describe and compare the
      complications and morbidity associated with minimally-invasive and open approaches to
      metastasectomy in these patients. IV. Test whether the patients undergoing video-assisted
      thoracic surgery will have a significantly better quality of life over a six month period
      than those undergoing an open resection.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified according to histology (sarcoma
      vs epithelial vs germ cell vs melanoma) and disease laterality. After spiral CT showing
      pulmonary nodules are amenable to video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) resection with
      curative intent, patients are randomized to undergo either open resection (thoracotomy,
      median sternotomy, or bilateral sternothoracotomy) (arm I) or minimally-invasive
      video-assisted resection (arm II). Patients with isolated recurrence in the chest should have
      the recurrence(s) resected if feasible. The original resection approach (open versus VATS)
      should be the preferred method for the second resection, but is not required. Quality of life
      is assessed prior to randomization and then at 30 days, 3 months, and 6 months. Patients are
      followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: There will be 530 patients accrued into this study in approximately 3
      years.
