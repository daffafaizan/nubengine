      patients were randomized to receive 10-day sequential therapy [rabeprazole (20 mg twice
      daily) plus amoxicillin (1 g twice daily) for the first 5 days, followed by rabeprazole (20
      mg), clarithromycin (500 mg) and tinidazole (500 mg, all twice daily for the remaining 5
      days] or standard 7-day therapy [corrected] [rabeprazole (20 mg), clarithromycin (500 mg) and
      amoxicillin (1 g), all twice daily]. H. pylori status was assessed by histology, rapid urease
      test and 13C-urea breath test at baseline and 6 weeks or more after completion of treatment.
