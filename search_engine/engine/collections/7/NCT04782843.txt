      to the experience of clinicians (16). It is very recent and therefore still little studied
      and little used. In particular, it has not been the subject of a prospective validation study
      for ICU patients.

      The use of this score is therefore not recommended in everyday practice.

      However, the literature shows a higher diagnostic value of the HEP score especially for
      resuscitation-type patients, as well as when used by an operator with little experience. This
      could be due to greater detail given in consideration of other causes of thrombocytopenia
      (17).

      The main objective of this work is to assess the intraoperator reproducibility in the
      calculation of the HEP score in a population of intensive care patients.

      The secondary objectives will aim to:

        -  Evaluate inter-operator reproducibility

        -  Determine if the reproducibility of the HEP score is influenced by:

      The patient's sex The type of heparin used (LMWH vs UFH) The severity of the patient (IGS2
      score) A history of cardiac or orthopedic surgery

      The expected consistent benefits allow validation of the HEP score in surgical intensive care
      (cf. EVHEP-TIH study).

      This would allow a better assessment of the pre-test probabilities of TIH with the
      performance of biological tests.
