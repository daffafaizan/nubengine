      single-agent dose-escalation phase Ia trial, the TL117 plus paclitaxel dose-escalation phase
      Ib trial, and the open label, multicenter phase 2 trial of TL117 plus paclitaxel.

      Adverse events and dose limiting toxicities will be assessed from the first dose of study
      drug though day 28. When the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of TL117 plus paclitaxel is
      determined, additional patients will be treated at the defined RP2D dose until occurrence of
      unacceptable toxicity, disease progression or withdrawal of consent or death.
