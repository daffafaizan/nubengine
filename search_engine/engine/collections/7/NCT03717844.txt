      Primary

        1. To create a Registry (to be called the PCD Registry) of PCD patients

        2. To have participating patients complete an assessment at enrollment and to repeat the
           assessment longitudinally over time.

      Secondary

        1. To gather information, including patterns of patient care, that would lend support for
           future research in the PCD population. Specific research questions would be explored
           within separate IRB-reviewed protocols.

        2. To bank blood samples for future research involving adults with PCD's, specifically
           examining p16INK4a and other markers to be specified in future, separate, IRB-approved
           protocols as specific research questions are identified.

      OUTLINE: Patients complete an assessment at baseline and then longitudinally over time which
      involves a multi-dimensional inter-disciplinary evaluation of a patient's functional status
      (ability to live independently at home and in the community), co-morbid medical conditions,
      cognition, psychological status, social functioning and support, medication review, and
      nutritional status. Patients' medical records are also reviewed.
