      I. To assess the objective response rate using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
      (RECIST) 1.1 criteria.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the progression-free survival (PFS). II. To assess the overall survival (OS).
      III. To correlate response and mutation load with PD-L1 status (5% and 1% cutoffs).

      IV. To assess clinical benefit (responses and stable disease lasting >= 6 months).

      V. To assess the response rate in mutation-defined subgroups, including subjects with >= 25
      mutations/mutational burden (MB) and >= 30 mutations/MB.

      VI. To correlate the type of mutations with response.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every
      2 weeks for up to 2 years (104 weeks) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 35 days and then every 3
      months for 2 years.
