      kinase inhibitors (TKIs) as well as 2nd-generation EGFR TKIs (overall response rates of
      0-8.7%). Osimertinib is an oral, potent, irreversible EGFR-TKI selective for sensitizing EGFR
      and EGFR T790M resistance mutations with a significant selectivity margin against wild-type
      EGFR. Osimertinib is potent with a wide therapeutic window in Ba/F3 cells with EGFR exon 20
      insertion mutations. Therefore, this study will be performed to investigate the efficacy of
      osimertinib in NSCLC patients with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutation
