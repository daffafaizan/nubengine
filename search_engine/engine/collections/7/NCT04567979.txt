      chemotherapy and radiotherapy unit at our center will be followed with a daily digital survey
      and optionally with biweekly PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2. People with symptoms and / or with a
      positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 will be notified and recommendations according to clinical
      state will be emitted.

      Hypothesis: COVID-19 infection rate among patients with solid tumors treated with
      chemotherapy and / or radiotherapy will be less than 5% during the pandemic period.
