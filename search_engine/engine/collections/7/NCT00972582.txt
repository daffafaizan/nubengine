      healthy young men by:

      A) Measuring leucine oxidation in response to short term (8 hr) graded excess leucine intake
      B) Correlating changes in leucine oxidation with changes in plasma concentrations of
      keto-isocaproic acid (KIC, the first breakdown product of leucine metabolism), other
      essential amino acids, ammonia, urea, creatinine, glucose, insulin, and electrolytes (sodium,
      potassium, chloride) to identify potential biomarkers C) Correlating changes in leucine
      oxidation with changes in urinary excretion of leucine and ketoisocaproic acid (KIC), urea
      and creatinine to identify potential biomarkers
