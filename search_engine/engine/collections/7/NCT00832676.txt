      RATIONALE

      Rheumatic diseases are a chronic, lifelong illness that results in significant pain,
      disability, and morbidity in the Canadian population (Perruccio, Power & Badley, 2006).
      Focusing on one aspect of rheumatic diseases, inflammatory arthritis has been associated not
      only with the aforementioned concerns, but also with an increased burden of care that affects
      not only patients, but extends its impact to include their family members, friends, and
      caregivers. Inflammatory arthritis is also associated with significant increases to
      healthcare budgets (Hunsche, Chancellor & Bruce, 2001). Care and management of these diseases
      are expected to be in high demand as the burden of illness is estimated to be on the rise
      (Perruccio, Power & Badley, 2006). The number of primary care providers and specialists is
      not sufficient to meet this anticipated increase, (Beaulieu et al., 2004; Glazier et al.,
      2003) and patients dealing with chronic diseases are increasingly required to self-manage
      their disease. This can be a stressful and daunting process for a newly diagnosed patient and
      may result in delayed decision-making and ultimately, delays in their disease treatment.

      While physician care is undeniably important in the management of inflammatory arthritis,
      educating patients with the knowledge and skills to self-manage their disease can be helpful
      with decision-making processes and reducing healthcare burden. For example, Lorig et al
      (2001) demonstrated that individuals who were better able to self-manage their illness
      experienced a significant improvement in health behaviours, self-efficacy, and health status,
      and had fewer visits to emergency departments. By equipping patients with strategies to cope
      and enhance personal health, they take on a more active role in the management of their
      disease and are able to take on health promoting activities with little supervision from
      healthcare professionals (Keysor et al., 2003). In fact, patient education in self-management
      has been identified as an arthritis best-practice and a key clinical practice guideline and
      (Combe et al., 2007; Holbrook, 2000; Jordan et al., 2003).

      Patient education can take many forms, but peer support interventions have been particularly
      effective in helping patients manage chronic diseases, including HIV, alcoholism and
      diabetes. Likewise, we hope to examine the benefits, challenges, and impact peer support can
      have on individuals living with inflammatory arthritis. A peer is someone who shares a common
      characteristic, such as age, gender, social economic status, education, religion, or in this
      case, status of disease (Doull et al., 2005). Peers have experiential knowledge of rheumatic
      disease, its management and care, and the social implications it has had in their lives.
      Within a healthcare context, they can provide assistance to individuals living with arthritis
      by providing support to their emotional, appraisal, and informational needs. Peers have the
      potential to influence health outcomes of other patients by addressing feelings of isolation
      and loneliness, promoting positive outlook and motivation, and providing information about
      behaviors that encourage health and well-being (Dennis, 2003). They can augment the services
      provided by healthcare professionals and can help individuals with inflammatory arthritis
      better cope and manage their illness. While peer support groups have been used to address
      many chronic diseases, their implementation amongst individuals with inflammatory arthritis
      has been limited. The effectiveness of such a program is dependent on the educational
      preferences and learning needs of its participants and this is a topic that requires
      examination and further assessment.

      PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVE

      This project addresses one subcomponent of a larger study in which the overall purpose is to
      explore the learning needs (informational needs, emotional needs, and appraisal needs) and
      the educational preferences of individuals with inflammatory arthritis. The impact of formal
      or informal peer support on individuals with rheumatic disease and the improvement of their
      health and well-being will also be examined with an emphasis on peer support from the
      perspective of patients living with the disease.

      This project will focus on soliciting perspectives of patients with inflammatory arthritis.
      To better understand the learning needs and potential impact of peer support strategies,
      including the context, circumstances, and processes involved in making peer support an
      effective intervention. This project, in particular, will examine:

        -  the perspective of individuals with inflammatory arthritis regarding disease management
           and educational needs

        -  what they feel are their emotional, informational, appraisal needs

        -  what specific feedback they are seeking related to peer support

        -  whether and how these needs change over the progression and duration of the disease
           course

      METHODOLOGY

      Qualitative examination of the aforementioned objectives will be carried out using focus
      groups.

      Study Design

      Eligible study participants will be divided into three focus groups of 6-8 participants each
      based on their disease duration:

        -  0-6 months

        -  Over 6 months - 2 years

        -  2 - 5 years

      Each focus group will be comprised of individuals with inflammatory disease of mixed age and
      gender. Focus group sessions will be held over several weeks and at a time convenient to the
      participants. This will be done in order to avoid conflicts with work and shift schedules.
      Informed, written consent will also be obtained from potential participants (Appendix 1 -
      Information Sheet and Appendix 2 - Consent Form).

      Two second-year medical student co-investigators and/or the study coordinator from the
      University of Toronto will be present at each focus group session. A semi-structured
      interview guide will be used (Appendix 3 - Interview Guide) with probes to prompt further
      discussion when appropriate. One medical student will conduct the focus group while the
      second student or study coordinator will keep a speaker log and take notes throughout the
      session. Each participant will be assigned a number and a record will be kept of the first
      phrase of each speaker. The speaker log will be used to aid in the analysis (i.e. to clarify
      if the view was expressed by a number of people or one person many times). During focus group
      discussions, only the first name of each participant will be used.

      Focus group sessions will run approximately 1 ½ - 2 hours in duration. After every session,
      each medical student/study coordinator will create field notes in which they will
      independently record their thoughts and impressions of the interview, non-verbal
      communication, and other conversations not recorded before or after the meeting. Each focus
      group session will also be recorded using a digital audio recorder and will be transcribed in
      whole or in part. Transcribed names will be removed, instead being replaced by their assigned
      speaker numbers.

      Subjects

      Potential focus group participants will have to meet all of the following criteria:

        -  Have a diagnosis of inflammatory arthritis from a physician

        -  Be able to participate in a 1 ½- 2 hour focus group session

        -  Be aged 18 years or older

        -  Be English-speaking

        -  Be able to get to the focus group session

      Recruitment and Consent Potential research participants will be identified through the
      Rheumatology clinics at the Sunnybrook Health Science Centre (SHSC). They will be approached
      by Dr. Mary Bell (Principal Investigator), staff Rheumatologist, who will introduce the study
      to eligible individuals and obtain their verbal consent to be contacted by the medical
      student co-investigator assigned to the project. The name of the individual will then be
      forwarded to the Office Manager who will schedule an interview at the Rheumatology clinic. At
      the interview, medical students will go over an information letter on the study and a consent
      form with each eligible patient to ensure that the potential research participant understands
      the study and what he/she is being asked to do. Once written consent is obtained, a copy will
      be provided to the participant. A confirmation letter (Appendix 4 - Confirmation Letter to
      Research Participants) with time and location of the interview/focus group will be mailed to
      the participant. The day before the interview is scheduled to take place the medical student
      will telephone the individual to remind them of the time and location of the interview using
      a Telephone Script (Appendix 5 - Telephone Script to Confirm Interview). At the beginning of
      the interview, prior to asking any questions, the medical student will obtain written consent
      and answer any further questions the participants may have.

      DATA ANALYSIS

      Transcripts will be analyzed using content analysis in order to systematically make
      inferences from text. Interview data will be imported into a NVIV0 8 qualitative software
      package and analyzed using a constant comparative method by the two research team members who
      were present at the focus group discussions. Medical students will be trained in qualitative
      content analysis. Interview data will be categorized into themes by each team member
      independently using an iterative coding scheme developed by the team. To ensure consistency
      in coding, the research team members who completed the focus group will frequently meet with
      the Principle Investigator and study coordinator to ensure consistency in coding and to
      verify the credibility of the codes. New codes will be added as themes arise from the data
      analysis. The individuals who conducted the focus group will independently code transcripts
      and subsequently meet compare results of the coding and agree upon their understanding of
      themes that emerged. By doing this cross-referencing, the rigor of the study will be
      increased. Modifications will be made to the interview guide with subsequent interviews to
      include new questions or probes that came up with prior focus group discussions. Field notes
      will also be used to inform the analysis.

      RISKS AND BENEFITS

      There are no known risks that may be associated with this study. Participants may become
      upset or emotional during the focus group session because the nature of the discussions will
      require open, honest sharing. The research team will make available a list of support groups
      and help-lines and reinforce that care of participants will not be affected in any way should
      an individual decide to withdraw from the study.

      These group discussions will benefit participants as they share and discover other
      individuals who can relate to their disease experiences. Individuals with arthritis in
      Ontario may indirectly benefit in the event that this research helps develop a peer support
      intervention for individuals with inflammatory arthritis that may be implemented as part of
      the patient care process. The results of this study may help validate the importance of
      support based on experiential knowledge in decision-making, health promotion, and education
      and may encourage the implementation of peer support groups among individuals living with
      inflammatory arthritis.

      PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY

      Only the Principal Investigator, Office Manager and the medical students/study coordinator
      who conduct the focus group sessions will be aware of the identity of participants. All data
      collection forms will have identifying information removed and replaced with a unique
      identifying number. A list of participant names, addresses, and phone numbers will be kept on
      a password protected computer on a secure server in a locked research room at the
      rheumatology clinic at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre to be accessed only by the Principle
      Investigator and research team involved in this study. Names or other identifying information
      will not be used in any publications, reports, or presentations and will not be passed on to
      anyone else outside of the research team for this study. All information collected during the
      focus group sessions will be kept confidential. Hard copies of data and will be locked in a
      research room at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre for storage for 25 years before being
      destroyed. All electronic data files (i.e., audiofiles, transcripts) will be stored on a
      password protected computer on a secure server in a locked office at the Sunnybrook Health
      Sciences Centre rheumatology clinic. A confidentiality agreement will be signed by the study
      coordinator and all second year medical students involved with the study.

      COMMUNICATION OF RESULTS

      In terms of reporting study results, a written report will be created and sent to any
      participants involved in the study upon their request. A copy will also be submitted to the
      University of Toronto DOCH-2 Course Coordinator and the results of this study may also be
      shared with scientific publications, conferences, and presentations.
