    
      The drug being tested in this study is called vedolizumab SC. The study will assess the PK,
      and variability of a vedolizumab SC in a PFS versus an investigational device.

      This study will include 2 different device delivery presentations in 2 treatment groups.
      Participants in each treatment group will be randomized to one of the three administration
      sites: Abdomen, thigh, or arm. The study will enroll approximately 102 participants,
      including 17 participants allocated to each administration site within each treatment group.
      Participants will be randomly assigned (per randomization schedule) to one of the two
      treatment groups:

        -  Group A: Vedolizumab SC PFS

        -  Group B: Vedolizumab SC Investigational Device

      All participants will receive a single dose of study drug on Day 1.

      This single center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to
      participate in this study is approximately 196 days. Participants will be contacted by
      telephone on Day 168 after their last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment which
      will involve the progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) questionnaire survey.
