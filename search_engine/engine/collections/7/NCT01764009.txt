      patients suffering from advanced or metastatic melanoma will be electrotransferred increasing
      doses of Plasmid AMEP into muscle. Treatment will be repeated every 28 days until progression
      or limiting toxicity.

      Consecutive cohorts of 3 to 6 patients will be treated with increasing doses of Plasmid AMEP
      at three dose levels: 0.25 mg, 1 mg and 4 mg according to an adapted 3+3 design. There will
      be no intra-patient dose escalation.
