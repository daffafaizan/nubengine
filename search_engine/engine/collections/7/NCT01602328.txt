      evidence of AKI within 48 hrs of removal from cardiopulmonary bypass. Subjects will be
      randomly assigned (1:1 ratio) to treatment with a single administration of AC607 or placebo
      (approximately 100 subjects per group).

      Safety and efficacy assessments will be performed daily during the post-operative hospital
      stay from the day randomized into the study until discharge, at 30 days, and at 90 days after
      study drug administration (evaluation phase). Safety and long-term clinical outcomes will be
      assessed at 6, 12, 24 and 36 months (long-term follow-up phase).
