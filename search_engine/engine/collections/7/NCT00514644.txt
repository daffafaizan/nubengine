      carotid arteries with carotid duplex-ultrasound. The prevalence of carotid stenoses > 50%
      (According to the NASCET criteria) in this group is the primary result of interest, answering
      the most fundamental question - should persons with calcifications in the area of the carotid
      arteries seen on panorama be screened with ultrasound in order to find asymptomatic carotid
      stenoses? Since the publication of the ACST and the ACAS studies it is clear that some of
      these patients might have indications for surgery.

      A second part of the study aims to more fully understand what it is that the panorama
      examination reveals. In this part will 100 patients that are going to undergo surgery to
      remove their carotid stenoses will be examined with panorama. The carotid plaque that is
      removed during the surgery will be examined radiologically.

      Primary endpoint:

        -  Subpopulation prevalence of carotid stenoses > 50% in persons with calcifications in the
           area of the carotid arteries seen in a panoramic examination.

      Secondary endpoints:

        -  Statistical data (sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, likelihood ratio and predictive
           values) for panorama to find carotid stenoses with ultrasound as gold standard.

        -  Qualitative description of the relationship between panoramic calcification images and
           the removed carotid plaques.

      AMENDMENT JUNE 2011: The different arms of the study will be published seperately.
