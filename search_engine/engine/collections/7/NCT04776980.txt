    
      This is a pilot study in subjects with a new diagnosis of high-grade glioma based on classic
      MRI appearance who are considered surgical candidates and patients with histologically proven
      diagnosis of glioblastoma (GB) who have completed chemoradiation and now have new
      contrast-enhancing lesions or lesions showing increased enhancement ( 25% increase) who are
      recommended for a clinical surgical resection. Subjects may participate in this study if they
      are at least 18 years of age, most participants will be receiving care at the clinical
      practices of the University of Pennsylvania. Subjects who come to the University of
      Pennsylvania for diagnosis and/or treatment of GB and who meet the study inclusion criteria
      may be approached by study personnel for recruitment into this study. Subjects will be
      approached about study participation regardless of race or ethnic background. Investigators
      anticipate enrolling up to 30 participants. Subjects who consent but do not complete the
      study imaging will be considered not evaluable and will be replaced. Accrual will likely
      occur over approximately 2 years. After undergoing screening assessments and verifying
      eligibility for study participation subjects will undergo a research ferumoxytol-enhanced MRI
      of the brain and blood draws for liquid biopsy.
