      Titration Phase, an 8-week Maintenance Phase, a 1-week De-escalation Phase, and a 2-week
      Safety Follow-Up Phase. If subjects met the eligibility criteria, they were randomized to
      receive rotigotine 4 mg/24 hrs, rotigotine 8 mg/24 hrs, or placebo during the Maintenance
      Phase. During the 4-week Titration Phase, subjects assigned to rotigotine were titrated at
      weekly intervals of 2 mg/24 hrs until they reached 4 mg/24 hrs or 8 mg/24 hrs. All subjects
      who completed the 4-week Titration Phase entered an 8-week Maintenance Phase and were
      maintained at their randomized dose (rotigotine 4 mg/24 hrs, rotigotine 8 mg/24 hrs, or
      placebo). No dose adjustment was allowed during the Maintenance Phase. The Treatment Phase
      was defined as the combined Titration and Maintenance Phases.
