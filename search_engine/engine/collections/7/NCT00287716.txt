    
      This is a Phase 3, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, three-arm, safety and
      efficacy study of pirfenidone in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Approximately
      400 patients at approximately 70 centers will be randomly assigned (2:2:1) to receive either
      2403 milligrams (mg) of pirfenidone, placebo equivalent, or 1197 mg of pirfenidone
      administered in divided doses three times per day (TID) with food. Patients will be
      randomized by geographic region.

      Patients will receive blinded study treatment from the time of randomization until the last
      patient randomized has been treated for 72 weeks. A Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will
      periodically review safety and efficacy data to ensure patient safety.

      After week 72, patients who meet the Progression of Disease (POD) definition, which is a ≥
      10% absolute decrease in percent predicted FVC or a ≥ 15% absolute decrease in percent
      predicted carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (DLco), will be eligible to receive permitted
      IPF therapies in addition to their blinded study drug. Permitted IPF therapies include
      corticosteroids, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide and N-acetyl-cysteine (with restrictions).
