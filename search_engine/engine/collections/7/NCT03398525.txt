      Computer-generated randomization with 1:1 allocation ratio will be stratified by the site of
      catheter insertion (superior vena cava or femoral), and by the ventilatory status (patient
      mechanically ventilated or not). Block size, not known by the investigators, of 4 or 6 will
      be used. Randomization group for each patient will be kept concealed into sealed opaque
      envelops until inclusion once consent obtained.

      Anxiety, the primary outcome measure, and pain related to the catheter insertion will be
      assessed using two distinct Visual Analogic Scales.

      In the usual care group, the catheter will be inserted using the Seldinger method, under
      local anesthesia with 2% lidocaine, with ultrasound guidance, after proper skin antisepsis,
      surgical operator's hand washing and antisepsis, and use of sterile drapes, gowns and gloves.

      In the intervention group, in addition to the usual care procedures as described above, a
      musical U-shaped session will be delivered to the patient through headphones, using a tablet
      computer and the "MUSIC CARE" music program, a validated program for use in health care.
