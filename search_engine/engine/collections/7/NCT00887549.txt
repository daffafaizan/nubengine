      pemetrexed and cisplatin (with each injection approximately 3 weeks apart). Patients who
      complete 4 such injections and respond well to their treatment may continue to receive an
      injection of chemotherapy drug pemetrexed (approximately every 3 weeks). In general terms,
      treatment will last until either the patient or the doctor decides that there is no clear
      benefit in continuing with the treatment.

      TS levels will be measured from the tumour sample used to make the original diagnosis of
      NSCLC.
