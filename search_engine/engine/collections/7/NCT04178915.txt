    
      -  To study the state of the immune system in patients with severe bacterial infections (on
           the model of pneumonia, infective endocarditis, sepsis): spontaneous and stimulated
           production of reactive oxygen species by blood neutrophils; spontaneous necroptosis,
           apoptosis and pyroptosis of neutrophils; the content of blood leukocyte subpopulations.

        -  Assess the clinical, biochemical status, state of the lipid transport system of patients
           with severe bacterial infections (in the model of pneumonia, infective endocarditis,
           sepsis), including determination of the cholesterol content in the cell membrane of
           T-cells and monocytes.

        -  To develop a method for predicting an unfavorable course and an algorithm for the
           treatment (immunocorrection) of severe bacterial infections (on the model of pneumonia,
           infectious endocarditis, sepsis) based on the determination of the clinical and
           immunological status, indicators of the lipid transport system and dysmetabolic
           disorders, and propose a correction method for the treatment of these diseases,
           supplementing existing clinical protocols (preparations of immunoglobulins, lipids for
           parenteral nutrition, possibly PCSK9 inhibitors).
