    
      This double-blind (investigator-surgeon-patient blinded), randomized, placebo control,
      multicentre, international, pragmatic, non-inferiority trial is designed to to provide
      evidence of the Dexamethasone safety profile with regard to the risk of post-tonsillectomy
      bleeding in children when administered as a single intraoperative dose of 0.15mg/kg. The
      study is also aimed at characterizing whether the co-administration of non steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs for analgesia potentiates the risk of postoperative haemorrhage.

      Sample size estimation is based on the definition of a minimal clinically important
      difference between the 2 groups of treatment (dexamethasone or normal saline) to be equal to
      2% (non-inferiority margin). Thus, 3'794 children in total will be included with 1'897
      children in each treatment group.

      The follow-up will be performed by the parents via an "Application" for Android and Apple
      that has been developed specifically for this study.
