      is a telephone contact from the study secretariate where the person can ask for more detailed
      information and put questions to the reserach nurse. The call leads up to a question to the
      person, if the questionnaire can be sent. If yes, the questionnaire is posted includeing the
      consent form and an pre-paid return envelope. After two weeks a thank you/reminder letter is
      sent out, and if no reply one more phone call is made two weeks further on.
