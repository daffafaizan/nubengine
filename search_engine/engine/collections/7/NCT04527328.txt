      who have cognitive impairment will be randomly assigned to receive AKST1210 or control during
      each hemodialysis session for 3 months. The primary objective is to assess the safety and
      tolerability of AKST1210, and secondary objectives include changes in cognitive assessments
      as well as the feasibility of using AKST1210 in this setting.
