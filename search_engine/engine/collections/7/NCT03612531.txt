      I. To determine the feasibility and safety of manual therapy for treatment of
      fibrosis-related dysphagia in head and neck cancer survivors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I.To estimate effect size, dose-response (number of treatment sessions to normalized cervical
      range of motion), and durability of manual therapy for improving cervical range of motion in
      head and neck cancer survivors with fibrosis-related late dysphagia.

      II. To examine functional outcomes after manual therapy in head and neck cancer survivors
      with fibrosis-related late effects and their association with change in dysphagia grade,
      cervical extension, and other cofactors.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants receive 10 manual therapy sessions performed by a speech pathologist during
      weeks 1-6. After completion of 6 weeks of therapy, participants perform manual therapy at
      home daily for 6 weeks.
