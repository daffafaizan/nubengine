      needle to make them hurt less and be less scary. However, this advice is not backed up by
      experimental research evidence. It is possible that looking away acts as a distraction and
      takes attention away from the needle, thus reducing pain. However, it is also possible that
      looking at the needle is better because it prevents people's imaginations from making them
      think it is worse than it actually is. To our knowledge, this is the first first randomized
      study to examine the effect of looking away vs. looking at the needle on pain and fear
      experienced during vaccinations. Adult university students undergoing routine flu vaccination
      will be included.
