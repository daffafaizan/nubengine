      enrollment, participants will take 5 mg of linagliptin once a day for one week of run-in
      period (Day 1 to Day 7). Randomization will be done on Day 8 to assign the participants to
      either mosapride arm or placebo arm. If a subject is assigned to mosapride arm, mixed meal
      tolerance test (MMTT) will be performed after taking mosapride with linagliptin. If a subject
      is assigned to placebo arm, he/she will take placebo instead of mosapride before MMTT. On Day
      9, all subjects will be crossed over to the other arm and MMTT will proceed with medication
      depending on their arms. Gastric emptying time measurement with paracetamol will be done
      along with MMTT. Plasma incretin hormone levels in two arms will be compared.
