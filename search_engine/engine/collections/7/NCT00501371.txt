    
      For MCS-2 This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel study where
      eligible male subjects (age 40, N=188), after a two-week washout period, will be randomized
      at 1:1 ratio to receive either MCS 30 mg/day or placebo for 12 weeks.

      Group A: MCS 30 mg/day for 12 weeks Group B: placebo for 12 weeks

      Subjects are limited to those who are currently not being treated medically for BPH or LUTS
      with alpha-blockers, anti-cholinergics, 5-alpha reductase inhibitors, or hormonal therapeutic
      agents. For each treatment arm, about 85 subjects eligible for final per protocol analysis
      will be recruited. Concerning an expected dropout rate of 10%, 188 subjects in total will be
      recruited onto the study.

      For MCS-3 This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, add-on, parallel study
      where eligible male subjects (age 40, N=242), after a two-week washout period, will be
      randomized at 1:1 ratio to receive either MCS 30 mg/day plus alpha-blocker or placebo plus
      alpha-blocker for 12 weeks.

      Group A: alpha-blocker plus MCS 30 mg/day Group B: alpha-blocker plus placebo

      Subjects are limited to those who are currently not being treated medically for BPH or LUTS
      with anti-cholinergics, 5-alpha reductase inhibitors, or hormonal therapeutic agents. For
      each treatment arm, about 220 subjects eligible for final per protocol analysis will be
      recruited. Concerning an expected dropout rate of 10%, 242 subjects in total will be
      recruited onto the study.

      All participating subjects will be advised to maintain a normal diet as they do before
      joining the study. However, participating subjects are advised to refrain from extra source
      of carotenoids supplementation and MCS extracts made into a capsule, soft gel, or crude
      granule extracts.
