      registry designed to evaluate pregnancy outcomes in women with multiple sclerosis (MS) who
      were exposed to a Registry-specified Biogen Multiple Sclerosis product during the eligibility
      window for that product. Women of childbearing potential are a considerable segment of the
      patient population affected by MS and are likely to be exposed to a Registry-specified Biogen
      MS product around the time of conception and during pregnancy. Biogen completed pregnancy
      registries for Avonex and Tysabri; however, formal studies in pregnant women have not been
      conducted. Therefore, it is important to evaluate, in a global Pregnancy Registry, how
      exposure to a marketed Biogen MS product specified in this Pregnancy Registry may affect
      pregnancy and infant outcomes. Data will be collected on prospective pregnancies (i.e.
      enrollment prior to knowledge of outcome) at time of enrollment, 6 to 7 months gestation, and
      approximately 4,12, and 52 weeks after estimated date of delivery. The prevalence of
      spontaneous abortions, birth defects, and other pregnancy and infant outcomes will be
      calculated and compared to background rates from external sources such as the European
      Surveillance of Congenital Anomalies.
