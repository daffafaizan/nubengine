      to prevent post-spinal hypotension in CS in 95 % of our patients. The study will be conducted
      in a randomized double-blinded fashion. This dose-response study will be conducted as per the
      up-down sequential allocation method, modified by the Narayana rule, designed to cluster the
      results around the ED95.

      Blood pressure will be monitored every minute from intrathecal injection to the delivery of
      the child. Phenylephrine will be administered every time the blood pressure is equal to or
      lower than the control value.Hypotension will be defined as a SBP less than 80 % of the
      baseline value, in which case the treatment will be a failure. Hypertension will be defined
      as a SBP more than 120 % of baseline value. If a patient presents hypertension for two
      consecutive measurements, the case will be considered a drop out.An adequate response will be
      defined as the absence of hypotension or nausea/vomiting during the period from induction of
      spinal anesthesia to uterine incision prior to fetal delivery.

      The results of this study will define the minimum effective dose of phenylephrine to prevent
      post-spinal hypotension and nausea/vomiting secondary to hypotension in Cesarean section,
      thus optimizing the safety profile with respect to maternal and fetal side effects of this
      vasopressor.
