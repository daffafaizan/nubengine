      collect blood samples and skin lesion biopsy at significant time points in patients who
      present a skin lesion. The intervention in this study is limited to some blood samples and
      skin biopsies.

      Two 7 mL tubes of blood will be collected at consultant time for essentially serological test
      for the SARS-CoV-2 and for analysing certain populations of white blood cells. The second
      additional blood sample of 7 mL will be collected around day 15 after inclusion in a dry tube
      to perform a serological test for SARS-CoV-2 at a distance from the onset of skin signs.

      A biopsy for histological study is usually done in patients with acrosyndrome. This is why
      this type of biopsy will be done as a routine care of these patients. An immunohistochemical
      study could complete the histological explorations using an anti-coronavirus antibody if
      arguments in favour of SARS-CoV-2 are demonstrated. In this study, patients who accept and
      sign informed consent will be proposed a skin biopsy on a characteristic lesion for freezing.
      This biopsy can be used for transcriptomic analysis. This may allow a better understanding of
      the mechanisms of the disease.
