      2013, the WHO Essential Regulatory Laboratories prepared candidate vaccine viruses and
      reagents for further development and several manufacturers have developed various inactivated
      influenza vaccines with and without adjuvant against A/H7N9 and tested these candidates in
      trials in healthy adults. The overall aim of this study is to evaluate the safety,
      immunogenicity and dose sparing effects of H7N9 influenza antigen produced by Butantan
      Institute in combination with 2 different adjuvants.
