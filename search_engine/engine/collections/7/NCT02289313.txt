      and behaviors related to nutrition and physical activity among 200 ALC students.
      Investigators will also conduct 6 gender stratified (3 boys, 3 girls) focus groups with
      students (n=24), up to 3 focus groups with their parents (n=24) and one focus group with
      staff and volunteers in order to understand perceived barriers towards healthy
      weight/nutrition/physical activity. Investigators will then utilize this information to
      co-develop a healthy living program at ALC. Investigators will finally test the feasibility
      of the program they develop over a period of 3 months in ALC students. Study findings will
      inform further research to test the efficacy and validity of the program developed at ALC in
      a subsequent school based trial with the future goal of obtaining funding for cluster
      randomized controlled trials among other schools in the region.
