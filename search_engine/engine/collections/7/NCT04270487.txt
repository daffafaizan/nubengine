    
      A randomized controlled trial (Phase IV trial) to evaluate the short-term efficacy and
      long-term health economic impact of a dietary intervention compared to pharmacotherapy with a
      musculotropic spasmolytic (otilonium bromide) agent for 470 newly diagnosed or newly treated
      irritable bowel syndrome patients in primary care.

      The primary objective of this trial is to study treatment efficacy (IBS-SSS responder rate)
      with diet versus medication after 8 weeks of therapy.

      The secondary endpoint is to study the quality of life and health economic impact over six
      months after the start of the initial treatment with diet versus medication.

      Finally, patient satisfaction during and after the different treatment modalities, HRU and
      WPAI-IBS score in subgroups according to IBS stool pattern subtype, faecal microbiota and
      serotonin synthesis genetic polymorphisms will also be investigated
