      randomize primary care clinics to three arms-a control condition and two alternative modes of
      delivery of the NIAAA Clinician's Guide to Alcohol Screening, Brief Intervention, and
      Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) in primary care settings. In the Primary Care Physician or
      "PCP" arm, PCPs will be trained on the SBIRT protocols outlined in the NIAAA Clinicians'
      Guide and conduct brief intervention and referrals as needed. In the Non-Physician Provider
      or "NPP" arm, Medical Assistants will be trained to use the NIAAA screener and enter the
      results in the Electronic Medical Record, and NPPs (e.g., Behavioral Medicine Specialists,
      Clinical Nurses and Health Educators) will conduct brief intervention and referral
      activities. The SBIRT content, based on the NIAAA Guide, is the same in both the NPP and PCP
      arms; we compare delivery by the two types of providers and versus the control condition, in
      which providers and staff will not receive any training on SBIRT protocols. We examine
      implementation outcomes: rates of screening, brief intervention, follow-up screening and
      brief intervention, referral to Chemical Dependency treatment, and alcohol use disorders
      medication rates. We also include, as secondary analyses, an effectiveness study examining
      patient outcomes by study arm.
