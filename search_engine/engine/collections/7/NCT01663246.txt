      radiation, is usually permanent and is the most frequent reason for reduced quality of life
      in these patients. The loss of antimicrobial, buffering, cleansing and remineralizing effects
      of saliva markedly increases the risk for dental caries. Extractions of diseased teeth
      located in irradiated bone and dental infection involving the bone can trigger
      osteoradionecrosis (ORN), another serious complication of high dose radiation of the jaws.
      Therefore, current dental treatment guidelines recommend the extraction of diseased teeth and
      any teeth that might require extraction in the future, before radiation therapy. (NCI, 1990;
      Rankin et al, 2003; NIDCR, 2005) As a result, patients with head and neck cancer often have
      many or all teeth extracted, especially those patients who are judged unlikely to comply with
      lifelong, daily topical fluoride, oral hygiene practices and frequent professional dental
      care. (Bruins et al, 1999)
