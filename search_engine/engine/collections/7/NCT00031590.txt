        -  By giving reduced dose craniospinal radiation followed by nine cycles of maintenance
           chemotherapy comprised of alternating cycles of lomustine, cisplatin, and vincristine
           alternating with cyclophosphamide and etoposide, we will reduce the late effects of
           higher dose radiation in children while maintaining the therapeutic efficacy (86% 3-year
           relapse-free survival) of current standard therapy

        -  To evaluate the late neurotoxic effects of low-dose craniospinal radiotherapy, in terms
           of cognitive, endocrinologic, and auditory function, in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multi center study of reduced dose craniospinal radiotherapy and
      chemotherapy in patients ages 3 - 30 years with newly diagnosed average risk medulloblastoma.

        -  Induction chemoradiotherapy: Beginning within 28 days after complete surgical resection,
           patients undergo radiotherapy to the craniospinal axis (1800 centigray (cGy)) followed
           by conformal radiotherapy to the tumor bed (5400 cGy). Patients receive vincristine
           weekly for 6 weeks.

        -  Maintenance chemotherapy: Beginning 4 weeks after the completion of craniospinal
           radiation therapy, patients receive two 6-week courses of regimen A as outlined below
           alternating with one 6-week course of regimen B for a total of 9 courses (AABAABAAB).

             -  Regimen A: Patients receive oral lomustine and cisplatin on day 0 and vincristine
                on days 0, 7, and 14.

             -  Regimen B: Patients receive cyclophosphamide on days 0 and 1 and etoposide
                intravenous (IV) on days 0 and 1, followed by oral etoposide on days 14-34.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and then
      annually thereafter with surveillance neuroimaging using Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan (MRI
      scan) and clinical examination.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.
