      are coupled with different components of LV function. The regional ventriculo-arterial
      couplings may be important in the pathogenesis of heart failure and ventricular remodeling,
      and in the prediction of future cardiovascular events. Therapies targeting these may play a
      role in the prevention and treatment of heart failure. Therefore, we will study at least 120
      patients with chronic heart failure (NYHA Class II-IV) who will randomly receive a direct
      renin inhibitor, aliskiren, or a placebo for 6 months on top of standard therapy.
