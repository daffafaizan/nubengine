    
      This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, combined single and multiple
      ascending dose (SAD and MAD) trial. Up to one hundred fifty two (152) subjects aged 18-55,
      who fulfill the inclusion/exclusion criteria, may be enrolled in this study. Up to a total of
      17 SAD and 2 MAD cohorts of eight subjects each will be examined. Subjects in each cohort
      will be randomized 3:1 to receive SPR994 at doses ranging from 100 mg to 900 mg or placebo in
      various immediate and timed release formulations. One SAD control cohort, Cohort 12, may be
      enrolled in which eight subjects will receive a single dose of OrapenemÂ® at 300 mg in a fed
      and fasted state. Dosing is complete in SAD Cohorts 1-3, 6 and 7. Subjects in Cohorts 1-3
      received a single dose of SPR994 and subjects in food effect Cohorts 6 and 7 each received 2
      doses. Subjects enrolled in SAD Cohorts 8 and beyond will receive a single dose of SPR994 or
      placebo in a fasted state and a second dose following a standardized meal to investigate food
      effect on the pharmacokinetics of SPR994 and TBPM. SAD Cohorts 8 through 10 may run in a
      staggered or concurrent manner before enrollment of further cohorts. Blinded pharmacokinetic
      data will be reviewed at the conclusion of Cohort 10 (300 mg fasted & fed). Should the PK be
      optimized in one of the various time released formulations, the Sponsor may decide to proceed
      to enrollment of the 600 mg Cohorts using the optimal formulation; other timed release
      formulations may also be explored at 300 mg dose in a staggered or concurrent manner until an
      optimal formulation(s) is identified. When an optimal formulation(s) is identified, the 600
      mg Cohorts may run in a staggered or concurrent manner. SAD Cohorts 16 (100 mg fasted) and 17
      (900 mg fasted) may run prior to or in a staggered or concurrent manner with MAD Cohorts 4
      (300 mg) and 5 (600 mg). During the MAD part of the study, subjects will receive 27 doses of
      SPR994 or placebo over a period of 14 days. Based on the observed PK of SPR994 in prior
      cohorts, the total number of doses may be increased to 40 doses of SPR994 or placebo
      administered TID over 14 days; only one dose will be administered on Day 14 to allow for PK
      sample collection In both SAD and MAD parts of the study, the Cohorts will be exposed to
      increasing doses of SPR994. Each part (SAD and MAD) of the study will consist of 3 periods: a
      screening period, a treatment period, and a follow-up period. The safety and tolerability of
      SPR994 will be assessed based on the types and frequency of adverse events (AEs) reported;
      concomitant medication usage; and changes from baseline in physical examination, weight,
      vital signs, ECG, and standard clinical laboratory tests. A Safety Management Group (SMG)
      will review the data of cohorts prior to escalating to the next dose level.
