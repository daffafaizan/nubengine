      pilot of Purposeful Parenting in three Boston-based health centers to optimize quality and
      logistical details. Phase II (months 5-36) will determine, with a parallel group randomized
      controlled trial (RCT), whether delivering Purposeful Parenting leads to increased responsive
      parenting at the intervention's conclusion (in intervention vs control parents), assessed
      using a validated observational measure. The investigators will enroll 260 low-income
      families with a full term newborn infant who present for well-child care. Families randomized
      to the control group will receive usual anticipatory guidance at each well-child visit in the
      first 12 months of life. Families randomized to the intervention group will receive usual
      anticipatory guidance plus Purposeful Parenting. As secondary outcomes, the investigators
      will explore the degree to which Purposeful Parenting (in intervention vs control parents)
      increases parental knowledge about responsive parenting and child development, reduces
      parenting stress and improves perceptions of parenting self-efficacy (via validated parental
      self-report measures) at the conclusion of the intervention. Investigators will explore
      potential differences by study group in child SEL development at the conclusion of the
      intervention. In addition, investigators will examine differences in the above listed
      outcomes are 6 months following the intervention. The RCT will include the collection of
      process level data including cost.
