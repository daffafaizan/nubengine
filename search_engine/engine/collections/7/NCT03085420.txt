        -  If heart arrhythmias are more common in children with a large burn injury than in
           children with a small burn injury.

        -  The difference in development of a heart arrhythmia after a large burn injury by
           comparing information from children with large burns who do and do not develop a heart
           arrhythmia.

        -  A better understanding of the length of a hospital stay, the number of operations, and
           the number of care complications in patients with heart arrhythmias after a burn injury.
