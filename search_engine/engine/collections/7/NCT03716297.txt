      participants to measure mental, social and physical health. In addition, Sensewear bracelets
      will be used during the PE lessons of the participants to collect data (MET's and number of
      steps).

      Three short questionnaires will be taken from the boys which measure the mental, social and
      physical health. Completing these questionnaires will take no longer than 10 minutes in
      total. The questionnaires will be filled in once by each participating individual at the
      start of the PE lesson.

      During the PE class, the participants will receive a Sensewear bracelet in which the number
      of METs and the number of steps during the effort are measured. A distinction will also be
      made between the various sports during the PE lesson. Each participant will have to wear the
      Sensewear bracelet once during a single PE lesson.

      It is an open research in which the participants are fully informed. The participants can
      voluntarily choose whether or not to participate in the study. The quantitative data
      collected from the questionnaires and Sensewear bracelets will then be used for de-finitive
      interpretation and decision making.
