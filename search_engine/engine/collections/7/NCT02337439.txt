      population. The disability of schizophrenia is due in large part to the effects of the
      illness on cognitive faculties. Current medications for schizophrenia do not generally
      improve cognition, so a major contribution to disability remains undertreated. Computerized
      cognitive remediation programs, which produce activity-dependent recruitment of neural
      resources to specifically enhance under-functioning brain systems, have been effective at
      improving both cognition and community functioning in patients with schizophrenia, but the
      effects are still modest. Our preliminary work has suggested that our training is associated
      with improvements in visual memory, though visual memory has been a cognitive area more
      refractory to cognitive training.

      In this study, participants with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder will be randomized
      to receive different computer exercises to help determine whether computer exercises can
      improve memory in schizophrenia, and whether the cognitive training is associated with
      changes in neural activity.
