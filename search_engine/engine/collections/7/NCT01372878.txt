      Platform with the PillCam COLON 2 capsule as demonstrated by the identification of subjects
      with polyps, compared to optical colonoscopy.

      884 subjects participated in this study. All subjects that were enrolled in this study were
      indicated and scheduled to undergo colonoscopy based on their age and demographics for
      screening for polyps.

      Each subject was required to follow a bowel preparation regimen and to undergo capsule
      endoscopy (CE) followed by optical colonoscopy (OC). The optical colonoscopy procedure was
      scheduled 4-6 weeks after CE procedure to allow for the central readers reading of the
      PillCam RAPID video.

      The colonoscopist was kept blinded to the CE results
