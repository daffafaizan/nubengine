      (identified by H&E staining and immunohistochemistry) "dominant" PC lesion(s) greater than
      5mm in diameter, whose lesion(s) have been successfully identified by 89Zr-Df-IAB2M imaging.
      Because this is an exploratory pilot study, no formal sample size/power calculation is
      required. However, with a sample size of 20 patients in the study, a two-sided 95% confidence
      interval for the proportion of patients successfully imaged by 89Zr-Df-IAB2M can be
      constructed to be within Â± 19.0% of the observed proportion of patients with successful
      imaging by 89Zr-Df-IAB2M. This calculation assumes an 89Zr-Df-IAB2M imaging-success
      proportion of 75%. All estimates from the study will serve as preliminary data (i.e.,
      hypothesis-generating) for future studies.
