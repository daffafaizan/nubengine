      pathologists and physicians involved in the diagnosis and care of patients with AIDS and non-
      AIDS associated malignancies. These specimens will be banked and linked to a clinical data
      set so that experimental results obtained by analysis of specific specimens can be linked to
      relevant clinical data. Contents of the ACSB will be made available to researchers through an
      application to the National Cancer Institute. Strict patient confidentiality protection
      guidelines are in place for all specimens in the ACSB. The objective of this protocol is to
      obtain clinical specimens from potential participants in clinical trials conducted by the
      AIDS Malignancies Consortium, and from other patients with and without HIV infection, who
      have AIDS-Associated malignancies.
