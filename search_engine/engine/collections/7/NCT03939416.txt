      in the treatment of fibromyalgia, which usually presents with pain and long-term disability,
      by applying a special form of manual physiotherapy called "POLD concept". This therapy is
      based on a passive, oscillatory mobilization, performed at a resonance frequency and applied
      throughout the time of the therapeutic session, on the vertebrae and the muscles of the back,
      without interruption. It is carried out on the initiative of the research team in "pain
      treatment", of the physiotherapy school of the University of Lleida, in collaboration with
      the Omphis Foundation and the clinical service of the Unity of Fibromyalgia of GSS (Hospital
      Universitarios de Santa Mar√≠a, Lleida)
