      Radiofrequency device treatment. The Matrix Radiofrequency device energy generates fractional
      deep dermal heating in the region of the electrode matrix to induce skin injury, thus
      eliciting a wound healing response. Less affected tissue surrounding the matrix points may be
      stimulated by heat which helps accelerate the healing process, while at the same time
      minimizing adverse effects such as scarring or changes in the normal skin pigmentation.

      The researcher can determine Port wine stain areas treated with the Matrix Radiofrequency
      device will have improved Port wine stain blanching responses as compared to those areas
      treated by pulsed dye laser.
