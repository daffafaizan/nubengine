      cyclophosphamide/thiotepa with peripheral blood stem cell rescue in women with locally
      recurrent or metastatic breast cancer who respond to induction therapy with
      epirubicin/fluorouracil/cyclophosphamide. II. Evaluate the effects of this intensive
      treatment on patient quality of life. III. Evaluate tumor response and progression-free
      survival after intensification.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified by clinical/therapeutic hormone
      sensitivity and participating institution. All patients receive induction therapy with
      epirubicin, fluorouracil, and cyclophosphamide (FEC 100) every 3 weeks for up to 4 courses,
      with response evaluated after at least 2 courses. Patients with a complete response or at
      least a 50% partial response are randomized either to no further therapy or to receive
      intensification chemotherapy. Patients randomized to intensification undergo peripheral blood
      stem cell (PBSC) harvest with G-CSF mobilization after the third or fourth induction course.
      Three to 6 weeks after induction, patients receive intensification chemotherapy with
      cyclophosphamide/thiotepa followed by PBSC. Post-transplant G-CSF is given for hematopoietic
      support. No concurrent hormonal therapy is permitted during induction; local irradiation of
      multifocal tumors is allowed provided response is still evaluable. Local therapy (excision of
      single metastasis, radiotherapy to metastatic site) is permitted after completion of protocol
      therapy. Treatment of relapsed disease is at the discretion of the investigator. Patients are
      followed every 3 months for 3 years or until relapse, then every 6 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 180 patients will be accrued over 3 years in this multicenter
      study.
