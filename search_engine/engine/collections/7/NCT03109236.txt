      minimum of 23 and maximum of 33 patients in each arm.

      The investigators propose that transplantation of mobilized autologous CD133+ cells harvested
      from the bone marrow directly into the liver has the ability to replace and regenerate the
      damaged sinusoidal endothelium as well as normalize macrophage and Natural Killer (NK) cell
      function. The niche provided by the refenestrated endothelium can polarize the macrophage to
      antifibrotic phenotype as well as directly inactivate the activated myofibroblast, resulting
      in reversal of liver fibrosis and improvement in liver function. Transplantation of cells
      will be via intraportal route delivered by percutaneous cannulation of the portal vein
      system.
