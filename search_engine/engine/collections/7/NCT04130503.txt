    
      This study has 3 main aims and an additional exploratory aim.

      Specific aim 1: Test whether PAP treatment for OSA in ischemic stroke improves stroke
      severity, post-stroke symptoms, post-stroke functional recovery (primary outcome), and
      quality of life.

      Specific aim 2: Determine whether acute vs. subacute initiation of PAP in ischemic stroke
      results in greater improvement in post-stroke outcomes (stroke severity, symptoms, stroke
      recovery, quality of life).

      Specific Aim 3: Conduct in-depth qualitative interviews with 25-30 stroke patients, family
      members, and acute care providers to elicit their experience with PAP use, including factors
      that influence adherence.

      Exploratory aim: Evaluate whether polysomnographic measures have prognostic utility in
      understanding the variability in stroke recovery.
