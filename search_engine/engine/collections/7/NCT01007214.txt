      guided biopsies for mapping tumor foci with men undergoing prostatectomy. Using a prostate
      hybrid imaging technology (HIT) which fuses a previously obtained endorectal MR image to
      transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) image to allow identification and biopsy of tumors by MR
      imaging in real time. We hypothesis that HIT guided biopsies will accurately localize the
      foci of prostate cancer.
