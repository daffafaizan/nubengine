      hyaluronic acid. Preclinical studies have shown that injection of Chondrogen aids in the
      repair of meniscal tissue following meniscectomy. In Chondrogen treated subjects, surgically
      removed meniscal tissue was regenerated, cartilage surface was protected, and joint damage
      was decreased in comparison to control subjects. These benefits persisted at least one year.

      Three groups of recent meniscectomy patients will be followed in this study, including
      patients that will receive placebo and patients that will be treated with one of two possible
      doses of Chondrogen.
