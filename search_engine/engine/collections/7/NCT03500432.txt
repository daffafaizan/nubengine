      validation process will be as follows: (1) all patients are randomly divided into three
      groups (Figure 1): group 1, subcutaneous local anesthesia+periprostatic block; group 2,
      subcutaneous local anesthesia+periapical triangle (PAT) block; group 3, subcutaneous local
      anesthesia+TPA switch (transperineal prostate biopsy local anesthesia switch) block; VAS
      scores for each puncture and complications will be recorded.
