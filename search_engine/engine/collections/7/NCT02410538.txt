      and nurses. Receiving clear, loyal and appropriate information is one of their main
      expectations. We have previously reported that relatives had difficulty asking questions that
      allow them to improve their understanding regarding ICU issues. In a preliminary study, we
      developed a list of questions considered as important by families, ICU doctors and nurses.

      The aim of this prospective, randomized and controlled trial is to test the effectiveness of
      a list of frequently asked questions to relatives of ICU patients on their understanding of
      the provided information.

      The intervention consists of the delivery of a list of 21 questions to the relative of each
      patient admitted in intensive care, intubated and mechanically ventilated in the first 48
      hours of ICU stay. A formal interview is scheduled for relatives at Day 3 of inclusion. The
      information comprehension at Day 5 (Â± 1) will be compared between families that received the
      list of "FAQ" and families that received information as usual (without providing the list of
      FAQ).
