      shock, ventilated using low tidal volume without spontaneous breathing activity. The test
      involves transiently increasing tidal volume from 8 ml/kg PBW to 12 ml/kg PBW for one minute
      and observing the change in PPV or SVV. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the
      respiratory variation in inferior vena cava diameter after tidal volume challenge can predict
      fluid responsiveness in cardiac surgical patients with mechanical ventilation
