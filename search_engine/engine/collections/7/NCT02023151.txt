      blood basophil response to crosslinking anti-IgE Ab during treatment with omalizumab predicts
      the clinical efficacy of treatment with the drug. Secondary outcomes measures would focus on
      whether the starting level of anti-IgE-mediated histamine release, or the changes syk
      expression or its starting level would be sufficient to predict the clinical outcome.

      The study is a single-site trial to evaluate the utility of baseline basophil measures to
      predict the efficacy of subcutaneously administered omalizumab as an add-on therapy for the
      treatment of adult patients 18-75 years old who have been diagnosed with moderate to severe
      asthma according to current approved guidelines. Patients will be treated with omalizumab
      according to the standard FDA approved dosing table for a period of 16 weeks.
