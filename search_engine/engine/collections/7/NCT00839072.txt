      and trazodone immediate-release 100 mg tablets administered q8h (reference product) will be
      compared in healthy adult volunteers in a randomized, crossover fashion. Morning doses will
      be administered after an overnight fast. Blood samples will be collected predose and at
      pre-defined times over 72 hours following the morning dose. Pharmacokinetic parameters will
      be analyzed using ANOVA. Comparative bioavailability will be assessed on the basis of the
      ratio of least-squares means and/or 90% confidence interval criteria.
