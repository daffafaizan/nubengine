        -  Determine the antitumor activity of capecitabine in patients with recurrent,
           platinum-sensitive ovarian epithelial or primary peritoneal cavity cancer.

        -  Determine the nature and degree of toxicity of this drug in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral capecitabine twice daily for 14 days. Courses repeat every 21 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 22-60 patients will be accrued for this study within 6-12
      months.
