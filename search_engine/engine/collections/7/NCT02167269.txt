      mL/kg was done. Anesthesia was maintained with a 50% N2O/O2 combination with sevoflurane 1 to
      3%, adjusted to ensure a proper anesthetic level to achieve normal vital signs and to keep
      the end-tidal CO2 (ETCO2) <60 mmHg. Fentanyl 1 μg/kg/h was infused during the procedure. All
      patients were pontaneously ventilated with FGF 500 mL/kg/min at the start of each anesthesia
      breathing circuit, waiting for the depth of anesthesia to be maintained and the patient to
      spontaneously breathe for at least 10 minutes. Baseline ETCO2 and imCO2 were then measured.
      The pulse rate, blood pressure and respiratory rate were recorded every five minutes.

      The FGF was reduced by 50 mL/kg/min every five minutes, waiting for the imCO2 to be regularly
      maintained at least 60 sec. The ETCO2 and imCO2 values were recorded until rebreathing
      occurred (imCO2 >2 mmHg) and measurements continued until rebreathing was not clinically
      acceptable (imCO2 >6 mmHg). The minimal FGF before rebreathing occurred (FGF of imCO2 ≤2
      mmHg) is the amount of gas that does not cause rebreathing. The minimal FGF for which
      rebreathing was still acceptable (FGF of imCO2 ≤6 mmHg) is the amount of gas that was
      clinically acceptable. After switching the anesthesia breathing circuit, the FGF was
      increased to 500 mL/kg/min for 10 minutes and the procedure was repeated. The minimal FGF
      before the rebreathing occurred and the FGF at hich rebreathing was still clinically
      acceptable were recorded. After extubation, all of the patients were observed in the PACU and
      relevant factors recorded until there was good recovery from anesthesia before sending the
      patient back to the ward.
