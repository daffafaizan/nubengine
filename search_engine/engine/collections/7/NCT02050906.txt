      I. To compare the effects of the intensive lifestyle intervention and standard of care
      treatments on functional limitations (FL), body composition (BC), and quality of life (QOL)
      in prostate cancer (PC) patients on androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).

      II. To determine the feasibility of delivering an intensive lifestyle exercise and dietary
      intervention to PC patients undergoing ADT.

      III. To identify the intermediate variables that account for the beneficial effect of the
      lifestyle intervention on functional limitations and QOL.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I:

      EXERCISE COMPONENT: Patients undergo 1 hour of intensive exercise comprising 30 minutes of
      aerobic exercise and 30 minutes of resistance exercise twice weekly during weeks 1-6, once
      weekly during weeks 7-8, and independently during weeks 7-12.

      BEHAVIORAL ACTIVITY COUNSELING: Patients undergo behavioral activity counseling in small
      group sessions over 20 minutes once weekly during months 1-2 and individualized activity
      counseling via telephone calls over 20 minutes every 2 weeks for 3 months.

      DIETARY COMPONENT: Patients undergo nutritional counseling over 30 minutes once weekly during
      months 1-2 and then every 2 weeks via telephone calls during month 3.

      ARM II: Patients receive standard care and educational literature describing the American
      Institute of Cancer Research dietary and physical activity guidelines. Patients also receive
      phone calls over 20 minutes every 2 weeks for 3 months focusing on routine prostate cancer
      self-management. After 3 months, patients undergo 2 supervised exercise training and dietary
      counseling sessions.
