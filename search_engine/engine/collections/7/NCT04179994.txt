      available miswak extract-containing toothpaste; 2) commercially available toothpaste
      containing 5% potassium nitrate as positive control; 3) a toothpaste containing the same
      formulation as miswak extract except for the active ingredient (miswak extract) as negative
      control. Toothpastes will be dispensed in labeled containers named A,B, and C to achieve the
      triple masking for investigators, participants, and statisticians. Masked toothpastes will be
      revealed to the investigators after the statistical analyses.

      After allocation, all subjects will be instructed to refrain from using any desensitizing
      agents for two weeks prior to the study up to the end of study period. The randomization
      process will be made using SPSS, the function "RAND" to assign every subject to random A, B,
      or C masked toothpastes. Moreover, to insure the blinded process of the study we will
      dispense the toothpastes in a previously prepared similar containers in separate area. Two
      trained examiners will read and record the scores each visit (baseline, 2-weeks, and
      6-weeks). For the seek of examiners' calibration, Kappa statistic will be used to assess the
      inter-rater reproducibility and we will duplicate a 10% of the study results.

      During each visit, teeth around the targeted tooth will be isolated with cotton rolls then
      the stimuli will be applied using a sharp dental explorer. It will be passed across the
      facial area of the tooth, perpendicular to the tooth long axis. The average of three
      consecutive applications will be recorded as a the reading for that tooth.
