      study, is to prospectively recruit participants on the basis of anthocyanin metabolism
      profiles (based on profiles confirmed in our previous studies) following a 'blueberry
      challenge'. Acute cardio and metabolic function responses will be assessed (by metaboliser
      profile), following an energy dense test meal with/without the addition of blueberries.

      Participants will be healthy, but overweight and obese (BMI inclusion: â‰¥ 25kg/m2) men and
      women (aged 50 y to 80 y), who will initially undertake a 'blueberry challenge' by consuming
      a single dose of freeze dried blueberries. Anthocyanin metaboliser type will be profiled from
      the analysis of metabolites within urine, collected for 48h following the 'challenge'.

      A total of 70 participants will complete the intervention (n=35 FAST and n=35 SLOW
      metabolisers) which consists of two, test meal periods (separated by at least 7d and
      allocated in random order); 1) energy dense test meal plus freeze dried blueberries, 2)
      energy dense test meal plus an isocaloric matched placebo material. Urine samples and
      ambulatory blood pressure measures will be collected for 24h prior to, and then over the 48h
      period which follows the test meal intake. Further assessment of vascular and metabolic
      function will be made at pre-defined times over the 48h postprandial period. Dietary
      restrictions to abstain from blueberries and reduce the anthocyanin intake level, will be
      applied for 5d before each test meal intake. In addition, all food and drink will be provided
      for a 4d period (2d before and during the 48h following the energy dense test meal) to
      further control the intake of flavonoids and to standardise the influence of background diet
      on metabolism profile.
