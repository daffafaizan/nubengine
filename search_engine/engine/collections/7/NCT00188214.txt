      therapy and subsequent surgical resection of any kind is planned. Kinetic analysis of dynamic
      contrast-enhanced CT will performed using the CT Perfusion 3 software (General Electric
      Medical Systems), yielding parameters characterizing tumor microvasculature in terms of the
      vascularity, or the blood volume (BV), the tumor perfusion or blood flow (BF), and the
      immaturity of the vascular wall, in terms of the microvascular permeability (permeability
      surface area, PS).

      To test the assumption that dynamic CT-assessed tumor microvascular characteristics represent
      reliable, user-independent and reproducible parameters, microvascular values and parameter
      maps will be derived from two independent observers. To address the interobserver
      variability, each study will be analyzed by the PI and by a second researcher (blinded to the
      results of the PI). Kappa-statistics will be used to assess inter-rater concordance.

      To test the hypothesis that the microvascular parameters obtained from dynamic
      contrast-enhanced CT predict the response to induction therapy, the parameters BV, BF and PS
      obtained prior to any treatment will be correlated with the histological result from the
      resected specimen (path CR or path non-CR). Spearman correlation will be used to compare
      non-parametric histology results with quantitative CT microvascular parameters.

      To test the hypothesis that the microvascular parameters obtained from dynamic
      contrast-enhanced CT reflect the response to induction therapy, the parameters BV, BF and PS
      obtained after completion of induction treatment will be correlated with the histological
      result from the resected specimen (path CR or path non-CR). Spearman correlation will be used
      to compare non-parametric histology results with quantitative CT microvascular parameters.
