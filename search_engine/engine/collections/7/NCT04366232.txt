      induced by the virus itself. It is imperative not to decrease the immune host response during
      this phase by prohibiting the use of non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or corticosteroids
      at this stage and developing an anti-viral strategy. The late phase, around Day 7-9, depends
      only upon host response and is linked to an excessive inflammatory response with a major
      increase of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, MCP-1, GCSF indicative of IL-1b excess, as
      well as IP-10, MIP-1, indicative of IFNg signature, corresponding to a "cytokine storm".
      Clinical and biological features during Still's disease (complicated in 10% of cases with
      hemophagocytosic lymphohistiocytosis inducing cytopenia, hepatic insufficiency, major
      hyperferritinemia and multi-organ failure) are close to those reported during COVID-19 and
      underline physiopathological similarities.

      Anakinra (KINERET) is an IL-1 pathway (IL-1ra) specific inhibitor that has been used for 15
      years, also largely blocking IL-18 production. Adult Still's disease is very effectively
      treated with anakinra. During sepsis with hyperferritinemia, IL-1ra demonstrated patient
      survival improvement. Ruxolitinib (JAKAVI) inhibits the downstream IFNg pathway targeting JAK
      kinase receptor. It has recently proved its efficiency in hemophagocytosic
      lymphohistiocytosis refractory forms associated with a multi-organ failure.
