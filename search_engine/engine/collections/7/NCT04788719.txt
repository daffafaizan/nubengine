    
      The primary goal of Total Hip Replacement (THR) surgery in the treatment of hip
      osteoarthritis is to reduce pain and restore hip function in order to increase patient
      mobility and quality of life. Patients with radiological signs of osteoarthritis of the hip,
      hip pain and functional disability may be treated with insertion of a THA.

      Two different fixation methods are used in order to insert THR implants. Cemented fixation
      using bone cement, polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) is the most commonly used fixation method
      in Sweden. A new bone cement, RefobacinÂ®, already marketed in Germany is planned to be
      introduced in Sweden in late 2018.

      The hospital is also equipped with a modern gait laboratory were the functional gait
      performance can be evaluated. This will be done before and after surgery in 2 groups
      randomized to either of 2 cement fixation methods. The subjects will undergo gait analysis
      befor and 2 year after surgery.
