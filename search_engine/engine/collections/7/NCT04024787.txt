      Brain responses associated with working memory task and declarative memory encoding will be
      decreased in chronic insomnia compared to good sleepers and, among individuals with chronic
      insomnia, cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia will lead to larger recovery in these
      brain responses, compared to a 3-month wait period.

      Brain responses to emotional stimulation, especially to insomnia-related stimuli, will be
      increased in chronic insomnia compared to good sleepers, and, among individuals with chronic
      insomnia, cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia will lead to larger reduction in these
      brain responses, compared to a 3-month wait period.

      Connectivity in the default-mode and limbic networks during resting-state will be increased
      in chronic insomnia compared to good sleepers, and, among individuals with chronic insomnia,
      cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia will lead to larger reduction in this connectivity,
      compared to a 3-month wait period.
