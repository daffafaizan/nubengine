    
      Between October 2017 and December 2018, we prospectively enrolled consecutive adult patients
      with suspected community-acquired pneumonia based on at least one respiratory symptom and
      focal auscultatory findings and at least one sign related to infection, for whom no
      definitive diagnosis was possible by clinical judgment.

      Eligible patients were randomly assigned to their imaging evaluation in a 1:1 ratio to either
      ultra-low-dose chest computed tomography (ULDCT) or the standard evaluation strategy using
      conventional chest radiography (CR).

      This study sought to compare the rule-out capacity and antibiotics prescriptions associated
      with those two different diagnostic imaging strategies (ULDCT versus CR) in a group of
      healthy adult patients presenting to the ED with suspected CAP.
