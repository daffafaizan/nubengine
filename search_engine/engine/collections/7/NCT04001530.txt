      radiofrequency ablation for atrial flutter. Given that saline contains ionic sodium and
      chloride in the solution, it has conductive properties that may disperse radiofrequency
      energy away from the tip-tissue interface, thereby reducing current density and lesion size
      compared to ablation with nonionic solutions. The efficacy of half-normal saline will be
      measured by the time taken to create bidirectional block across the cavotricuspid isthmus as
      well as the acute recurrence rate within 30 minutes of the initial occurrence of
      bidirectional block and the 1 year freedom from flutter recurrence.
