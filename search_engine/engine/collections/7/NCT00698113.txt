      1,285 children per year for a total of 6,427 children over a five year period. Individual and
      family responses to a child's or adolescent's cancer diagnosis and treatment include
      psychological, sociocultural and biological dimensions. Parents of children with cancer can
      experience severe emotional distress including anxiety and depression. Parents require
      support and skills to reduce their own anxiety and distress and to help alleviate suffering
      in their children.

      This is a two-phase research project: phase I: development of a standardized educational
      intervention on video/DVD to teach parents how to massage their child with cancer; phase II:
      test the feasibility of the developed intervention with children with cancer and their
      parents. A total of 24 parents and their children with cancer who are under the care of the
      paediatric oncology units at the Stollery Children's Hospital (Edmonton) will be recruited
      for the study.

      It is hypothesized that this research on an educational program in parent-delivered massage
      therapy will directly improve the lives of children with cancer and their parents.
