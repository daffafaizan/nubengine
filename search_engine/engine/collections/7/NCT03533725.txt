      the role of breastfeeding peer counselors. These women will assess usability and
      acceptability of mobile health (mHealth) education tools designed following a series of focus
      groups for the project, Breastfeeding Education Support Tool for Baby. The mHealth tools will
      be used during the training and education of the peer counselor subjects. Following
      appropriate modification, some of the mHealth tools will be used with a total of
      approximately 120 women recruited late in pregnancy for initial breastfeeding counseling
      before delivery and the subsequent provision, for at least 6 months post-delivery, of home
      visits for peer counseling and education that integrates use of mHealth tools. Peer
      counselors and research staff will gather data from mothers receiving the intervention about
      breastfeeding experiences and outcomes, including breastfeeding continuation after
      initiation, exclusivity for 6 months of an infant's life, and breastfeeding duration. This
      data will be compared to data obtained through surveys administered to a control group of
      approximately 120 maternal subjects that received standard pre- and post-delivery care but
      not the study intervention of peer counseling and education using mHealth tools.
