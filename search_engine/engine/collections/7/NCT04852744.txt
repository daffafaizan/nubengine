        1. Primary objective:

           • Compare the hippocampal volume between adolescent girls with BPD with and without PTSD

        2. Secondary objectives:

             -  1 - Evaluate the link, transverse and long-term (18 months), between the
                hippocampal volume and the level of general psychopathology in all the patients
                studied, and between the hippocampal volume and the intensity of the symptoms of
                traumatic revival in adolescent girls with PTSD.

             -  2 - Compare the volume of the hippocampal subfields between adolescent girls with
                BPD with and without PTSD, and assess in patients with PTSD the link, transverse
                and long-term (18 months), between volumes of the hippocampal sub-fields and
                intensity symptoms of traumatic revival

             -  3 - Compare the volume and integrity of the white matter bundles of the
                fronto-limbic network between adolescent girls with BPD with and without PTSD

             -  4 - Compare resting brain activity between adolescent girls with BPD with and
                without PTSD

             -  5 - Explore the links between changes in the brain and the intensity of the main
                psychological alterations associated with BPD in adolescence: i) attachment
                insecurity; ii) emotional dysregulation; iii) attention deficit and dysexecutive
                syndrome; iv) hypermentalization; and v) autobiographical memory and dissemination
                of identity.

      B - Secondary evaluation criteria:

        -  1 - Hippocampal volume (VBM); Global Clinical Assessment Scale score (CGA-S; Endicott et
           al., 1976); "Réviviscences" score in the French version of the UCLA Post-Traumatic
           Stress Disorder Reaction Index for Children and Adolescents (UCLA PTSD-RI C / A;
           Steinberg et al., 2013).

        -  2 - Volume of each hippocampal subfield (Ammon's Horn [CA] 1, CA2, CA3, dentate gyrus,
           subiculum: anatomical MRI; Region Of Interest [ROI] method; Postel et al., 2019);
           "Intrusion" score of the French version of the UCLA PTSD-RI C / A.

        -  3 - Orbitofrontal and cingulate cortex volume (VBM); anisotropy fraction (fractional
           anisotropy; FA) and average diffusivity (apparent diffusion coefficient; ADC) of
           fronto-limbic white matter beams (IRM Diffusion Tensor Imaging [DTI]; Le Bihan et al.,
           2001).

        -  4 - Functional connectivity of brain networks in the resting state: default network
           (default mode network), salience network and central executive network; Viard et al.,
           2019).

        -  5 - Brain modifications (VBM, ROI, AF, ADC, functional connectivity of resting networks)
           and: i) "Insecure attachment" score to Individual Relationship Model Cards (Ca-MIR;
           Pierrehumbert et al., 1996); ii) score "Separation-distress" and "Fear" in the French
           version of the Affective Neuroscience Personality Scale (ANPS; Pahlavan et al., 2008);
           iii) Continuous Performance Test omission score (CPT; Conners, 2002) and Wisconsin Card
           Sorting Test perseverance score (WCST; Heaton et al., 1993); iv) "Hypermentalisation"
           score in the French version of the Movie Assessment of Social Cognition (MASC; Martinez
           et al., 2017) and of the Reflective Functioning Questionnaire (RFQ; Badoud et al.,
           2015); and v) measurement of the quality of autobiographical productions (Reese et al.,
           2011), total score in the French version of the Assessment of Identity Development in
           Adolescence (AIDA; Goth et al., 2012).
