      by subjective vaginal manual examination (Bishop's score).One of the variables of the score
      is cervical consistency which is considered important factor.The cervical consistency is
      described as soft,medium or stiff.However, the digital assessment of consistency is
      subjective and less reproducible.The Bishop's score also gives information about expected
      duration of labor after induction. The consistency of the uterine cervix can also be
      evaluated objectively sonoelastographically by measuring the cervical elasticity.This is
      illustrated by a color map, where low stiffness (soft tissue) is indicated in red, middle
      stiffness is in green and high stiffness (hard tissue) is in blue.In this study we aim to
      compare the cervical dilation time between the clinical evaluation of the cervical
      consistency and the quantitative measurement of the cervical elasticity in pregnant patients
      at term.
