    
      Dolutegravir (DTG) is an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) that supports once-daily
      dosing without the need for pharmacokinetic boosting and may be co-formulated with other
      antiretrovirals into a single-tablet regimen (STR). With people living with HIV with
      injection drug use (IDU) being more prone to unplanned antiretroviral therapy (ART)
      discontinuation and suboptimal adherence, DTG offers a high genetic barrier to resistance, a
      profile that reduces drug-drug interactions, with better tolerability and its availability as
      single tablet regimen (STR) combined with abacavir and lamivudine (ABC/3TC) is likely to
      improve adherence.

      The aims of this study include:

        -  To assess tolerability through self-reported adverse effects and directed symptom
           questionnaire

        -  To determine change in number and severity of reported ART-related adverse effects from
           baseline to week 48 and 96

        -  To determine change in health-related quality of life (HRQOL) from baseline to week 48
           and 96

        -  To determine change in frailty score from baseline to week 48 and 96

        -  To determine the percentage of subject with unscheduled ART discontinuations/
           interruptions over 96 weeks

        -  To determine the estimated number of weeks of missed ART over 48 and 96 weeks of
           follow-up

        -  To determine change from baseline of medication possession ratio (MPR) at 48 and 96
           weeks or adherence score as measured by an antiretroviral therapy medication self-report
           form at the same time points

        -  To determine the percentage of subjects with HIV RNA<40 copies/mL at 96 weeks

        -  To determine change in genotypic resistance profiles in subjects experiencing
           virological failure

        -  To determine change in CD4+ T-cell counts through 96 weeks

        -  To determine change in bone mineral density through 96 weeks

        -  To determine the number of subjects with any adverse and any serious adverse events
           (SAE) from baseline to week 96

        -  To determine the number of subject with Grade 1 to 4 laboratory abnormalities from
           baseline to week 96

      This is a prospective, single arm, open-label 96 weeks clinical trial. Study subjects will be
      followed for 96 weeks post enrolment, with regular clinical evaluations, laboratory
      evaluations, safety and adherence assessment, quality of life and bone mineral density (BMD)
      measured at regular intervals.
