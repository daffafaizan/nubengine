      surface of their lungs from people without CF. There are two things that are known to be
      different. One is called bicarbonate secretion, which is the movement of a salt called
      bicarbonate that is normally present in the blood and lung fluid in all people. The abnormal
      movement of bicarbonate appears to cause a second abnormality - the liquid in the breathing
      tubes has more acid than the liquid in patients without CF. These differences may affect the
      stickiness and thickness of the mucus and limit how well the hairs that line the breathing
      tubes (cilia) move mucus out of the lungs.

      Recent studies in a group of patients with chronic cough looked at the effects of giving an
      inhaled bicarbonate solution (sodium bicarbonate instead of sodium chloride) on the study
      subjects' ability to cough up mucus. Compared to the group given inhaled saline, the patients
      given inhaled bicarbonate were able to cough up approximately three times as much mucus. No
      clinical studies have looked at whether inhaled bicarbonate improves the ability of the lung
      in a person with CF to move mucus out of the lung or how this treatment affects lung function
      in patients with CF.
