      This study will aim at determining the nature of subjective memory complaints (i.e.,
      prospective or retrospective memory) in cancer patients with intra- cerebral tumors
      (Glioblastomas and Diffuse Low Grade Gliomas) and extra cerebral tumors (Breast cancer), and
      in patients with HIV compared with controls.

      The protocol administration will take about 20 minutes. It will be conducted by an
      experienced clinical neuropsychologist or clinical oncologist in each center during standard
      care. According to the results on the questionnaires and test, patients will be addressed and
      managed by a neuropsychologist, a clinical psychologist, psychiatrist or a speech therapist.
