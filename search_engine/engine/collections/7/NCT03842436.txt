      Participants will complete a quantitative assessment on their history fo substance use,
      sexual risk and PrEP adherence, and be trained to use the digital pill for 90 days and
      instructed to take PrEP daily during the course of the study. Participants will return each
      month for a study visit to assess their use of the technology. At study visit 1 and 3, we
      will obtain dried blood spots (DBS) to measure drug levels and to confirm adherence detected
      by the digital pill. The investigators will also obtain drugs of abuse screens from DBS. At
      the final study visit (3 months), participants will undergo a semi-structured qualitative
      interview to understand the user response to digital pills.
