    
      CAH comprises a group of autosomal recessive disorders caused by a deficiency of one of five
      enzymes needed for the synthesis of cortisol leading to defect in cortisol synthesis with or
      without aldosterone deficiency and an increase in the production of adrenocorticotropic
      hormone through negative feedback.

      The most common form is 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21OHD), which forms more than 90 % of the
      cases.

      In classic CAH, 75% of the patients have the salt wasting (SW) and 25% have the non
      salt-wasting phenotype (NSW).There are no clinical signs at birth in male infants and in
      female patients, CAH is suspected shortly after birth if there is genital ambiguity, ranging
      from slight clitromegaly to complete masculinization with acceleration of growth and pubertal
      development.

      The non-classic (late onset) form of CAH is a less severe form of 21OHD, and is diagnosed
      later in life.

      Final height in early and late onset patients has been reported as diminished (Hauffa et al,
      1997).This could be attributed to androgen excess or treatment with steroids. Androgen excess
      can occur at any age leading to accelerated growth, early epiphyseal closure and compromised
      final adult height.

      Despite that all forms of CAH differ in their degree of enzymatic deficiency, they all
      represent a therapeutic challenge to pediatric endocrinologists attempting to optimize
      growth.
