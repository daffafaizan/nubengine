      tolerability of the allogeneic human adipose derived stem cell component extract on
      androgenic alopecia in relatively healthy adults. A total of 38 subjects received 1.2 g of
      allogeneic human adipose derived stem cell component extract per month or a placebo for 16
      weeks. Hair count and thickness will be primary outcomes.
