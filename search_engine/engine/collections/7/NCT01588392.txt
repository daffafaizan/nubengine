      preschool day. Within this time frame, children accumulate most of their activity within the
      first 10 minutes. This study is a cluster randomized controlled study designed to examine the
      effects of short bouts of structured physical activity implemented within the classroom
      setting as part of designated gross-motor playtime on during-school physical activity in
      preschoolers. Results from this intervention could provide evidence that a physical activity
      policy that exposes preschoolers to shorter bouts of structured physical activity throughout
      the preschool day could potentially increase preschooler's physical activity levels.
