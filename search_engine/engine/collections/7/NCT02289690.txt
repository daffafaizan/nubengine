    
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, dose-escalation/Phase 2 randomized double-blind study of
      veliparib in combination with carboplatin and etoposide and maintenance veliparib
      monotherapy.

      Participants in Phase 1 will be sequentially assigned to ascending dose levels of veliparib
      in combination with standard carboplatin/etoposide regimen for up to four 21-day cycles based
      on the observed toxicities. The study design for Phase 1 will follow a traditional "3 + 3"
      dose-escalation protocol.

      Once the veliparib recommended Phase 2 dose (RPTD) and schedule is determined, enrollment
      into Phase 2 will begin. Participants from the Phase 1 dose-escalation portion of the study
      are not eligible for enrollment into the Phase 2 portion. Participants in Phase 2 will be
      randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to carboplatin, etoposide, placebo followed by placebo
      maintenance (Arm C), or carboplatin, etoposide, veliparib followed by either veliparib (Arm
      A) or placebo (Arm B) maintenance. Randomization for Phase 2 will be stratified by baseline
      lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level (> upper limit of normal [ULN] vs. â‰¤ ULN), and gender.
