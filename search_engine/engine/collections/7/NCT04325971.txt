      techniques EEG and MRI while eye movements are recorded. Three experiments are performed: in
      MR scanner 1) functional localisation of specific areas: LOC, FFA, MT/V5, V1 and V2 and 2) a
      saccadic choice experiment; with EEG, replication of the experiments performed in the MR
      scanner and 3) an additional experiment of movement detection during the ocular saccades.

      Thirty young volunteers (18-40 y old) are involved.
