      limb movement in chronic stroke patients following twelve one hour sessions of rehabilitation
      using the "Nintendo Wii" over a period of four weeks, and to compare with a group of patients
      receiving traditional upper limb rehabilitation of the same duration. The investigators
      hypothesize that the use of compensatory strategies will increase in the group receiving the
      "Wii" rehabilitation while they will decrease in the group receiving traditional
      rehabilitation. The investigators further hypothesize that this will have an impact on the
      functional benefit with a greater improvement of function in the group receiving traditional
      rehabilitation.
