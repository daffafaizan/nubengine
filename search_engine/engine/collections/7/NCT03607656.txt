      chemotherapy in the treatment of stage IIIb and IIIc gastric cancer through randomized
      controlled trial.

      Metastasis and recurrence is the primary cause in decreasing the survival time of gastric
      cancer patients who experienced radical operation. Among whom, patients with stage IIIB and
      IIIC are especially in high risk of metastasis and recurrence, result in a significant poor
      survival time than patients with earlier stages.

      Oxaliplatin with capecitabine is the standard adjuvant chemotherapy for curative D2
      gastrostomy gastric cancer, contribute the 3-year disease free survival rate of 74% in ITT,
      and 61% in stage IIIB sub-group. Meanwhile, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) treatment has
      been used for thousands of years in Chinese clinical practices. In China, the clinical
      curative effect of TCM in the treatment of gastric cancer has been part of affirmation. Some
      reports with large samples of clinical research show that the TCM is effective and safety for
      gastric cancer.In order to evaluate efficacy on TCM combined adjuvant chemotherapy in IIIB
      and IIIC gastric cancer, we design this randomized, open-label study.
