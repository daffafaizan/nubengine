      patients regularly followed-up after canal wall-up tympanoplasty with at least two non-EP DWI
      performed on the same 1.5T MRI scanner. MR images were reviewed independently by two
      radiologists. Sensitivity and specificity values were calculated as a function of time after
      the surgery. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves were analyzed to determine the
      optimal follow-up duration.
