      trial. The sample population will consist of one-hundred fifty healthy adult volunteers. All
      participants will be Malaysian women between eighteen and forty-two years of age. Study
      participants will be recruited by word of mouth and through advertisements placed in
      hospitals and universities starting in January 2011. Study participants will be randomly
      assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups: 1) 1000ug L-MTHF 2) 1000ug folic acid 3) placebo (methyl
      cellulose). All treatments will be given in capsule form. Blood samples will be collected at
      baseline, 6 and 12 weeks.

      The primary outcome measure is red cell folate. A sample size of 45 subjects per group will
      allow us to detect a minimum difference of 100 nmol/L red cell folate assuming an alpha 0.05,
      a beta of 0.8 a SD of 183 nmol/L. Accounting for a 10% attrition rate we will enroll 50 women
      per group. The study will be analyzed as intent to treat. Baseline characteristics and
      compliance between treatment groups will be compared using a one-way ANOVA for continuous
      variables and chi-square analyses for categorical variables. The difference in measurements
      between the treatment groups at week 12 will be determined by regression analysis,
      controlling for baseline values.
