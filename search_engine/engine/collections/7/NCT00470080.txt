      Nonpharmacological intervention (oral sucrose solution) can reduce neonatal pain. EMLA cream
      is an oil in water emulsion of an eutectic mixture of prilocaine and lignocaine; it is an
      local anesthetic cream. Very few reports have looked at the efficacy of EMLA in preterm
      infants.

      This randomized bicentric trial will investigate the efficacy of topical EMLA cream with oral
      sucrose solution compared to oral sucrose solution alone before venepuncture in preterm
      infants.
