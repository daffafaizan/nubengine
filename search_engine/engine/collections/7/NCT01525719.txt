      cholangiocarcinoma are often diagnosed at advanced stage. Palliative therapeutic approaches
      consisting of percutaneous and endoscopic biliary drainage have usually been used for these
      patients, since there is no effective chemotherapeutic treatment for this type of cancer.
      Activation of the phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway is frequently
      found in cholangiocarcinoma cells. It has been suggested to be a key step leading to the
      progression of cholangiocarcinoma. In this study, the investigators hypothesize that
      inhibition of mTOR may be useful in treating cholangiocarcinoma.
