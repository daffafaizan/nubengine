      diseases in the REDUCE-IT study. In the upcoming study the effect of E-EPA to low-density
      lipoprotein (LDL) aggregation susceptibility is measured using dynamic light scattering
      technique to continuously measure particles size while inducing aggregation. LDL Lipid
      composition is analyzed using electrospray mass spectrometer optimized for lipid
      measurements. Previously is reported that the aggregation susceptibility is affected by the
      lipid composition which is modifiable (Ruuth et. al. Eur.H.Journal 2018). Common disease
      factors such as total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, triglyserides, ApoB-100, ApoA-I, Lp(a) and
      different modified LDL levels are measured. Also, activities of lipid metabolism enzymes like
      PON-1, LCAT, CETP, PLTP and lipid mediated resolvins are looked into. Objective is to
      identify changes and possible pathways that are altered by the increase of E-EPA and to use
      the data to possibly explain the health benefits of EPA.
