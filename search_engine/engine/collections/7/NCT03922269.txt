      study will comprise recording clinical data from up to three visits over an 18-month period.
      The study visits will happen at the same time of routine clinical care, and all clinical data
      will be collected in the study database. At the screening/baseline study visit (following
      written consent), a survey will be administered to all study participants. The overall
      recruitment target is 200 participants.

      The primary aim is to assess the rate of virological response to antiretroviral therapy in
      transgender and non-binary (gender diverse) people living with HIV (TPLWH) in Europe. It's
      secondary outcomes are:

        -  To explore demographics, risk behaviours and community needs

        -  To explore the barriers and facilitators to adherence to cART

        -  To report TPLWH experiences with regard to:

             -  Stigma

             -  Quality of life

             -  Prevalence of opportunistic infections

        -  To record data on:

             -  Retention into care

             -  Clinical characteristics (e.g. drug toxicity, BMD results, hormone intake, drug
                interactions between hormones and antiretrovirals, cardiovascular risk, etc.)

        -  Implement and analyse a trans-inclusive method of gender identity data collection, in
           order to provide comprehensive demographic information that is acceptable at the
           community-level and includes a diverse spectrum of trans/non-binary genders across all
           study sites. People living with HIV (PLWH) who refer to themselves as transgender and
           non-binary (and all gender diverse people).
