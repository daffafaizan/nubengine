    
      This study is a double-blind, individual-randomized, placebo-controlled, clinical efficacy
      trial among healthy children aged 24 through 71 months in the Niakhar area of Senegal. A
      total of 1,761 healthy children will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio of LAIV to placebo.

      For evaluation of efficacy, passive and active surveillance will be conducted weekly
      throughout the study to identify outcomes among vaccinated subjects. Children meeting the
      protocol-defined clinical case definition will have a nasal swab and throat swab specimen
      collected for testing by rRT-PCR for evidence of influenza virus infection.

      100 of the 1,761 participants were also included in a substudy designed to evaluate virologic
      evidence of LAIV replication. As such, nasal and throat swab specimens were collected on day
      0 (prior to vaccination), as well as on post-vaccination days 2, and 4 from all subjects
      included in the substudy. These specimens will be tested for presence of wild-type and
      vaccine virus. Additionally, a more detailed assessment of vaccine reactogenicity will be
      made among these children by actively collecting solicited and unsolicited reactions at each
      study visit for the week post vaccination (days 2 and 4).
