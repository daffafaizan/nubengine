      to dosing. The subjects will be randomly assigned to receive WCK 2349 1000 mg as an oral dose
      in fed or fasting state (1:1) in the food effect study as per the randomization schedule. The
      subjects completing the food effect study (i.e., Period 1 and Period 2) will be administered
      WCK 771 800 mg as an intravenous infusion in fasting state in Period 3 of the study. There
      will be a washout period of three days between each period. The subjects will continue to
      remain in the clinical facility for the entire duration of the study (completion of three
      periods in the study), including wash out period. Prior to check out procedure, detailed
      clinical examination will be done to confirm that subject has no safety issues.
