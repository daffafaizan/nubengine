    
      This study is a prospective, single-arm, multicenter, post-market safety evaluation of
      subjects indicated for embolization of brain AVMs with the study device. The study device was
      developed to potentially minimize the side effects of catheter retainment and increased
      procedural risk associated with alternative methods necessary for removing entrapped
      catheters. In the event of catheter retainment, using the Apollo™ Onyx™ Delivery
      Microcatheter versus any a standard catheter represents leaving behind a 1.5 - 3.0 cm long
      detachable tip in the Onyx™ Onyx™ Delivery Microcatheter cast versus an average 165 cm long
      catheter in the vasculature.
