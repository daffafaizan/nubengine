      be fit enough to be treated with chemotherapy will be asked to participate in this study.
      Patients will first be treated with 4 courses of chemotherapy (standard
      treatment[Alimta/cisplatin]). After this chemotherapy a leukapherese is performed of which
      the monocytes are used for differentiation to dendritic cells. The procedure to grow these
      dendritic cells in vitro (culture) and pulse them with tumor lysate is performed in a
      cleanroom environment. Several quality control tests will be performed before the dendritic
      cells are ready for re-injection. Three doses of properly pulsed autologous dendritic cells
      are then re-injected every two weeks.

      Using the proper procedure in mesothelioma patients, minor side effects are expected.

      Ten (10) patients will be treated by this procedure to define the safety and toxicity of
      immunization and to observe (anti-tumor) immune responses.
