      care resources in New York in April 2020. The prone position improves oxygenation in
      intubated patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. The investigators wanted to
      study whether the prone position is associated with improved oxygenation and decreased risk
      for intubation in spontaneously breathing patients with severe COVID-19 hypoxemic respiratory
      failure. Awake prone positioning was implemented based on the health care provider decision.
