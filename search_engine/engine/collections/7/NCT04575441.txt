      habit should be given to people from earlier ages. Moreover, doing exercise can be beneficial
      to improve motor skills of this age and this improvement can support other developmental
      areas of these children. Thus, this study aims to investigate the effects of an exercise
      routine on balance, reaction time and dual task performance of preschool children. This
      exercise program includes pilates ball to make more fun for this age group. All movements are
      conducted with the same pilates ball. Exercises are conducted with individual sessions in the
      kindergartens of children.
