      intervention and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational
      intervention to use for further studies. "Investigational" means that the intervention is
      being studied.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved GO-203-2C as a treatment for
      any disease.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved bortezomib as a treatment option
      for your disease.

      The purpose of this research study is to test the safety of GO-203-2C with bortezomib.
      GO-203-2C is a newly discovered compound that binds to an oncoprotein (a cancer causing
      protein) called MUC1. Myeloma cells harbor an increased amount of MUC1 on its cell surface.
      By binding to MUC1, GO-203-2C has been shown to cause tumor cell death in laboratory studies.

      Bortezomib is an intravenously or subcutaneously administered medication that belongs to a
      class of drugs called proteasome inhibitors. Proteasome inhibitors disrupt the normal action
      of cells that breakdown proteins in both normal and cancer cells. This disruption can stall
      tumor growth and cause cancer cells to die. Bortezomib is currently approved for the
      treatment of multiple myeloma.

      The Investigators want to find the highest dose of GO-203-2C given in combination with
      bortezomib that can be administered safely without severe or unmanageable side effects.
