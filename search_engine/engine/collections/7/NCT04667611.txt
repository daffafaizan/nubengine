      administration of PROMs questionnaires to patients that attend the Clinic for Functional
      Disorders at Helsinki University hospital (HUS). The questionnaires are handed out to the
      study population within seven days before their first visit at the clinic, and then at the
      following 3, 6 and 12 months. The study population consists of consecutive adult patients
      that are referred to the clinic either from other hospital units or primary care. The
      collected data will later be linked with national registries on diagnoses, medication use and
      work ability. The Sympa Cohort study may have implications in targeting the factors
      influencing functional outcomes and quality of life reported by patients with bodily stress
      syndrome. It will also form a quality register for the Clinic and characterize the first
      systematic collection of PROMs related to these disorders in Finland.
