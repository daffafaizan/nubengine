      and theory-based interventions that promote HPV vaccination among men. A few studies have
      been conducted with parents and physicians regarding HPV vaccination with girls, and a few
      regarding women's awareness and acceptability. Results indicated increasing awareness of HPV,
      informing costs and benefits associated with the vaccine, and perceived susceptibility. Based
      on this information, it is crucial to obtain a further understanding of knowledge, awareness,
      and predictors related to HPV and its vaccination in men. Information obtained can be
      utilized in developing an intervention to increase intentions of taking the HPV vaccine.
      Refining results will lead to a standardization of an intervention that can be implemented
      across college campuses.
