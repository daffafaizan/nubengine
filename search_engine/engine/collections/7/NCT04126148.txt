      breathing maneuvers as a vasoactive maneuver and Oxygenation-Sensitive Cardiac Magnetic
      Resonance Imaging (OS-CMR) in a patient population. OS-CMR results will be compared to the
      clinical gold standard of Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR) and instant wave-free ratio (iFR) as
      a secondary objective, to determine if this non-invasive, no pharmaceutical agent imaging
      technique can identify areas of oxygenation deficit in myocardium perfused by a stenosed
      coronary artery.
