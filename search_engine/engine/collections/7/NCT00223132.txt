      and predictable weight loss within a period of 12 to 18 months following surgery.
      Consequently, body contouring after weight loss is emerging as the fastest growing field of
      plastic surgery. Patients seek consultation with a plastic surgeon to correct skin laxity of
      the abdomen, thighs, chest, back, and neck.

      A major problem in body contourinig is the extrusion of absorbable suture material used for
      dermal closure. Long incisions and high tension inherent to body contouring surgery mandate a
      secure dermal closure. While absorbable sutures are preferred, they can result in suture
      granuloma and extrusion.
