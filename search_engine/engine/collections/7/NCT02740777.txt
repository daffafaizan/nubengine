      aged 18 to 26 years. The adolescents will be divided into two cohorts, 300 each, receiving
      either a 2-dose (0, 6 months) immunization schedule or a 3-dose (0, 2, 6 months) immunization
      schedule. The adult female group will receive a 3-dose (0, 2, 6 months) immunization
      schedule.

      Each subject shall be administrated with the studied vaccine according to either 2-dose or
      3-dose schedule as above. Immediate reactions occurred during 30 minutes after each
      inoculation, all the local and systematic reactions occurred from 0 to 7 days after each
      inoculation will be recorded. All the adverse events (AEs) occurred from the first dose of
      administration to 1 month after the final dose of administration, as well as all the serious
      adverse events (SAEs) occurred from the first dose of administration to 6 months after the
      final dose of administration will be collected. Blood samples will be collected at day 0
      (prior to immunization) , month 6 (prior to the last injection) , month 7, month 12, month
      24, and month 36. All the blood samples will be tested HPV 16- and HPV 18-specific antibody
      titers.
