      diseases (GVHD) are at high risk for serious CMV infection due to CMV reactivation or
      reinfection during their post-transplant period.

      Antiviral agents used to treat CMV infection have well-known side effects such as bone marrow
      suppression causing cytopenia and renal toxicities. Therefore, patients in a serious
      condition would have a higher probability of antiviral treatment-related toxicities and also
      increased possibility for prolonged antiviral treatment, thus development of antiviral
      resistance and risk of treatment failure.

      Allogeneic HCT recipients are typically lack of these CMV-specific T cells during the
      post-transplant period and their immune function can be further repressed especially when
      they are on additional immunosuppressive agents to prevent GVHD. Therefore, these patients
      may benefit from CMV-specific T cell adoptive transfer.
