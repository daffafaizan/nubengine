    
      This is a randomized, open-label, phase 3 long-term study designed to evaluate the safety,
      local tolerability and efficacy of sofpironium bromide gel when applied topically to the
      axillae.

      Subjects will apply the gel once daily at bedtime, to both axillae.

      A maximum of 300 subjects, will be randomized to receive one of two sofpironium bromide gel
      concentrations.

      Adverse events, vital signs, and local tolerability assessments will be collected at each
      visit. Urine pregnancy tests will be taken throughout the course of the study for women of
      child bearing potential. Blood and urine samples will be collected and analyzed for routine
      hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis parameters at specified visits. Patient-reported
      outcome assessments will be recorded during the study at predefined time points.

      The study will be comprised of a total of 17 scheduled visits to take place over a 52 week
      period.
