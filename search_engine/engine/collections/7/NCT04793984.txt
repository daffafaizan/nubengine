      double blind, placebo-controlled trial in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

      Patients will inhale Inhaleen or Placebo 3 times a day for 7 minutes for 5 days.

      The primary objective of the trial is to demonstrate that Inhaleen inhalation improves the
      clinical status of hospitalized COVID-19 patients on day 8 compared to placebo inhalation.
