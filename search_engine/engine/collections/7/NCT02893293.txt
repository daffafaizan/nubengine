      with ferumoxytol-enhanced MRI.

      The investigators approach relies on the FDA-approved iron supplement ferumoxytol (Feraheme),
      which is used off label as a contrast agent for MRI. Ferumoxytol is composed of iron oxide
      nanoparticles, which provide a strong T1- and T2-signal on magnetic resonance (MR) images and
      are taken up by cells in bone marrow.

      20 patients will undergo MRI before and after decompression surgery and transplantation of
      bone marrow derived cells. 10 patients will receive a single intravenous injection of
      ferumoxytol prior to their surgery. 10 additional patients will serve as untreated controls.
      The investigators hypothesize that MR images after intravenous injection of ferumoxytol will
      improve lesion detection and allow to track transplanted bone marrow cells. MR imaging
      findings will be correlated with clinical outcomes.
