      with health information to study how genetic variation in the population is associated with
      particular diseases, treatments and medical outcomes. Investigators may study the entire
      range of diseases and medical problems that exist within the NSLIJHS, including medical,
      surgical, psychiatric, pediatric and obstetric conditions. The specimens and medical
      information will be kept at a central Biorepository. This research study does not involve any
      treatment and individual research results are not provided.
