      age 16-45. Patients were randomized to standard treatment at normothermia or to standard
      treatment with moderate hypothermia (32.5-34C for 48 hours). An intent to treat analysis was
      used with the primary outcome measure as the Glasgow Outcome Scale at six months after
      injury. GOS is dichotomized into good outcome (Good Recovery/Moderate Disability) and poor
      outcome (Severe Disability, Vegetative, Dead).
