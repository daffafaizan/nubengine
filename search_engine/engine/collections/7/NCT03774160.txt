      intervention for HIV prevention for young men who have sex with men (MSM). MP targets
      individual and community empowerment and community mobilization, self-affirmation, sexual
      self-knowledge and creation of a supportive and affirming social environment. MP has been
      widely used in the U.S. but not in Peru, with the exception of earlier pilot research. In the
      earlier research, MP was adapted for the sociocultural issues facing MSM and transgender
      (trans) women in Peru, and only focused risk reduction and increasing HIV testing. In
      addition to the MP (which is called the community-based intervention), a health systems
      component has been added. The health systems includes (1) sensitization of hospital staff
      (where people living with HIV obtain their medication) to the issues facing transgender women
      and MSM; (2) the use of Navigators, who help MSM and trans women at the hospital navigate the
      system of care and remain in care; and (3) a focus on "positive prevention", in which
      providers talk about the positive aspects of maintaining in care and being virally suppressed
      instead of only talking about "avoiding death." There is a 2.5 year implementation of the
      intervention, called "Projecto Orgullo Plus" or Project Pride Plus, which involves a
      longitudinal cohort of MSM/trans in two large districts of Lima, Peru. Primary outcomes will
      be unprotected anal sex and HIV testing. Secondary outcomes will be self-reported visits to
      hospital for care and adherence to medications.
