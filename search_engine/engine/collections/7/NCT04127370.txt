      around 25.24%. The highest prevalence of NAFLD is reported from the Middle East 31.79% and
      South America 30.45% whereas the lowest prevalence rate is reported from Africa 13.48%.

      Unlike NAFLD, Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis is more aggressive and is associated with a risk
      of approximately 10 to 29% of progression to cirrhosis within10 years. Therefore, early-stage
      NASH represents a group of patients that is most likely to benefit from treatments in order
      to prevent progression to cirrhosis and its complications. Obesity is the most common and
      well documented risk factor for NAFLD, the majority (>95%) of patients with severe obesity
      undergoing bariatric surgery will have NAFLD. To date, weight loss achieved via lifestyle
      intervention remains the mainstay of treatment of NASH.

      Bariatric surgery contributes to weight loss in two main ways: restrictive procedures and
      malabsorptive procedures.

      In 2018, the AASLD board stated that it is premature to consider foregut bariatric surgery as
      an established option to specifically treat NASH. Accordingly, the effects of bariatric
      surgery on hepatic fibrosis are still unclear. In Egypt there is lack in such type of study
      thus this research will conducted to evaluate the prevalence of NAFLD and NASH in obese
      patients undergoing bariatric surgery and to assess the role of bariatric surgery in
      management of NAFLD related hepatic morbidity in our locality.
