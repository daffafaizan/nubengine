    
      Glaucoma patients who are hospitalized for diurnal intraocular pressure measurements and
      glaucoma assessment are asked about their drinking habits. Objective evaluation of hydration
      status is assessed with the Body Composition Monitor (Fresenius). Retinal Vessel Analysis and
      Laser Doppler Flowmetry are investigated in subgroups.

      The control group are also hospitalized patients who do not suffer from glaucoma.
