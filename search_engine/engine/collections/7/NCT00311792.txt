      reality simulator LapSimGyn can be transferred to a real laparoscopic operation measured as
      improved score in a technical skills assessment. Design: prospective randomized double
      blinded intervention study.

      Subjects:Younger gynaecologists (Postgraduate year 2-8) Half are having conventional training
      the other half is undergoing virtual reality simulator training before performing their first
      laparoscopic salpingectomy.

      Outcome is measured by blinded video evaluation with criteria. The criteria is defined in the
      previous validated scoring system Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS)
