    
      Hypothesis #1 To verify the efficacy of an 8-week course of cocoa-containing product
      consumption on blood pressure in adults with stage 1 hypertension. Specifically, to
      demonstrate at least 3.5 mmHg improvement in 24-hour mean systolic blood pressure following 8
      weeks of treatment with cocoa- containing products when compared to placebo. Our hypothesis
      is that cocoa-containing product consumption will result in clinically significant
      improvement of systolic blood pressure at the conclusion of an 8-week course of treatment.

      Hypothesis #2 To identify a dose-response relationship in which increasingly higher doses of
      cocoa powder in cocoa-containing products will demonstrate correspondingly greater beneficial
      effects on blood pressure over an 8-week period in individuals with stage 1 hypertension.
      Specifically, to investigate the effects of the variation of dose of cocoa powder in
      cocoa-containing products (i.e. 5 grams or 10 grams of cocoa powder) for 8 weeks on blood
      pressure. We hypothesize that increasingly higher doses of cocoa powder in cocoa-containing
      products will demonstrate correspondingly greater beneficial effects on blood pressure.

      Hypothesis #3 To assess the effects of different doses of cocoa-containing product
      consumption over an 8-week period on 24-hour diastolic blood pressure, endothelial function,
      arterial stiffness, serum lipids, theobromine, CRP, glucose, insulin, body weight, and waist
      circumference in adults with stage 1 hypertension. We hypothesize that consumption of
      cocoa-containing products will lower diastolic blood pressure; improve endothelial function
      of our participants; reduce arterial stiffness; improve serum lipids; theobromine; and will
      have no clinically meaningful effects on body weight and waist circumference, CRP, glucose,
      or insulin.
