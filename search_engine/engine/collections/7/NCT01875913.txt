      behaviors-exercising, losing weight, getting a colonoscopy-but then fail to do so. This has
      massive individual and societal costs. This research tests a promising intervention to
      increase the likelihood that an adult will follow through on their health-related intentions.
      Curiosity can be a powerful motivator and can cause people to engage in new behaviors
      (Tomkins 1962; Silvia 2006); however, curiosity has not yet been used as an intervention to
      help people follow-through on their intentions. In this project, the investigators target
      employees who have failed to complete their annual Vitality Health Review (VHR) and test
      whether curiosity can be used to induce the employees to complete their VHR. The VHR is a
      medical questionnaire that can help individuals understand medical risk factors they may be
      prone to. The investigators provide employees with a question and inform them that they will
      see the answer upon completion of their VHR. The investigators hypothesize that the
      curiosity-inducing messages will cause employees to follow through on their intention to
      complete their VHR.
