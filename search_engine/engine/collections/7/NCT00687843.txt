      fluorouracil, 5-FU), gimeracil and oteracil potassium. The response rate of TS-1 in the
      untreated advanced gastric cancer patients was 44.6% in the late phase II study. In 2007,
      efficacy of the adjuvant therapy using TS-1 in the resected gastric cancer patients was
      demonstrated by ACTS-GC study group conducted in Japan. PSK is an oral anticancer drug
      approved in Japan consisting of protein-bound polysaccharide extracted from mycelium of
      Trametes (Coriolus) versicolor, a kind of mushroom. Even though survival benefit by PSK in
      combination with adjuvant chemotherapy using 5-FU or tegafur in the postoperative gastric
      cancer patients was already demonstrated, it is not uncertain about efficacy of combination
      therapy with PSK and TS-1 in gastric cancer. In this study, we compare efficacy and safety of
      postoperative adjuvant therapy using TS-1 or TS-1+PSK in the stage II or III gastric cancer
      patients.
