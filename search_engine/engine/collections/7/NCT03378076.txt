    
      This is a randomized, open label, parallel group study that will be conducted in male and
      female patients â‰¥ 40 years of age with bilateral knee OA.

      Approximately 24 patients will be randomized to one of two treatment groups (1:1) and treated
      with IA injections to both knees of either:

        -  extended-release FX006 64 mg total dose (approximately 12 patients) or

        -  immediate-release TAcs 80 mg total dose (approximately 12 patients) Each patient will be
           screened to confirm the diagnosis of OA and eligibility based on the inclusion/exclusion
           requirements and will be randomized to treatment on Day 1. Following screening,
           pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety will be evaluated at 6 out-patient visits scheduled on
           Study Days 1 [calendar day of injection], 2, 8, 15, 29, and 43.
