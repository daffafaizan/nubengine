      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) for 40 years without much improvement in efficacy. The key
      reason for lack of progress is that chemotherapy agents are not effective in hypoxia and
      cancer stem cells are induced under hypoxia. Tirapazamine, a hypoxia activated agent, can
      potential solve these two problems. This open label randomized trial will be conducted in HCC
      patients who are in intermediate stage and naive to embolization, Child Pugh up to B7 and
      with normal organ functions. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive TATE (trans-arterial
      tirapazamine embolization) or conventional TACE. The goal of treatment aims to achieve CR by
      mRECIST for every patient. If there is evidence of viable lesion, patients should be treated
      again. All patients are followed by contrast MRI scans every 2 months in the first year and
      every 3 months afterwards until patients have evidence of progression and no longer
      considered suitable for TATE/TACE. Survival will be followed for 3 years. Total sample size
      will be 134 patients with the total study duration for 3 years.
