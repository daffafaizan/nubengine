      diseases.

      As a precondition for participating in this study, the patients were provided information in
      writing and verbally about the details of the study. Informed consent was obtained from all
      volunteers. Before the beginning of the study, all participants were subject to a medical
      examination by their general practitioners. Fifty-one hypertriglyceridemic patients (25 f, 26
      m; with triacylglyceride (TAG) values ≥ 150 mg/dl or ≥ 1.7 mmol/L) entered the study.

      The placebo-controlled, randomized double-blind cross-over study consisted of two
      investigation periods of 15 weeks, with a ten-week washout period in between. After the
      washout period the intervention was crossed between the groups and the respective products
      were consumed for another 15 weeks. Patients received about 40 g fat daily (200 g yoghurt
      with 3.8% fat, 30 g cheese with about 50% fat in the dry matter, and 20-30 g butter). The
      milk fat was partially exchanged by special oils (fish oil, rapeseed oil) with high amounts
      of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and alpha linolenic acid (ALA).
      The daily dose of n-3 FA amounted to 3.3 g, consisting of 1.5 g EPA, 1.2 g DHA, 0.2 g DPA,
      and 0.2 g ALA.

      Venous blood and 24h urine were collected at the beginning and at the end of each period.
