      prescribed physical exercise as a healthy lifestyle intervention added to the
      antihypertensive regimens in the framework of the "ACTIVA-Murcia Program".

      Participants in the HIT and LMIT groups followed the same physical training program, with the
      only difference being the intensity of the training. The program included two phases of
      physical exercise lasting 12 weeks and 16 weeks, respectively, separated by a 7-week rest
      period, which coincided with a holiday period. The times of both phases were not equal in
      terms of duration, since it is a community physical exercise program established by the
      Region of Murcia, and does not depend on the researchers.

      The program was developed by graduates in Physical Activity and Sport Sciences, who were in
      charge of teaching the exercises and supervised each training session.

      Participants assigned to the HIT and LMIT groups were given guidelines to continue physical
      exercise during the 7-week rest period, while participants in the control group were offered
      to participate in the program after the study.
