      evidence has indicated that cognitive trainings improve cognition functions of MCI patients
      in multiple cognitive domains, making it a promising therapy for MCI. However, the effect of
      long-time training has not been widely explored. It is also necessary to evaluate the extent
      of its function in reducing the conversion rate from MCI to AD.
