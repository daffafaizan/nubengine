      strategy for uncomplicated acute bacterial skin and skin structure infection (ABSSSI) in the
      Barnes Jewish Hospital (BJH) Emergency Department (ED) focusing on hospital admission
      avoidance using single-dose, long-acting antimicrobial therapy complemented by close
      follow-up in the ambulatory setting. The extended half-life of these new antimicrobials
      (dalbavancin, oritavancin) allows for an effective treatment course of >7 days with a single
      dose, which is the accepted duration for which ABSSSI is usually treated with daily doses of
      other intravenous or oral antimicrobials. The investigators believe that such an approach
      will conserve hospital resources by reducing admissions for uncomplicated ABSSSI while
      delivering comparable if not superior care for this disease, allowing optimal utilization of
      BJH inpatient beds for other serious medical conditions requiring inpatient care. The
      investigators believe this novel alternative approach will allow hospitals such as BJH to
      more cost-effectively and efficiently manage ABSSSI patients. This study will reduce the
      number of >2 midnight observation admissions to BJH for ABSSSI, thereby improving inpatient
      capacity to care for patients requiring >2 midnight hospital inpatient admission.

      The investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial comparing patients treated with
      a single-dose of intravenous dalbavancin (an antibiotic that has been FDA-approved for the
      treatment of ABSSSI and is currently being used in clinical practice in the U.S.) and
      discharged home from the ED with close ambulatory care follow-up in clinic vs. patients
      treated with "usual care" (hospital admission for multiple doses of intravenous vancomycin or
      other antibiotic directed towards Gram-positive bacteria). Clinical outcomes, healthcare
      utilization, hospital costs, and patient satisfaction will be evaluated.
