      catheter for urodynamic evaluation, patients were asked to report pain and/or desire to void
      felt at every centimeter (cm)of insertion, on an analogic visual scale graded from 0 to 10.
      The USP was defined by the graphic representation of the successive values of these
      sensations , from the urinary meatus, to the urinary bladder.
