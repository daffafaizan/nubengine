      tattoos. Healthy patients who wish to remove a tattoo will be enrolled. The study will test
      the removal of a small part of the tattoo (5cm2 area). Treatment lasts about 20 minutes (with
      local analgesia if needed), after which an absorptive bandage is put over the treated area
      for an hour and removed. Treatment may be performed using one of two washing fluids. For one
      of them, blood samples for material blood level will be taken before and several times after
      treatment. Pictures of the tattooed area being removed will be taken before and after
      treatment, and at each follow-up evaluation.

      Follow up evaluations will be performed at 1 week, two weeks, one month and two months post
      treatment. Overall health and skin condition will be evaluated, and the tattoo area will be
      pictured. Efficacy of tattoo removal will be evaluated after two months, by visual estimation
      of the percent area that reacted to treatment, and the change in brightness (both evaluated
      on a 1-5 analog scale). Depending on the result of tattoo removal, and on skin condition, the
      study treatment will be stopped (if treatment is successful), or may be repeated (up to a
      limit of two additional times) if the tattoo was not completely removed.

      The results of tattoo removal using both washing fluids will be analyzed and compared. A
      result of 3 or more on the brightness change scale will be considered as a successful
      treatment.

      Pharmacokinetic data for washing fluid no. 2 will be collected and analyzed, to provide Cmax
      and AUC.
