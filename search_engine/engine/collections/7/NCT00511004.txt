      treatment of lymphatic filariasis in all parts of the world except Africa. Although the drugs
      have been donated, the cost of such programs is very high and has proven to be a major
      impediment to the success of programs in many countries with limited financial resources.
      Data from albendazole treatment of other filarial infections and one study comparing single
      to multi-dose DEC/albendazole in lymphatic filariasis suggest that increased dose and/or
      frequency of albendazole dosing may be more effective in clearing microfilariae. In this
      study, 75 volunteers with microfilaremic Brugia malayi infection will be randomized to
      receive standard annual therapy (albendazole 400 mg + DEC 300 mg), annual therapy with
      increased dosing of albendazole (albendazole 800 mg + DEC 300 mg), or semiannual therapy with
      an increased albendazole dose (albendazole 800 mg + DEC 300 mg). Microfilarial levels will be
      followed every 6 months for 2 years to determine whether the higher dose, and/or the more
      frequent regimen, is more effective.
