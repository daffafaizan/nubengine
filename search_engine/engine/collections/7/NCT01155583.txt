    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      Define the highest tolerated low dose (HTLD) and safety of azacitidine given at low but
      increasing doses up to 50mg/m2 twice a week concurrently with Glomerular filtration rate
      (GFR)-adjusted lenalidomide and low dose dexamethasone in patients with relapsed or
      refractory multiple myeloma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        -  Response according to international response criteria (≥PR) and clinical benefit
           response (≥minor response according to adapted EBMT criteria)

        -  Correlate response with plasma activity of the azacitidine inactivating enzyme cytidine
           deaminase (CDA)

        -  Progression-free survival and overall survival

        -  Peripheral blood hematopoietic progenitor (CD34+) yield and time to neutrophil and
           platelet recovery in patients undergoing autologous stem cell transplantation

        -  Promoter demethylation and gene reactivation in myeloma cells and hematopoietic
           progenitors treated at the HTLD / HTLD-CKD level after cycle 1

        -  Changes in global gene expression in myeloma cells treated at the HTLD / HTLD-CKD level
           after cycle 1

      OUTLINE:

      This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of azacitidine followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive azacitidine subcutaneously once or twice weekly and oral dexamethasone once
      weekly starting on day 1. Patients also receive oral lenalidomide once daily on days 1-21.
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6 courses. Patients then continue to receive lenalidomide
      as maintenance therapy. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 3 years.
