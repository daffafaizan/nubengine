      their competition seasons. Three teams participated in a seven--month, three--times--a--week
      shoulder--muscle strength--training program while three teams participated in a comparable
      handball training program but did not conduct any specific upper--body strength training.
      Effects of this strength--training program were evaluated by comparing pre-- and
      post--training data from a survey on shoulder complaints based on a self--report
      questionnaire (quick DASH) and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). The players completed the VAS on
      pain once a month. In addition to that the players were tested in a maximum push up test,
      dynamometer test for internal and external rotation strength in the shoulder and throwing
      distance in the pre- and posttest.
