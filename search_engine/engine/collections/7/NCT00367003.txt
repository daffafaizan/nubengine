      depression can be effectively treated in the majority of patients by either medication or
      some form of evidence-based psychotherapy, up to 20% of patients fail to respond to standard
      interventions. For these patients, trial-and-error combinations of multiple medications and
      electroconvulsive therapy are often required. For patients who remain severely depressed
      despite these aggressive approaches, new strategies are needed.

      Converging clinical, biochemical, neuroimaging, and post-mortem data suggest depression is
      unlikely to be a disease of a single brain region or neurotransmitter system. Rather, it is
      now generally viewed as a systems-level disorder affecting integrated pathways linking select
      cortical, subcortical and limbic sites and their related neurotransmitter and molecular
      mediators. Treatments for depression can be viewed within a limbic-cortical system framework,
      where different modes of treatment modulate specific regional targets, resulting in a variety
      of complementary, adaptive chemical and molecular changes that re-establish a normal mood
      state. Functional neuroimaging studies have played a critical role in characterizing these
      limbic-cortical pathways. Previous studies have demonstrated consistent involvement of the
      subgenual cingulate (Cg25) in both acute sadness and antidepressant treatment effects,
      suggesting a critical role for this region in modulating negative mood states.

      This study will test whether high frequency deep brain stimulation of the subgenual cingulate
      white matter (Cg25-DBS) is a safe and efficacious antidepressant treatment in forty patients
      with treatment resistant depression, and to investigate potential mechanisms of action of
      this intervention.
