      EGFR-mutated NSCLC. However, the costs of those new treatments are extremely high.
      Osimertinib is mainly metabolized by CYP3A4, and partially by CYP3A5. Combination of
      osimertinib with a strong CYP3A4-inhibitor may result in a smaller first-pass effect and a
      decreased clearance of osimertinib, thereby increasing the exposure to osimertinib.

      Cobicistat is a strong CYP3A4-inhibitor, this mechanism may be used to boost osimertinib, as
      is done for other drugs, mainly drugs used to treat HIV-infected patients.

      Using this personalized treatment approach and combining the concepts of therapeutic drug
      monitoring (TDM) and pharmacokinetic boosting, osimertinib therapy could become much more
      cost-effective. By reducing the necessary dose of osimertinib, this strategy may ultimately
      result in a significant reduction in drug costs, as the additional expenditure for the CYP3A4
      inhibitor and blood sample analysis are negligible compared to the price of osimertinib.
