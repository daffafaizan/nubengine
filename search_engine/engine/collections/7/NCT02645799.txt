    
      This is a phase IIb, prospective, multi-center, multi-national, randomized, double-blind,
      two-arm, 1:1 (escalating dose LABR-312 vs. placebo) clinical trial.

      In both study arms, all target lesions will be treated with the Resolute Integrity Drug
      Eluting Stent during the index PCI.

      Lesions that are planned to be treated must be declared and recorded at the time of
      randomization.

      Randomization will be stratified by the presence or absence of insulin treatment, HbA1c level
      (<7.5% vs. ≥7.5%), and by pre-procedure monocyte count (≥500/uL or below).

      Subjects (n=~270) will be randomized to receive either the study drug LABR-312 or the
      placebo. Conditionally to ongoing safety monitoring, dose escalation of LABR-312 in the study
      arm will be performed: 0.01 mg (first 45 patients vs. 45 patients receiving placebo), up to
      0.03 mg (next consecutive 45 patients vs. 45 patients receiving placebo) and up to 0.08 mg
      (final 45 consecutive patients vs. 45 patients receiving placebo). If a decision is made not
      to dose escalate, recruitment will continue with the highest dose level deemed safe by the
      ongoing safety monitoring, until approximately 270 subjects are randomized.

      In the LABR-312 group, 3 doses will therefore be tested, resulting in 6 possibilities:

      Group 1: Low dose 0.01 mg LABR-312 or equivalent volume of placebo (saline) administered IV.

      Group 2: Intermediate dose Up to 0.03 mg LABR-312 or equivalent volume of placebo (saline)
      administered IV.

      Group 3: High dose Up to 0.08 mg LABR-312 or equivalent volume of placebo (saline)
      administered IV.

      The duration of subject participation will be 1 year; clinical follow-up will be performed at
      30 days, 9 months, and 1year post randomization.

      OCT follow-up will be performed at 9 months.
