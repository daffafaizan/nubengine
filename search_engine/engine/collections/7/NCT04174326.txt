      may limit or interfere with their everyday activities and Quality of Life (QoL).One possible
      way to help these children is by using a modified cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for pain
      management.

      For this study, the investigators want to do a feasibility study, to see if participating in
      a six-week pain management CBT program for children and youth with CP and their parents,
      leads to better pain coping skills and lower levels of pain interference, when compared to a
      controlled waiting list.

      Participants in both groups (immediate and delayed treatment) will participate in a 2-hour
      CBT session, once a week, for a total of six weeks. Following 3-months from the last CBT
      session, participants will be contacted for a short follow-up screening. All participants
      will be enrolled in the study for a total of 18 weeks.

      This study will be done at the Holland Bloorview Kids Rehabilitation Hospital, Toronto,
      Canada. Sixteen participants with CP (gross motor function classification system (GMFCS)
      levels I-V), age 8 to 18, with evidence of chronic pain (detailed as pain lasting more than 3
      months or lasting longer than the expected time to heal) and their parents, will be recruited
      for participation.
