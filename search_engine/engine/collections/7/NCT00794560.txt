      interventions under daily-practice conditions and facilitates the recruitment of a larger
      number of patients.

      Data collection:

        -  telephone interviews with structured questionnaires at the beginning and at the end of
           the therapy

        -  monitored self-injection in the study center or at patient's home (direct observation
           technique [DOT])

        -  compliance measurement: answers from patient interviews, comparing number of used
           syringes vs. number of prescribed syringes (analogue "pill count"), measuring residual
           volume in recycled syringes

        -  recording of the fine motor skills by the adapted "Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and
           Hand" questionnaire (DASH questionnaire)
