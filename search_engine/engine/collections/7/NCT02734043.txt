      bundled payments for orthopedic procedures. The goal of this work is to provide insights from
      this health system's six years of experience and offer a road map that other organizations
      around the country can use as they plan and implement their own bundled payment programs. The
      investigators will conduct a retrospective analysis on quality and cost data from a health
      system with extensive experience with bundled payments for orthopedic joint replacements. The
      study design will consist of three parts: first, the team will report trends in quality and
      cost outcomes over time using descriptive statistics; second, the team will perform
      multi-variable regression analyses on the data to identify significant predictors of
      different quality and cost outcomes and provide statistical tests on the trends; third, the
      team will evaluate changes in physician and hospital level variation along the outcomes.
