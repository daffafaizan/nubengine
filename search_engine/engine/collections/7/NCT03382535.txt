      part of the study is comparison of two voice therapy methods.

      There are several factors in the classroom that increase teacher's risk of voice disorders.
      One of the most significant is high noise level during lessons. This study explores the noise
      conditions the teachers are working in and how these conditions are related to the voice
      parameters and symptoms.

      Finally, the study aims to determine whether classroom noise level can be lowered by
      improving classroom acoustics and by noise reducing workshops for teachers and pupils.
