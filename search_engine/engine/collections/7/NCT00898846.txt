        -  Identify the prognostic factors in patients with curatively resected stage II colon
           cancer receiving adjuvant chemotherapy with tegafur-uracil.

        -  Identify predictive factors of chemosensitivity to this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Available tumor tissue samples are analyzed by real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR
      for TS, DPD, TP, OPRT, VEGF, cyclooxygenase-2, and FPGS; by PCR for microsatellite
      instability and genomic deletions on chromosome arm 18q; and pathologically for tumor
      budding, Crohn's-like lymphoid reaction, category of extent of poor differentiation, and
      fibrotic cancer stroma. The candidate prognostic and predictive markers are analyzed for
      correlation with disease-free survival, relapse-free survival, and overall survival of
      patients.
