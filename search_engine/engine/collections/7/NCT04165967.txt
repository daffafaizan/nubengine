      patients with melanoma. Due to an immunosuppressive microenvironment, not all patients
      respond to this therapy. In this trial, the immune suppressive microenvironment will be
      targeted by adding a PD-1 blocking antibody in combination with a TIL Transfer.
      Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes will be expanded from resected melanoma samples from the
      patient and expanded TILs will be transferred to the patient after non-myeloablative
      chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine. TIL transfer will be combined with low
      dose IL-2 and nivolumab anti-PD-1 treatment. The study uses a personalized IMP, i.e. TIL
      product and in combination with IL-2 treatment and nivolumab.
