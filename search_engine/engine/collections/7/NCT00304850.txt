      tumorectomy and adenectomy (T1, T2, T3, N0, N1, M0) for breast cancer. Patients will be
      randomly assigned in a 2x2 factorial plan : Group 1 = control (n = 40) ; group 2 = ketamine
      group administered during and 48 hours after a standardized anesthesia (n = 40) ; group 3 =
      polyamine-free diet, 1 week and 72 hours after surgery (n = 40) ; group 4 : ketamine +
      polyamine-free diet (n = 40).

      The amount of morphine for the 24 first postoperative hours will be compared between each
      group as well as pain score, allodynia (Von Frey filaments) and hyperalgesia (algometer).
      Chronic pain occurrence (post-mastectomy pain syndrome) will be evaluated at 3 and 6 months
      using adequate questionnaire ( analgesic scale). Diet observance will be controlled
      preoperatively by a dosage of polyamines in circulating red cells blood.

      Polyamines deprivation and ketamine ability to reduce postoperative pain will be compared
      (isobolographic method). Anti-hyperalgesic properties of ketamine have already been
      demonstrated in urologic, orthopaedic and abdominal surgery. In case of additive or
      synergistic effect of a polyamine deprivation such a strategic could be helpful to achieve
      better postoperative rehabilitation in reducing chronic pain after surgery.
