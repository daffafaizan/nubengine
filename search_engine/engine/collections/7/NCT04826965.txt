    
      Bacterial bio-burden as measured by quantitative microbial PCR prior to debridement,
      immediately following initial debridement, after 2 days of VAC veraflo (or conventional VAC)
      therapy, and at the time of repeat operative debridements, if needed. We will use the
      MicroGen PCR platform (DBA Microgen Diagnostics, LLC, Lubbock, TX.) to report on the
      bacterial burden (reported on a log scale of bacteria per gram) present at the time of
      debridement. Our goal is to be able to assess the bioburden quantitatively at each time point
      to discern a change.

      Exploratory outcomes to be measured: number of operative debridements required prior to
      reconstruction, number of days until final reconstruction, number of days until decision is
      made by surgeon that further debridements are no longer necessary, length of hospital stay,
      wound surface area will be monitored from enrollment through when the veraflo is removed.
      This is likely a 3-month interval.
