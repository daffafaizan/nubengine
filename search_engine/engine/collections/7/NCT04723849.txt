      resveratrol, plus zinc, magnesium, selenium and Vitamin D in a cohort of pediatric subjects
      with obesity. Endothelial function was assessed using two methodologies: a "post occlusive
      release hyperemic test" (PORH) and a "heat provocation test" (HPT). Treatment tablet
      composition (Auxilie® Immuplus, Envicon Medical, Verona, Italy): Vitamin D3: 25,00 mcg, Folic
      acid: 90,00 mcg, Selenium: 55,00 mcg Magnesium: 300,00 mg, Zinc: 7,00 mg, Curcum (Meriva®):
      100,00 mg Polygonum dry extract: 20,41 mg (of which Resveratrol: 20,00 mg), Soy dry extract:
      37,50 mg. Placebo tablet composition: Saccharose, fructose, aroma, anti-agglomerate agents:
      fatty acids magnesium salts, silicium dioxide, colorant: riboflavin 5-sodium phosphate;
      sweetener: stevia glycoside, sucralose, neosperidin DC. Both tablets (treatment and placebo)
      were similar in form, color and flavor.
