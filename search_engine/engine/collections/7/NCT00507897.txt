      functional disorders of thyroid gland, the relationship between thyroid hormones and
      hemodynamic parameters in euthyroid patients remains not enough clear.

      We detect the parameters of blood pressure and thyroid hormones in euthyroid patients with
      thyroid nodules directly before planned operation on the thyroid gland.

      As the study is carries out directly before operation, that assumes presence of preoperative
      stress in patients, activity of the sympatho - adrenal system is estimated in addition.

      On the one hand, the design of our research will allow to estimate relationship of thyroid
      hormones with the parameters of blood pressure in conditions of euthyroidism, on the other
      hand - to investigate features of blood pressure in patients with thyroid nodules.

      The research of the patients in the preoperative period will enable to select the group of
      patients without pathology of cardiovascular system whose increased blood pressure is
      connected with preoperative stress, that in turn will allow to exclude influence of the
      pathology of the cardiovascular system on studied correlation.
