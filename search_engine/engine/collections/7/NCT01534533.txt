      which are the top two causes of death in industrialized countries including China. Lutein was
      found to be protective against atherosclerosis in some case control studies. However, the
      intervention on atherosclerosis have not been reported. In the present study, 192 subjects
      were randomly assigned to four groups treated with different amounts of lutein. The
      investigators observe the changes of serum lutein concentration by hyper-pressure liquid
      chromatography (HPLC), and compare the differences of common carotid IMT and arterial
      stiffness by carotid ultrasonography before and after the intervention. Serum biochemistry
      indexes including cholesterol (CHO), triglyceride (TG), high density lipoprotein-cholesterol
      (HDL-C), low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) and glucose (Glu) were measured at 0, 7
      and 12 months of treatment by auto-analyzer.
