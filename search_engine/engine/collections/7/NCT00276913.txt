      hematologic malignancies. STA-5312 will be administered intravenously. Administration is
      anticipated to take 1 hour, although infusion time may be extended when appropriate with
      large infusion volumes. A treatment cycle is 4 weeks with a weekly infusion of STA 5312 for
      the first 3 weeks of each 4 week cycle. The planned treatment schedule is 2 cycles of
      STA-5312 treatment (8 weeks). Decisions regarding dose escalation and DLT determination will
      be made based on observations during the first cycle of therapy. Subjects who tolerate
      treatment may be eligible to continue receiving additional cycles of STA 5312 per the
      investigator's medical judgment. Evaluation of antitumor response will be performed after
      every 2 cycles of STA 5312 administration.

      The initial dose level of STA 5312 will be 6 mg/m2. The starting dose level was chosen based
      on preclinical animal studies that used alternate day dosing x 3/week on alternate weeks. The
      dose level of 6 mg/m2 represents less than 1/10 the weekly dose (3 mg/m2 x 3) that
      demonstrated severe toxicity. Subsequent dose escalations will follow an accelerated
      titration design once the 8 mg/m2 cohort is completed No fewer than 3 patients will be
      enrolled at each dose level. Once a DLT is observed the cohort will be expanded to at least
      six subjects. If one-third of at least 6 subjects treated at a dose level experience a DLT,
      dose escalation will terminate. The dose below this will be considered the MTD and will be
      expanded to at least 12 subjects to collect additional safety and pharmacokinetic data. No
      intrasubject dose escalations will occur.
