    
      This is a monocentre randomized pilot study. All patients received CVVHD with MCO filter
      (Ultraflux® EMiC®2) and post-Continuous Veno-Venous Hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) with
      HFF(AV1000S®) in a controlled randomized (1:1) blinded manner. Crossover randomized to
      sequence (A+B or B+A) for 48 h total without washout.

      The efficiency of the filters for small and middle molecules was compared in septic shock
      patients with AKI stage 3.
