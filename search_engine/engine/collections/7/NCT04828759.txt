      participants' experiences of this novel kind of language intervention. The effects of the
      intervention will be studied with various outcome measures in terms of language performance,
      functional communication, and quality of life. The aim is to explore the VR-intervention on
      the group level and with a randomized waitlist control group design (or delayed crossover
      design). In this study, the people with aphasia will be practicing at their home with support
      of their relatives, and participants will also receive regular remote guidance by a speech
      and language therapist (SLT) during the intervention. The relatives are also involved in the
      assessment process.
