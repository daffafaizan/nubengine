        -  Compare the effect of immunization with GM2-KLH and QS21 to observation on the
           disease-free survival of patients with primary cutaneous stage II melanoma after
           adequate surgery.

        -  Determine overall survival and toxicity in the two treatment arms.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, parallel, multicenter study. Patients are
      stratified according to participating center, tumor thickness (greater than 1.5 to 3.0 mm vs
      greater than 3.0 to 4.0 mm vs greater than 4.0 mm), gender, ulceration (yes vs no), and
      presence of additional staging procedures of regional lymph nodes (yes vs no). Patients are
      randomized to one of two arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients are vaccinated with GM2-KLH and QS21 subcutaneously on day 1 of weeks
           1-4, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, 120, and 144 for a total of 14 vaccinations.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo observation. Patients are followed every 6 months for 7 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1300 patients (650 per arm) will be accrued for this study
      within 36 months.
