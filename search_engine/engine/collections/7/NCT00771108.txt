      The prevalence of NAFLD is four to five times higher in obese than lean persons and is
      associated with insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome. Decreasing calorie intake and
      increasing physical activity has been recommended as primary therapy for NAFLD, but the
      independent effect of aerobic exercise is unknown. The current exercise guidelines for
      disease prevention and weight management range from 150 min/wk, recommended by the Centers
      for Disease Control and the American College of Sports Medicine, to 300 min/wk, recommended
      by the Institute of Medicine. However, it is not known whether aerobic exercise alone can
      improve NAFLD, and which recommended dose of exercise might have the most beneficial effects.
      The purpose of this proposal is to determine the effect of moderate intensity endurance
      exercise on: 1) hepatic fat content; 2) hepatic lipoprotein kinetics; and 3) plasma
      inflammatory markers. We hypothesize that aerobic exercise will decrease hepatic fat content,
      improve VLDL kinetics, and decrease inflammation in a dose-dependent fashion. The results
      from this study will help determine exercise guidelines for obese patients with NAFLD, and
      lay the groundwork for future studies evaluating the effects of exercise on metabolic
      diseases associated with obesity.

      This proposal involves conducting a randomized controlled trial that will randomize obese
      subjects with NAFLD (> 10% hepatic fat content) to one of two groups: Group 1 (Control, no
      exercise) and Group 2 (Moderate Intensity Aerobic Exercise- 150 min/wk to 300 min/wk of
      supervised exercise performed at 45-55% of O2 max).
