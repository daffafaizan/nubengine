      however, the detection rate of heart defect are only around 50%. In this study we use color
      Doppler at three different levels in the fetal heart; the four chamber view, the outlet of
      the aorta on on the level of the great arteries.

      All heart defects at delivery are recorded and compared with the ultrasound findings.
