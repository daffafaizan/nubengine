      general anesthesia, and test whether the changes of serum calcium ion, inflammatory factors
      and orphanin fQ are correlated. By prospective case study controlled study of diabetes
      (research group) general anesthesia surgery and the non-general anesthesia surgery of
      diabetes patients (control group), through the assessment of cognitive function and serum
      calcium ion, inflammation factors and the change of isolated brown peptide content to watch,
      in order to obtain reliable data to explore consciousness change changes of cognitive
      function in patients with diabetes and cognitive function in the process of the change of
      serum calcium ion concentration, the corresponding inflammation factors and solitary brown
      peptide content if there is a corresponding changes.The medical records of the patients were
      recorded. General information of the selected patients was recorded: gender, age, relevant
      medical history;Test results: blood glucose, hemoglobin , blood pressure;Drug use of
      patients: blood pressure drugs, hypoglycemic drugs, insulin, etc.;To observe and compare the
      changes of cognitive function between the control group and the study group, to detect the
      levels of calcium ion and orphanin fQ, and to conduct correlation analysis.To seek new
      theoretical basis and take corresponding treatment measures to improve the prognosis of
      patients with diabetic cognitive dysfunction and the quality of anesthesia surgery.

      Objective: To investigate the changes of cognitive function and serum levels of calcium,
      inflammatory factors and orphanin fQ in diabetic patients under general anesthesia and
      non-general anesthesia.

      Methods: the general anesthesia surgery of patients with diabetes is set to the team (group
      A), and to the general anesthesia surgery of diabetic patients as control group (group B),
      and then measured preoperative serum calcium ion concentration in patients with general
      anesthesia and solitary brown peptide content, intraoperative blood serum calcium ion
      concentration and solitary fei peptide content, and postoperative serum calcium and solitary
      brown peptide content. Postoperative cognitive function were evaluated in both
      groups.Finally, the two groups of patients were screened and the inconsistent medical records
      were eliminated.Observation indicators: Endothelin, C-reactive protein, nitric oxide,
      interleukin-6, calcium ion concentration, orphanin fq concentration, glycated hemoglobin
      value and blood glucose value were observed before, during and after operation.

      The cognitive function of diabetic patients after surgery was observed. The cognitive
      function was evaluated with the cognitive function assessment scale 24 hours after surgery,
      respectively, and scores were obtained.

      Statistical processing: Statistical Product and Service Solutions （SPSS ）21.0 statistical
      software was used for data analysis. Measurement data consistent with normal distribution
      were expressed as (mean±SD). Independent sample T-test was used for data comparison between
      the two groups.Repeated measurement data were compared by repeated measurement anOVA, and P <
      0.05 was considered statistically significant.

      Expected results: Compared with the clinical data of the control group and the study group,
      the cognitive function of patients in the study group was lower than that in the control
      group, the serum levels of orphanin fq in the analysis group were higher than those in the
      control group, and the levels of calcium ions in the analysis group were lower than those in
      the control group, and the differences were statistically significant.The results showed that
      when the cognitive function decreased, the content of orphanin fq increased, the content of
      corresponding inflammatory factors increased, and the content of calcium decreased,
      indicating that the change of consciousness state and cognitive function were correlated with
      the orphanin fQ system.
