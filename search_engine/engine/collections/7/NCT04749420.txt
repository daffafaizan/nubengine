      hand and is accompanied by motor and / or sensory defects. These symptoms often have an
      intensity that prevents normal function. For individuals with cervical radicular syndrome,
      there is a lack of a patient-reported outcome measurement tool to measure the impact of the
      disorder. The Cervical Radiculopathy Impact Scale (CRIS), which focuses on the symptoms and
      functionality of the arm and neck, was developed to improve the quality of studies on
      cervical radicular syndrome. CRIS is a newly developed self-report questionnaire that covers
      the measurement of symptoms and limitations in individuals with cervical radiculopathy due to
      pain, tingling sensation, and loss of sensation in the arm with neck discomfort. The CRIS
      consists of 21 items divided into three subscales: (i) symptoms, (ii) energy and postures,
      and (iii) actions and activities. Each item contains a likert type answer and takes a value
      between 1 and 5. The study is planned with 105 individuals with hip disease. After
      questioning the sociodemographic characteristics of the individuals, the patients will be
      asked to fill in CRIS, EQ-5D Health-Related Quality of Life Questionnaire, Neck Disability
      Index, Quick Disabilities of the Arm Shoulder and Hand, Brief Illness Perception
      Questionnaire, Short Form-36 and Visual Analog Scale. Test-retest will be re-applied to those
      of the same individuals who can be reached after 1 week. The results will be analyzed using
      the SPSS version 22.0 computer package program.
