      intervention addressing tobacco use and heavy episodic drinking, tailored to readiness to
      quit smoking; or (2) a 3-month Facebook intervention targeting tobacco use. Both
      interventions will include 12 weeks of Facebook-based messages and activities tailored to
      participants' readiness to quit smoking.

      Assessments will occur at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months follow-up. Assessments will include
      measures on smoking and drinking patterns and thoughts about abstinence. All participants who
      report no past 7-day smoking will be asked to give biochemical verification of smoking status
      with saliva cotinine test kits that will be mailed to participants.
