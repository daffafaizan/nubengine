      quantitatively. For this balance assessment system, a balance board will be developed that
      will work with inertial sensors and detect the oscillations of the individual trying to stand
      on balance. The validity and reliability of the balance score determined by the analysis of
      the oscillation data of this balance board will be investigated.

      Our hypothesis is that the correlation between the balance score revealed by the newly
      developed evaluation system and the results of clinical and instrumental balance assessment
      methods will be significant. For this, one commonly used clinic and one instrumental balance
      assessment method will be used. Star Excursion Balance Test as a clinical balance assessment
      method and Balance Master device (BMc) as an instrumental balance assessment method were
      evaluated. Limits of Stability Test (LOS) and Modified Clinical Test of Sensory Interaction
      in Balance (mCTSIB) were used in the BMc.
