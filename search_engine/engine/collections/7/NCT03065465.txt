      hemostasis has revolutionized management of these patients. Despite standard endoscopic
      treatment and high dose proton pump infusions, 25% - 30% of high risk patients with UGIB from
      ulcers or other non-variceal UGI lesions (NVUGI) had recurrent bleeding in a recent RCT and
      cohort studies by our group. Potential risk factors for NVUGI rebleeding were large ulcers (≥
      15 mm), fibrotic bases, Dieulafoy's lesions, anastomotic ulcers, coagulopathies, cirrhosis,
      other severe co-morbidities and residual arterial blood flow under stigmata of recent
      hemorrhage (SRH) after endoscopic treatment. Such patients with rebleeding after standard
      endoscopic hemostasis usually required angiography (by interventional radiologists-IR) or
      surgery for definitive hemostasis. A new, large, FDA approved, over-the-scope hemoclipping
      device (OTSC® System OVESCO Endoscopy, Tübingen, Germany) can capture larger amounts of
      tissue and underlying arteries than standard hemoclips and potentially can improve endoscopic
      hemostasis of such bleeding lesions.
