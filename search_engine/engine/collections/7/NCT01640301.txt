    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the safety and potential toxicities associated with treating patients with high
      risk or relapsed AML, MDS, and CML after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT)
      by adoptive transfer of virus-specific cluster of differentiation (CD)8 T cells
      genetically-modified to express a high affinity Wilms tumor 1 (WT1)-specific T cell receptor
      (TCR).

      II. Determine the anti-leukemic activity associated with treating patients with relapsed AML,
      MDS and CML after allogeneic HCT by adoptive transfer of virus-specific CD8 T cells
      genetically-modified to express a high affinity WT1-specific T cell receptor (TCR).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the in vivo persistence of transferred T cells and ability to migrate to and
      accumulate in bone marrow.

      II. Determine the maintenance of TCR expression and function of transduced T cells.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients with no evidence of leukemia post-HCT receive WT1-sensitized T cells
      intravenously (IV) over 45 minutes (or longer for patients who are 15-30 kg) on days 0 and 14
      and aldesleukin subcutaneously (SC) twice daily (BID) on days 14-28.

      ARM II: Patients with evidence of AML (minimal residual disease or overt relapse) post-HCT
      receive cyclophosphamide IV and fludarabine phosphate IV daily on days -4 to -2. Patients
      also receive WT1-sensitized T cells IV over 45 minutes (or longer for patients who are 15-30
      kg) on days 0 and 21 and aldesleukin SC BID on days 14-28.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up weekly for 4 weeks, at weeks 6
      and 8, at 3, 6, 12 months, and then annually for up to 15 years.
