      microbiota composition, in particular to a growth stimulation of bifidobacteria, and the
      production of organic acids like lactate and short-chain fatty acids (SCFA). The introduction
      of solid foods is frequently associated with harder stools which are more difficult to pass
      and can cause painful defecations. Subsequently, the changes in bowel habits associated with
      weaning and the introduction of complementary foods could be minimized by the addition of
      prebiotics to complementary foods and, thus, the transition from milk-feeding to family food
      could be facilitated.
