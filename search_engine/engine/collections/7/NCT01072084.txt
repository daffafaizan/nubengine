      gastrointestinal tract and the histological analysis of taken biopsies of the intestinal
      mucosa are basic instruments in the diagnostic of food allergy. With modern high-resolution
      video endoscopy the intestinal mucosa can be investigated on inflamed areas and can evaluate
      several of differential diagnosis. With the implementation of a fluorescein based confocal
      laser endoscope the intestinal mucosa can be magnified 1000 fold, so that even next to the
      macroscopic investigation the cellular patterns can be analyzed. The laser endoscope offers
      for the first time an in vivo presentation of cellular structures. Our study group could
      utilise for the first time the laser endoscope in patients with colitis ulcerosa for cancer
      prevention. Hereby, the cancer prediction could be enhanced obviously. Furthermore, we
      conducted these investigations in more than 1500 patients und could present that this method
      is a safety method.

      Based on these investigations we want to implement now the laser endoscope in the diagnostic
      field of food allergy. Patient wit food allergy generates through the intestinal mediators
      and histamine secretion an oedema, an increase of inflammatory cells, vasodilatation and
      expansion of lymph nodes. In comparison of patients with food allergy to healthy subjects,
      the degree of oedema formation, the amount of cell infiltration and the expansion of lymph
      nodes will be evaluated.

      The aim of the present study is to detect these cellular structures in patients with food
      allergy and to open with that a new diagnostic option in patient with an allergy disease.
