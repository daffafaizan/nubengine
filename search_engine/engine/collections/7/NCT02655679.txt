    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled study to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and preliminary clinical efficacy of
      VTP-38543 following twice-daily, every twelve hours (Q12h) administration for 28 days in
      otherwise healthy adult male and female participants with mild to moderate atopic dermatitis.

      Evaluation of three ascending doses in three dose panels is planned for this trial. Dose
      Panel 1 (VTP-38543 0.05%) and Panel 2 (VTP-38543 0.15%) will each enroll 30 participants and
      randomize 20 to VTP-38543 and 10 to matching vehicle control (Vehicle without Transcutol®P).
      Dose Panel 3 (VTP-38543 1%) will enroll 40 participants and randomize 20 to VTP-38543 and 20
      to matching vehicle control (Vehicle with Transcutol®P). A total of approximately 100
      participants will participate in the trial.
