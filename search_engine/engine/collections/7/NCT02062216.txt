      macrophages/foam cell accumulation beneath the arterial intima. Immune competent cells are
      abundant in atherosclerotic lesions, where they produce mainly proinflammatory cytokines.
      Macrophages play a central role in each stage of the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. At the
      beginning, the so-called foam cells contribute to the formation of early lesions; in mature
      plaques, macrophages constitute 50% of the cells in the lesion; finally, they are involved in
      the mechanisms leading to plaque rupture.

      The primary objective of this study is to assess whether the inflammatory receptors play a
      role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.
