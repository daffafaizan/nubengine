      body. CP 870,893 was produced in cells grown from a hamster but is fully human in
      composition. The vaccine contains peptides (pieces) from two different proteins called
      NY-ESO-1 and gp100. Each one is made by 50-100% of melanomas. These proteins can be
      recognized by the immune system. They will be injected under the skin of the participant's
      thigh in combination with, or without an oil-based substance, called "Montanide ISA 51 VG".
      The Montanide ISA 51 VG is an adjuvant or "assistant" which stimulates the body's immune
      system. The peptides in the vaccine, the Montanide ISA 51 VG, the Oncovir poly IC:LC and the
      CP 870,893 antibody are not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) but the FDA is
      permitting their use in this study. It is believed that the CP 870,893 and the Oncovir poly
      IC:LC will boost the body's immune response against the melanoma vaccine, although this
      vaccine has not been proven to help the patient's melanoma.
