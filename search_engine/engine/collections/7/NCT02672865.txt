    
      Treatment Plan:

      Patients undergoing definitive resection for gastric cancer and meeting the eligibility
      criteria will be treated with HIPEC using a single dose of Mitomycin 15mg/m2 and Cisplatin
      50mg/m2 at 41-42 C for 90 minutes. HIPEC will be performed after resection but before
      anastomosis. Both Cisplatin and Mitomycin are commercially available chemotherapeutic agents
      and will be obtained as marketed drugs.

      Outcome Measures:

      Patients will be followed for 90 days following surgery. All postoperative complications will
      be recorded and graded according to the modified Clavien-Dindo classification.

      Schedule for Follow Up:

      Trial-related patient assessments will be performed daily while the patient remains in the
      hospital for postoperative care, and then during postoperative clinic visits. The final
      postoperative clinic visit for evaluation of study outcomes and complications should occur
      between postoperative days 90 and 95 to allow for a cumulative assessment of the patient's
      perioperative complications, if any.
