      children. Many common household substances can trigger or worsen an asthma attack. It is
      important for people to reduce household allergens and learn effective treatments for
      specific types of asthma. Inhaled short-acting beta agonist such as albuterol is the standard
      treatment for mild, intermittent asthma. However, recent studies have shown that adding
      allergen-specific immunotherapy to your current asthma therapy can help to control asthma
      symptoms. This study will determine the safety and effectiveness of SLIT in two different
      dosing regimens in treating patients with house dust mite-induced allergic rhinitis/mild
      intermittent asthma.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive low dose SLIT, high dose SLIT, or placebo
      for at least 12 months. House dsut mite-induced allergy skin tests will be performed at study
      entry, at selected timepoints throughout the study, and at the end of the study. The tests
      will determine whether SLIT creates an immune tolerance state as well as whether SLIT acts
      via local or systemic immunological systems.
