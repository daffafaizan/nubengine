      is 2 to 5 cases / 100,000 inhabitants / year. The potentially serious haemorrhagic risk is
      the major issue of management. A recent international consensus conference classifies PTI
      according to the duration of thrombocytopenia: acute ITP (<3 months), persistent ITP (3-12
      months) and chronic ITP (> 12 months) (Rodeghiero 2009). In the acute or persistent phase,
      polyvalent immunoglobulins (IVIG) and / or corticosteroids are proposed. In the chronic
      phase, splenectomy is a possible cure for 70% of patients. No predictor of treatment response
      is known.

      The pathophysiology of ITP is multifactorial: platelet phagocytosis, mediated by
      autoantibody, macrophages of the reticuloendothelial system, and destruction in the spleen,
      genetic background and / or environmental factor favoring the role of certain lymphocyte
      subpopulations, cytotoxic or regulatory T, via their cytokine environment, abnormalities of
      thrombopoiesis.

      ITP affects children as well as adults, but the evolutionary profile is very different. In
      children, ITP, which is often post-infectious, is acute in 80% of cases, whereas ITP in
      adults has a chronic evolution in 80% of cases. The primary diagnostic and therapeutic
      practices are similar. The reasons for these evolutionary differences are not known and
      little studied.

      Is the orientation of the hemato-immunological response observed during the first episode of
      ITP different in children and adults? Do these differences explain the evolutionary
      specificities of the two age groups? Are there hematologic parameters predictive of a
      response to initial treatments?
