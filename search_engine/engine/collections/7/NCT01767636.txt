      I. To determine the efficacy of pazopanib hydrochloride (pazopanib) in non clear cell
      metastatic renal cell cancer patients as assessed by the overall survival rate at 12 months.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the rates of best tumor response at the end of the first two treatment cycles
      of pazopanib in non clear cell metastatic renal cell cancer patients.

      II. To determine the benefit of pazopanib in increasing progression free survival time.

      III. To describe toxicity profile of pazopanib in non clear cell metastatic renal cell cancer
      patients.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pazopanib hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 2 years.
