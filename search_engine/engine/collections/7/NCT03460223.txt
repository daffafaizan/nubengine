      stem cells to treat kidney failure was recently confirmed. In particular, mesenchymal stem
      cell (MSC) transplantation has been applicated in the clinic for treat several human diseases
      such as GVHD, kidyney injury and displayed good tolerance and efficiency. The purpose of this
      study is to learn whether and how MSCs (MSC) can improve the disease conditions in patients
      with kidney fibrosis. This study will also look at safety in these patients.
