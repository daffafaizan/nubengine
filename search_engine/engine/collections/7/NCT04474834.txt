      into a standard breast cancer risk reduction consultation, followed by annual surveys over 10
      years to determine if and how the availability of the PRS influenced patient decisions
      regarding preventive medicine and medication compliance. Because women know beforehand that
      the PRS is pending, study participants will be advised that a final decision to take
      preventive medicine must be deferred until after the PRS results are made available.
      Nevertheless, a survey of understanding of risk and benefit and assessment of willingness to
      take preventive medicine will be done prior to receiving the PRS results and then another
      survey will be completed after receiving the PRS score.
