    
      This protocol involves a randomized controlled trial (N=240) to test the efficacy of the Deep
      south Active Lifestyle (DIAL intervention) telephone-based physical activity counseling
      intervention vs. a wait list condition. Assessments of MVPA and psychosocial variables will
      occur at baseline, 6, 12, and 18 months.

      Primary aim. Test the efficacy of DIAL intervention vs. wait list control. Hypotheses are
      that the participants receiving DIAL intervention will report significantly greater increases
      in MVPA (based on 7-Day Physical Activity Recalls, accelerometers) from baseline to 6 and 12
      months than the wait list control arm.

      Exploratory Aims. Examine 1) Intervention effects on physical performance and psychosocial
      variables (anxiety, depression, fatigue, sleep disturbance; corroborate self report sleep
      improvements from pilot with accelerometry); 2) Changes in MVPA from 12-18 months to assess
      long term (6 months post-intervention) maintenance in the intervention arm and ascertain
      replicability of intervention effects in wait list control arm; 3) Intervention costs; 4)
      Potential mediators (social support from family, friends, CHAs, theoretical constructs
      directly targeted by the intervention) and moderators (education, neighborhood/environmental
      features) of treatment efficacy; 5) Potential barriers/ facilitators to widespread
      implementation of DIAL intervention in rural Black belt counties by Deep South Network for
      Cancer Control.

      This proposal tests an intervention which acts on multiple levels of the socio-ecological
      model and uses IVR technology to enhance the potential for scaling and sustainability for
      broad use in populations at high risk for sedentary behavior (residents of rural Black
      counties in the Deep South).
