      study with two parallel groups. Subjects in the co-administration group will be administered
      the DPT-IPV vaccine according to a 3, 4, 6 month schedule and the liquid HRV vaccine
      according to a 2, 3 month schedule. Subjects in the staggered group will be administered the
      DPT-IPV vaccine according to a 3, 4.5, 6 month schedule and the liquid HRV vaccine according
      to a 2, 3.5 month schedule. The intended duration of the study, per subject, is 5 months.

      A sub-cohort of subjects (HRV Immunogenicity sub-cohort) from both the study groups will
      include the first 73 subjects enrolled into the study to assess the serum anti-RV IgA
      seropositivity and Geometric Mean Concentrations (GMC).
