      Sjögren's syndrome and 58 eyes of 31 patients with non-Sjögren's syndrome) were treated with
      either 20% autologous serum (41 eyes of 21 patients) or umbilical cord serum eyedrops (51
      eyes of 27 patients). Symptom scoring, corneal sensitivity test, tear film break-up time
      (BUT), Schirmer test, tear clearance rate (TCR), corneal fluorescein staining, and
      conjunctival impression cytology were performed before and 1 month and 2 months after
      treatment.
