        -  Single: Walking without task at a self-selected speed

        -  Cognitive Task (CT): Walking while counting down rhythmically from 20 in threes

        -  Motor Task (MT): Walking while carrying an empty box

        -  CT + MT: Walking while carrying an empty box and counting down rhythmically from 20 in
           threes

      The task was explained to individuals by a physiotherapist. The individuals were not allowed
      to use orthosis during walking performance. Running was not accepted. 30 seconds were given
      to take a break between tasks. The physiotherapist followed the individuals along the track
      in case of any falling. If the child was not able to complete the track (falling or need to
      rest), the evaluation was accepted uncomplete and was excluded from the database.

      The Kinovea-08.15 software program was used to assess all of the outputs (images and videos)
      from the camera
