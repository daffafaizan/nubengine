      non-fasting plasma triglycerides (TG), low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) -cholesterol and
      preponderance of small dense low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles nominated as the
      atherogenic lipid triad. Humans are mostly in a postprandial rather than fasting state and
      therefore non-fasting TG values reflect more accurately the continuous exposure of arterial
      wall to triglyceride rich lipoproteins (TRLs) and more importantly, to substantial
      cholesterol load that these particles deliver.

      Postprandial lipemia is highly prevalent even in type 2 diabetes patients with normal fasting
      TG concentrations. Intestinal overproduction of chylomicrons (CMs) and the structural protein
      apolipoprotein (apo)-B48 has been identified as an integral feature of postprandial lipemia
      in type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance. It is clinically important to elucidate the
      mechanism for delayed postprandial lipemia and the interactions between dysglycemia and
      dyslipidemia in type 2 diabetes patients.
