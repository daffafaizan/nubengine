    
      Primary Objective:

      To evaluate the rate of peptide-specific CTL induction to S-588210 within the first 8 months
      in HLA-A*02:01-positive patients with MPM who have not progressed on first-line
      pemetrexed-based chemotherapy treated on a weekly or every other week vaccination schedule.

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. To evaluate the safety of S-588210 in HLA-A*02:01-positive patients with MPM treated
           with S-588210

        2. To determine the disease control rate (DCR) in HLA-A*02:01-positive patients with MPM
           treated with S-588210

        3. To determine the progression-free-survival (PFS) in HLA-A*02:01-positive patients with
           MPM who have not progressed on first-line pemetrexed-based chemotherapy and who are
           treated with S-588210

        4. To evaluate the peptide-specific CTL response to S-588210 over time up to 8 months in
           HLA-A*02:01-positive patients with MPM who have not progressed on first-line
           pemetrexed-based chemotherapy
