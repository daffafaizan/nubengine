      lumborum block as a postoperative analgesic modality after major abdominal surgery in
      comparison to epidural block and its effects on total rescue analgesic requirements in the
      1st postoperative 24hours, time to first analgesic request, pain VAS scores, intraoperative
      and postoperative hemodynamics and postoperative opioid-related side effects.

      Under complete aseptic conditions, the patients will receive either thoracic epidural block
      or bilateral ultrasound-guided quadratus lumborum block after induction of general
      anaesthesia
