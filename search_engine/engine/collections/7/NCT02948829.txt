      safety up to 3 years post second TDV administration to healthy children aged 4 to 16 years
      and in dengue endemic regions.

      The study enrolled 200 participants. Participants received:

      â€¢ TDV 0.5 mL subcutaneous (SC) injection into the upper arm at Day 1 (Month 0) and at Day 90
      (Month 3).

      This multi-center trial was conducted in Panama and Philippines. 198 participants received
      the 2-dose schedule of TDV, and 2 participants received only the first dose of TDV (Day 1).
      Participants made multiple visits to the clinic and were contacted at least every week for
      the entire study duration post first injection.
