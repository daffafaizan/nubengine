    
      Hallux Abducto Valgus is a frequent pathology with a prevalence of 30% in women and 13% in
      men. The tendency is to increase with age.

      Usually, the elected treatment is surgery, as the conservative orthopedic methods are used at
      the early stages of the pathology. Global Postural Re-Education is a manual therapy treatment
      method through which we can treat lots of pathologies. Some investigations demonstrate
      Postural Re-Education is effective for the treatment of temporomandibular disorders, urinary
      incontinence, and spine disorders, but there is no scientific evidence that defends the
      improvement of the symptoms and correction of the angle of the Hallux Abducto Valgus using
      Postural Re-Education.
