      darapladib 160 mg once a day, a selective, reversible, orally active inhibitor of plasma and
      vascular Lp-PLA2, on coronary endothelial function, progression of coronary atherosclerosis
      as determined by intravascular ultrasound (IVUS), and atherosclerosis in patients with early
      atherosclerosis. Patients with evidence of coronary endothelial dysfunction, as determined by
      intracoronary administration of acetylcholine during angiography and IVUS, will be followed
      for 6 months during once daily dosing of darapladib. Coronary endothelial function is
      determined by the changes in coronary artery diameter and coronary blood flow response to the
      intracoronary administration of acetylcholine and adenosine. The patients will be followed in
      clinic 6 months. They will have follow-up angiography, assessment of endothelial function,
      and IVUS during the six month visit.
