    
      This randomized, double-blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled study will evaluate the
      effect of a fixed 30 mg dose of benralizumab administered subcutaneously every 4 weeks for 3
      doses on allergen-induced inflammation in subjects with mild atopic asthma challenged with an
      inhaled allergen.

      Approximately 38 non-smoking men and women (18 - 65 years of age) corticosteroid-free (oral
      and inhaled) mild, atopic asthmatics who have demonstrated a dual (early and late) asthmatic
      response to inhaled allergen challenge at screening will be recruited to complete the study.
