      intervention with XNKQ acupuncture and to build a foundation for future studies with stroke
      patients our study aims to evaluate changes of brain activity and brain structure in healthy
      subjects after XNKQ acupuncture in comparison to three control interventions. We will use
      EEG, structural MRI, and resting-state functional connectivity MRI to assess neuronal
      responses in 28 healthy subjects to a) strong manual needle-stimulation of the acupuncture
      points DU26, PC6 and SP6 (XNKQ acupuncture), b) insertion of needles on the acupuncture
      points DU26, PC6 and SP6 without stimulation (control 1), c) strong manual needle stimulation
      of three non-acupuncture points (control 2), and d) insertion of needles on three
      non-acupuncture points without stimulation (control 3). With this, our study aims to create
      results which inform future studies in patients and might be helpful for the rehabilitation
      of deficits after stroke.
