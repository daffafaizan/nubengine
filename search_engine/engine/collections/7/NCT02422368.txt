      TED either by enhancing improvement or preventing worsening in patients with Moderate to
      severe TED thyroid eye disease (TED) based on:

        1. Total eye score (NOSPECS severity score) 1 Total eye score is used to assess the
           severity of TED, which was calculated by multiplying each class of the NOSPECS system1
           (except class 0) to its grade of severity (0-3), yielding a maximum total score of 63
           and a minimum total score of 0 (the higher the number the worse the severity) The
           overall ophthalmic outcome is a composite score based on multiple items (Soft tissue,
           retraction, proptosis, diplopia, and corneal involvement); the use of a composite score
           circumvents the problem arising from the presence of improvement in one item and
           simultaneous worsening in another item.

           The severity score in each of the classes 1, 2, 3, and 4 will also be separately
           compared to evaluate the effect of different treatments on each sign.

        2. Score of thyroid eye disease Quality of life questionnaire (TED-QOL) 2.

      Secondary outcomes measures:

      To compare possible change in:

        1. Clinical activity score (CAS Score) 3 (7 items are scored in the beginning and 10 items
           are scored at 3 and 6 months)

        2. Serum thyroid auto-antibodies (Anti-thyroid peroxidase (TPO), Anti-thyroglobulin) at 0,
           3 and 6 months. Thyroid function test (Free T4, T3, and TSH) will be measured in all 3
           visits0

        3. Side effects
