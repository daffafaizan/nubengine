      processed into personalized Chaperone Rich Cell Lysate (CRCL) vaccine. This study consists of
      three phases: priming phase, vaccination phase, and activation phase. The priming phase
      involves intradermal injections of AlloStim(TM). The aim of this phase is to increase the
      titer of Th1 immune cells in circulation. The vaccination phase involves the intradermal
      injections of AlloSim(TM) immediately followed by the intradermal injections of CRCL. This
      phase is designed to elicit tumor-specific immunity. The activation phase involves
      intravenous infusion of AlloStim(TM). This phase is designed to activate memory cells and NK
      cells and cause them to extravasate and traffic to tumor sites.
