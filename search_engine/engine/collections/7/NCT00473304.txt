      subjects will wear the study lenses for 3-months daily wear. 1-Day Acuvue will be worn by
      spherical subjects and 1-Day Acuvue for Astigmatism will be worn by astigmats.

      There is a total of 4 study visits (baseline, contact fitting and dispensing, 1 week, 1 month
      and 3 month follow-up). Tests conducted include manifest refraction and over-refraction,
      keratometry, visual acuity, ACA ratio, lens fit assessment, slit lamp biomicroscopy and
      parent/patient questionaires.

      Each child was provided with a supply of lenses to last until the next scheduled follow-up
      visit, unit-dose rewetting drops for rinsing their lenses if necessary, and a daily log to
      complete each day until the next follow-up visit.

      Informed consent was obtained from all subjects after the nature of the study had been fully
      explained. The study gained approval from the Ethics Committee of the Singapore Eye Research
      Institute.
