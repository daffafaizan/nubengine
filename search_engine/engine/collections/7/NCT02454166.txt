    
      Methods: The investigators use the ischemic stroke TCM syndromes Diagnostic Scale (ISTCMDS)
      and the Meridian Energy Analysis Device (M.E.A.D.) to objectively analyze the diagnostic
      elements and detect the deficiency or excess performance of meridians of acute ischemic
      stroke patients from Stroke Center at Linkou Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. The onset of
      stroke is set Within 7 days, and the investigators expected to collect 300 patients. The
      investigators initially establish the scientific epidemiological study of acute ischemic
      stroke with TCM syndromes and deficiency or excess of meridian performances through
      statistical analysis to become a standard of Chinese and Western medicine integration. The
      data collection can gradually become a library, which will facilitate the assessment of the
      clinical efficacy of TCM adjuvant therapy and become a basis to assist Western and Chinese
      medicine integration.
