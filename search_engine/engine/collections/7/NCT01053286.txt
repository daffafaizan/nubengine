      setting. The list of possible causes is large, ranging from strokes and neurological disease
      through to complications of cancer treatment, acid reflux, and surgery. Many patients have a
      reduced ability to feel food and fluid (reduced sensation) within the throat (pharynx) and
      this leads to inability to manipulate food and fluids in the correct manner. This can produce
      a variety of swallowing problems such as choking on foods and fluids, regurgitation,
      aspiration, weight loss, malnutrition and poor quality of life.

      Treatment is largely directed at rehabilitation of muscle power and education about safe
      swallowing techniques or positioning that limits food and fluid entering the airway. A novel
      approach is to try to improve sensation within the pharynx so that patients can feel
      substances present and then manipulate them in a more appropriate and safe manner. In this
      regard capsaicin, a nutritional supplement derived from peppers, has shown a stimulatory
      effect on sensory nerves and an ability to improve the swallowing reflex (Ebihara et al.,
      2005). Although studies have shown that capsaicin can improve the swallowing reflex, data
      regarding improvement in swallowing function is lacking. Using a small dose of capsaicin
      administered as a lozenge, we hope to stimulate sensation within the pharynx enough to
      improve physical swallowing measures on a contrast swallow study. This method of application
      is comfortable, easy and directed to the site of action.
