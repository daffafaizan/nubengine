      hydrothorax (HH) at the institution of the investigators during the past 10 years.

      Methods A total of 63 patients with refractory HH, who underwent thoracoscopic mesh onlay
      reinforcement to repair diaphragmatic defects from January 2005 to December 2014, were
      included in the study. Mesh covering alone was used in 47 patients and mesh with suturing was
      used in 16 patients. Patient demographics, Child-Pugh class, and model for end-stage liver
      disease (MELD) score were evaluated to predict morbidity and mortality.
