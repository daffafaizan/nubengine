      investigators propose the use of thermotherapy as a modality for viral containment, thereby
      preventing the progression of the infection to severe cases. The investigators consider
      applying the intervention with thermotherapy mainly as an adjuvant therapy in high-risk
      patients. The most accessible thermotherapy delivery method the investigators have identified
      is the use of an electric chest pad for its wide and known clinical use, including its
      recommended use for patients with arthritis. The intensity of temperature delivered by the
      electric cushion should be placed on the first level (lowest level), to avoid discomfort to
      the patient. The electric cushion provides a continuous hour of regulated heat, with enough
      penetration to raise the external temperature of the area to 40-42 Â° C, a temperature range
      at which facilitation of elimination of the virus is expected.
