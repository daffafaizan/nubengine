      and expansion to determine the safety and tolerability, recommended phase 2 dose and optimal
      dosing interval, pharmacology, and antitumor activity of RTX-240 in adult patients with
      relapsed/refractory or locally advanced solid tumors (Phase 1/2) or relapsed/refractory acute
      myeloid leukemia (Phase 1 only). RTX-240 is a cellular therapy that co-expresses 4-1BBL and
      IL-15TP, a fusion of IL-15 and IL-15 receptor alpha, with the goal of harnessing the innate
      and adaptive immune systems for the treatment of cancer. The study will include a monotherapy
      dose escalation phase followed by an expansion phase in specified tumor types.
