    
      This Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, two-arm, open-label study will include subjects with
      intermediate or high-risk (as per the DIPSS score) primary myelofibrosis (PMF),
      postpolycythemia vera myelofibrosis (post-PV MF), or post-essential thrombocythemia
      myelofibrosis (post-ET MF). This study will be conducted in compliance with International
      Council for Harmonisation (ICH) Good Clinical Practices (GCPs).

      Study design includes:

        -  A 28-day Screening Period

        -  2:1 Randomization to fedratinib or best available therapy (BAT)

        -  Stratification at Randomization according to:

             -  Spleen size by palpation: < 15 cm below left costal margin (LCM) versus ≥ 15 cm
                below LCM

             -  Platelets ≥ 50 to < 100 x 109/L versus platelets ≥ 100 x 109/L

             -  Refractory or relapsed to ruxolitinib treatment versus intolerant to ruxolitinib
                treatment

        -  Study Treatment Period (time on study drug plus 30 days after last dose)

        -  Subjects are allowed to crossover from BAT to the fedratinib arm after the Cycle 6
           response assessment or before the Cycle 6 response assessment in the event of a
           confirmed progression of splenomegaly by MRI/CT scan

        -  A Survival Follow-up Period for progression and survival
