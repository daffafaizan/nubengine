      effects on health. However, it should be noted the literary emptiness in relation to the
      influential factors in it. Chronobiology is the science responsible for studying the rhythmic
      changes in living beings; where the investigators include the circadian rhythm. In this way,
      all the "cycles" will be influenced by a series of factors that allow its correct operation,
      being in this case the light-dark cycle (LD), together with the temperature compensation,
      these being the determinants that allow, or not homeostasis.

      The sleep - wake pattern is one of the most important circadian rhythms that happen in the
      organism. The dream is an unconscious process by which, despite the muscular relaxation that
      occurs, it is accompanied by continuous brain activity along with sensitive perception, where
      several of the organ systems come into play. This cycle is composed of two factors: a
      homeostatic one directly proportional to the time we are awake, and another circadian,
      dependent on the secretion of melatonin and the body's regulation of temperature. This fact
      can be compromised by the appearance of both external and internal stimuli, altering normal
      functioning, which is translated into sleep deprivation, which, if extended over time, can
      have physical and mental consequences, Some of them are: deterioration of the immune
      function, an increase in the incidence of cardiovascular diseases, memory deficit, early
      aging, mood swings, difficulty in healing, greater probability of developing metabolic
      syndromes, cognitive, affective disorders and even some types of cancer

      The results obtained will facilitate the elaboration of action protocols focused on improving
      sleep quality in hospitalized patients.
