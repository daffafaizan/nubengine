      neurologic, respiratory, circulatory and many other systems. The outcomes of patients with
      severe stroke depend largely on medical strategies on acute stage, especially on blood
      pressure (BP) management. Unfortunately, so far no ideal BP range has been scientifically
      determined for patients with acute severe stroke.

      The CHASE study aims to provide reliable data on the effects of individualized
      anti-hypertension strategy in patients with acute severe stroke (target recruitment 250)
      compared to standard guideline-based management of BP (target recruitment 250). Patients
      presenting with acute (<72h) severe stroke (GCS ≦ 12 or NIHSS ≧ 11) and elevated BP (systolic
      blood pressure ≧150 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ≧ 100 mmHg) will be randomly assigned to
      individualized anti-hypertension treatment or guideline-based treatment for 7 days.
