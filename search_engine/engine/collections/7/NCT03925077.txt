      8-week, remotely delivered exercise interventions: Movement-to-Music (M2M) and Standard
      Exercise Training (SET), with 327 adults with SCI. The primary aim is to examine change in
      physical activity level after the 8-week M2M and SET interventions. We hypothesize that
      participants in M2M and SET will have significant increase in physical activity compared to
      an Attention Control (AC) group after the 8-week intervention. The secondary aim is to
      examine effects of the M2M and SET interventions on health and quality of life outcomes. We
      hypothesize that participants in M2M and SET will have significant increases in sleep quality
      and quality of life and decreases in pain and fatigue compared to AC after the 8-week
      intervention. Exercise enjoyment in M2M and SET participants will also be explored. The
      tertiary aim is to evaluate the demographic (age, race, sex), clinical (level of injury, type
      of injury), and psychosocial (social support, outcome expectations, self-efficacy,
      self-regulation) variables of two participant groups: 1) compliant participants who completed
      â‰¥ 50% of the intervention, and 2) noncompliant participants who completed post-testing but <
      50% of the intervention or who did not complete post-testing.
