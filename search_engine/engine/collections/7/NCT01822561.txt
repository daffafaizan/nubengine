           choroidal vessel vasodilation, focal leakage, and choroidal thickness in patients with
           both acute and chronic CSCR, leading to resolution of subretinal fluid and ultimately an
           improvement in symptoms.

        -  Resolution of sub-retinal fluid will be the primary outcome, which can be precisely
           measured using optical coherence tomography (OCT)

        -  Secondary outcomes will include: Change in macular thickness measured with OCT, in
           central macular circle thickness on OCT, change in visual acuity, change in dye leakage
           characteristics on fluorescein angiography, change in OCT characteristics of the fellow
           eye, and safety and tolerability characteristics

        -  In acute CSCR, subretinal fluid often resolves on its own, but it often takes several
           months (the literature shows that ~20% of patients have complete resolution of
           sub-retinal fluid on OCT 1 month after presentation)

        -  Chronic CSCR is defined as persistent fluid on OCT after 3 months of symptom onset, or
           recurrence of signs and symptoms within 1 year after the prior episode

        -  In this study, the investigators will not make a distinction between acute and chronic
           CSCR

        -  Eplerenone, a generic medication, is a potassium sparing diuretic, which is FDA approved
           to treat heart failure as well as high blood pressure, but is not FDA approved for
           treatment of central serous chorioretinopathy.

        -  The most important side effect of eplerenone is elevation of serum potassium and
           decrease of blood pressure

        -  Patients will therefore be screened with routine blood tests as suggested by the package
           insert of the medication, and serum potassium and blood pressure will be monitored
           routinely as directed by the medication package insert

        -  Study visits will be performed at therapy initiation, 1 week, 2 weeks, and 4 weeks
