      groups. Group A (n = 200) women with intraoperative cervical dilatation; group B (n = 200)
      women with no intraoperative cervical dilatation.Patients were randomised using
      computer-generated random numbers in sealed envelopes, to place them in one of the groups:
      group A (n = 200) women with intraoperative cervical dilatation; group B (n = 200) women with
      no intraoperative cervical dilatation. The investigator was not blinded to the procedure
      allocation. The allocated envelope was opened by the clinician just before the surgery. The
      procedure allocation was recorded in the women's charts.Antibiotic prophylaxis of 1 g of
      intravenous cefazolin or clindamycin 600 mg was given to each woman when the umbilical cord
      was clamped. In group 1 patients, the surgeon inserted his or her double-gloved index digit
      in the cervical canal to dilate it and removed the outer gloves after digital dilatation of
      the cervix.
