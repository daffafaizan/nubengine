      weight gain, gestational diabetes and musculoskeletal problems such as low back pain and
      pelvic girdle pain, and urinary and fecal incontinence. While pregnancy and labor imply these
      and other risks, exercise is regarded as advantageous during pregnancy. Today's knowledge
      about the importance of exercise during pregnancy is mainly based on observational data from
      epidemiological studies, and the scientific strength of the clinical recommendations given is
      open to question. There is a great lack of results from randomized clinical trials with high
      methodological quality, assessing the effects of exercise during pregnancy. As a result of
      this, many important questions are still not answered. One of these is the effect exercise
      during pregnancy has in the prevention and treatment of disease and complications which may
      arise during pregnancy. Another question is the consequences that exercise during pregnancy
      has for labor and delivery. This study is designed as a randomized clinical trial using
      validated measurement tools to find answers to the mentioned questions.

      In both national and international literature the importance of physical activity is
      highlighted. WHO has recently presented a global strategy for nutrition, physical activity
      and health. In Norway physical activity and exercise have been strongly addressed, and is an
      issue of high priority also in pregnant and postpartum women (St.meld.nr.16). Nevertheless,
      few trials evaluating the effects of regular exercise have been published. There is a need
      for evidence based knowledge to be implemented in education of health professionals, and in
      the development of health promotion strategies aiming at the general population.
