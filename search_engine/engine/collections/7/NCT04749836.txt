      conduction system pacing is providing physiological pacing via His-Purkinje activation.
      Current approaches include His bundle (HBP), left bundle branch area pacing (LBBAP), and
      Bachmann bundle pacing. In addition, HBP and LBBAP enable correction of underlying proximal
      bundle branch block, consequently improving the ventricular activation time and narrowing the
      QRS. Furthermore, atrial activation can be improved with direct Bachmann bundle stimulation.
      However, the data regarding long-term performance and safety of these physiological
      approaches in various clinical scenarios is scarce.

      With this registry, the investigators would like to obtain real-world data regarding the
      feasibility and safety of this physiological pacing approaches in various pacing indications
      and their implementation in routine clinical practice.

      Implant success rate, specific implant characteristics, procedural complications, electrical
      parameters and clinical outcomes will be analyzed at implantation, 1-3 months after inclusion
      and every 6 months thereafter. Minimal follow-up will be 2 years.
