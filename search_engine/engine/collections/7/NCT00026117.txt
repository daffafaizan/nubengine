        -  Determine whether the addition of powdered shark cartilage (BeneFinâ„¢) to standard
           therapy improves overall survival in patients with advanced colorectal or breast cancer.

        -  Determine whether this therapy has any impact on toxicity in these patients.

        -  Determine whether this therapy improves the quality of life in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients
      are stratified according to disease type (breast vs colorectal female vs colorectal male),
      age (49 and under vs 50-69 vs 70 and over), ECOG performance status (0-1 vs 2), baseline
      quality of life (UNISCALE rating less than 50% vs 50-75% vs more than 75%), and concurrent
      chemotherapy (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.
