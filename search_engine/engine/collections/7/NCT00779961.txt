      functioning velopharyngeal mechanism as early as possible without hazard to other aspects of
      health and development. Two major criteria by which the success of cleft palate surgery is
      determined are subsequent speech development and facial growth. Therefore, the debate about
      timing of cleft palate surgery is focused on the need for early palatoplasty for speech
      purposes versus later palatoplasty to ensure undisturbed facial growth. A compromise solution
      to this controversy was proposed by Schweckendiek; the soft palate is repaired at an early
      age leaving the hard palate cleft unrepaired until later in life. The premise is that primary
      veloplasty will result in a functioning velopharyngeal mechanism for early speech
      development, while the unrepaired hard palate will allow unrestricted maxillary growth. The
      speech outcomes of patients who have undergone delayed stage palate repair have been
      addressed in several studies and case series. However, there is little evidence to support
      the benefits of delayed stage repair with respect to facial growth and speech development.
      Results from published studies have shown the speech results to be relatively poor and
      fistula rates as unacceptably high. These results have lead a vast majority of North American
      surgeons to favour primary one-stage repair. Yet, the optimum timing of primary palate repair
      remains unknown. No randomized control trials or prospective cohort studies have been
      conducted to address this question.
