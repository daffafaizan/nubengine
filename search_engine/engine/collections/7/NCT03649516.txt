      bio-information data. Patients will be randomly assigned into the iCKD APP
      group(intervention) and traditional care group (control). Participants will be randomized
      into an 1:1 manner (intervention : control). Random assignment occurred after the consent and
      initial enrollment interview. Individuals randomized to the iCKD APP will provide with the
      equipment after randomization. Participants will follow for at least 6 months before the exit
      interview.
