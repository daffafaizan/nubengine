      currently) has assumed increasing importance of its use in clinical practice. Therapeutic
      algorithms for both Infliximab (IFX) and Adalimumab (ADA) have been published and are used by
      many expert teams in the event of loss of therapeutic response. Similarly, the concentrations
      are assuming important in the indication of therapeutic de-escalation. Lastly, the assays may
      predict medium-term therapeutic response to treatment and thus enable proposal of preventive
      therapeutic changes (5). The Gemini 1 study (phase 3 vedolizumab vs. placebo in Ulcerative
      Colitis) showed a correlation between drug levels and clinical response during induction and
      maintenance therapy. Moreover, in 3.7% of cases, anti-vedolizumab antibodies were reported
      during the time-course and 1% had samples that were persistently positive. (1). In addition,
      we have decided to assess the clinical response to VDZ induction at W10 (Week 10), as the
      Gemini III trial for Crohn Disease (Crohn Disease) have reported, among patients who had
      experienced previous Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) antagonist failure, that 15% of those given
      vedolizumab versus 12% under placebo were in remission at W6 (P=0.433) whereas a higher
      proportion of them were in remission (26%) under VDZ when compared with the placebo arm (12%)
      at week 10. Therefore, in clinically non-responders at W10, an additional dose of 300 mg of
      VDZ will be infused at W10 and every four weeks.
