      I. To determine the recommended dose for phase II studies of veliparib (ABT-888 ) that can be
      administered in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel in patients with advanced solid
      malignancies. (Stratum I) II. To determine the recommended dose for phase II studies of
      veliparib that can be administered in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel in patients
      with advanced solid malignancies that harbor a germline BRCA1/2 mutation. (Stratum II) (added
      04/07/09)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To define the dose-limiting toxicity and other toxicities associated with the use of this
      combination.

      II. To obtain preliminary evidence of antitumor activity in patients treated with this
      combination.

      III. To evaluate the pharmacokinetic parameters of veliparib, carboplatin, and paclitaxel
      when administered as a combination.

      IV. To conduct correlative science studies.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of veliparib. Patients are stratified
      according to BRCA status (no [stratum I] vs yes [stratum II]).

      Patients receive carboplatin intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes and paclitaxel IV over 3
      hours on day 3 and veliparib orally (PO) twice daily on days 1-7 until the recommended phase
      II dose is determined. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for at least 6 courses in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo peripheral blood mononuclear cell collection periodically for
      pharmacokinetic and biomarker studies.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.
