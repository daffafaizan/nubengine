      fashion that considers dietary preferences. They will then undergo baseline testing, begin
      the diet and training interventions, followed by post-testing (phase 1) and a carbohydrate
      titration period in the ketogenic diet group (phase 2). In the following academic semester,
      the training intervention will be repeated with an adjusted dietary carbohydrate level,
      delivered as a pre-workout supplement, corresponding to Phase 2 (Phase 3).

      Phase 1 will consist of diets at an energy level estimated by the Mifflin St. Jeor equation
      adjusted by 1.625 for exercise. The exercise intervention will be a supervised, periodized
      (daily undulating), 9-week concurrent resistance (3 days/week) and cardiovascular (2
      days/week) exercise program designed to improve body composition and performance variables.
      During phase 2, the ketogenic diet participants will continue exercising with the same
      program while consuming incrementally greater quantities of carbohydrate pre-workout until
      the state of ketosis is lost. Phase 3 will be identical to Phase 1, but diets will be
      modified to include more carbohydrate. As of completing Phase 2, this amount has been
      determined to be 20g of Carb10 (pea starch).
