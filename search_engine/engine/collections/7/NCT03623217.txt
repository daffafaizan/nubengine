      life when switching from tacrolimus twice daily (b.i.d) regimen to once daily (q.d) regimen
      after kidney transplantation.

      In-depth interviews are conducted to develop questionnaire items, and the interviewees are as
      follows: participants who have received tacrolimus b.i.d for a minimum of 6 months to a
      maximum of 12 months, and who are within 1 month of switching to Advagraf (q.d regimen of
      modified release tacrolimus).

      The time required for the in-depth interview is approximately 30 minutes to one hour.

      After questionnaire items are developed, survey participants for validation are as follows:
      the first survey is conducted on participants who have received tacrolimus b.i.d for a
      minimum of 6 months to a maximum of 12 months during the period. The second survey is
      conducted within one month after switching to Advagraf (q.d regimen of modified release
      tacrolimus).

      At the validation stage, the survey using the developed questionnaire is conducted twice,
      once during the b.i.d. regimen and once after switching to the q.d. regimen.
