      plays a desirable role in the prevention and prognosis of prostate and other cancers.
      Prostate cancer cells possess both of the enzymes required to convert vitamin D to the active
      paracrine hormone, calcitriol. However, the dose-response relationship between serum levels
      of calcidiol (vitamin D status) and prostate tissue levels of calcidiol and calcitriol is yet
      to be defined. As a neoadjuvant, prior to radical prostatectomy (for 4-6 wk) vitamin D3 [400
      IU (control group), 10,000 IU or 40,000 IU/day] will be given to 90 men randomized,
      double-blinded, 30 per dose. Immediately after surgery, the pathologist will obtain a few
      grams of prostate tissue, some of which will be used to assay calcidiol and calcitriol within
      prostate. From the embedded prostate, we will prepare immunohistochemically stained sections
      to characterize cellular responses and morphological changes. Our hypothesis is that vitamin
      D will increase intraprostate calcitriol concentration and thereby lower cellular
      proliferation (as judged by the markers MIB-1 and p27) in zones of Gleason pattern 3 prostate
      cancer and in pre-cancerous (PIN) lesions. We expect that our results will provide surrogate
      outcomes to justify larger trials of vitamin D for treatment of prostate cancer. This
      research has the potential to: 1. Provide direct evidence at the cellular level using
      clinical samples that vitamin D lowers cellular proliferation in prostate cancer, 2. Provide
      guidance about the serum calcidiol concentrations (and thereby vitamin D doses) that should
      be targeted for such studies, and 3. Eventually support other research directed at vitamin D
      as a primary prevention strategy.
