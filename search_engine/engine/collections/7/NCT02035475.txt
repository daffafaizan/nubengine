      with pelvic cancer who are electing to undergo robotic surgery with PLND. The patients in our
      trial will be pelvic cancer patients at risk for lymphocele after PLND. Given the safe nature
      of the product and the patient's risk for lymphocele after PLND and subsequent potential
      morbidity, there is justification to give patients the option for inclusion in the study.
      Investigators intend to determine whether the rate of lymphocele formation after PLND at the
      time of robotic pelvic cancer surgery can be reduced by using the robotic Vessel Sealer
      unilaterally for the lymph node dissection. The side of the pelvis of each patient will be
      randomly selected by Excel'sÂ® random number function "RAND()" to receive the Vessel Sealer
      dissection. Investigators intend to use this device unilaterally so the contralateral side
      can serve as an internal control and eliminate patient specific confounding variables such as
      BMI, and surgeon specific factors such as degree and method of hemostasis utilized by each
      surgeon. In addition, Dr. Abaza will be the only surgeon performing these procedures,
      eliminating variation in technique between surgeons.
