      enroll 1200 patients with anterior STEMI. Immediately after the first medical contact, the
      patients who were determined by the investigator to meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria
      were randomized through the interactive web response system (IWRS) and received different
      pre-reperfusion treatments. The four groups were placebo group, metoprolol group, remote
      ischemic post-conditioning (RIPC) group and metoprolol & RIPC group. Subsequently, the
      investigator conduct diagnosis and treatment according to the patient's specific conditions
      and check the serum level of myocardial damage markers (i.e. CK and CK-MB) at the time of
      admission for 12, 24, 36, 48, 60 hours, respectively. If the patient undergoes PCI treatment,
      additional detection of myocardial damage markers immediately after PCI is also required. All
      patients were followed for 1 year with an office visit or a telephone call at 1, 3, 6, 9 and
      12 months to evaluate the health status and adverse clinical events of patients.
