      leading to hyperglycemia. Current concepts indicate that insulin resistant adipose tissue
      releases metabolites, which stimulate hepatic gluconeogenesis (GNG), lipid deposition and
      secretion. Failure of compensation by ÃŸ cell function will favour muscle insulin resistance
      and fasting/postprandial hyperglycemia. The investigators have previously provided evidence
      for abnormal ATP synthesis and mitochondrial efficiency, but it remains unknown, how and
      which substrate fluxes account for excessive GNG in T2D. For this reason, the main objective
      of this project is to adress the multi-system challenges of T2D, by examining interorgan
      metabolic crosstalk with an emphasis on liver as orchestrator of interorgan substrate fluxes
      and driver of the transition from normo- to hyperglycemia. This proposal aims at
      investigating hepatic glucose and energy flux in T2D with focus on gluconeogenic contribution
      of lactate to hepatic mitochondrial substrate flux, the activity of the redox shuttle and
      mitochondrial ATP synthase flux, also after inhibition by metformin by using a novel
      combination of positional isotopomer nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis (PINTA) with
      multinuclei magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS).
