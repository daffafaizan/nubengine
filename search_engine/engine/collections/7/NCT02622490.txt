      stay until lunch on four occasions each. The participants are randomized to the order of the
      test meals. The meals have a total caloric content of 750 kcal and have either 50% of energy
      from carbohydrates (low fat) or 20% of energy from carbohydrates (low carb.). The meals are
      consumed on one occasion in the morning or divided in 5 portions (150 kcal each) for every 30
      minutes, i.e. total combinations of meal composition and of meal distribution is 4. Effects
      of the food on p-glucose, s-insulin, blood-lipids, hormones and on metabolic rate is measured
      by blood tests or by indirect calorimetry (for metabolic rate). Sense of satiety is measured
      by visual analogue scales.
