      intervention in people with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) could reduce the incidence of
      type 2 diabetes (Knowler, Barrett-Connor et al. 2002). These findings were consistent,
      regardless of ethnicity, age, body mass index (BMI), gender (Knowler, Barrett-Connor et al.
      2002). However, the DPP lacks a specific focus on new mothers with a recent history of
      gestational diabetes despite their documented high risk for developing Type 2 diabetes.
      Although there are recommendations that all women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM)
      receive postpartum testing for diabetes and type 2 diabetes risk reduction, study findings
      suggest that women with a recent history of GDM may be unaware of their risk for future
      diabetes, and also do not take steps to reduce their risks (Kim et al., 2007). The postpartum
      period is also a time when many changes occur in a woman's life, with competing
      responsibilities often altering sleep patterns, work schedules, eating patterns, exercise
      regularity, and time allocation (Walker, 1999; Swan et al., 2007). New mothers may have
      difficulties engaging in healthy lifestyle programs because of lack of time and energy, and
      because of competing work and family demands, including child care (Swan, Kilmartin, and
      Liaw, 2007).

      Modeled around the barriers identified in literature and gleaned from the focus groups and
      informant interviews of the preliminary study (2009p-000042), we have created a
      lifestyle/behavioral intervention that utilizes a modified DPP.
