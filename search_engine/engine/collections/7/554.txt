distribution and excretion of radioactivity after parenteraladministration of radioactive polydiethylstilbestrol phosphateto rats and a cow.polydiethylstilbestrol phosphate(psp), a water soluble polyester of phos-phoric acid and diethylstilbestrol, was in-jected in rats and a cow and the distributionand excretion of radioactivity were followedin both species.  after a subcutaneous orintramuscular injection the bulk of the radio-activity was accumulated at the site of injec-tion.  the disappearance of radioactivity fromthis depot was very slow.  as late as 90 daysafter the injection into rats, 20% of theadministered radioactivity was still accumu-lated at the site of injection.  the liver wasvery effective in removing labeled materialfrom circulating blood.  twenty-four hoursafter intravenous injection in rats, about50% of the radioactivity was recovered fromthis organ.  the distribution of radioactivityin the cow indicated that the polymer waspreferably accumulated in organs containingreticuloendothelial cells.
