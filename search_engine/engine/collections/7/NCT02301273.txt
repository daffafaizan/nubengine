      in the ICU, to prevent as well as remediate a range of multisystem problems and
      complications. Mobilization which refers to low levels of exercise and progressive position
      changes from being supine to being upright and moving, is both a gravitational and an
      exercise stimulus. Given the hemodynamic status of patients in the ICU can change suddenly,
      physiotherapists gauge the patient's status moment by moment, and change the parameters of an
      intervention accordingly, i.e., the type and level of an intervention, its duration and rest
      periods. The aim of this research is to study the short- and long-term outcomes of enhanced
      early physiotherapy, with mobilization and upright position, in critically ill patients on
      prolonged invasive ventilation. This is a prospective, randomized, single blind trial where
      the intervention permits variation in the physiotherapist's clinical decision making to
      simulate the general practice. This study started in November 2011, data collection and
      intervention will continue until November 2014 with 12 months follow up until november 2015.
