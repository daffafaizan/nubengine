      and adolescents who are taking methylphenidate or amphetamine/ dextroamphetamine for the
      treatment of ADHD. Prescribing various psychiatric medications in combination with
      antiretroviral regimens is a standard clinical practice occurring without adequate evidence
      regarding benefits and risks. The goals of this study are to determine plasma concentrations
      of psychiatric and antiretroviral medications in children and adolescents. Psychiatric
      medication dose requirement and exposure in HIV-1 infected subjects will be compared to that
      seen in uninfected children and adolescents, and antiretroviral exposure will be compared to
      published studies in children and adolescents.
