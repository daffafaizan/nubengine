      revascularization surgery. Remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC), brief periods of ischemia
      followed by reperfusion, can provide systemic protection for prolonged ischemia. Previous
      study found combined remote ischemic pre- and post-conditioning can be effective in reducing
      neurologic complications and the duration of hospitalization in moyamoya patients undergoing
      direct revascularization.In order to investigate whether RIPC before EDAS can protect these
      patients from the perioperative and long-term complications, a prospective randomized
      controlled trial will be performed in the current study.

      DESIGNING: About 328 patients who are eligible for carotid artery stenting will be randomly
      assigned in 1:1 ratio to RIPC group and sham RIPC group (control). Remote limb ischemic
      preconditioning (RIPC) is consisted of five 5-min cycles of bilateral arm
      ischemia/reperfusion, it is induced by a sphygmomanometer placed on bilateral arm and
      inflated to 200 mmHg for 5-min followed by deflating the cuff for 5-min, patients in the RIPC
      group will do it twice a day for at least five days before EDAS. Patients in the sham RIPC
      group receive sham RIPC treatment, which is consisted of five 5-min cycles of bilateral arm
      ischemia/reperfusion, induced by a sphygmomanometer placed on bilateral arm and inflated to
      60 mmHg for 5-min followed by deflating the cuff for 5-min, they will do it twice a day for
      at least five days before EDAS. Cerebral injury is assessed by plasma Human Soluble
      protein-100B (S-100B) and Neuron specific enolase (NSE). Clinical outcomes are determined by
      cerebrovascular events (including ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), cerebral
      hemorrhage and transient neurological deficit) and death or dependent.
