      seen at the Clinical Center as a consequence of use of central venous access devices (VADs)
      required for intravenous medication treatment programs at the NIH. In order to relieve
      discomfort associated with this condition or restore patency of the central veins, we
      successfully developed a treatment program employing intraclot pulse-sprayed injection of
      recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) and anticoagulation with heparin plus
      warfarin (Protocol 95-CC-0053). Recent laboratory kinetic studies of thrombolysis with rtPA
      suggest that more rapid thrombolysis can be achieved with rtPA doses that are more than 10
      times lower than the doses used in our earlier protocol. The purpose of this protocol is to
      evaluate whether these lower doses translate into more effective thrombolysis in the clinical
      setting, so that we may modify our thrombolysis treatment to make it more effective,
      potentially safer, and less costly than our previous protocol. This proposed protocol still
      utilizes pulse spray injection of rtPA directly into the thrombus as before, but evaluates
      the efficacy and safety of using a total of 4 mg or less of rtPA each day for thrombolytic
      therapy. As this lower dose of rtPA has been found to be safe in catheter clearance
      applications, hospitalization will not be required as part of the protocol. Patients who
      elect to have this procedure performed as outpatients will also receive anticoagulation with
      standard regimens using subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) alone, or with
      gradual conversion to oral warfarin.
