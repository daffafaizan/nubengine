      integrating complementary medicine (CM) within the CHS Oncology Service. In 2008, the CHS
      established the Integrative Oncology Program with the goal of addressing patient concerns and
      improving quality of life parameters during chemotherapy and advanced disease. The study is
      purposed to assess concerns, needs and perspectives of patients referred to integrative
      consultation during chemotherapy and/or advanced cancer; to characterize social demographic
      and health parameters of patients who consult or avoid integrative medicine consultation; to
      document complementary medicine use prior and during consultation; to assess if complementary
      medicine consultation and treatment improve patient's concerns and well-being; and to assess
      oncology provider and integrative practitioner communications issues concerning integrative
      care.
