    
      Study participant DNA samples will be sequenced for 109 genes of interest along with
      genotyping of select polymorphisms. Genetic tests will be performed in a Clinical Laboratory
      Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certified lab (Baylor Human Genome Sequencing Laboratory).
      Selected results (pathogenic/likely pathogenic) will be returned to participants by a genetic
      counselor and deposited into the Electronic Health Record (EHR).
