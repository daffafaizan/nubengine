      cerebellopontine angle (CPA) tumors (>2 x 2 cm diameter), with compression of the pons.The
      incidence of such complications are unknown. One of the plausible mechanisms is inadvertent
      parasympathetic nerve stimulation (IPNS) due to the proximity of this cranial nerve to the
      CPA tumor. Monitoring parasympathetic nerve activity may provide further insight to the
      implication of this cranial nerve in the cardiac complications observed during surgery of
      large CPA tumors. The analgesia nociception index (ANI) monitor assesses the balance between
      analgesia and nociception through the detection of parasympathetic tone. Despite the abundant
      clinical reports about this index, to the knowledge of the investigators, only a few studies
      have been published in the neurological setting. Moreover, there are no data reporting the
      parasympathetic profile (measured by the ANI monitor) in situations of IPNS and EA. Are these
      profiles the same or different? Such is the main question this study thrives to answer.
      Understanding the behavior of parasympathetic nerve activity in this context could help
      provide the appropriate management strategy.

      In order to answer this question, participants undergoing elective large CPA tumor surgery
      were included in this prospective observational study. Standard cardiorespiratory monitoring
      including heart rate (HR) was done. Target-controlled anesthesia with Propofol and
      Remifentanil was guided by a bispectral index of 30-40 and an ANI of 50-70 respectively. Data
      was continuously recorded with event markers at the onset of bradycardia (HR < 45 bpm),
      asystole and the coincidence of ANI > 80 with Remifentanil site effect > 6 ng.ml-1 (defined
      as excessive analgesia).
