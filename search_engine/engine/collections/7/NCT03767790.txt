    
      The goal of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of an AID system using a MPC
      algorithm versus SAP/PLGS therapy with different food choices over a 4 week period.

      The AID system (iAPS) is comprised of an insulin pump, a Dexcom G6 continuous glucose
      monitoring sensor, and a smart phone that contains the algorithm and communicates with the
      other devices.

      In this study, during each two-week period, subjects will be given pre-weighed portions of
      different meals to eat (either regular semolina pasta or extra-long grain white rice) with
      detailed cooking instructions, and will eat these meals on 6 different occasions for dinner.
      They will bolus as they normally do for these meals. This will allow us to observe the
      postprandial meal response when using sensor-augmented pump (SAP) or iAPS, showing the
      importance of nutrition choices with modern technological treatments in T1D.
