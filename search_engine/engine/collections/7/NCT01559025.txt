      show a detectable Î²-cell function at clinical diabetes. The preservation of this endogenous
      insulin production, even if it is small, can have a great impact on the evolution of
      long-term disease through improving glycemic control, reducing chronic diabetes complications
      and hypoglycemia. Strategies for preventing the loss of beta cell are based on stopping the
      autoimmune process and also in the preservation and regeneration of beta cells. Currently
      have been questioned the potential use of GLP-1 for new-onset type 1 diabetes. The
      justification for this issue is based on the fact that this class of drugs, besides acting on
      insulin secretion and glucose regulation, may be effective to preserve and expand beta cell
      mass, which has been shown in animals. Ideal candidates for this treatment are newly
      diagnosed patients who still have significant viable beta cell mass.
