      Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), degree of activation of RAAS correlates with
      severity of OHSS. In OHSS there is a cascade of events that mainly involves capillary leak
      with resultant fluid shift and electrolytes imbalance, these consequences are more pronounced
      - according to our hypothesis - due to inadequate mineralocorticoid response/activity in
      susceptible individuals in the settings of high progesterone levels with its
      antimineralocorticoid property, OHSS can be interpreted as a (mineralocorticoid deficiency
      crisis) and may effectively be treated as being so, so we conducted this study to test the
      hypothesis in both treatment and prevention of OHSS.
