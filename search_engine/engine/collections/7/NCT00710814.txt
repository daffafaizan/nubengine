      twice per day (i.e. at 8 am and 8 pm). This dose was chosen because it would not be expected
      to cause substantial weight loss in an obese non-surgical population, nor should it incur any
      substantial injection site reactions. Subjects will receive a demonstration of dose
      preparation and injection in addition to written instructions with visual aides. After the
      run-in period, subjects will demonstrate their preparation and injection technique. Placebo
      injections will consist of sterile water equal in volume to that of the metreleptin dose
      calculated for each individual. Subjects will be instructed to continue with their current
      level of physical activity. At week 16, each subject will cross-over to the alternate
      treatment for an additional 16 weeks.
