      third trimesters of pregnancy to highly viremic, HBV DNA-positive mothers on maternal HBV DNA
      and HBeAg levels prior to delivery and the rate of vertical transmission of HBV to infants
      who received passive-active immunoprophylaxis. Additionally, we investigated the timing of
      the administration of telbivudine on reducing the risk of perinatal transmission and the
      safety of telbivudine during pregnancy.
