      infections such as PCP. However, PCP recurs in about 43 percent of patients receiving AZT,
      indicating a need for other treatments to reduce the relapse rate.

      The two medications to be tested in this study, SMX/TMP and aerosolized PEN, have also been
      partially effective in preventing recurrence of PCP. It is hoped that the combination of AZT
      with these medications will be more effective than AZT or one of the medications alone.

      Patients receive the standard dose of AZT at study entry. Low body weight patients receive
      AZT at a lower dose. Patients are randomly assigned to one of two medications intended to
      prevent the recurrence of PCP. Patients assigned to SMX/TMP will take 1 capsule which
      contains both drugs once a day for 1 year. Patients assigned to PEN will have 1 aerosol
      treatment every 4 weeks for 1 year. Blood will be drawn at intervals in order to estimate
      blood levels of the drugs and to detect any adverse effects from the drugs. Note: Earlier
      versions of this protocol reflect its original design as a 3-arm study comparing aerosolized
      PEN, SMX/TMP, and pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine as secondary prophylaxis of PCP in AIDS patients
      receiving AZT. In order to reduce the effective sample size and permit the completion of
      accrual in a reasonable period of time, the pyrimethamine - sulfadoxine arm of this study has
      been discontinued. Patients randomized to this arm will be continued in this study on the
      original randomized therapy. Management of these patients will follow that described for
      SMX/TMP in the latest protocol version. AMENDED: Lower dose of AZT allowed.
