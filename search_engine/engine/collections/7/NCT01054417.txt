      The laparoscopic inspection of the appendix is carried out according to a specific protocol.
      In case of appendicitis the appendix is removed laparoscopically, a normal appendix is not
      removed. The primary outcome of the study is: appendicitis according to pathologic
      examination following appendectomy, or appendicitis according to clinical follow-up in case
      the appendix is not removed.

      The clinical diagnosis of appendicitis in the follow-up should be confirmed radiologic
      examination (ultrasound, CT-scan, MRI) or by a re-operation.
