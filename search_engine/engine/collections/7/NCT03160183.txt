      confirmed HIV-associated KS patients initiating chemotherapy in Malawi. The primary objective
      of this study is to estimate the complete response rate (CR by ACTG criteria) at 48 weeks.
      This will be done both overall and by chemotherapy (BV or not BV) treatment group. Secondary
      objectives are to estimate PFS and OS for both overall and by chemotherapy treatment group.
      Exploratory objectives include the investigation of: select clinical variables and laboratory
      biomarkers among HIV-associated KS patients and their possible association with response,
      PFS, and OS; the histopathology of KSHV-associated lymphoproliferative diseases among
      HIV-associated KS patients; KSHV strains in tumor biopsies, PBMC and plasma, and KSHV gene
      expression characteristics between KS that develops on and off ART.

      The investigators plan to accrue 200 HIV-associated KS patients at a rate of approximately 50
      patients per year. Approximately half of the patients will receive BV chemotherapy treatment.
      An important factor for this study's size is that it will be comparable to or exceed the size
      of other important KS cohort studies, which have demonstrated significant differences in
      outcomes based on gender or baseline KSHV DNA levels.

      The investigators want to show that there are definable biologic and clinical subsets within
      the HIV-associated KS population, and that identifying these subsets will have direct
      relevance to more effective treatment strategies for these patients.
