      female patients â‰¥40 years of age with OA of the knee.

      Patients were enrolled sequentially with at least 10 patients per cohort as follows:

      Cohort A: FX006 32 mg, Final Visit at Week 20 Cohort B: FX006 32 mg, Final Visit at Week 16
      Cohort C: FX006 32 mg, Final Visit at Week 12 Cohort D: FX006 32 mg, Final Visit at Week 6
      Cohort E: FX006 32 mg, Final Visit at Week 1 Cohort F: TCA IR 40 mg, Final Visit Week 6

      Each patient was screened to confirm eligibility and assigned to a cohort on Day 1/baseline.
      Each patient was evaluated for safety during his/her participation in the study at 6, 12, 16,
      or 20 weeks following a single IA injection depending on the assigned Cohort, and plasma and
      synovial fluid was collected for drug concentration measurements.

      Safety and tolerability was assessed by physical examinations, index knee examinations, vital
      signs, clinical laboratory evaluations, and adverse events (AEs).

      No efficacy assessments were employed in this study.
