      in the U.S. or internationally. Our previous work supports that early mobilization through
      physical and occupational therapy for ICU patients on the ventilator can help them experience
      less delirium, spend less time in the ICU and hospital, and become more independent when they
      leave. To advance our knowledge in this area, large longitudinal studies are needed to
      understand the long-term physical, cognitive and mental health status of survivors and to
      test how specific ICU therapies may affect these outcomes.
