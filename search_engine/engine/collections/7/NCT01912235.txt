      GLN and nitrogen labeled PRO to determine the dietary source for the carbon chain of ORN, CIT
      and ARG. Additionally, using Nitrogen labeled GLN, we will identify the source of the
      nitrogen atoms in these amino acids.

      Using guanidino - 15N2 arginine, 1-13C Glutamine, 2-15N Glutamine and 15N Proline we will be
      able to:

        1. determine the flux of arginine and proline in healthy adult volunteers

        2. determine and compare the flux of carbon and nitrogen labeled glutamine

        3. demonstrate whether glutamine or proline provides the carbon backbone for ornithine,
           citrulline and arginine in adults.

        4. the source of the N atoms in ornithine, citrulline and arginine.
