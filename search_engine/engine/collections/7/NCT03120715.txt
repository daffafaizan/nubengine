      for Reproductive Medicine of Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University are recruited.

      They are randomly allocated to be prepared for transfer by using HRT cycle, with(low
      molecular weight heparin-group B(group LMWH-B)) or without( non-low molecular weight
      heparin-group A(group NLMWH-A)) administration of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) before
      frozen embryo transfer (FET).

      Both groups use the same protocol of HRT-FET. The oral estrogen replacement is 4mg per day (2
      mg twice daily), 4 days; 6 mg per day, 4 days. Then, the patient's endometrial thickness is
      evaluated through vaginal ultrasound and if the endometrial thickness is <7 mm, increasing
      estrogen by 2 mg is given to patients until the endometrial thickness is >9 mm.In group
      NLMWH-A, If the endometrial thickness is greater than 9 mm, human chorionic gonadotropin
      (hCG)10000 IU will be administered via intramuscular injection. Then on the next day(D0),
      progesterone in oil 60 mg will be administered via intramuscular injection. Transfer of
      thawed embryos will be performed 3 days later(D3). In group LMWH-B, If the endometrial
      thickness is greater than 9 mm, hCG 10000 IU will be administered via intramuscular
      injection. And low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) will be injected subcutaneously 4100 IU
      (WHO) every other day before FET. Then on the next day(D0), progesterone in oil 60 mg will be
      administered via intramuscular injection. Transfer of thawed embryos will be performed 3 days
      later(D3).

      This study was approved by the medicine ethics committee of Nanfang Hospital.
