      behavior. Currently, there is no systematic method for assessment of suicide risk in these
      patients and often, emergency department staff are required to make judgments about the
      disposition of these patients without a full understanding of the patient's risk for another
      serious suicide attempt. This pilot project involves experts in child psychiatry, biomedical
      informatics, and emergency medicine to collect pilot data for developing a method to estimate
      the risk of serious suicidal behavior based on computational linguistics.
