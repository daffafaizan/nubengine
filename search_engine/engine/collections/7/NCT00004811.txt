      are treated at 1 of 3 doses of itraconazole; the starting dose for each patient is determined
      at entry.

      Therapy is administered daily for 3-6 months. Patients with progressive disease may be
      treated at the next higher dose; there may be only 1 such increase. Concurrent systemic and
      topical antifungals are prohibited.

      Patients are followed at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months.
