    
      The Sound Of Family Together (S.O.F.T.) Music Program was introduced on a 14-bed burn
      intensive care unit to provide an avenue for communication between adults with major burns
      and their children. In adherence with unit policies, children under the age of 16 are only
      allowed onto the unit under very special circumstances, e.g. patient is under DNR status.
      This restriction may translate into a prolong absence between the patients and their young
      children; which may result in emotional and psychological stress factors such as separation
      anxiety, feelings of abandonment, and rejection of the parent when the patient is being
      discharged to home. Children who participate in the S.O.F.T. Music Program will record and
      produce an audio CD for their hospitalized parent/grandparent. The contents of the CD might
      include original songs, poems, and special messages created by the children. Pre and post
      tests results will determine the efficacy of the program to decrease anxiety levels in the
      children.
