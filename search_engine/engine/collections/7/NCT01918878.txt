      initial incomplete response or loss of initial response for other intravitreal anti- vascular
      endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) therapy was demonstrated.

      This is a multi-center study initiated and conducted by the Israeli retina association. Each
      center participating in the study will follow the same protocol including standardized
      measurement of visual acuity, OCT, and Fluorescein angiography (FA).

      We will enroll 48 NVAMD patients which are partial or non-responded for 3-6 injections of
      intravitreal bevacizumab or ranibizumab and no more than one year of treatment .

      Test Treatment:

      Monthly intravitreal aflibercept 2mg /0.05 ml will be given at enrolment (day 0), 4 weeks, 8
      weeks, 16 weeks, and 24 weeks after the initial enrollment for the study group.
