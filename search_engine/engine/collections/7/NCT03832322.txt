      clinical and research practices. We first observed whether optimal WE colonoscopy decreased
      the AMR in the right and proximal colon in a tandem approach. If WE did lower the AMR as
      compared with data in the literature, a randomized RCT deserves to be studied. For the
      calculation of sample size in the upcoming RCT, the AMR in the CO2 group would be collected.
      The differences of the AMRs in the right and proximal colon determined by tandem colonoscopy
      using WE or CO2 insufflation would then be compared.
