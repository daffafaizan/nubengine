      adjuvant chemotherapy and received anti-PD1 antibody-activated TILs on the day 15 of the
      final cycle of chemotherapy.

      Fresh tumor tissues or sentinel lymph nodes were collected from participants with
      postoperative non-small cell lung cancer, and the tumor tissues were digested with type IV
      collagenase at 37 °C for 2 to 4 hours. The cell pellet was washed, suspended in medium
      containing 10% AB serum, planted in a 24-well cell culture plate, and periodically changed
      according to the growth of the cells. After culturing for 2 to 3 weeks, TILs were
      co-stimulated with radioactively irradiated allogeneic peripheral blood mononuclear cells
      （PBMCs）and were expanded in 100 ml of Interleukin-2 (IL-2) medium in a cell culture flask.
      After rapid expansion for 15 days, the number of cells reached 0.1-1*10^10 cells. Before cell
      transfer, TILs were incubated with anti-PD-1 antibody, and a fraction of the TILs were
      collected to assess their number, phenotype, and viability of cells, and to test for possible
      contamination by bacteria, fungi, or endotoxins. Then, autologous TILs (0.1-1*10^10 cells)
      were transferred to participants via intravenous infusion.
