    
      Background:

        -  Vulvar high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) is a premalignant epithelial
           lesion that is frequently multifocal and/or recurrent.

        -  The primary treatment is surgery, which may result in disfigurement and compromise of
           the urethra, anus, or clitoris. Recurrence after surgery is common and primarily treated
           with additional surgery.

        -  Vulvar HSIL is caused by chronic infection with the human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16
           infection. In this clinical trial the HPV-16 infection is targeted with a single
           infusion of autologous T cells that have been genetically engineered to express a HPV-16
           E7-specific T cell receptor (E7 TCR T cells).

      Objective:

      -Determine the complete response rate for E7 TCR T cells in the treatment of vulvar HSIL.

      Eligibility:

        -  Histologically confirmed diagnosis of HPV-16+ vulvar HSIL.

        -  Expression of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A2*02:01 allele.

        -  Measurable lesion(s) that are recurrent or cannot be resected with acceptable cosmetic
           or functional results.

        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years old.

        -  Eastern Oncology Cooperative Group Performance Score of 0 or 1.

      Design:

        -  This is a phase II clinical trial

        -  Simon minimax two-stage design with initial enrollment of 12 patients and expansion to
           16 patients if one or more complete response(s) is/are observed in the initial patients.

        -  Subjects will receive 1x10^11 E7 TCR T cells

        -  No conditioning regimen or aldesleukin will be given

        -  Re-enrollment will be allowed for a small number of subjects.
