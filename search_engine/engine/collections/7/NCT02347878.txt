      often debilitating syndrome, which was reported to occur in about 40% patients who received
      lumbar puncture. Now there lacks of effective approaches in the prophylaxis of PLPH, although
      some physicians consider bed rest for at least 6 hours to be a useful methods (Some recent
      meta-analysis found no benefit of bed rest for any hours in the prevention of PLPH). Studies
      have found that P substances and its receptor (Neurokinin-1 receptor, NK-1R)have played an
      important role in the pathogenesis of PLPH. Thus, we hypothesize that use of NK-1R inhibitor
      (aprepitant) 1 hour before lumbar puncture may decrease the incidence of PLPH and lower the
      severity of PLPH.
