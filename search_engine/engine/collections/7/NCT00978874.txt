        -  To determine if the presence and heterogeneity of hypoxia can be detected by fluorine F
           18 EF5 binding in tumors during PET/CT imaging in patients with newly diagnosed or
           recurrent carcinoma of the cervix.

        -  To determine if fludeoxyglucose F 18 uptake correlates with fluorine F 18 EF5 uptake.

        -  To assess the relationship between fluorine F 18 EF5 uptake and disease-free and overall
           survival.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to disease stage (locally advanced vs recurrent or
      metastatic disease).

      Patients receive fluorine F 18 EF5 IV followed by PET/CT imaging from the base of skull to
      upper thigh at baseline and during radiotherapy or chemotherapy (i.e., at 3-4 weeks after the
      initiation of radiotherapy or after the 4th, 5th, or 6th course of chemotherapy). Patients
      also undergo fludeoxyglucose F 18 PET/CT imaging within 7 to 10 days of the second fluorine F
      18 EF5 scan.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then annually
      thereafter.
