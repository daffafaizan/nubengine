      mechanisms are not clear, but patients with ESRD have more cerebral white matter changes.
      Several studies have shown that cognitive function improves post-transplant, indicating that
      there may be some reversibility in the process. This study will examine the correlation
      between cognitive impairment and structural brain changes before and after renal
      transplantation. We will also study the correlation of cognitive function with serum
      inflammatory markers before and after transplant. These results will be compared to aged
      matched healthy controls without kidney disease.
