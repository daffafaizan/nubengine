      Primary

        -  Determine the feasibility and tolerability of administering clofarabine and fractionated
           cyclophosphamide in patients with relapsed or refractory acute leukemia, chronic
           myelogenous leukemia, or high-risk myeloproliferative disorders

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of clofarabine and fractionated cyclophosphamide in
           these patients.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of these drugs in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Obtain preliminary data of biologic and pharmacodynamic effects of this regimen on
           marrow and circulating leukemic blasts in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients are stratified according to age (adult vs
      child).

      Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours on day 0. Patients then receive clofarabine
      IV over 2 hours and cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours on days 1-3 and 8-10. Treatment with
      clofarabine and cyclophosphamide repeats every 28 days for at least 2 courses in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of clofarabine and cyclophosphamide until
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that
      at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. At least 10 patients
      are treated at the MTD.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 70 patients will be accrued for this study.
