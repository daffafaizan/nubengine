      SC MRI. This MR-sequence delivers excellent contrast between the SC gray and white matter as
      well as between the SC and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in clinically feasible-acquisition
      times. Moreover, the high quality and in-plane resolution of AMIRA images allows for
      segmentation of the SC gray and white matter with high accuracy and reproducibility. This
      study is to evaluate the sensitivity and intra-/inter-observer agreement of the averaged
      magnetization inversion recovery acquisitions (AMIRA) in spinal cord (SC) Multiple sclerosis
      (MS) lesion detection and to evaluate the additional clinical value of this sequence in
      clinical settings.
