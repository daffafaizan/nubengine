        -  Determine the response rate and response duration in patients with cutaneous T-cell
           lymphoma when treated with bexarotene and, in the absence of a complete response,
           interferon alfa.

        -  Determine the safety and toxicity in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral bexarotene once daily for 8 weeks.

      Patients with a complete response (CR) after 8 weeks continue bexarotene alone for at least
      another 8 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients who progress or relapse during bexarotene therapy or who achieve less than a CR
      after 8 weeks begin receiving interferon alfa subcutaneously 3 times a week and oral
      bexarotene daily for at least another 8 weeks in the absence of continuing disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 4 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-45 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
