      performed pulling that causes noticeable hair loss and results in clinically significant
      distress or functional impairment (1). Trichotillomania appears relatively common with an
      estimated prevalence between 1-3% (2). Data on the pharmacological treatment of
      trichotillomania is limited to case reports and conflicting double-blind studies of serotonin
      reuptake inhibitors (3).

      Inositol is used for diabetic nerve pain, panic disorder, high cholesterol, insomnia, cancer,
      depression, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder
      (ADHD), autism, promoting hair growth, a skin disorder called psoriasis, and treating side
      effects of medical treatment with some medications, including lithium. A small study (n=3)
      found that subject's showed improvement while taking Inositol in both trichotillomania and
      pathological skin picking (4). This suggests that Inositol might be effective in treating a
      large sample of subjects with trichotillomania and it also suggests that it may be effective
      for impulse control disorders in general. Inositol has also been shown to be effective in
      treating obsessive compulsive disorder and showed significantly lower scores on the
      Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (5). Both studies indicate the effectiveness of
      Inositol in treating impulsivity and compulsivity in subjects. There is no medication
      approved by the Food and Drug Administration for trichotillomania. Inositol represents a
      potentially safe and effective treatment.
