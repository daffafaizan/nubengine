      shoulder surgery. As part of a multi-part investigation, The investigators intend to
      prospectively determine actual postoperative opioid use, while evaluating whether
      implementation of an educational session with pain contract would help minimize opioid use.
      Through use of a teaching session and pain contract, it is hypothesized opioid use would
      decrease. The investigators hypothesize the use of a pain contract and thorough discussion
      regarding proper opioid use and side-effects, will decrease the amount of postoperative
      opioid use.
