    
      The aim of the project is to use a combination of patient-derived organoid models:

        -  To amplify tumour tissue to obtain enough material for genomic and histological analysis

        -  to characterize the lung cancer sub-type

        -  To predict treatment (non)response.

      The following points will be addressed:

        1. First, the investigators plan to establish and characterize formation of organoids from
           biopsies of patients with lung cancer: in spheroids, in the 3D cellular model
           OncoCilAirTM (OncoTheis), and on the chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM).
           Patient-derived organoids from tumoural tissue (PDO) will be characterized and compared
           to the original tumour.

        2. Second, the investigators will test the chemoresponse (chemosensitivity and
           chemoresistance) of organoids to anti-cancer treatment.
