      I. Evaluate whether vaginal dilator adherence is improved with additional reminder phone
      calls and/or email reminder survey.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate whether there are differences in the length of vaginal canal between the
      non-intervention and intervention groups. Evaluate rates of gynecologic, urinary, and
      gastrointestinal toxicity.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive no additional reminders.

      ARM II: Patients receive a reminder email survey every 2 weeks for 1 year after completing
      radiation.

      ARM III: Patients receive a reminder email survey as in Arm I and 4 additional phone calls at
      4-8 weeks, 3-5 months, 7-8 months, and 10-11 months during their first year of follow-up.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 10-14 weeks, 5-7 months, 8-10 months,
      11-13 months, 15-17 months, 19-21 months, and 23-25 months post treatment.
