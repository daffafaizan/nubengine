    
      Rationale: Until now it has not been investigated whether placement of implants in SS
      patients is less successful than compared to non-SS patients. The risk factors and the
      efficacy of dental implants in dry mouth patients are not known because of the lack of
      scientific evidence.

      Objective: to investigate changes in marginal peri-implant bone loss and the clinical
      performance of dental implants in SS patients compared to implants in healthy patients.

      Study design: A prospective multicenter clinical trial.

      Study population: N = 120

      Intervention: All patients receive Biohorizons Laser-lok bonelevel implants to replace the
      missing (pre)molars or to support a full denture in the upper and lower jaw .

      This study is comprised of four study groups:

        -  30 human adults affected by SS with the need of replacement of missing premolars or
           molars in the upper or lower jaw.

        -  30 healthy human adults with the need of replacement of missing premolars or molars in
           the upper or lower jaw.

        -  30 human edentulous adults affected by SS with the need of stabilization of the
           dentures.

        -  30 healthy human edentulous adults with the need of stabilization of the dentures.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: changes in marginal peri-implant bone loss of dental
      implants between the healthy and SS groups and differences in clinical performance 1.5 years
      after finalization.
