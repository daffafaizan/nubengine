    
      This is an Intermediate-size patient population Expanded Access Protocol (EAP) to provide
      NurOwn® (MSC-NTF cells) for eligible ALS participants who completed the BCT-002-US phase 3
      ALS clinical trial and have received all three IT treatments.

      The participants will undergo up to three intrathecal (IT) treatments with NurOwn® (MSC-NTF
      cells).

      The first treatment will be at Visit 3, approximately 5-6 weeks after the BMA (Visit 2), with
      the subsequent treatments at Visit 4 and Visit 5.

      Following the third and last treatment, the participant will be followed for three additional
      monthly visits (in-person, if feasible, or by telephone call or telemedicine in consideration
      of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic) through week 28, during which the ALSFRS-R and safety
      assessments will be collected.
