    
      This Phase Ib/II study will investigate the anti-tumour activity and safety of daily oral
      doses MEN1611 in combination with cetuximab in female and male patients affected by PIK3CA
      mutated, N-K-RAS wild-type and BRAF wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer.

      MEN1611 is a potent, selective Class I phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor. The
      Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of MEN1611 given as single agent was assessed in a phase I trial
      in patients with advanced solid tumors.

      This Phase Ib/II will start with a dose confirmation part (Step 1) to identify the RP2D of
      MEN1611 given in combination with cetuximab.

      The study will continue with a cohort expansion (Step 2) to explore the anti-tumour activity
      of the selected MEN1611 dose level combined with cetuximab with further assessment of their
      safety and tolerability.
