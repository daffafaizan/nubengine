      regular, moderate to vigorous intensity physical activity for 60 minutes or more each day.
      Unfortunately, children in the U.S. are not meeting these goals. Moreover, physical
      inactivity in these children is considered a significant, contributing factor to childhood
      overweight and obesity. In addition to the importance of physical activity for overall
      physical health and fitness, classroom behavior, academic skills, and attention may also
      improve in children with increasing physical activity. There appears to be a positive
      association between physical activity and academic performance, mental cognition, and
      behavior in children, however, further research to delineate the ideal duration and intensity
      is warranted particularly in elementary school children. As schools in recent years have
      eliminated recess and/or physical education due to growing pressure to increase academic
      scores, creative solutions to engage children in physical activity are desperately needed.
      And with the vast majority of children's time spent in school, this may be the ideal location
      for implementing physical activity interventions.

      The purpose of this pilot study is to determine the feasibility of implementing a
      before-school, physical activity program. Furthermore, the effect the physical activity
      program may have on academic performance, and health measures will also be examined through
      several methods.

      The results of the proposed study may help design future physical activity interventions and
      provide insight to the relationship between physical activity and academic performance.
