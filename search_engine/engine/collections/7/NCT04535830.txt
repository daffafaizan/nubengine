      for reducing the risk of complications and all-cause mortality.Glucose monitoring is the key
      point of diabetes management.Continuous glucose monitoring(CGM)can identify day-to-day
      glucose profiles to guide management decisions.Flash glucose monitoring is a variant of CGM
      and is factory calibrated,requiring no finger pricks.The purpose of this study is to
      determine if Flash glucose monitoring improves glycemic control in adults with new-onset type
      2 diabetes.
