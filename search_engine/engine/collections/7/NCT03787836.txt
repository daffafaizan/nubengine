      suggest large interindividual variability exists in glycemic response to exercise, resulting
      in a subset of individuals known as exercise non-responders (NRs). Emerging research proposes
      that altering the parameters of an exercise intervention to provide a sufficient stimulus can
      elicit a response in those previously identified as NRs. To date, no research has attempted
      to rescue previously classified NRs based on glycemic outcomes by altering the parameters of
      an exercise intervention.

      This study will implement an exercise program targeted at achieving the Canadian Physical
      Activity Guidelines, and calculate the number of NRs. We will then evaluate if increasing the
      intensity of exercise will elicit response to the treatment in the NRs.

      Sixty adults living with prediabetes or T2D will be recruited into one of a control group, or
      an exercise group. The exercising participants will begin a 16-week exercise intervention,
      targeted at achieving 150 minutes of moderate to vigorous intensity (equating to 4.5 METs)
      aerobic physical activity per week. Following the 16-week exercise program, participants will
      be randomized into two groups, each completing an additional 12 weeks of exercise. The first
      will maintain the same time and intensity, while the other will complete the 150 minutes per
      week at an intensity equal to 6.0 METs. Randomization will occur in blocks in order to ensure
      an equal number of NRs in each group.
