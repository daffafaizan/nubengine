      In the animal study with pig, the result of Thunderbeat shows fast abalation rate and same
      thermal conductivity. There has been reported a significant reduction in operative time and
      same complications with Thunderbeat in gynecology patient who underwent laparoscopic
      hysterectomy with lymph node dissection. Comparison of the utilization of this new device,
      however, with the Harmonic scalpel in thyroidectomy has not been performed in any study. The
      objective of this study is to compare the results of thyroidectomy using the Thunderbeat to
      that with the Harmonic scalpel device in respect to hemostasis, operative time and
      perioperative complications. All patients undergoing a thyroidectomy in our endocrine surgery
      department are randomized into those operated with Thunderbeat (Group A) and those with
      Harmonic scalpel (Group B).
