    
      A total of 60 subjects were recruited and divided into two groups according to their ages:
      adolescents aged 7~17 and adults aged 18 ~45, 30 each.All subjects received 650nm low-energy
      red light irradiation treatment with a 650nm low-energy light emitter, twice a day for 3
      minutes each time, for 12 weeks in the adolescent group and for 3 weeks in the adult
      group.The adolescents were followed up before treatment, at the end of the 4th week and at
      the end of 12th week.In the adult group, follow-up examinations were conducted immediately
      after treatment on the 1st day, the 1st week, and the 3rd week.Angio-oct was used as the main
      examination to observe and record the vascular density and blood perfusion in macular area.
      The effects of 650nm low energy red light on macular blood circulation before and after
      treatment were respectively compared between the two groups.Axial length, diopter and OCT
      were used as secondary observation indexes.
