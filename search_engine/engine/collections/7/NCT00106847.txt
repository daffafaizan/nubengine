    
      This is a phase III, multicenter, randomized (patients are assigned different treatments
      based on chance), double-blind (neither the patient nor the physician knows whether drug or
      placebo is being taken, or at what dosage), placebo-controlled trial evaluating the
      effectiveness and safety of scheduled and as needed treatment with infliximab in patients
      with plaque-type psoriasis. This study will also help determine the way to use infliximab in
      treating patients with psoriasis.

      Safety evaluations will be performed at specified intervals throughout the study and will
      consist of laboratory tests, vital signs (such as blood pressure), physical examinations and
      the occurrence and severity of adverse events as well as other study specific procedures.

      Patients will receive infusions of either placebo, 3mg/kg or 5 mg/kg infliximab (Remicade) at
      weeks 0, 2, 6 14, 18, 22, 26, 30, 34, 38, 42 and 46. Patients receive either 3mg/kg, 5 mg/kg
      or placebo infusions at week 0, 2, and 6. The 3mg/kg and 5 mg/kg infliximab groups then
      receive either every 8 week infusions or infusions as needed when their psoriasis is less
      than 75% improved from baseline. The placebo patients begin infliximab at week 16, 18 and 22
      followed by every 8 week infusions.
