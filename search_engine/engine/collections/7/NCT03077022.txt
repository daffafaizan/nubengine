      number of arthroscopic hip operations has risen over the last few years, so has the level
      controversy in regards to the appropriate initial management. There have been many recent
      advances in clinical diagnosis, advanced imaging techniques, improved indications for surgery
      and improved arthroscopic techniques which have led to improved clinical outcomes, but the
      effectiveness of physical therapy remains unknown.

      A paucity of evidence exists in regards to the non-operative treatment of FAI.

      Several insurance companies are now requiring three to six months of physical therapy prior
      to approval for surgery. There is not a single study that has objectively evaluated the
      effectiveness of physical therapy in the avoidance of surgical intervention. The
      investigators plan to evaluate this using an electronic outcomes data collection system. The
      hypothesis is that the majority of patients will not see a significant enough improvement
      with physical therapy to avoid surgery, especially in a subset of patients such as those with
      sub spine impingement. The investigators plan to prospectively collect data for three years
      and monitor the outcome of each hip patient, especially those treated with physical therapy
      as an initial treatment and there potential avoidance of surgery.
