      disease. However, the underlying immune mechanisms that contribute to their effectiveness are
      incompletely understood. Transcriptomics (methods that measure the activity of thousands of
      genes) studies have identified key features of responses to vaccination(see references) and
      infection(see references). However, these experiments are typically performed on
      heterogeneous cell mixtures such as peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC which include
      certain types of white blood cells) and therefore provide an aggregate measure of gene
      expression from the many different immune cells and their respective activities in the
      mixture. Such results can obscure important biological information, particularly in minor
      subsets of active cells. Establishing a method for immune transcriptomics at single cell
      resolution would be a highly significant advance and enable more informative and functionally
      relevant systems immunology studies with commonly used sample types (i.e. PBMC). Applying
      this high-resolution approach to Yellow Fever Vaccine (YFV), an exceptionally effective
      vaccine, is likely to identify unappreciated mechanisms that contribute to protective
      immunity.
