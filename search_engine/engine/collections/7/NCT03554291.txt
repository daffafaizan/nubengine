      the right side of the heart. This stress and strain can cause right heart failure. Although
      there are medications to treat PAH, there are currently no medications that act directly on
      the heart to improve right heart function. This is different than left heart failure where
      one of the cornerstones of treatment is medication targeted at the heart to improve left
      heart function.

      Famotidine is a well-tolerated, over-the-counter, and inexpensive medication. Preliminary
      results suggest that famotidine may help the right heart to adapt and strengthen when
      stressed instead of fail; however, these results are suggestive and not definitive. A
      randomized controlled trial is required to evaluate the possibility that famotidine can
      impact right heart function.

      Participants in the study will take famotidine or placebo for 24 weeks. They will have three
      study visits at 0, 12, and 24 weeks. These visits will add 20-30 minutes to the standard
      clinic visits at those time points and there will be an echocardiogram at weeks 0 and 24.
      There will also be one phone visit at 4 weeks to check-in. Some participants may elect to
      participate in exercise testing and/or right heart catheterization at weeks 0 and 24;
      however, this is not required to participate in the trial.
