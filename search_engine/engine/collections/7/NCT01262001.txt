      with FG-3019 to eligible Cohort 1-EX (approximately 14 subjects) and Cohort 2 (approximately
      28 subjects) subjects who complete the Week 48-EX and Week 48 assessments described in
      Protocol Amendment 2, respectively. A subject is eligible for long-term extension of
      treatment if the investigator, after discussion with the Fibrogen Medical Monitor, believes
      that the subject would benefit from continued treatment with FG-3019.
