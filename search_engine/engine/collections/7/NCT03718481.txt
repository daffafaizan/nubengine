      assessments throughout each placement and appraisal at an Annual Review of Competence
      Progression (ARCP). The ARCP evaluates performance during each training year and determines
      progression to the next year of training. It is critical that the ARCP is a robust and fair
      process. The Association of Surgeons in Training (ASiT) sought to evaluate surgical trainees'
      experiences of the ARCP process in order to identify areas for improvement.

      Methods: A Prospective Cross-Sectional Questionnaire Study was conducted An electronic survey
      was developed and distributed electronically to the trainee membership of ASiT in the UK and
      Republic of Ireland. A 57 point survey examined the specifics of one ARCP cycle as well as
      attitudes to the process in general. Quantitative analysis was performed, along with thematic
      analysis on the free-text comments.
