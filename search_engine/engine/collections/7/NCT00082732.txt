        -  Determine whether a behavior-based dietary intervention can motivate patients with
           hormone-refractory prostate cancer to adopt and maintain a dietary pattern that includes
           < 20% of energy from fat, > 25 g of fiber, and 80 g of soy protein powder.

        -  Compare bioavailable levels of testosterone in patients treated with a behavior-based
           dietary intervention vs observation only.

        -  Determine whether this dietary intervention decreases or stabilizes a rising serum
           prostate-specific antigen level in these patients.

        -  Determine whether this dietary intervention improves disease-specific survival, mediated
           by reduced bioavailable levels of testosterone, in these patients.

        -  Determine the impact of a positive intervention outcome on androgen receptors in
           patients treated with this dietary intervention.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, controlled, pilot, multicenter study. Patients are randomized
      to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      All patients receive nutritional counseling on a healthy diet. Patients also keep a food
      diary during study participation.

        -  Arm I (dietary intervention): Patients receive dietary intervention comprising
           nutritional counseling on a low-fat, high-fiber, soy supplemented diet and
           behavior-based activities, such as goal-setting, contracting, and stimulus control, once
           weekly for 6 weeks, every 3 weeks for 33 weeks, and then at weeks 44, 48, and 52.
           Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II (observation): Patients undergo observation every 6 weeks for 36 weeks and then
           every 8 weeks for 18 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 92 patients (46 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
