      Primary

        -  Determine the response rate in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer treated with
           cetuximab and capecitabine that progressed on prior fluoropyrimidine-containing therapy
           comprising irinotecan with or without oxaliplatin.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the progression-free survival and overall survival of patients treated with
           this regimen.

        -  To determine the tolerance to therapy in these patients.

        -  To assess biological correlates of response in available tissue biopsies and blood
           samples.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive cetuximab IV over 1-2 hours on days 1, 8, and 15 and oral
      capecitabine twice daily on days 1-14. Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo tumor tissue and blood collection periodically for correlative studies.
      Samples are analyzed for expression of genes correlated with fluoropyrimidine responsiveness
      via quantitation RT-PCR; degree of expression of EGFR via immunohistochemistry; and
      expression pattern analysis via gene expression profiling and polymorphism.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.
