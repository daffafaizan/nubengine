439. configuration of transforming deoxyribonucleic acid during entry intobacillus subtilisa correlation was obtained between mapdistance and the length of the lag periodpreceding the appearance of pairs of genetictraits after the addition of dna to acompetent culture of b. subtilis.  the resultsare taken to indicate that dna enterscompetent cells in lengthwise fashion.the smallest length of transforming dnawhich can participate in a recombinationevent, and the number of nucleotide pairswhich enter the cell per unit time, havebeen estimated.  the evidence indicatesthat only part of the lag period is devotedto the transport of dna into the cell.the significance of these results withrespect to the mechanism of entry of dnainto the cell is discussed.
