      minimally invasive chronic implant for the treatment of urgency urinary incontinence. CTNS
      works by the same mechanism as percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS), but is provided
      for chronic use with an implantable device. CTNS treatment involves the placement of a
      minimally invasive stimulator with an embedded receiver at the tibial nerve. The Protect CTNS
      System has an external transmitter that activates the implanted stimulator and sends mild
      electrical pulses to the tibial nerve. These impulses travel to the sacral nerve plexus, the
      group of nerves at the base of the spine responsible for bladder function. Since stimulation
      with the Protect CTNS System is chronic it is expected that bladder activity can be changed
      more quickly and without the frequency of treatments related to PTNS.
