      source for inappropriate Mode Switch from the DDD mode to the DDI or VDI mode. Inappropriate
      loss of atrioventricular synchrony due to false positive Mode Switch is hemodynamically
      disadvantageous, may induce atrial tachyarrhythmias, can lead to pacemaker syndrome, and
      impairs the reliability of pacemaker Holter data. The aim of the study is to determine
      whether the use of a new atrial screw in lead with ultra short tip-ring distance of 1.1 mm
      (Study Group) eliminates the need for individual adjustment of the postventricular atrial
      blanking period (PVAB) based on an additional test in the Control Group with standard leads.
