      of Dentistry, National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH), Taiwan. Informed consent was
      obtained prior to participation. The study protocol was approved by the Human Research Ethics
      Committee of NTUH. Before the testing, the experimental protocol was explained to the
      subjects. The subjects with normal overnight sleep quality were recruited to prevent the
      influences in both physiological and physical fatigue. All potential subjects receive
      independent examinations by an occupational therapist and a dentist to determine the
      eligibility for inclusion as well as were blind to the study hypotheses. Both electrodermal
      activity (EDA) and heart rate variability (HRV) were recorded continually through the entire
      testing procedures. Since the EDA and HRV are sensitive indicators for autonomic nervous
      system modulation, a standardization procedure that ensures the integrity of data is
      accessed. The power of the testing is preset at 0.80, and the significant level is 0.05. The
      quasi-experimental design of clinical trial for repeated measures will be used.
