      of physical and mathematical models, statistical evaluations, and software implementation.
      The clinical experimental phase of the study (data collection) will involve hospitalized
      adult patients requiring a scheduled central venous catheterization and measurement of the
      CVP as part of their usual care. The latter will be used as the gold standard measure of CVP
      for the subsequent data processing and analysis. A small sample of healthy adult volunteers
      will also be recruited only for the non-invasive US evaluation of the JVP. The validation
      processes will include assessment of the diagnostic power of the US-JVP estimated CVP values
      and US-JVP waveforms, including evaluation of sensibility, specificity, predictive positive
      and negative values, accuracy and precision.
