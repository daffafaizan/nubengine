      Cornell curriculum for parents and caregivers focusing on the behaviors most likely to help
      children avoid unhealthy weight gain. These behaviors include drinking water or milk instead
      of sweetened beverages, eating more vegetables and fruits, playing actively, eating fewer
      high-fat and high-sugar foods, limiting screen time, and having sensible serving sizes. The
      8-session curriculum uses a learner-centered dialogue approach, hands-on activities and role
      plays. The study will include 300 participants with young children 3-5 years old in Head
      Start and childcare programs in New York City using a randomized control design. In period 1
      (9 weeks), half the groups will receive HCHF education (immediate education, IE) and half
      will serve as controls, receiving no education (delayed education, DE). In period 2 (9
      weeks), DE will receive education; IE will receive no education and be followed
      longitudinally for periods 2 and 3. In period 3 (16 weeks), neither group will receive
      education and both will be followed longitudinally. Data will be collected at each time point
      using validated measures, including the HCHF Checklist developed by the investigators and
      complementary measures that assess parenting feeding practices, food behavior in parents,
      food behavior in children, and parent self-efficacy around obesity prevention behaviors. It
      is hypothesized that change pre- to post- HCHF will be greater than control groups, and
      changes in behavior will be retained post-education.
