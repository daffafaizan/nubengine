      male erectile dysfunction using Penile Prosthesis Implants (PPIs). The data collection will
      be undertaken from multiple centres in Europe. The participation will be by open invitation
      from the European Association of Urology (EAU) Section of Genitourinary Reconstructive
      Surgeons (ESGURS) to all its members, along with other urologists undertaking these
      procedures.

      There will be no restriction on the number of patients enrolled per centre as long as they
      are consecutive. The aim is to have a long term collection of the dataset from as many
      centres as possible. An initial assessment for the robustness of the data collection and
      first clinical evaluation of the data collected will be performed 1 and 2 years after
      recruitment of the first patient by a nominated steering committee. Thereafter, the
      evaluations will be performed every 2 years until the end of Registry (10 years after the
      first patient was enrolled).
