    
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the operation, safety, and feasibility of the ISSD
      system in patients who require an ICD. An ISSD emulator will be briefly implanted and tested
      during the standard implantation procedure of an ICD, and then entirely removed.

      The emulator is not a powered medical device.

      This acute intra-operative protocol will test the ability of the ISSD to appropriately
      convert tachyarrhythmia.
