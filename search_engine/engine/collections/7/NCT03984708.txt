      peripheral motor neurons. None of the clinical trials conducted have been clearly successful
      and the disease remains incurable, putting patients' vital prognosis at risk in the medium
      term. An alteration of the basal metabolism leading to hypermetabolism has been described in
      several articles in the literature. The causes of this hypermetabolism and the precise
      exploration of the metabolic pathways involved are still poorly understood. The fibroblasts
      of ALS patients may be the site of some metabolic disturbances in this disease with a
      hypothetical specific basal metabolic profile. These cells are adapted to different metabolic
      explorations such as omnic approaches. Superficial skin biopsy followed by fibroblast culture
      can provide a considerable biobank. This cellular richness will allow us, in ALS patients and
      their controls, to perform experiments for the quantification of metabolites by metabolic and
      lipidomic approaches, as well as the quantification of mRNAs and the rate of gene
      transcription by a transcriptomic approach.
