    
      Single centre prospective non-randomised non-comparative study of patients delivered by
      ambulance and admitted to the CCU with suspected NSTEACS.

      Aims of this study are:

        1. To characterize the contingent of patients admitted to the CCU with suspected NSTEACS.

        2. To evaluate possibilities of fast differential diagnosis and risk stratification in
           patients admitted to the CCU with suspected NSTEACS using clinical data, ECG, biomarker
           levels (hsTn, NT-proBNP, hsCPR, cardiac FABP) as well as HEART, ADAPT, EDACS, T-MACS,
           GRACE, ACTION and TIMI scores.

        3. To evaluate the correlation between clinical data, ECG, biomarker levels (hsTn,
           NT-proBNP, hsCPR, cardiac FABP) as well as HEART, ADAPT, EDACS, T-MACS, GRACE, ACTION
           and TIMI scores with presence and severity of coronary atherosclerosis in patients
           admitted to the CCU (intensive care unit) with suspected NSTEACS.
