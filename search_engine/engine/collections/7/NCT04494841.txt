      patients from a mixed physical therapy/chiropractic practice with demographic and economic
      diversity in the metro Washington area. The neuromodulatory device will have patient
      controlled frequencies at 50Hz, 100Hz, and 180Hz attached to a 12 x 22 cm metal plate
      ergonomically curved to fit the low back. The device will be wearable with a neoprene belt on
      both sides for patients to adjust pressure. The metal pocket in our device holds a 221g clay
      pack capable of being frozen to 15F or heated to 110F or patient tolerance, with 30 minute
      thermal capacity. A convenience sample of 10 patients at the clinic was invited to give
      feedback on the prototype device after informed consent. Changes suggested were incorporated
      and after informed consent a second group of ten gave will give feedback with the
      production-ready device.
