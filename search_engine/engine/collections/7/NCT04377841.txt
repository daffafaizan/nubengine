      presentations, the association between the two diagnoses is not clearly identified.

      Clinically, we plan to enroll 120 patients with facial demodicosis, ocular demodicosis. We
      will obtain their basic information, medical history, medication, and lifestyle. We will
      evaluate their clinical features. We will also perform quantitative tests including direct
      microscopic examination and cilia epilation test:

        1. Direct microscopic examination: On glabella and bilateral cheeks, follicular contents in
           the 1-cm Ã— 1-cm area will be squeezed out. The contents are transferred onto a glass
           slide, covered with mineral oil and a cover slide, and examined under the microscope.

        2. Epilation: Four (4) non-adjacent cilia will be pulled from each upper eyelid and
           examined under the microscope. The total Demodex counts are recorded.

      We will analyze the clinical presentations, the density of Demodex infestation, and possible
      risk factors of the two diagnoses.
