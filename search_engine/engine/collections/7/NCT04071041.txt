      interventional controlled clinical trial. The estimated sample size is of 360 patients, who
      will be recruited from three Spanish hospitals. Hypoalbuminemic (â‰¤30g/L) adult patients with
      CAP will be randomly assigned (1:1) to receive standard care plus albumin (20g in 100ml)
      every 12 hours for 4 days or standard care alone.

      The primary endpoint will be the proportion of clinical stable patients at day 5, defined as
      stable vital signs for at least 24h, analyzed by intention to treat.

      The secondary endpoints will be time to clinical stability; duration of intravenous and total
      antibiotic treatment; length of hospital stay; intensive care unit admission; duration of
      mechanical ventilation and vasopressor treatment; adverse events; readmission within 30 days
      and all-cause mortality.
