      infant formula, are less likely to experience the serious illnesses and poor developmental
      outcomes associated with VLBW. However, a disparity exists in breast milk feeding. Infants
      whose mothers have low educational attainment and low income are less likely to receive
      maternal breast milk than infants whose mothers who do not have low educational attainment
      and low income. The primary objective of this proposed research is to determine the effect of
      lactation discharge instructions in an audio-visual format provided to mothers for home
      viewing on the dose and duration of maternal breast milk received by their VLBW infants
      during the neonatal intensive care unit hospitalization.

      Methods. Forty mothers of VLBW infants will be randomly assigned to receive a breast milk
      expression instruction digital video disc (DVD) in addition to standard of care lactation
      education or assigned to receive written instructions in addition to standard of care
      lactation education. In addition to comparing infant intake of maternal breast milk intake,
      pre and post intervention lactation and breast milk expression knowledge will be compared
      between groups and DVD viewing frequency and acceptability will be determined with a log and
      questionnaire to be completed by the intervention group and collected the first month after
      delivery.
