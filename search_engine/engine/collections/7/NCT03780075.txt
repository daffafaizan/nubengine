      high numbers dying from this disease. Recent studies have demonstrated the possibility of
      177Lu-PSMA-617 therapy as a viable treatment option in mCRPC. To increase tumor accumulation
      and retention for radioligand therapy, and reduce dosage of 177Lu, the investigators
      conjugated a truncated Evans blue (EB) molecule and DOTA chelator onto PSMA-617 (EB-PSMA-617)
      and label it with 177Lu.

      The study is open-label and patients will be divided into three groups and monitored
      throughout the 6 to 10-month treatment period for survival, disease progression, and adverse
      events to evaluate the safety and therapy response to the 177Lu-EB-PSMA-617.
