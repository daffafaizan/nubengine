      I. To collect, both prospectively and retrospectively, data on disease characterization,
      treatment, and outcomes for patients with neuroendocrine carcinoma of the uterine cervix.

      II. To organize clinical information in order to support multifaceted queries of patient
      characteristics, treatment, and disease outcome data and to facilitate correlation of these
      characteristics with patient outcome.

      III. To have a single data repository kept on a secure platform that will integrate clinical
      information and research findings and serve as an archive for future research.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients' medical records are reviewed retrospectively and prospectively. Patients are
      followed up by email, telephone, or United States (U.S.) mail every 4 months for up to 10
      years from date of initial study enrollment. Patients, who are beyond 5 years from their
      initial diagnosis, are followed up by email, telephone, or U.S. mail annually.
