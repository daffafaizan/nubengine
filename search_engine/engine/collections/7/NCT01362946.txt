      sufficient for children with conduct problems (CP) and callous-unemotional (CU) traits. Other
      research suggests that children with CPCU are less responsive to punishments as evaluated
      using controlled laboratory tasks. Based on these two sets of findings, it was hypothesized
      that behavioral treatment modified to emphasize reward and de-emphasize punishments would be
      advantageous when used to treat children with CPCU. This hypothesis was tested in a treatment
      development study that had three phases. During phase 1, which occurred in 2010, the
      intervention was planned and treatment procedures and manuals were developed. During phase 2,
      which occurred in 2011, a pilot study was conducted in which the intervention was tested in
      an iterative manner in a group of 12 children with conduct problems and callous-unemotional
      traits. In phase 3, a larger trial was conducted using a cross over design, with one-half of
      participants getting standard behavioral treatment for four weeks followed by modified
      behavioral treatment for four weeks and remaining participants receiving treatments in the
      reverse order.Treatments were evaluated using parent ratings, counselor ratings, and
      frequency counts of behavior during treatments.
