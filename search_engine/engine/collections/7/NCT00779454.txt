      diagnosed each year. A small part of the patients can be offered surgery, but the operation
      will rarely be radical, and most patients with cholangiocarcinoma are therefore candidates
      for chemotherapy.

      In Denmark the combination therapy of Gemcitabine, Oxaliplatin and Capecitabine has been used
      in recent years. Based on experience with gastrointestinal tumors, however, there seems to be
      an effect of new biological substances, including EGFR antibodies. There are casuistic
      reports on the specific effect of a monoclonal antibody against EGFR in cholangiocarcinoma.

      The effect of EGF is mediated through an intracellular pathway involving the KRAS protein. It
      has been shown that a mutation of KRAS causes the EGF system to be constantly activated.
      Effect in patients with a KRAS mutation is therefore not to be expected. Approximately 50% of
      the patients present this mutation.
