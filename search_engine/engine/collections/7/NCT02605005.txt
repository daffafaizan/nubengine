      patients randomise themselves by choosing the type of anesthesia technique (general
      anesthesia or interscalene block) after detailed description of both techniques. They receive
      the standard, routine medical care (monitoring and anesthesia techniques) during which the
      obtained data of arterial pressure, heart rate, peripheral and cerebral oxygen saturation
      will be statistically analysed and compared.
