      composition, glycemic index and glycemic load, which have foods with high glycemic index or
      glycemic load (white rice, white bread, corn flakes, mashed potatoes, orange juice (brown
      rice, whole wheat bread, whole noodles, oat bran, yogurt, milk, apple, pear, peach). The
      methodology for calculating GC estimates will be based on the FAO / WHO Protocol. The diets
      will be designed in 1200, 1400, 1600, 1800 and 2000 kcal / day. All participants will be
      categorized according to one of the five levels of the diet's energy content. In addition,
      all patients will receive a leaflet with nutritional guidelines according to their diet.

      with a nutritionist on a weekly basis and complete the 24-hour food recall.

      It will be measured the pulse wave velocity.This outcome will be evaluated before the
      beginning of the diets and 6 weeks after the beginning of the diets.
