    
      Specific Aim 1: Participants will be recruited from 8 Pittsburgh-area schools. The
      investigators will conduct a social network survey for all 6th graders in each school.
      Students will be asked to identify their closest peers based on several relationship
      dynamics: friendship, opinion leadership, academic support, and personal support.

      Specific Aim 2: The investigators will adapt modules from CATCH My Breath, an evidence-based,
      school-implemented e-cigarette intervention supported by University of Texas and MD Anderson
      Cancer Center. The 8 schools will be randomized to receive the intervention led by either (1)
      an adult content-expert or (2) a peer-nominated opinion leader to students who nominated them
      or (3) a peer-nominated opinion leader to students who did not nominate them. Surveys will be
      administered before and after the intervention. Primary outcomes will be acceptability and
      feasibility measures, including (1) recruitment and (2) retention rates. Secondary outcomes
      will include e-cigarette use, intention-to-use e-cigarettes, and knowledge about
      e-cigarettes.
