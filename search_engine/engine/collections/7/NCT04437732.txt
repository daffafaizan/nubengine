    
      Apioc-P and Apioc-PT is an investigational contact lens, which means it has not been approved
      by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), although the contact lens material, called
      Definitive 74, is already approved and marketed for contact lenses that are similar to
      Apioc-P and Apioc-PT. In this study, participants will wear an Apioc-P and Apioc-PT contact
      lens the way they wear their current contact lenses for approximately one month (no more than
      35 days).

      Participation in this study will include a minimum of four study visits. The first will last
      up to 90 minutes, the second will last up to 45 minutes, the third will last up to 45
      minutes, and the final visit will be up to 90 minutes. If the lens does not appear to be
      fitting properly at the second visit, then another lens will be ordered for participants and
      they will be asked to return for an additional visit for up to 45 minutes. Up to 60 subjects
      will participate in this study.
