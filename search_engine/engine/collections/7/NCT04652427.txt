      anesthesia, nerve block, regional blocking, intravertebral anesthesia. Patients under
      non-general anesthesia surgery, is still in a more sober state, easily due to external
      factors and increase the psychological and mental burden, even if the ideal anaesthetic
      effect can be achieved, but for autonomic nerve activities can not be completely and
      effectively eliminated. Hydrochloric acid right-metomidine is an alpha2-adrenaline receptor
      agonisant developed by Orion Pharma (Finland) and Abott (Usa) in collaboration. Unlike other
      sedative hypnotic sedatives, hydrochloric acid right metamine produces a sedative hypnotic
      effect by acting on the blue spot nuclear alpha2 receptor and the inflammatory endogenous
      sleep-stimulating pathway, allowing the patient to maintain a natural sleep state of non-fast
      eye III, which is characterized by the patient being stimulated or speech-altered, and does
      not produce respiratory inhibition during sedative hypnosis. In addition to the sedative
      effect, the right metomisurein also has anti-anxiety, reduce stress response, stable
      hemodynamics, analgesic, inhibitsalival secretion, anti-cold and diuretic function, and other
      sedative analgesic drugs when used with good synergy, can significantly reduce the use of
      other sedative analgesic drugs.
