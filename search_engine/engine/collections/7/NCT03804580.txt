    
      This is a phase II, single-arm study to assess the safety and efficacy of osimertinib (80 mg,
      orally, once daily) as first-line therapy in patients with EGFR mutation-positive, locally
      advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have not previously treated
      with an epidermal growth factor tyrosine kinase inhibitor agent.

      Subjects will have to provide a biopsy sample (fresh or archival) for molecular testing at
      inclusion. If feasible, a biopsy will also be sampled when partial response is achieved and
      at the time of disease progression on osimertinib. Liquid biopsies will be sampled throughout
      the treatment period.

      Subjects should continue on study treatment until RECIST 1.1-defined progression or until a
      treatment criterion is met. There is no maximum duration of treatment as subjects may
      continue to receive investigational product beyond RECIST1.1-defined progression as long as
      they are continuing to show clinical benefit, as judged by the investigator.
