      painful herpetic gingivostomatitis and perioral vesicles. The investigators discuss the
      pathophysiology of primary herpes simplex virus infection and the effect of maternal
      antibodies on the infant's immune system. In addition, the investigators explain the
      diagnosis, management, and prognosis of herpes simplex virus infection in young infants.
