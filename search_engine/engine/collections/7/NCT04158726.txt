      patient and provider use of Carevive Treatment Care Planning technology. The provider
      education component of the intervention highlights evidenced guidelines and investigational
      agents in the treatment of AML in older adults. The Carevive CPS will be used for the second
      component of the intervention. The results of this study will provide important information
      about drivers of treatment decision-making and practice patterns, feasibility of a technology
      platform to incorporate important, but under-utilized components of value-based care into
      practice, and healthcare utilization data.
