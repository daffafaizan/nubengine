      non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) were found, compared to best evidence as described in
      guidelines. In a problem analysis study, barriers and facilitators for good quality of
      NHL-care were assessed and a tailored implementation strategy was developed, based on these
      findings. The proposed study aims at the effectiveness, feasibility and costs of this
      tailored strategy to improve quality of care for patients with an NHL in a clustered
      randomized controlled trial in 19 Dutch hospitals.

      Multilevel regression analyses will be performed to evaluate the effectiveness of both
      strategies. Exposure to and experiences with the strategy elements will be analysed
      descriptively.

      Regarding the costs, the two strategies are compared with a health care perspective. The
      input of resources will be assessed by collecting volumes of consumed resources and
      multiplying these by the price of each resource unit; the implementation process and
      consequently costs will be estimated by an Activity Based Costing (ABC) approach. The output
      will be determined by the level of adherence to the NHL quality indicators.
