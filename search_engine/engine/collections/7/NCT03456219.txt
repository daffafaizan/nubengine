      habits, which provoke metabolic and nutritional disorders. In this crossover study the
      participants consumed, at different times and separated by 6 days interval, two meals
      pre-established at the time of night work: a control and a higher-protein. On the day of each
      intervention, the participants were evaluated for response of blood and subjective markers
      after meal (glucose, insulin, triglycerides and subjective perceptions related to ingestion
      after each meal). It is expected that the standardization of a glycemic reduction diet will
      improve the metabolic response of the workers, demonstrated in the results of the biochemical
      parameters. If this scenario is confirmed, it is still expected that the data and results
      obtained in this study may serve as subsidies for the elaboration of nutritional
      interventions consistent with the work routine at night.
