      participants scheduled for lung cancer surgery. At time of enrollment (at least 3 weeks
      before their scheduled surgery), participants will complete baseline assessments, receive the
      uPEP exercise prescription, and be oriented to the wearable fitness device. A research
      assistant will call the participant to conduct an audiotaped semi-structured interview
      regarding the acceptability of the electronically-monitored uPEP within 7- 14 days of
      enrollment. The study team will complete follow-up assessments on the day of surgery, two
      weeks after surgery, and four months after surgery. Data will also be collected from chart
      review and the wearable fitness device throughout the study.
