    
      The order of infusion on Days 1, 8, and 15 will be gemcitabine first, immediately followed by
      ON 01910.Na. The dose of gemcitabine will be fixed at 1000 mg/m2 i.v. as a 30 minutes
      infusion on days 1, 8, and 15 every 28 days. The starting dose of ON 01910.Na is 600 mg/m2 as
      a 2 hour intravenous (i.v.) infusion on days 1, 4, 8, 11, 15 and 18 of a 28-day course. The
      dose of ON 01910.Na will be escalated in increments in successive cohorts (dose level (DL) 1
      = 600 mg/m2, DL 2 = 1200 mg/m2, DL 3 = 1800 mg/m2) of new patients. A course is defined as 4
      weeks in length. Toxicity will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE v3.0). A minimum of three new patients
      will be treated at each dose level with a minimum of a 1 week stagger between the dosing of
      the first and remaining patients in each new dose cohort. In exceptional circumstances (e.g.
      where there is one slot available in a cohort and two eligible patients have been screened),
      the Sponsor may allow four patients to enter a cohort (or seven patients to enter an expanded
      cohort). A DL -1A (ON 01910.Na = 400 mg/m2) is set in case dose de-escalation is required
      with the starting dose due to ON 01910.Na-related toxicity. A DL -1A gemcitabine = 750 mg/m2
      and DL - 1B at 500 mg/m2 are set in case dose de-escalation is required with the starting and
      subsequent doses due to gemcitabine-related toxicity. If DLT is not observed in the first
      three patients, then the dose of ON 01910.Na will be increased to the next level (see Section
      4.2 for definitions of DLT). If DLT occurs in any of the first three new patients in the
      first course, at least three additional new patients will be treated. If no further DLT is
      encountered, dose escalation will proceed. Alternately, if DLT is noted in one or more of
      three additional patients, dose escalation will be terminated and the MTD will be defined as
      the highest dose level at which none of the first three patients or no more than one of six
      patients experienced DLT in course 1. All patients receiving doses exceeding the confirmed
      MTD will have their dose reduced to the MTD; even if apparently tolerating their current
      dose. Intra-patient dose escalation of ON 01910.Na will be permitted. There will be no limit
      to the number of courses that could be administered to a patient who is both tolerating and
      benefiting from therapy.

      A patient will be considered evaluable for the purposes of the dose escalation decision if
      the patient completes the first course of therapy without missing more than 1 dose of ON
      01910.Na for reasons unrelated to toxicity, or if the patient is withdrawn due to a DLT.
      Non-evaluable patients will be replaced. Escalation to the next dose level will occur only
      after the third evaluable patient (or sixth, if an expanded cohort), on the previous dose
      level has been observed for 4 weeks. Dose escalation decisions will be made by a Cohort
      Review Committee (CRC). Intra-patient dose escalation of ON 01910.Na will be allowed after
      the third evaluable patient on the next dose level has been observed for 4 weeks with
      acceptable tolerability (ie, MTD has not been exceeded per criteria above).

      Once the MTD has been defined, an expanded cohort of 20 to 23 additional patients (depending
      if 3 or 6 patients were enrolled on the previous cohort) will be enrolled at the MTD dose
      level in order to further define the safety and tolerability of this regimen, and
      characterize the pharmacokinetics of ON 01910.Na alone and after gemcitabine, and perform a
      tumor biomarker study.
