    
      This is a 12-week, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, two-arm, vehicle controlled study.
      Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to BPX-04 minocycline topical gel 1% or vehicle. This study
      will include approximately 176 randomized subjects with inflammatory lesions of
      papulopustular rosacea on the face, defined by an IGA score of 3 (moderate) or 4 (severe) at
      Baseline. Subjects will be healthy male or female subjects aged 18 years or older. There will
      be up to 20 study sites in the USA.

      Subjects will apply approximately 1 gram of topical gel once each day for a 12 week duration.
      They will come to the study site at Screening, Baseline, and Weeks 4, 8, and 12 or early
      termination (ET) for the protocol required efficacy and safety evaluations.

      At each visit, efficacy will be assessed by rosacea lesion counts, IGA, PGI-S, PGI-I, CGI-S,
      CGI-I, RosaQoL, Erythema Assessment Scale, Telangiectasia Assessment Scale and subject
      satisfaction questionnaire.

      Safety will be assessed with vital signs, physical examination, laboratory tests such as
      clinical hematology and chemistries, investigators' and subjects' assessments of cutaneous
      tolerability, incidence of minocycline-induced skin hyperpigmentation, incidence of visual
      disturbances and/or headaches suggestive of pseudotumor cerebri, and incidence of TEAEs.
      Blood samples will be collected to evaluate the level of minocycline in plasma at Baseline
      and Week 12/ET.
