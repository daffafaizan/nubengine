        -  Determine the complete and partial response rates of patients with chemotherapy-na√Øve
           unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma treated with T900607.

        -  Determine the efficacy of this drug, in terms of duration of response and time to
           disease progression, in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the safety profile of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive T900607 IV over 1 hour once weekly. Treatment continues in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-35 patients will be accrued for this study.
