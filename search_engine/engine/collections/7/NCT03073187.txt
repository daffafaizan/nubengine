      Asthma control is an important risk factor for poor sleep and poor academic performance. In
      addition, poor asthma control, poor sleep hygiene, and poor sleep quality are more likely in
      urban settings. Interventions to promote sleep quality by targeting both asthma control and
      sleep hygiene in this vulnerable population are lacking.

      To adapt ASMA and Sleep-Smart, the investigators will use a 3-step iterative process that
      will consist of (1) interviewing high school students and their caregivers, (2) interviewing
      high school teachers and (3) conducting separate focus groups with students and caregivers.
      The investigators hypothesize that the intervention will be feasible and acceptable. This
      study is a multi-site trial and collaboration between Columbia University Medical Center and
      Rhode Island Hospital (RIH).
