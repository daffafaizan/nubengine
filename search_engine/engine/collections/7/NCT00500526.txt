      the first one is going to have singing classes for six months; the other one is going to have
      classes of general manual arts for a similar period of time. The patients of both groups are
      going to perform spirometry, measurements of maximal respiratory pressures and answer the
      health related quality of life questionnaires SF-36 and Saint George's before the beginning
      of practice and after 6 months.Both singing and manual arts practices are going to be
      administered one hour a week by specialized teachers.
