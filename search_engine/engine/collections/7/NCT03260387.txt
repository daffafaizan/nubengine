      participate in this observational study, with 450 participants anticipated. The aims of the
      study are:

      Aim 1: To determine (1a) whether patient and disease characteristics are associated with
      favorable pain and health-related quality-of-life outcomes (HRQOL) after TPIAT; (1b) the
      optimal timing of the TPIAT intervention to resolve pain and improve HRQOL; and (1c) in a
      subset of patients, the impact of central sensitization on pain resolution.

      Aim 2: To determine (2a) whether patient and disease characteristics are associated with
      favorable glycemic outcomes from the IAT procedure; and (2b) the optimal timing of TPIAT to
      obtain post-surgical insulin independence.

      Aim 3: To determine the cost-effectiveness of TPIAT.
