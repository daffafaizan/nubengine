      I. To assess the changes in the fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient
      (ADC) values of the lower extremity nerves by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) before
      initiation and after completion of taxane chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Establish normal and abnormal FA and ADC values of the lower extremity nerves.

      II. Evaluate relationship of DTI findings of chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy
      (CIPN) with self-reported Patient Neurotoxicity Questionnaire (PNQ) and Functional Assessment
      of Cancer Therapy/Gynecologic Oncology Group-neurotoxicity questionnaire (FACT-GOT-NTX)
      questionnaires.

      III. Assess inter-reader variability in measuring FA and ADC values.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo non-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of both lower extremities
      using magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) and DTI prior to initiation and after completion
      of standard of care chemotherapy.
