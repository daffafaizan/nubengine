      lower limb strength and collecting blood samples to test for enzymes which relate to Pompe's
      disease. These measures will be completed during a routine clinic visit. Participation will
      also involve the study coordinator accessing medical notes to gain information about disease
      history.

      The study aims to collect information about the number of patients attending respiratory
      clinics with undiagnosed Pompe's disease and the characteristics of these patients so that
      other specialist services could use these criteria to identify patients who may benefit from
      investigations and treatment. If any participants are diagnosed with Pompe's disease and
      could benefit from treatment medical staff would refer them for treatment at local UK
      centres.
