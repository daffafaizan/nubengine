    
      This is a prospective, comparative, non-interventional study involving one clinical nutrition
      unit in France. Gut microbial will be evaluated with feces between patients and healthy
      volunteers.

      Main investigations:

        -  Presence of gut microbial deviation compared to healthy volunteers;

        -  Presence of a significant statistical association between this deviation and metabolic
           disorders.

      For each patient under the routine care a clinical examination and a blood sample will be
      done for standard biology report and nutrition. The age, gender, weight, height (for
      calculation of BMI), type of anorexia nervosa will be also collected with the pathological
      behavior associated (physical and intellectual hyperactivity, potomania, ongoing supplements
      drug taking including vitamins and trace elements). Eating and psychological disorders will
      be evaluated with EDI (eating disorder inventory) questionnaire.

      Only the age, gender, height, weight (BMI), medical antecedents and ongoing treatment taking
      will be collected.
