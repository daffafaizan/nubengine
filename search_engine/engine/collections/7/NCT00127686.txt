      the most bothersome symptom for children with colds. It is particularly annoying at night
      because it can interrupt sleep for both coughing children and their parents. Dextromethorphan
      (DM), the most common over-the-counter (OTC) "cough medication," may not be as helpful for
      these symptoms as previously believed. Because of this, treatments are needed to better
      reduce the symptoms from a cold. Honey is a naturally occurring substance that may provide
      relief for cold symptoms. Children are being offered the opportunity to take part in this
      research because they have been diagnosed with a cold and have had difficulty sleeping due to
      their cough.

      The purpose of this research is to use a survey to see if a single dose of honey or DM is
      better than no treatment at all for controlling nighttime cough in children, ages 2 to less
      than 18 years with a cold and if the medicine or honey helps the quality of sleep for the
      coughing children and their parents. DM has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration
      (FDA) and is available over the counter. The form of honey used in this study may also be
      purchased without a doctor's prescription.

      About 125 male and female children from 2 to less than 18 years old will take part in this
      study at the Hershey Medical Center.
