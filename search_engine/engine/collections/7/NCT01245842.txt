      population. The disease may have large influences on an individual's function, health related
      quality of life and participation in the society. In recently published clinical guidelines
      for management, non-pharmacological approaches are considered as core treatments.

      Several studies have demonstrated that exercise may reduce pain and improve function in
      persons with knee OA, and a similar effect is suggested for hip OA. Regarding effect of
      exercises in hand OA, available research results are limited, and randomised controlled
      trials (RCT) of good quality are needed.
