      ultrasound guidance and nerve stimulation.

      Despite these different means of identification, nerves contacts and intraneural injection
      are frequent. Even rare, nerve damage may occur.

      The nerve damage may be related to direct trauma with the needle or inadvertent intra-neural
      injection. High injection pressure of local anesthetic (AL) is an indicator that further
      characterize the location of the needle in terms of tissue density. In clinical practice,
      local anesthetic injection pressure monitoring is performed manually or by a pressure
      transducer according to the availability of the equipment or preferences of clinicians. To
      date, no comparative study has measured the advantages of this measure during PNB.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate injection pressure monitoring in order to reduce the
      risk of intraneural injection.

      sentinel mode. Manual injection pressure control Group 2: ultrasound-guided PNB, "in plane"
      approach, Nerve stimulator set to detection mode. Electronic Injection Pressure controlled
