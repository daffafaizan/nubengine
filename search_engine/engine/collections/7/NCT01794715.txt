      the are referred with heart failure and concent to participate in the study. No other
      exclusion criteria other than no willing/able to give their concent.

      Study population: Approximately 80 patients Intervention: All participants will undergo
      careful medical history, physical examination and blood tests led by nurses. All patients
      will be examined twice (by two nurses), one will routinely add ultrasound examination of the
      pleural space and the inferior vena cava to assess volume state, the other nurse will not
      perform ultrasound examination. Full cross-over design were nurses do ultrasound examinations
      at a random matter.

      Patients will then be examined by echocardiography by experience cardiologist's
      echocardiographers. Outcome measures:Change in therapy after routinely performed ultrasound
      examinations vs controls, detection of volume state when performing ultrasound examinations
      compared to controls with cardiologist's echocardiographic examination as a gold standard.

      Descriptive data of patients before, under and after examinations.
