      that clearly permit storage of patient material at SJCRH will be banked, provided proof of
      informed consent is available. Such samples will be tagged accordingly and will be only
      released to fulfill the aim(s) of the protocol under which they were obtained, or to
      investigators that apply to the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital Tissue Resources
      Committee to use the samples.
