      adults, under conditions that reflect typical beverage consumption. We will first identify
      molecular pathways potentially affected by LCS (adipose transcriptomics via global RNAseq)
      and then identify links between LCS-induced gene expression changes and circulating levels of
      key metabolic biomarkers and clinical outcomes. We will perform subcutaneous adipose biopsies
      before and after consumption of 12 ounces of diet soda three times daily for eight weeks.
      Within-subjects changes in adipose gene expression will be evaluated using RNAseq. We will
      then correlate transcriptomic changes with circulating levels of key inflammatory and
      metabolic biomarkers, to provide mechanistic insight into which pathways drive
      clinically-relevant LCS-induced metabolic impairments. We will measure glucose, insulin,
      inflammatory markers and adipose-derived hormones before and after eight weeks of LCS
      exposure.
