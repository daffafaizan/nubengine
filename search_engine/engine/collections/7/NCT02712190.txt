      clearance despite the absence of thoracic movement in anesthetized, invasively ventilated
      subjects. This same technique could be applied by a non-invasive interface (HF-NIV), allowing
      to obtain a prolonged apnea (absence of thoraco-abdominal respiratory movements) in awaken
      subjects. Such an application would be of interest for several clinical applications, e.g.
      lung imaging and radio-therapy treatment on lung cancer. The purpose of the study is to
      assess the effect of different HF-NIV setting on the apnea duration, carbon dioxide clearance
      and oxygen delivery in healthy subjets and patients with lung diseases.
