      efficacy of the CTLA-4 and PD-1 antibodies expressing MUC1-CAR-T for patients with MUC1
      positive, advanced recurrent or refractory malignant solid tumors. MUC1-CAR-T can specificly
      and effectively kill the MUC1 positive cancer cells, CTLA4 and PD-1 antibodies are secreted
      from the CAR-T cells could improve immunosuppression microenvironment, new CAR-T cells
      contain the advantages of CAR-T and immune checkpoint inhibitor, which is a promising
      therapeutic method for advanced solid tumors.

      The new CAR-T therapy is applied to clinical practice as bellow. T cells are prepared from
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) by leukapheresis, and then activated and engineered
      to express CTLA-4 and PD-1 antibodies and chimeric antigen receptor targeting MUC1. Cells are
      proliferated in culture and returned to the patients by venous transfusion. A total of 40
      patients may be enrolled in the study. The total duration of the study is expected to be
      approximately 24 months.
