      expression and up-regulating anti-inflammatory gene expression in leukocytes. There is a
      local release of vasodilators, including adenosine and nitric oxide that are thought to have
      renal protective effects [16]. More is known regarding ischemic preconditioning in the heart,
      where it has been shown to decrease the adenine nucleotide pool, increase creatine phosphate
      and intracellular glucose, decrease ATP depletion, and lactate and H+ accumulation. This
      leads to sodium maintenance of the transmembrane sodium gradient that prevents intracellular
      edema. Ischemic preconditioning is thought to yield protection in the first minutes of
      reperfusion. Activation of the adenosine A1, bradykinin, and opioid receptors is thought to
      trigger protection. This is supported by the interference with protection if an adenosine
      receptor antagonist is administered. The role of reactive oxygen species as part of the
      protective mechanism has also been described via mitochondrial mKATP channels which lead to
      increased production of protective superoxide. Protein kinase C may also be involved in the
      protective mechanism of ischemic preconditioning, however the exact mechanism is unknown and
      controversial.
