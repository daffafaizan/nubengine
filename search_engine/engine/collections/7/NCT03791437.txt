      Hippocrates. Thus far, the function of chest tubes, specifically to drain fluid or air from
      the pleural space, has virtually remained unchanged for more than 3000 years. The use of
      chest drainage tubes after thoracic surgery is crucial to evacuate air leakage and/or pleural
      effusion; however, delayed tube removal may exacerbate pain, delay recovery of lung function
      and prolong hospitalization. Recently, Thopaz digitally monitored thoracic drainage system
      (Medela Healthcare, Baar, Switzerland)has been designed to provide objective measurements of
      air leakage and pleural pressure. With this system, air leakage and pleural pressure can be
      accurately measured in mL/min and mm H2O, respectively. The rate of air leakage can be seen
      on a display in real time. Digital surveillance for air leakage is reported to reduce
      interobserver disagreement in decision making in the management of patients with chest tubes,
      which might help caregiver a more solid evidence of strategies of postoperative chest
      drainage care.
