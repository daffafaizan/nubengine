      inversion recovery (DIR), Phase-Sensitive Inversion Recovery (PSIR), Magnetization Prepared -
      RApid Gradient Echo (MPRAGE) and Magnetization Prepared - 2- RApid Gradient Echo (MP2RAGE)
      have all shown variable sensitivity to CLs and LCLs. The central vein sign (CVS, i.e. the
      detection of a central vessel in a focal lesion) has been recently proposed as a biomarker
      for distinguishing between MS and not and not MS. Both the presence of CL and CVs brings high
      sensitivity and specificity in distinguishing MS from not MS patients; whether their
      combination achieves higher sensitivity and specificity to MS diagnosis and differential
      diagnosis is to date not know. This study investigates the specificity/sensitivity of the
      combined presence of cortical lesions (CLs)/leuco-cortical lesions (LCLs) and central veins
      sign (CVs) for multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis and differential diagnosis.
