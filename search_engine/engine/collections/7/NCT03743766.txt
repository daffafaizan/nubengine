      and the anti-PD1 monoclonal antibody nivolumab in combination in subjects with unresectable
      or metastatic melanoma who have not received prior treatment with immunotherapy. The trial is
      designed with a lead-in phase of 2 cycles (4 week) treatment of either nivolumab, relatlimab,
      or the combination of nivolumab/relatlimab, followed by a combination phase of
      nivolumab/relatlimab treatment in all subjects. This lead-in design with accompanying tumor
      biopsies and peripheral blood analyses will enable mechanistic analyses of the effect of LAG3
      and PD1 blockade alone and in combination to enhance understanding of mechanisms of response
      and resistance. Duration of response, progression free survival, and safety will be assessed
      as secondary objectives.
