      could enroll in the extension study, KEYNOTE-587 (NCT03486873), which would allow further
      study participation after the Primary Completion Date cut-off. Thus, all efficacy outcome
      measures except for survival (Overall Survival [OS]) were to be followed up to the Interim
      Database cut-off of 18-Sept-2018, and the primary safety analyses (except for the DLT
      analysis) and Overall Survival were to be followed up to the study Primary Completion Date
      (Final Database cut-off of 05-Nov-2018).

      Five participants did not have end of study assessments completed by the Primary Completion
      Date cut-off and were subsequently followed up to the Study Completion Date (11-Dec-2018).
      End of treatment and end of study assessments are missing for these 5 and the status was
      noted as unknown as of the Primary Completion Date cut-off. Per protocol, any safety
      information after the Primary Completion Date cut-off (Final Database cut-off of 05-Nov-2018)
      would not be included in the safety analysis but reported by the Investigator to the Sponsor
      via the Sponsor Communication Form and filed in the electronic Trial Master File.
