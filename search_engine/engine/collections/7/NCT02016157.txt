      periodontal pathogens, including Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, Prevotella
      species, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Actinomyces species, Peptostreptococcus species,
      Campylobacter rectus, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. Moxifloxacin penetrates well
      into soft tissues and is effective against intracellular periodontal pathogens when used in
      the treatment of periodontitis as an adjunct to scaling and root planning (SRP). Systemic
      administration of moxifloxacin has provided superior outcomes compared with SRP in
      conjunction with systemic administration of doxycycline, or SRP alone. We hypothesized
      similar benefits with local drug delivery of Moxifloxacin in the treatment of chronic
      periodontitis. To the best of our knowledge, there is no published literature on in situ gel
      using moxifloxacin employing gellan gum as the vehicle, for direct placement in the
      periodontal pocket for the treatment of chronic periodontitis.

      Among various drug delivery systems for treating periodontitis, gel formulations have some
      advantages. Despite a relatively faster release of the drug, gels can be more easily prepared
      and administered. Moreover, they possess a higher bio compatibility and bio adhesivity, by
      allowing adhesion to the mucosa in the dental pocket and by decreasing the risk of dilution
      of the material by saliva.

      Keeping the above facts in mind, the goals of this study were to (1) evaluate in situ gel as
      a vehicle in a local drug delivery system, (2) evaluate the efficacy of moxifloxacin for
      local drug delivery, (3) evaluate the efficacy of gellan gum for in situ gelation of
      moxifloxacin, and (4) evaluate and compare the clinical and microbiological parameters of
      moxifloxacin with those of the gold standard, chlorhexidine di gluconate.
