      double-blind, double-dummy parallel group, randomized (stratified by unilateral vs. bilateral
      knee OA) trial. The trial will enroll subjects who have been diagnosed with OA of the knee
      (confirmed by weight-bearing x-ray) and whose condition is in flare at baseline. Subjects who
      qualify to enter the study will be randomized to topical TDS-943 40 mg bid, oral celecoxib
      200 mg qd, or placebo in a 3:2:2 ratio.
