    
      This is an institutional, monocentric, open-label, phase II study of oral "metronomic"
      Vinorelbine plus Capecitabine and Cyclophosphamide (VEX) in patients with advanced breast
      cancer .

      Patients will receive the combination regimen as follow:

      Cyclophosphamide 50 mg daily Capecitabine 500 mg, thrice daily Vinorelbine 40 mg orally
      thrice a week

      Four independent cohorts of patients will be evaluated in the study:

        1. Untreated (naïve) patients with endocrine responsive disease

        2. Pretreated patients with endocrine responsive disease

        3. Untreated (naïve) patients with triple negative disease

        4. Pretreated patients with triple negative disease Combination will be administered until
           disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      The primary endpoint will be to assess the Time to progression (TTP) of VEX combination in
      the four different cohorts
