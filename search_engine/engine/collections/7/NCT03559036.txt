      the loss of supra-spinal connections and subsequent alterations of the lumbosacral circuitry,
      can be ameliorated through activity-based therapy that regulates the state of
      detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia and normalizes release of neurotrophic factors known to
      contribute to bladder hyper-reflexia. The primary study aim is to determine the effects of
      weight-bearing task-specific training for locomotion (stepping on a treadmill) after
      incomplete and complete spinal cord injury in children on bladder storage, voiding,
      biomarkers, and quality of life (parent-reported during baseline and exit interview). A
      secondary aim is to develop a scale for classifying bladder recovery after spinal cord injury
      based either on the pattern of storage and voiding prior to injury (if the child had bladder
      control prior to injury) or on established patterns of micturition development (if the child
      was injured prior to experiencing bladder control).
