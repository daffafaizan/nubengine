      an incidence of 3-5% worldwide. Despite intensive research efforts the pathogenesis of the
      disease is still unknown but it is likely to be multifactorial.Clinical risk factors
      traditionally have been used to identify women at high risk of developing preeclampsia,and
      biophysical factors that may help predict hypertensive disorders of pregnancy.In
      addition,changes in the serum concentrations of angiogenic and antiangiogenic factors are
      implied in the pathogenesis of PE and have possible relevance in the diagnosis of the
      disease.
