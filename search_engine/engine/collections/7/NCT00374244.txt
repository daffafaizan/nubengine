      eligible. The study physician will do a number of tests including a physical examination, a
      routine medical history, lab tests for blood and urine, and EKG (to monitor your heart) and
      interviews about your physical and mental health.

      At each visit you will complete an EKG (to monitor your heart), vital signs, and discuss how
      you are feeling with the research staff and doctor. Once a month, we will also conduct a
      slightly longer interview with you about your symptoms and draw one tube of blood to check
      your Clozapine level. At the beginning and end of the study, you will do some pencil and
      paper games called "Neurocognitive tests".

      If you are interested in participating in this study, we will go over it in greater detail
      with you, including the possible benefits and risks associated with participating. We will
      make sure you understand the study before you begin. This study is completely voluntary,
      which means that you can choose to stop participating in the study at any time.
