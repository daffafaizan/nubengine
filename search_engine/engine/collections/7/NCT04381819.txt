      such as the SARS-CoV-2, require investigation to understand pathogen biology and pathogenesis
      in the host. In order to develop a mechanistic understanding of disease processes, such that
      risk factors for severe illness can be identified and treatments can be developed, it is
      necessary to understand pathogen characteristics associated with virulence, the replication
      dynamics and in-host evolution of the pathogen, the dynamics of the host response, the
      pharmacology of antimicrobial or host directed therapies, the transmission dynamics, and
      factors underlying individual susceptibility.

      At Oslo University Hospital, an observational study on the newly discovered emerging SARS-
      CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 infection has started. The study has been
      approved by the Regional Ethics Committee, so that inclusion of confirmed COVID-19 cases
      admitted at the hospital can start immediately including the first patients needing
      hospitalisation. The plan is to include more hospitals in other parts of Norway, starting
      with inclusion of Akershus University Hospital, Vestre Viken Drammen Hospital and Ã˜stfold
      Hospital. The study is anticipated to provide much needed data on the course of the COVID-19
      infection, as well as generating knowledge about the virus and its transmission.
