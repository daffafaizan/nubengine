      which is more than 2 months before expected date of delivery. If these smallest infants
      suffer in addition to prematurity a second hit, such as intraventricular hemorrhage or
      parenchymal infarction, they are at high risk for learning disabilities, mental retardation,
      and cerebral palsy in later life.

      Intraventricular hemorrhage and parenchymal infarction occur in about 12% of very preterm
      infants, mostly in the very smallest and within the first few days after birth, and can be
      recorded by cranial ultrasound. Except for shunt insertion to divert cerebrospinal fluid in
      infants with posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus and possibly the removal of blood clots, there is
      no treatment for established intracerebral bleeding, and no medical therapies exist to
      ameliorate the neurodevelopmental sequelae.

      Apart from stimulating production of red blood cells in the bone marrow, recombinant human
      erythropoietin (Epo) has been shown to exert neuroprotective action in a variety of animal
      models and in clinical studies. Epo administration has been found to be beneficial and safe
      in randomized controlled trials (RCT) involving adult and infant patients.

      Observational data suggest that Epo administered to very preterm infants in order to prevent
      from anemia improves long-term cognitive outcomes until school-age especially in those
      infants who had suffered intracerebral bleeding. These data, however, are observational and
      therefore do not allow for any firm conclusions or recommendations. The hypothesis generated
      by these data calls for confirmation or refutation by an RCT designed to address this
      question.
