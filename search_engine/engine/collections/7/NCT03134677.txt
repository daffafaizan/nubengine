      proarrhythmic and antiarrhythmic effects by inducing cardiac electrical signals with
      different pathways.In addition, comorbid disease, hormonal changes, surgery procedures, and
      drug therapy can all cause arrhythmia in the intraoperative period. Likewise, pregnancy
      causes many changes hormonal and physiological in women. Hemodynamic and hormonal changes
      during pregnancy can cause effects proarrhythmogenic that cause premature atrial and
      ventricular beats to develop.
