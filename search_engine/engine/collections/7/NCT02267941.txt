      Without optimal treatment, approximately 50% of patients die within one week of the onset of
      symptoms, and 80% die within 2 weeks. With the change of life-style and the development of
      diagnostic technology, the incidence and detection rate of AD were increasing in China
      recently. However, the cause remains unclear. Studies showed that AD were associated with
      some risk factors, such as hypertension, connective tissue disease, iatrogenic injury, drug,
      pregnancy, etc. It is reported that two thirds patients with AD had a history of
      hypertension; 50% patients aged <40 years were accompanied with hereditary Marfan syndrome;
      13ï½ž19% had a familial history of aortic aneurysm or dissection. These epidemiological data
      were obtained from Caucasian population, however, such information was not available for the
      Chinese population. Moreover, epidemiological investigation was absent in China, and the
      assessment of risk factors for AD was mainly referred to the studies from developed
      countries. Therefore, the aim of our study was to evaluate epidemiological features of risk
      factors for AD in Chinese patients using 3045 individuals from the 15 major centers in China.
      We anticipated that this analysis would provide helpful information preventing and
      controlling AD in China.
