development of dirofilaria immitis in anopheles quadri-maculatus after exposure of the microfilariae to afreezing temperatureblood samples containing dirofilariaimmitis microfilariae were stored frozen forperiods ranging from 24 hr to 4 months,thawed at 38 1c andfed through an animal-derived bandrode membrane to laboratory-reared anophelesquadrimaculatus.  the microfilariae were capable of developing to the third orinfective larval stage and migrating to the head and labium of the mosquito.
