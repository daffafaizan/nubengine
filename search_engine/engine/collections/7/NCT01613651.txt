    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if eliminating placement of a pelvic drain in patients during robotic
      assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP) increases incidence of early postoperative adverse
      events occurring within 90 days from prostatectomy, compared to patients who have a pelvic
      drain placed during RALP.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the incidence of early postoperative adverse events in patients with and
      without a pelvic drain when adjustments to confounders associated with these events are made
      (confounders: demographic, surgical and pathologic; age, body mass index [BMI], pathologic
      stage, Gleason sum, extent of lymph node dissection).

      II. To report peri-operative and postoperative outcomes, including but not limited to, length
      of hospital stay, re-admissions, continence, potency and incidence of medical interventions
      for patients with and without pelvic drain.

      III. To compare early postoperative adverse event rates between patients with and without a
      pelvic drain in patients who had extended pelvic lymph node dissection during RALP.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients undergo RALP.

      ARM II: Patients undergo RALP and placement of pelvic drain.

      After completion of treatment, patients are followed up at 1 week and then 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12
      months.
