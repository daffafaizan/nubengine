      and effectiveness of investigational drugs to learn whether the drugs work in treating a
      specific disease. "Investigational" means that the drugs are being studied.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved ipilimumab for this specific
      disease but it has been approved for other uses, including for patients with advanced
      melanoma.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved nivolumab as a treatment option
      for this disease. However, nivolumab it is not approved in combination with ipilimumab to
      treat NSCLC.

      Nivolumab and ipilimumab are both types of immunotherapy. Immunotherapy works by stimulating
      the body's own immune system to attack cancer cells. The combination of ipilimumab with
      nivolumab may or may not increase anti-cancer activity by further boosting the immune system.

      In this research study, the investigators are investigating if the combination of ipilimumab
      and nivolumab is effective in treating advanced NSCLC. The investigators are also
      investigating whether there are certain DNA or protein markers in the blood or tumor tissue
      that may indicate whether the combination will work in future patients.
