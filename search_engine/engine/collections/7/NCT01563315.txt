      Pneumonia as the leading cause of death from infection in developed countries. Purpose: (A)
      Determine the etiology of CAP among adult hospitalized patients- especially the occurrence of
      mixed infections- by systematic implementation of combined conventional and new diagnostic
      methods. (B) Assess risk factors of CAP, such as COPD, congestive heart failure, smoking,
      malignancy etc., predictive of re-admittance to hospital and mortality. (C) Examine the
      prognostic value of potential predictors in relation to all-cause mortality in adult patients
      hospitalized with CAP. Design: Prospective observational study with inclusion of 270 adult
      patients during a 3-year period, who all required admission for pneumonia in a community
      hospital setting. Clinical and biochemical data was recorded longitudinally by inclusion, at
      stable clinical situation and after 6 weeks, and mortality and need for re-admission within
      12 months. Patients were examined systematically, using modern research methods to explore
      relevant microbes. At all points, blood tests were sampled for clinical-chemical analysis,
      DNA, RNA and immunological analyses. Application: A translational research approach with the
      ambitions to elucidate new pathogenic mechanisms which could lead to new diagnostic tools and
      treatment modalities. This will possibly lead to less drug exposure and unnecessary
      hospitalization both of which have positive consequences for patients and medical care costs.
