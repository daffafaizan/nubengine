      to compare the efficacy of 15 mg meloxicam i.m. once daily compared with 15 mg meloxicam
      tablets once daily p.o. in patients with rheumatoid arthritis over a time period of 7 days.

      Patients eligible for the trial who met all inclusion and exclusion criteria and who gave
      their informed consent were randomized to one of two treatment groups (i.e. meloxicam ampoule
      or meloxicam tablet).

      The study period totaled 8-14 days included screening, randomisation, study drug
      administration, and 7-day follow-up. The relevant assessment were performed on the day of
      randomisation and 7-day follow up.
