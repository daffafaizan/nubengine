      1-4)in a 6-week cycle. The rationale for this study includes:

        -  Sunitinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets multiple receptor pathways
           critical for cell growth. It has both antiangiogenic and direct antitumor activities.

        -  Resistance to receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors is well-documented. The mammalian
           target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway may play a critical role in imatinib-refractory GIST.
           Rapamycin and other agents that inhibit mTOR demonstrate antiangiogenic and antitumor
           properties by decreasing VEGF production and decreasing responsiveness to VEGF.

        -  Sunitinib is approved and well-tolerated at doses as high as 75mg daily. The typical
           dose in most Phase II and III trials has been 50mg/day, given on a four weeks on/two
           weeks off schedule. There are, however, recent trials looking at a lower dosage, 37.5
           mg, in NSCLC.

        -  Rapamycin at doses greater than 2 mg daily is documented to be well-tolerated in renal
           transplant patients. In renal transplant patients, 2mg daily is the typical starting
           dose. This dose was used in one of the phase I studies of rapamycin in glioblastoma.

        -  The administration of two oral medications, taken once daily, may be more convenient to
           patients than iv administration of chemotherapy at an infusion center every 1-3 weeks.

        -  Based on these data, initial dosing of sunitinib beginning at 37.5 mg orally everyday
           for 4 weeks, followed by 2 weeks off, in combination with rapamycin 2 mg/day orally for
           6 weeks during a 6 week cycle should be well tolerated and allow for dose-finding
           escalation.
