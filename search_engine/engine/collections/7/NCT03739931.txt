    
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation study of intratumoral injections
      of mRNA-2752 alone and in combination with intravenously administered immune checkpoint
      blockade therapy in participants with histologically confirmed advanced or metastatic solid
      tumor malignancies or lymphoma. The study consists of Dose Escalation and Dose Confirmation
      Parts, which will occur in Arm A and Arm B, followed by a Dose Expansion Part, which will
      occur in Arm B.

      Participants in Arm A and in Arm B will be enrolled into the Dose Escalation Part and the
      doses of mRNA-2752 will be administered in a dose escalation regimen until a maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) or a recommended dose for expansion (RDE) is identified. When the
      MTD/RDE is identified, participants with visceral lesions may be enrolled into the Dose
      Confirmation Part to confirm that the dose is also appropriate for this subgroup.

      Once the MTD/RDE is identified in the Dose Escalation/Dose Confirmation Parts, participants
      in Arm B will be enrolled into the Dose-Expansion Part in order to assess the preliminary
      anti-tumor activity of mRNA-2752 in combination with durvalumab.

      Following completion of 6 cycles of mRNA-2752, participants may continue with durvalumab
      alone until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or 24 months of treatment (total),
      whichever is sooner. If a participant is experiencing clinical benefit and it is in the
      participant's best interest, in the opinion of the Investigator, dosing of mRNA-2752 may
      continue beyond Cycle 6 (up to 24 total months of treatment) after approval from the Sponsor.
