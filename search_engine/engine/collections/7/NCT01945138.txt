      insulin system can successfully achieve tighter blood sugar control than the current multiple
      daily injection regimen. The investigators hypothesize that the average blood glucose will be
      lower in the closed loop group than the control group, there will be less glucose variability
      in the closed loop group than the control group, and there will be less total time spent in
      hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia in the closed loop group than in the control group. The
      investigators also will investigate insulin requirements and islet function in the first 6
      months post-transplant in the closed loop group The investigators hypothesize that the
      insulin requirements will be lower and the C-peptide levels higher in the closed loop group
      than in the control group.
