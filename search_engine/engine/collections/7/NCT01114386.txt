      defined by presence of fixed airflow obstruction (post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC less than 70%)
      according to Global Initiative for Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines. Each patient
      will be characterized by medical history and physical examination. Patients with a diagnosis
      of COPD must have: 1) had a history of chronic respiratory symptoms, i.e., cough and sputum
      and/or breathlessness and only occasional wheezing (SGRQ and MMRC Questionnaire); 2) they had
      to be smokers or ex-smokers with more than 10 pack-years, and 3) a documented absence of a
      history of variable airflow obstruction and/or diagnosis of asthma. Each patient will perform
      pulmonary function tests, including reversibility to inhaled bronchodilator (400 Âµg
      albuterol); arterial blood gases, and routine blood tests. In addition, each patient will
      undergo regular PA/LL chest x-ray. The diagnosis of CHF is established according to the
      criteria of European Society of Cardiology. At time of entry in the study, all patients will
      be in clinically stable condition (ie, no changes in medication dosage or frequency, and no
      exacerbations of disease or hospital admissions in the preceding 6 weeks). Clinical and
      biological follow-up of these patients will be prospectively followed for 2 years, from 2009
      to 2011.
