      athletes, and symptoms may affect athletic performance and reduce or even result in
      retirement from sports participation. The current best treatment is considered to be
      heavy-slow resistance training (HSRT); however, not all patients are able to cope with heavy
      exercise loads. Therefore, low-load strength training performed under partial blood flow
      restriction may be a clinically relevant rehabilitation tool.

      This project aims to investigate a new innovative intervention to treat chronic unilateral
      patellar tendinopathy in male individuals using strength training with low-load muscle
      contractions performed under partial blood flow restriction (LL-BFR), and to compare the
      resulting treatment outcome to that of the current best practice (HSRT). Specifically, the
      effect of LL-BFR will be investigated using a randomized controlled trial design with two
      groups; 1) a low-load blood flow restriction training program, and 2) a heavy-load slow
      strength training program. A total sample size of 36 participants are needed when assuming a
      10 % dropout.

      The training protocol consist of three weekly training sessions during a 12-week
      rehabilitation period. The primary outcome is measured using the Single-Leg Decline Squat at
      12-week.

      If LL-BFR proves to be an effective treatment strategy for tendinopathy, it can easily be
      implemented in daily clinical practice.
