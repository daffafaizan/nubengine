      effects of LDX on eating in participants with sub-clinical binge-eating disorder symptoms. A
      sub-clinical sample will be recruited in line with the Research Domain Criteria Initiative
      established by the US National Institute of Mental Health which encourages research on
      dimensions of observable behaviour rather than a categorical, symptom-based approach to the
      study of mental health. The tendency towards binge-like eating will be modelled using an
      eating in the absence of hunger paradigm in which participants consume a pasta meal and are
      then offered the opportunity to consume as many palatable cookies as they like. Reward
      processes will be assessed by measuring neural and behavioural responses to palatable food
      pictures using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). Responses to emotional stimuli
      will be assessed using the P1vitalÂ® Oxford Emotional Test Battery. Impulsive responding will
      be assessed using the delay discounting task and the stop signal task. Attentional processing
      will be assessed using the sustained performance task and working memory will be assessed
      with the n-back task.
