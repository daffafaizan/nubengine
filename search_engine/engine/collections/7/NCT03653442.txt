      blood pressure (SBP) less than 100 mmHg or a decrease of 20-30% from baseline values. The
      incidence of hypotension could exceed 71% and can cause, if serious and prolonged, nausea,
      vomiting, lost of consciousness, placental hypoperfusion and foetal acidosis.

      There are two alternative hypotheses to explain why hypotension might be so commonly
      diagnosed after regional analgesia during labour: preload reduction theory and afterload
      reduction theory. A non-invasive continue haemodynamic monitoring could be useful in
      detecting pregnant women with a positive preoperative supine stress, at increased risk for
      clinically significant hypotension during Caesarean section under spinal anaesthesia. These
      women seem more likely to benefit from optimizing the administration of fluids and
      vasoconstrictors to maintain pressure and cardiac output at basal levels.

      Predictors of clinical need of therapy to counteract symptomatic hypotension (dependant
      variable) will be sought by using regression logistic analysis. Putative variable to include
      in the model will be selected through clinical and statistical criteria. Univariate screening
      will be performed assuming the usual cut-off of p<0,1 and taking into account the biological
      relevance. The final variable to challenge in the multivariate model will be selected
      according to the parsimony criteria in order to avoid overfitting and multicollinearity.
