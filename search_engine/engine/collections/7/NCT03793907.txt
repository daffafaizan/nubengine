        -  I. To assess the feasibility of a 6 month, twice weekly supervised strength training
           intervention in patients with multiple myeloma. (Cohort 1)

        -  II. To assess the feasibility of a 6 month behavioral intervention to prompt an increase
           in weekly physical activity in patient with multiple myeloma. (Cohort 2)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the adherence rate of patients during a 6 month intervention program.

      II. To assess the eligibility and recruitment rate for the trial among patients with multiple
      myeloma.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Comparison of disease activity parameters, physical activity level, clinical symptoms,
      medication, psycho-oncological parameters before, during and after intervention.

      II. Determine factors that may influence a persons' willingness to participate in the trial.

      III. Investigate "immune fitness" by frequencies and function of immune cell subsets in
      peripheral blood.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts.

      COHRT 1 (STRENGTH TRAINING): Patients receive a Fitbit to track their physical activity, and
      complete an in-person personalized and supervised full-body strength training program over 1
      hour twice weekly (BID) up to 52 sessions for 6 months.

      COHORT 2 (BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTION): Patients receive a Fitbit to track their physical
      activity, and complete an unsupervised walking program daily at home, increasing physical
      activity stepwise weekly, for 6 months.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year.
