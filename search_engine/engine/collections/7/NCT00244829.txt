      Primary

        -  Determine the safety of adjuvant imatinib mesylate after allogeneic hematopoietic stem
           cell transplantation (AHSCT) in patients with high-risk Philadelphia chromosome-positive
           leukemia.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the bcr/abl transcript load during the first 90 days after AHSCT in patients
           treated with this drug from the time of engraftment.

        -  Determine the 1-year survival of patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, pilot, multicenter study.

      Beginning within 14-30 days after allogeneic stem cell transplantation, patients receive oral
      imatinib mesylate once daily until 1 year after transplantation. Treatment continues in the
      absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

      Patients are followed for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study.
