      intervention and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational
      intervention to use for further studies. "Investigational" means that the intervention is
      being studied.

      In this research study, the investigators are studying Smoldering Multiple Myeloma.
      Smoldering Multiple Myeloma is an early precursor to a rare blood cancer known as Multiple
      Myeloma, which affects plasma cells. The study will test two different combinations of the
      study drugs; a combination of the vaccine (PVX-410) along with Citarinostat (CC-96241) and
      triple combination of the vaccine, Citarinostat, and Lenalidomide.

      The vaccine (PVX-410) is a multi-peptide vaccine that contains four synthetic peptides that
      together are intended to induce a T cell-mediated immune response against the myeloma. The
      FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved PVX-410 as a treatment for any
      disease.

      Citarinostat is an orally active, small-molecule Histone Deacetylase (HDAC) Inhibitor which
      is being combined here to further augment the immune activity of the vaccine. Citarinostat
      has not been approved by the FDA as a treatment for any disease.

      Lenalidomide is commercially available analogue of thalidomide with immunomodulatory,
      antiangiogenic, and antineoplastic properties that has demonstrated an increase in immune
      activity in previous trials. The FDA has approved Lenalidomide as a treatment option for
      Smoldering Multiple Myeloma. Lenalidomide is being added to the combination of the vaccine
      and Citarinostat because it is hypothesized that co-administration of lenalidomide along with
      Citarinostat would further enhance the T cell-mediated immune response induced by PVX-410.
