      and develop a better understanding of the individual (substance use, mental health) and
      couple dimensions (communication, marital satisfaction, violence) as intermediate variables
      explaining this efficacy. Couples will be randomized between the marital treatment and the
      treatment as usual (individual or group). The experimental couple treatment is offered over 8
      to 12 sessions of 90 minutes. The couple treatment called (Integrative Couple Therapy for
      Pathological Gambling - ICT-PG) is inspired by the "Alcohol Behavior Couple Therapy" from
      Epstein and McCrady, to which the team added diverse components to adjust to gamblers. During
      the sessions, the focus is on a) reducing/stopping gambling behaviors, b) helping the partner
      to stop behaviors facilitating gambling habits and rise the frequency of behaviors
      imcompatibles with gambling habits and c) improve marital components (communication, sharing
      positive moments, negotiation, mutual support).

      The control group receive individual or group treatment as already offered by the specialized
      centers in addiction.Their partner can receive individual intervention if desired. All
      participants are recruited in Specialized Addiction Treatment Centers in Quebec province,
      Canada. Evaluation of participants is done at admission, three, nine and 18 months
      post-admission.

      Repeated measures ANOVA will be used to compared evolutions of groups over time. Multiple
      regression will allow the estimation of components roles into as intermediate variables to
      predict rehabilitation.
