    
      This RAPID COVID-19 study is a prospective, unblinded clinical trial. POC testing utilizing
      the Spartan Cube COVID-19 platform will be performed on a cohort of 2200 hospitalized
      patients who have been tested for COVID-19.

      This cohort will be divided into three groups:

        1. patients consulted upon by ICU, internal medicine, or cardiology for admission to the
           hospital

        2. patients undergoing cardiac testing and/or procedures

        3. patients awaiting surgery The results from the POC test will be compared to the results
           from the traditional hospital core lab test to determine sensitivity and specificity of
           the POC test.

      An additional cohort of 500 quarantined health care workers will have the POC test performed
      and compared with the results from the traditional hospital core lab test.
