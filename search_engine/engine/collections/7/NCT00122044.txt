      dystonia in children, previous studies have not investigated efficacy in secondary dystonia.
      We describe the results of a prospective, open-label, multi-center trial of high-dose
      trihexyphenidyl in children with secondary dystonia of the arms due to cerebral palsy.

      METHODS: Twenty-six children age 4-15 years with cerebral palsy and dystonia that impairs
      function of the dominant upper extremity were enrolled. All children were given
      trihexyphenidyl at increasing doses over 9 weeks up to 0.75mg/kg/day. Trihexyphenidyl was
      subsequently tapered over 5 weeks. Visits occurred at baseline, 9 weeks, and 15 weeks. The
      primary outcome measure was the Melbourne assessment of upper extremity function, tested in
      the dominant arm.

      RESULTS: Three children withdrew due to non-serious adverse events (chorea, drug rash,
      hyperactivity). 3 children reduced dosage due to non-serious adverse events. The 23 children
      who completed the study showed a significant improvement in arm function at 15 weeks
      (p=0.045) but not at 9 weeks. Post-hoc analysis showed that a subgroup (N=10) with
      hyperkinetic dystonia worsened at 9 weeks (p=0.04) but subsequently returned to baseline
      following taper of the medicine.

      CONCLUSIONS: Trihexyphenidyl appears to be safe and effective for treatment of arm dystonia
      in children with cerebral palsy. Children with hyperkinetic dystonia may worsen. A larger
      randomized prospective trial is needed to confirm these results.
