    
      The PHOENIX Wound Matrix® (PHOENIX) is a novel, fully synthetic, fully bioabsorbable advanced
      wound care device that provides a temporary microenvironment to support endogenous wound
      healing, allowing for the regeneration of functional, native tissue in the defect space/wound
      bed. As PHOENIX degrades, the pH of the local wound environment is lowered.

      In this pilot study, the investigators will examine the microbiome of chronic diabetic foot
      ulcers from ten subjects prior to treatment with PHOENIX Wound Matrix® (PHOENIX) and one week
      following treatment with PHOENIX.
