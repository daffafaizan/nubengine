      platforms would provide quantitative and qualitative knowledge regarding the action of
      scratching and sleep quantity in a symptomatic atopic dermatitis (AD) population. Our overall
      aim is to validate the use of accelerometry technology and digital measures to quantitatively
      and qualitatively evaluate scratch and sleep in AD patients in a home environment.

      Accelerometry devices appear similar to a wristwatch. The subject will be asked to wear an
      accelerometry device on each wrist during the study. The accelerometry device provides
      continuous measures of wrist activity and will be used to quantify nocturnal scratching and
      sleep behaviors to be compared to videography (annotated for scratch), sleep sensor, PSG and
      traditional patient-reported outcome (PRO) and Quality of Life (QoL) measures [Peak Pruritus
      Numerical Scale, Severity of Pruritus Scale (SPS), Patient Global Impression of Severity
      (PGIS), Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) Sleep Scale, Itch and Sleep Diary, Patient-Oriented
      Eczema Measure (POE), Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)-pain
      interference, PROMIS- anxiety, Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), Family Dermatology Life
      Quality Index (FDLQI), Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index (CDLQI), Device and Device
      Comfort Questionnaire] in patients with AD in a clinic and home setting in a well-controlled
      clinical study.
