      max aorta VTI (AVTI) by Echo, the concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) was so high from
      0.96 to 0.99.

      But up to now, there are no clinical trials to evaluate mid-long term clinical outcome for
      CRTP/D patients by QuickOptTM and Echo optimization, this is indeed the main purpose of the
      study; in addition, the clinical impact, the status of arrhythmia and agents of all the
      enrolled patients, will be evaluated at 1 year after implant.
