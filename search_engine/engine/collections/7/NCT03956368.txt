      elderly population associated with mild head injury. Surgical drainage has been regarded as
      safe and effective. However, surgical complications including recurrences can result in poor
      functional outcome and fatality, particularly in the elderly patients. Atorvastatin, an
      HMGCoA reductase inhibitor and a widely prescribed lipid lowering medication has properties
      of inflammation modulation and neovasculature promotion.

      Hypothesis: Atorvastatin can improve functional outcome in patients with CSDH for both
      initially non-operatively treated group (estimated to be 10%) and the operative group (90%)
      by reducing the rate of surgical intervention and recurrence rate.

      Design: A prospective multicentre study of 690 consented patients with symptomatic CSDH will
      be randomised on the day of admission to receive atorvastatin 20 mg or a placebo daily for 8
      weeks. All seven regional neurosurgical units in Hong Kong and two units outside Hong Kong,
      each treating 80-200 patients per annum, have been invited to participate.

      Main Outcome Measures: Primary outcome: Modified Rankin Scale (mRS). Secondary outcome:
      surgical recurrence.

      Sample Size: Assuming an absolute 10% improvement in favourable outcome in the Modified
      Rankin Scale score (mRS 0-3) at 6 months from the control group of 70% to the treatment group
      80%, allowing a 10% loss to follow up, a sample size of 690 is required.

      Expected Results: A successful study for improving clinical outcome of CSDH, an important
      illness of the elderly with an annual incidence of 58/100,000 will change clinical practice.
