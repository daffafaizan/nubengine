    
      The aim of this protocol is to study the appearance of the high grade AV conductive disorders
      at 12 months by monitoring for patients with a de novo LBBB after TAVI from an adapated
      algorithm to the risk and based on an early electrophysiological evaluation.

      The recruitment of patients takes place in each cardiology department. The project is
      submitted to the Ethics Committee .

      The patients are informed about this study by the investigator. After a reflection period and
      an answer to the possible questions, the patient is included. The informed consent is signed.

      Every patient included with a de novo LBBB, persistent that is observed beyond 24 hours after
      the TAVI procedure, will benefit from an endocavitary electrophysiological exploration .
      According to the meditative delay of conduction, a pacemaker will be implanted in case of
      delay lengthened HV (> 70 ms) or of infrahissian block, in the opposite case the implantation
      of an holter with remote monitoring will be made.
