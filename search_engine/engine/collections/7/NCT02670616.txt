    
      EBV-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma has EBV-mediated carcinogenic signaling pathway
      activation, and this diverse intracellular pathway may be a potential therapeutic target in
      this disease.

      The BTK inhibitor, ibrutinib, targets the B cell receptor signaling pathway and is active
      against B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. As a result, evidence of the antitumor effect of
      ibrutinib has been accumulated in some B-cell lymphoma forms such as mantle cell lymphoma.
      The addition of ibrutinib to standard chemotherapy, rituximab-CHOP, is considered to be an
      effective treatment for patients with EBV-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, because it
      is known to show a poor response to treatment compared to (NOS) diffuse large B- It can
      provide benefits to patients.
