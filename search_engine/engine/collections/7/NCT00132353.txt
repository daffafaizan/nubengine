    
      Objective: This is a training protocol. The goal of this protocol is to train fellows in
      advanced physiological techniques used for diagnosing neurological disorders. A secondary
      objective of the protocol is to gather normative data for diagnostic neurophysiologic tests.

      Study population: Patients and healthy adult volunteers may be studied under this protocol.
      Patients must have a clinical indication for the diagnostic test. Most patients will be
      enrolled in a primary NIH protocol, and this protocol will serve as a secondary protocol.
      Occasionally, patients will be enrolled in this protocol as a primary protocol when they are
      referred from hospitals that participate in the NINDS fellowship training program. Healthy
      adults will be studied by fellows-in-training to practice a new testing procedure or to
      provide normative data when required by changes in instrumentation or laboratory technique.

      Design: Testing will be performed during an outpatient clinic visit. One or two of the
      following procedures may be performed as clinically indicated: single fiber EMG, macro-EMG,
      near-nerve recording, single-pulse transcranial or peripheral nerve magnetic stimulation,
      quantitative sensory testing, nerve conduction studies, electromyography, nerve
      ultrasonography, or autonomic testing.

      Outcome measures: This is a training protocol. No research will be carried out under this
      protocol.
