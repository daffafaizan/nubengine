      available, there remains a need for safer and more effective therapies in the treatment of
      manic and depressive episodes of bipolar I disorder. Brexpiprazole's specific receptor
      activity profile likely correlates with its established efficacy in schizophrenia and major
      depressive disorder, and may prove to be an effective target for the treatment of acute mania
      of bipolar I disorder.
