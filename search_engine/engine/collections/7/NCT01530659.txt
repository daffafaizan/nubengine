    
      This clinical trial is a prospective, randomized, double-masked, sham-controlled trial of 30
      study participants who have early-stage retinitis pigmentosa, or Usher syndrome (type 2 or
      3). The trial will be conducted at the University of California, San Francisco. Individuals
      with these diseases experience gradually worsening vision that ultimately may lead to
      blindness due to a genetic condition in which specialized cells in the eye's retina called
      photoreceptor cells cease functioning and/or die. The study is intended to use a relatively
      new, non-invasive technology called AOSLO (adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscopy) in
      combination with a routine standard of care measurement called sdOCT (Spectral Domain Optical
      Coherence Tomography) to demonstrate that when a device that secretes an investigational drug
      called CNTF (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor) is surgically placed in the patient's eye, one type
      of photoreceptor called "cone photoreceptors" is preserved such that the gradual loss of
      vision is halted.
