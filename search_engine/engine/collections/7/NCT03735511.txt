      original medical records of patients with gastric carcinoma treated with apatinib from 2015
      to 2018 in Henan Cancer Hospital. Clinical data such as patient demographic, history of
      treatments, tumor biological characteristics and adverse events will be analyzed to evaluate
      the efficacy and safety of apatinib and explore the risk factors of prognosis in patients
      with gastric carcinoma.
