      subjects are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment sequences. During each treatment period, subjects
      have one lidocaine topical system applied to their back for 12 hours with a 4-day washout
      between treatments. In each treatment period, the subject will either swim (Treatment A),
      shower (Treatment B), or refrain from these activities (Treatment C) while wearing the
      topical system. Blood samples for lidocaine PK will be collected pre-dose until 24 hours.
      Adhesion will be monitored throughout the wear time and skin irritation will be assessed the
      topical system is removed.
