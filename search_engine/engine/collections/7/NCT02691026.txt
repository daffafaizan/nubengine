    
      Patients with MPNST, who are not eligible for surgery of curative intent, will be considered
      for treatment with pembrolizumab. Patients will receive pembrolizumab treatment for up to 10
      cycles. The patients must discontinue study treatment earlier (before 10 cycles of
      pembrolizumab) if they experience symptomatic deterioration attributed to disease
      progression, intolerable toxicity related to pembrolizumab, any medical condition that may
      jeopardize the patient's safety, use of other non-protocol anti-cancer therapy or pregnancy.

      Patients who have received 10 cycles of pembrolizumab or discontinued study treatment of
      another reason than progression, will in the follow-up period be assessed for safety and
      treatment-related toxicity (for up to 90 days), progression and survival.

      Patients who have achieved a clinical meaningful response after 10 cycles of pembrolizumab,
      defined as complete response (CR), partial response (PR), and stable disease (SD) assessed by
      the Investigator by using RECIST, v1.1, and have not experienced any clinically significant
      toxicity of study treatment, may be considered for reintroduction of pembrolizumab, if
      progression is detected after cycle 10.

      Due to the low incidence of MPNST, the inclusion rate is expected to be low, thus a Simon's
      two-stage design is suggested (see Statistical Analysis Plans - Section 8.0).

      Evaluation of efficacy and safety in stage one will be performed after the first 7 patient
      has been treated for 18 weeks: In case of no responders; the trial ends. If one or more
      responders, the trial will continue into stage two to a total number of 18 patients will be
      included.
