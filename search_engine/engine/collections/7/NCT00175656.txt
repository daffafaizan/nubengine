      treated with TEN for a femoral shaft fracture. All children and adolescents presenting to the
      Emergency department of a participating center with a femur fracture will be approached for
      inclusion in the study. The primary outcome for this study will be functional recovery, as
      measured using a pediatric specific generic QOL measurement tool. The clinical outcome
      measure which will be used will be the performance version of the ASK (ASK-p) which has been
      previously tested and shown to be valid, reliable, and responsive in children and adolescents
      with acute and chronic Orthopaedic disorders. The first time point for data collection will
      be at four months. Clinical data which will be obtained over the course of follow-up will
      include clinical evaluation of hip and knee range of motion, limb rotation, clinical
      measurement of limb length, fracture union, and the presence of complications, including the
      need for nail removal in the group in which it was not planned. The second time point for
      data collection will be at one year. Again, the ASK-p will be mailed to all subjects in
      advance to allow completion at the desired time. The return of questionnaires and process for
      reminder notifications will proceed in a similar fashion to the four month time point.
      Clinical and radiographic data will be collected in a similar fashion to the four month time
      point. No subjects will be excluded on the basis of failure to return questionnaires at the
      one year time point since this represents a secondary outcome.
