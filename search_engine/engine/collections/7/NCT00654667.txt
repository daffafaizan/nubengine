    
      Hypotheses for this study:

      4 weeks of supplementation with RSV 5.0 grams daily compared to placebo control in
      individuals with insulin resistance will: 1) Increase insulin sensitivity (assessed by the
      insulin sensitivity index as derived from glucose and insulin levels obtained during a 2 hour
      oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)and insulin growth factor (IGF)-1 levels) 2) Improve
      cholesterol metabolism (lower LDL, raise HDL and lower triglyceride (TG) levels); and 3)
      physical activity levels measured by pedometer and 7 day physical activity recall (PAR).

      Secondary hypotheses are: Treatment with RSV 5.0 grams daily in individuals with IR will
      result in: 1)No change in energy intake as measured by food intake by 3 day food diary; 2)No
      change in body fat mass or distribution (via dual x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), body mass
      index (BMI) and waist-to-hip ratio; and 3)Improved Quality of life as assessed by SF-36,
      compared to PC group.

      We will also examine self-reported appetite and satiety as well as biomarkers leptin and
      adiponectin in the RSV versus PC group. Finally, we will examine the effects of RSV on
      hepatic (serum Ala aminotransferase, asp aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, alkaline
      phosphatase, bilirubin, albumin), pancreatic (serum amylase) and renal (BUN and creatinine),
      function and red blood cell count (CBC with differential) in the IR compared to the PC group.
