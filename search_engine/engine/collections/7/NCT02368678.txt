      higher in periodontitis patients. However, the relationship between periodontal disease and
      bad breath is still controversial. Aspects that should be clarified include its relation to
      periodontitis severity, the influence of risk variables and the subject of the present
      research, that is treatment choice. To help clinicians and patients when deciding about
      mechanical periodontal therapy, 30 patients with advanced chronic periodontitis were selected
      from the periodontics clinic, Dental School, Pontiphical Catholic University of Minas Gerais
      from April 2013 to May 2014. A complete periodontal clinical examination was performed and
      the following parameters were recorded: probing depth (PD), clinical attachment level (CAL),
      bleeding on probing, plaque index, and tongue coating index. Halitosis was assessed by using
      the organoleptic method and measurements of volatile sulfur compounds (VSC), including
      hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and methyl mercaptan (CH3SH) by using gas chromatography, at baseline
      and 90 days after non-surgical periodontal treatment. After periodontal clinical examination,
      individuals were randomly allocated to full-mouth scaling (FMS) - completed within 24 hours -
      or to conventional quadrant-wise scaling and root planing (SRP) - completed within 2 months.
      Halitosis and sulfur gas levels were were statistically compared (Mann-Whitney and Wilcoxon
      tests, p < 0.05). For inter- and intra-group comparisons regarding categorical variables
      Chi-square, McNemar, and Fisher exact tests were used. Primary outcome was halitosis
      changing.
