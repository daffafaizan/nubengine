      breath) during sedation and anesthesia. Dexmedetomidine and propofol are safe and effective
      drugs regularly used by anesthesiologists. These drugs are used to put patients to sleep for
      operations and certain studies like MRI scans. However, there have been no studies describing
      the effects these drugs have on the upper airway of children, adolescents, and young adults
      with OSA.
