      I. To determine the clinical efficacy of trametinib in advanced BRAF nonV600mutation (MUT)
      melanoma ("high activity" group).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize the safety of trametinib. II. To evaluate the progression-free survival
      (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of trametinib in advanced BRAF nonV600MUT melanoma.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the clinical efficacy of trametinib in advanced BRAF nonV600MUT melanoma
      ("low activity/unknown" group).

      II. Identify mechanisms of resistance to trametinib in this patient population.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive trametinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 28 days.
