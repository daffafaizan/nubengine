      octogenarians. Nonvalvular atrial ﬁbrillation increases the risk of ischemic stroke by
      approximately 5-fold and these strokes result in higher mortality and disability. Warfarin is
      recommended as ﬁrst line anticoagulation treatment in patients with NVAF who are at moderate
      or high risk of stroke,while antiplatelet agents, such as aspirin, give a more convenient but
      less effective alternative in the prevention of ischemic stroke and are recommended in low
      risk patients.Current guideline about warfarin anticoagulation therapy recommend that target
      INR value must be maintained between 2.0 and 3.0,which not only reduces the frequency of
      ischaemic stroke but also its low incidence of major bleeding. However, the current status of
      anticoagulation therapy for elderly Chinese AF patients, particularly in aged over 80 years,
      is not clear. The purpose of the present study was to test the hypothesis that an INR target
      of 1.5-2.0 can provide the same efficacy and better safety as compare with a standard target
      of 2.0-3.0 in patients over 75 with NVAF.
