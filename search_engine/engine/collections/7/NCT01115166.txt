      volume and rate of fluid loss from the intravascular space, since hypo- and hypervolemia are
      combined with increased morbidity and mortality. In this study we which to use the large
      variations in hemoglobin during extracorporal to calculate both these variables.

      Hemoglobin is measured every 5 minutes during one hour beginning shortly before start of the
      heart-lung machine. When the extracorporal circulation begins the hemoglobin decreases due to
      the quick mix and dilution of the priming fluid from the heart-lung machine with the patients
      blood.

      From the amount of priming fluid and the fall of the hemoglobin, the blood volume can be
      calculated. If no further fluid is given the next 20 to 30 minutes, the hemoglobin
      concentration will in most cases increase as a result of the fluid loss from the vascular
      space. This increase in combination with the diureses can be used to calculate the
      intravascular fluid loss to the interstitium during surgery.

      Sodium concentration will also be measured in parallel with the hemoglobin concentration.

      The Sodium concentrations in combination with given and excreted (urine)Sodium can be used in
      a mass balance to calculate if intracellular edema is induced.
