      the American Stroke Association, the prevalence of stroke in the U.S. is approximately 4.8
      million with approximately 700,000 additional strokes occurring annually. The 2001 overall
      death rate for stroke was 58%. Of those who survive, 30 to 50 percent do not regain
      functional independence, 15 to 30 percent are permanently disabled, and 20% require
      institutional care at three months after onset.

      The most common neurological deficit among these stroke survivors, and thus a substantial
      contributor to post-stroke disability, is a motor weakness on one (hemiparesis) side of the
      body. Presently, the only treatment available for patients with motor deficits is
      rehabilitative therapy. However, many patients are not responsive to standard rehabilitative
      therapy or achieve a less than satisfactory improvement in function.

      The primary objective of this study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of targeted
      sub-threshold epidural cortical stimulation delivered concurrent with rehabilitation
      activities to enhance motor recovery in patients suffering from hemiparesis (a motor weakness
      in one half of the body) affecting the upper extremity (shoulder, arm, wrist, hand) following
      a stroke. In addition to evaluating changes from baseline level, safety and efficacy measures
      will be compared to patients who undergo the same rehabilitation activities but without
      cortical stimulation. The two study groups will be compared to determine the degree to which
      motor function of the affected limb can be improved beyond rehabilitation alone by epidural
      stimulation of a targeted cortical region.
