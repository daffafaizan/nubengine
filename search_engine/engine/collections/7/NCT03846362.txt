      factors of AML relapse. Standard risk group includes favorable t (15;17) (q22; q21) and inv
      (16)/t (16;16). High-risk patients have a complex karyotype rearrangement (3 and more),
      inversion of the long arm in 3rd chromosome and EVI1 gene rearrangement, monosomy 5 and 7,
      translocations involving KMT2A gene and several rare translocations. All other genotype
      alterations attributed to the moderate risk group.

      Besides genetic factors, detection of the minimal residual disease (MRD) after initial
      chemotherapy and its decrease rate after 1st postremission chemotherapy with high dose
      Cytarabine and anthracyclines, plays a crucial role in the development of the morphologic
      relapse. Patients with PCR-MRD<0,1% after 2 courses of chemotherapy have a 30% or less risk
      of relapse, while PCR-MRD>0,1% - over 70%. In the clinical trial investigators are planning
      to measure MRD either by immune-phenotype, or PCR methods, in 3 check-points and it will be
      one of decision-making control parameter for the optimal therapy tactics.

      Patients with initially high-risk group and those with high MRD after 2 initial courses of
      chemotherapy will be assigned to the allogenic transplantation of the hematopoietic stem
      cells from HLA- matched or haploidentical family donors.
