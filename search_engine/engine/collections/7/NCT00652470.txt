      ventricles due to a blockage in outflow at the level of cerebral aqueduct. This can cause
      increased intracranial pressure, with adverse effect on brain development. The causes of this
      include congenital aqueductal stensois or acquired aqueductal stenosis from previous brain
      hemorrhage or infection.

      TVH is currently treated through one of the following two approaches:

        -  Extra-cranial CSF diversion through ventricular shunts. Extra-cranial shunting has been
           the standard approach over the past few decades, since functional shunts were first
           developed and inserted successfully.

        -  Intra-cranial internal CSF diversion using endoscopic techniques. The principles of
           internal diversion were clear from the time neurosurgeons first understood the nature of
           hydrocephalus. However, internal diversion was never really practical or successful on a
           large scale until the more recent development of neuroendoscopy. There is currently a
           revived interest in diversionary hydrocephalus treatment through neuroendoscopic
           surgical techniques, with the primary focus on endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV).
