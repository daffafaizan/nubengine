      cells at the time of B cell reconstitution in the peripheral blood can be used to stratify
      patients between those with low % CD5+ B cells at greater risk of relapse who would need
      maintenance immunosuppression and those with normalized CD5+ B cells who would be at lower
      risk and relapse, and therefore may not need maintenance immunosuppression. The latter group
      will be randomized to either maintenance immunosuppression vs close clinical observation
      without maintenance immunosuppression. This study is not designed to evaluate the efficacy of
      new therapies in ANCA vasculitis. The treatment regimen used in the proposed study are
      routinely used in the treatment of patients with ANCA vasculitis and considered
      standard-of-care.
