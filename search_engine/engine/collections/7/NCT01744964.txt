      cross-over trial. Heat pain threshold and intensity, cold pain threshold, and the response to
      tonic cold pain (latency, intensity, and tolerance) were evaluated before and for up to 120
      min after the administration of 1.5 mg apomorphine/placebo. A polymorphism (DAT-1) within the
      dopamine transporter gene (SLC6A3) was investigated.
