      history of alcohol withdrawal in order to provide remotely monitored symptom-triggered
      alcohol withdrawal treatment using telemedicine. Participants will initially complete a
      screening and eligibility visit. If eligible, participants will then be scheduled for 3-day
      remote withdrawal management (which can be extended by 1-2 days if medically indicated).
      During remote withdrawal management, participants will receive symptom-triggered diazepam
      treatment using a modified version of the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for
      Alcohol Scale, revised (CIWA-Ar). Within one week following termination of withdrawal
      treatment, participants will be scheduled for a remote follow up visit in which they will
      complete patient satisfaction questionnaires and will be offered weekly counselling sessions
      and anticraving medication to prevent relapse to alcohol use. Approximately 30 days following
      treatment initiation, relapse to alcohol use will be assessed.
