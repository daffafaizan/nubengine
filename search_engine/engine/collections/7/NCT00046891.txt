        -  Determine the effectiveness of EGb761 in the prevention of chemotherapy-related
           cognitive dysfunction in women with breast cancer.

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of this drug when administered during adjuvant
           chemotherapy in these patients.

        -  Assess the onset and trajectory of cognitive loss that may occur during chemotherapy in
           these patients.

        -  Assess the quality of life and cognitive role functioning of patients treated with this
           drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients
      are stratified according to type of chemotherapy (doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide vs
      doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide with taxane vs other anthracycline-based chemotherapy vs other
      non-anthracycline-based chemotherapy), age (18 to 49 vs 50 and over), menopausal status at
      start of therapy (premenopausal vs postmenopausal vs unknown for surgical reasons), and lymph
      node involvement (0-3 vs 4 or more). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral EGb761 twice daily.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo twice daily. Patients in both arms receive
           treatment beginning no later than the start of the second course of chemotherapy and
           continuing until 1 month after the completion of chemotherapy.

      Quality of life and cognitive function are assessed at baseline, monthly during chemotherapy,
      and then at 1, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months.

      Patients are followed every 6 months for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 220 patients (110 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 11 months.
