      basal metabolism and is considered to be a defense mechanism for regulating body temperature
      in adults .

      Post spinal shivering may cause discomfort to the patient,and may aggravate wound pain by
      stretching incisions and increases intracranial and intra ocular pressure.Shivering may
      increase tissue oxygen demand as much as 500% and is accompanied by increase in minute
      ventilation and cardiac output to maintain aerobic metabolism.

      Tympanic temperature will be recorded preoperatively,after establishment of spinal
      anesthesia,and every 15 minutes til the end of operation.Core temperature below 36.5 C is
      considered as hypothermia Shivering intensity will be assessed with a five -point scale
      validated by Crossly and Maharaj.

      Adverse events like hypotension,bradycardia, respiratory depression,nausea and vomiting will
      be recorded and treated.
