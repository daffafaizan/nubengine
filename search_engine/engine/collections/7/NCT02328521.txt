      drug-eluting stent (DES) reduces restenosis rate to 4%-10%. Neointimal hyperplasia and
      restenosis remain to be problems after DES implantation. Besides, DES causes an increase in
      uncovered struts, late stent thrombosis, neoatherosclerosis, and heterogeneous neointima.
      Diabetes mellitus (DM) results in increased risk for atherosclerosis, in-stent restenosis,
      neoatherosclerosis and late-stent thrombosis. Nicorandil, a hybrid of adenosine
      triphosphate-sensitive potassium (K-ATP) channel opener and nitrates, has been shown to
      reduce target vessel revascularization after stent implantation, target lesion
      revascularization after rotational atherectomy, and restenosis in patients undergoing
      percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Intracoronary optical coherence tomography(OCT) has
      emerged as a high-resolution imaging method for analysis of neointima that grows over the
      stent. We aim to examine the effect of nicorandil on the neointima after coronary DES
      implantation in patients with unstable angina and DM.
