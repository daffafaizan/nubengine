    
      Acne rosacea is a chronic inflammatory disease with different components including
      inflammatory lesions (papules/pustules), erythema and telangiectasia. Brimonidine 0.33% Gel
      primarily affects the erythematous components of rosacea. As such, combination treatment with
      a standard rosacea treatment, such as Finacea 15% Gel, may provide additional relief for the
      inflammatory component of rosacea.
