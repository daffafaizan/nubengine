    
      This is a randomized (the study medication is assigned by chance), double-blind (neither
      physician nor participant knows the identity of the assigned treatment), placebo (an inactive
      substance that is compared with a drug to test whether the drug has a real
      effect)-controlled, event-driven, multicenter study in patients who are hospitalized for a
      specific acute medical illness and have other risk factors for venous thromboembolism (VTE).
      The study is designed to evaluate rivaroxaban in the prevention of symptomatic VTE events and
      VTE-related deaths for a period of 45 days post-hospital discharge. The study will consist of
      a screening phase, a 45-day double-blind treatment phase, and a 30-day follow-up phase. Study
      drug will start at randomization (Day 1), and will continue until Day 45 (inclusive). A total
      of approximately 12000 patients will be randomly assigned to either rivaroxaban or placebo in
      a 1:1 ratio. The total duration for a patient who completes the study after randomization is
      expected to be 75 days.
