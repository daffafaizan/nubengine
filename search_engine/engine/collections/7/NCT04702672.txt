      activity and unhealthy diet. Therefore, it is of great important to evolve dietary products
      that counteracts this development.

      Barley has shown some beneficial effects on postprandial blood glucose compared with wheat. A
      lowering of the postprandial glucose level reduces the risk of developing T2D and helps in
      the regulation of a pre-existing diabetes. However, barley is traditionally not used in
      bread-making in Denmark.

      The elevation of postprandial glucose also depends on how fast the dietary products are
      degraded in the gastrointestinal tract.

      The starch in barley consist of both fastly degraded amylopectin and slowly degraded amylose.
      Slow degradation is expected to lower postprandial glucose. By natural breeding techniques it
      has been possible for the investigators collaborative partners at the Universities of Aarhus
      and Copenhagen and PlantCarb ApS to make an natural organic high-amylose barley (HIAMBA®).

      In a series of acute studies the investigators want to study the effects on the glycemic
      response to bread made with different compositions of wheat and HIAMBA® in subjects with T2D.

      The investigators expect that HIAMBA® positively affect the postprandial glucose-metabolism
      more than wheat and hereby acutely improves the glycemic regulation for both subjects with
      and without T2D.
