      patients with relapsed or refractory Ewing sarcoma or osteosarcoma will be enrolled and
      treated in a 3+3 design with a combination of cabozantinib, topotecan and cyclophosphamide.

      The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment including
      medical tests and follow up visits.

        -  The names of the drugs are:

             -  Cabozantinib

             -  Topotecan

             -  Cyclophosphamide

        -  The names of the non-investigational supportive care drugs are:

             -  Filgrastim, pegfilgrastim, or a related growth factor.

      It is expected that up to 16 people will take part in this research study.

      This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of an investigational
      drug combination and also tries to define the appropriate doses of the drugs to use for
      further studies. "Investigational" means that the drug combination is being studied.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved all medications included in this
      trial as a treatment for multiple types of cancers.

      The combination of topotecan and cyclophosphamide has been used for treatment of this
      population. Cabozantinib has been used alone for treatment of Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma
      and shown to have an effect in some patients. This is the first time that cabozantinib will
      be studied in combination with topotecan and cyclophosphamide.
