      Rhenium Re 188 P2045 and will do that by observing you closely after you receive the drug and
      by conducting multiple tests, as well as by asking you how you feel. We want to also learn if
      there is any benefit, in terms of lung cancer tumor reduction, as a result of treatment with
      Rhenium Re 188 P2045. This study has previously been posted by Berlex, Inc. Andarix
      Pharmaceuticals is the sponsor of the trial.
