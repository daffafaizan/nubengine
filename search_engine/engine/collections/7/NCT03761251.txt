      self-care behaviors and collaborative parental involvement. Adolescence is a vulnerable time
      for the deterioration of glycemic control in patients with T1DM. In particular, parental
      monitoring declines during early adolescence. This often occurs before the child has
      developed self-efficacy and competence in independently performing diabetes-related tasks,
      including blood glucose monitoring. Consequently, there is a great need for innovative
      strategies in early adolescents that promote self-efficacy development and facilitate
      parental involvement.
