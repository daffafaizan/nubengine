      clinic, the sensitivity was 100%, and specificity 96.4% with the MyDiagnostics as compared to
      a 12-lead ECG. Adequate comparison of this device with accordingly treatment with care as
      usual is needed before large scale implementation in the primary care setting can be
      advocated.
