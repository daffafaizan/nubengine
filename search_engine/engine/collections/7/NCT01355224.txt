      short-term impact of personalized risk feedback for obesity. This study is uniquely situated
      to provide important data on how individuals interpret various sources of risk information
      and how they arrive at an overall perception of risk for a condition. Taken altogether, study
      findings will be used to serve as an overall model for future intervention efforts to
      effectively communicate obesity risk information with the goal of improving weight management
      and overall population health.

      CPMC-The CPMC is an ongoing evidence-based longitudinal research study designed to determine
      the utility of using personal genome information in health management and clinical
      decision-making. They collect saliva samples, perform genetic analysis and provide genetic
      risk feedback for several disease conditions including coronary artery disease and type 2
      diabetes. The present study will build upon the existing genetic testing and web feedback
      infrastructure at Coriell to conduct behavioral science research to address critical public
      health questions.
