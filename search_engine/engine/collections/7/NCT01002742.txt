      published and unpublished data from Johns Hopkins, M. D. Anderson, University of Michigan and
      others defined an expected 35%-53% complete response (CR) at Day +28 of corticosteroid
      therapy for previously untreated patients with acute GVHD.

      BMT CTN study 0302 (NCT00224874)was a randomized Phase II study evaluating etanercept,
      mycophenolate mofetil, denileukin diftitox or pentostatin in addition to corticosteroids. The
      results of that study suggested that mycophenolate mofetil produced the highest rates of CR
      at Day 28 and overall survival, supporting its evaluation in a Phase III study. Day 56
      GVHD-free survival for the four treatment arms (all combining corticosteroids with one of the
      four study drugs) ranged from 39-71% across the four study arms.
