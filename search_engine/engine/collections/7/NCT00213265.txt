      end organ failure. SOT recipients have a lifelong increased risk for infections as a result
      of immunosuppression, including those caused by pneumococci. The increased susceptibility to
      pneumococcal infections is multi-factorial and is related to underlying immunosuppression as
      well as varying degrees of splenic dysfunction as a result of underlying pretransplantation
      diseases, among other factors.

      The types and severity of invasive pneumococcal disease vary among each transplant
      population. However, comparative data are lacking. Lung transplant recipients have the
      highest incidence of bacterial pneumonia among solid organ transplant recipients. Pneumonia
      secondary to Streptococcus pneumoniae occurs in heart transplant patients at a rate 10 times
      that found in the general population. It is suggested that besides the intensity of
      immunosuppression, ongoing immunosuppression is important as a risk factor for invasive
      pneumococcal disease in transplant recipients.

      Despite the fact that 23-valent polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine is one of the vaccines
      that receives priority among organ transplant recipients, at the Hospital for Sick Children,
      several cases of pneumococcal disease have been seen. The advent of the 7-valent conjugate
      vaccine affords the opportunity to possibly reduce the burden of pneumococcal disease in the
      patient population by virtue that it may be more immunogenic in transplant patients

      This study will examine the antibody titres achieved among transplant recipients who are
      immunized with Prevnar™, as well as evaluate the safety and tolerability or Prevnar™
      administered as a three-dose regimen to children and adolescents following organ
      transplantation.
