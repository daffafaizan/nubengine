      formula. The composition of the low-protein formula vs the standard formula was: energy (65
      vs. 68 kcal/100 mL), protein (1.2 vs. 1.7 g/100 mL).

      To investigate the safety of the low-protein formula without any bias, a 4-month intervention
      period was selected during which the infants were fed only formula.

      Anthropometric parameters (weight, length, and head circumference) and body composition were
      assessed at enrollment, at 2 and 4 months' of age. Parents were asked to keep a diary on the
      occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms or any other symptoms and were contacted every two
      weeks either by clinic visits or phone calls.

      The reference group was constituted by a cohort of healthy, exclusively breastfed, full-term
      infants.
