      can accurately detect significant carotid artery stenosis.

      Secondary objective is to relate changes in CSS signal to different degrees of stenosis. We
      obtain a "proof of concept" if the device correlates strongly with the established
      classification of atherosclerotic carotid disease derived various imaging modalities
      including magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and computer tomographic angiography (CTA),
      conventional angiography, or carotid ultrasound.
