      improving the quality of life of these patients. A comparison with a placebo is necessary, as
      GERD symptoms may be heavily influenced by the nocebo/placebo effect.

      This is a post-marketing, single center, double-blind, and randomized, placebo-controlled,
      parallel study. Patients with GERD treated with an 8-week cours of proton pump inhibitors
      will be randomize and receive either Zinc-l-carnosine or placebo for 12-week. GERD symptoms
      will be assessed with a questionnaire (modified GERD questionnaire by Locke) monthly for 12
      weeks and after a 4-week wash-out. Also, quality of life will be assessed at baseline and at
      12 weeks with the 36-item short form survey (SF-36).
