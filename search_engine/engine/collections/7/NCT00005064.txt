      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of PS-341 in patients with refractory or relapsed
      acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, or chronic
      myeloid leukemia in blast phase.

      II. Assess the plasma pharmacology of this drug, its ability to inhibit proteasome function
      and to accelerate apoptosis in circulating blasts in this patient population.

      III. Assess the antileukemic effects of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive PS-341 IV bolus twice weekly for 4 weeks followed by 2 weeks of rest.
      Treatment continues for a maximum of 12 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or
      disease progression.

      Cohorts of 2 patients receive escalating doses of PS-341 until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose level associated with toxicity
      probability closest to 0.2 after 30 patients are treated.
