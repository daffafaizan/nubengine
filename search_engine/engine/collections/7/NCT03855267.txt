      pharmacokinetic characteristics makes it very suitable for total intravenous anesthesia(
      TIVA), etomidate belongs to intravenous anesthesia with propofol, is a derivative of the
      imidazoles, its calm performance is strong, work quickly, no obvious respiratory depression,
      had little effects on the cardiovascular system, which, therefore, to protect the
      cardiovascular, maintain hemodynamic stability has a certain advantage. Our previous project
      showed that propofol and etomidate combined application can maintain stable hemodynamics in
      patients with better, reduce the occurrence of adverse reactions, can be used within 3 h of
      surgery anesthesia.The purpose of this study is to use propofol or etomidate/propofol mixture
      in combination with BIS monitoring to perform general anesthesia maintenance for patients, in
      order to ensure the appropriate depth of anesthesia, better maintain the hemodynamic
      stability of patients, reduce adverse reactions, and find the appropriate E/P mixture of the
      best proportion and dose.
