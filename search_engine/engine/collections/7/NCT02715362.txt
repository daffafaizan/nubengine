    
      Patients treated with leukapheresis from which peripheral blood mononuclear cells are
      purified. T cells are activated and then re-engineered to express chimeric antigen receptors
      (CARs) specific for GPC3. Cells are expanded in culture and returned to the participant by
      transcatheter arterial infusion at the dose of .(1-10)Ã—106 CAR positive T cells/kg. The cells
      perfusion process would last for 15min to 2 h via an ambulatory infusion pump. A single dose
      of 1.5 grams/m2 of cyclophosphamide will be given two days before CART cell infusion.
