      total anesthesia time, needle visibility, block needle passes, block success and early and
      late complications. Investigators made the hypothesis that, while providing similar efficacy
      and better needle visualisation than coracoid infraclavicular block, performance time of
      retroclavicular block will not exceed the performance time of its comparator.

      This study is designed as a prospective randomized non-inferiority trial. Two groups of
      non-consecutive patients will be randomly assigned to either retroclavicular or coracoid
      infraclavicular block. This study will be carried out in three different centres
      simultaneously.

      The multicentre trial will be conducted in two university hospitals (Centre hospitalier
      universitaire de Sherbrooke [CHUS] Hôtel-Dieu/Fleurimont and Centre Hospitalier de
      l'Université Laval [CHUL] in Quebec city) and a community hospital (Cowansville). The third
      participating establishment, Brome-Missisquoi-Perkins hospital, is located in Cowansville, a
      peripheral city of 15,000 people.
