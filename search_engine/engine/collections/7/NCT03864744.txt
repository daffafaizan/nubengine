      supplementation in order to treat the endocrine and exocrine insufficiencies inherently
      occurring postoperatively. In addition to secondary diabetes and insufficient digestive
      capacity, totally pancreatectomised patients face a high risk of developing non-alcoholic
      hepatic steatosis. Under normal circumstances non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is regarded
      as the hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome and pathophysiologically related to excess
      energy intake and insulin resistance resulting in fat accumulation in adipose tissue as well
      as in the liver. Thus, the high incidence of hepatic steatosis following total pancreatectomy
      is surprising as patients typically are lean, peripherally insulin sensitive and properly
      insulinised.Interestingly, the pancreatic hormone glucagon has been implicated in lipid
      metabolism and recent human data from studies investigating the effect of glucagon receptor
      antagonism suggest that glucagon signalling may be essential for maintaining a fat-free
      liver. This makes the investigators speculate that the decreased glucagon levels following
      pancreatic surgery may play a hitherto unrecognised role in the development of hepatic
      steatosis after the operation.

      The study will include 33 patients scheduled for pancreatectomy (total or
      pancreaticoduodenectomy). They will be followed for one year. A liver biopsy will be
      collected during the operation on all patients. After 12 months, participants will undergo
      magnetic resonance spectroscopy and those who have hepatic lipid content â‰¥2% will undergo an
      ultrasound-guided percutaneous liver biopsy. Furthermore, all participants will undergo a
      metabolic evaulation after one year.
