    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Characterize the safety and toxicity of riluzole in combination with modified (m)
      leucovorin calcium, fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) 6/bevacizumab and determine the
      recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of riluzole in combination with mFOLFOX6/bevacizumab in
      patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Determine the pharmacokinetics of riluzole in patients with metastatic CRC.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the efficacy of the combination treatment. II. Determine the effect of riluzole in
      downstream GRM3 signaling by immunofluorescent staining of phosphorylated (p)AKT and pCREB in
      pre- and post-treatment tumor tissues.

      III. Assess FCGRT/FcRn expression, bevacizumab pharmacokinetics, inflammatory cytokines, and
      cachexia associated factors as early biomarkers for resistance to therapy.

      IV. Assess cytotoxic T cells in peripheral blood to evaluate the immunomodulatory effect of
      this therapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of riluzole.

      Patients receive riluzole orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-14. Patients also receive
      oxaliplatin via intravenous piggyback (IVPB) over 2 hours, leucovorin calcium IVPB over 2
      hours, and bevacizumab IVPB over 30 minutes on day 1 and fluorouracil via intravenous (IV)
      push over 5 minutes and then IV continuously over 46 hours on days 1-2. Treatment repeats
      every 2 weeks for up to 8 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.
