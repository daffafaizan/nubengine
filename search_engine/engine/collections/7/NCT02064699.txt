    
      QuantiFERON-CMV Â® is a fast and standardized test that evaluates the CMV specific cellular
      immunity measuring the amount of secreted Interferon gamma (IFN gamma) in plasma by ELISA. It
      uses more epitopes of proteins including CMV glycoprotein B (gB), protein IE-1 and protein
      pp65 and protein pp50, which are specific for (human leukocyte antigen) HLA class I.
      Pretreatment of the sample is simple and plasma can be stored, frozen, for a delayed dose of
      interferon.
