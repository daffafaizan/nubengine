      daily life. Hamstring muscle shortness, commonly seen in the community, is a risk factor for
      many musculoskeletal pathologies. Clinical observations have shown that the shortness of the
      Hamstring muscle causes spinal malalignment. This deterioration of the spine alignment may
      adversely affect the rib cage expansion. Moreover, considering that the optimal length of the
      muscles provides optimal contraction, it was found that the spinal malalignment adversely
      affected the effective contraction of the diaphragm by changing the position of diaphragm. A
      different view is that, because the fascia functions as a single tissue surrounding the
      entire body, a restriction in the hamstring muscle can also cause a restriction in distal
      muscles such as diaphragm through the fascia.

      There are many treatment methods used to increase the flexibility of the hamstring muscle.
      One of these methods is the myofascial release technique. In this technique, which targets
      both muscle and fascia, applying light and prolonged pressure provides the myo-fascial
      complex to reach its optimal length, resulting in the optimal function of the muscle. In our
      best knowledge, no study has evaluated the effect of myofascial release technique on
      respiratory parameters in patients with hamstring muscle shortness.
