      every other female is silently suffering from this disease leading to bone, joint pain and
      disability. This project is innovatively designed first time in Pakistan to target weak bones
      of women with high intensity, progressive exercise training. The objectives of this study are
      to determine the effects of a high intensity multi-modal exercise training on bone mineral
      density and functional performance in postmenopausal women.

      After initial screening based on history, subjective fracture risk calculations and
      subjective osteoporosis screening. Females fulfilling criteria and willing to participate in
      exercise trial will be recruited in the study. At baseline, DEXA scan will be done for
      Femoral and lumbar bone density. All performance based testing for functional performance
      outcome measures would be done at baseline, after 3 months & after 6 months. Patient will be
      called twice a week for 8months and DEXA will be repeated after 8months of training. It is
      hypothesized that supervised exercise training will improve bone mineral density and
      functional performance in postmenopausal women with low bone mass.
