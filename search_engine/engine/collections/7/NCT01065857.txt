      significant differences in the joint variable of efficacy and acceptability between
      CitraFleet and Klean PrepÂ® (polyethylene glycol) for the preparation of subjects undergoing a
      colon examination.

      The evaluation will be carried out by two blinded assessors, independent of the investigator
      who performed the procedure (endoscopist investigator). It will be assessed from images of
      different sections of the colon: cecum, ascending, transverse, descending and rectum and
      subsequent confirmation by Principal Investigator if an agreement has been reached between
      the two blinded assessors or whether it is necessary to reach consensus.

      The evaluation of the subject's acceptability will be assessed using a 5 point scale which
      assesses the difficulty of taking the product, the degree of discomfort caused by it, and the
      taste of the drug.

      The secondary objective is to evaluate the safety of CitraFleet.

      In addition a second exploratory arm of CitraFleet was included in this study (CitraFleet
      Exploratory arm). The study is not powered to make formal statistical comparisons for this
      arm. Exploratory assessment of this arm against the main CitraFleet regimen and Klean-Prep
      will be made in order to run future trials design with this schedule.
