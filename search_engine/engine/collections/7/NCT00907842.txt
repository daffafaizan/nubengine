      trial (RCT) with the mesh placed upon end colostomy formation. Results suggest this procedure
      is the panacea against stoma associated herniations. The investigators still have unanswered
      questions however, about the size and ideal position of the mesh, possible complications
      (infection, adhesions) and the benefit in terms of quality of life.
