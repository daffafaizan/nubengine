      body core temperature thermometer TcoreÂ®. Therefore the bias of the measurements to the
      reference measurements of the bladder catheter thermometer is determined.

      Patients included are in the ICU of the UKSH and awake. They already have the reference
      thermometer in the catheter. The patient investigation time is limited to maximum 2 hours,
      SAEs will be recorded for 24 hours. The temperature of the two temperature sensors will be
      compared on three timepoints.
