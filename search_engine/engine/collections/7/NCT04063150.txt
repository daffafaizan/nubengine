      contains live poliovirus, which can mutate and become neurovirulent. After OPV cessation,
      inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) will be the only polio vaccine used for routine
      immunization. This clinical trial will provide poliovirus type-specific immunogenicity data
      on an IPV or fractional-dose IPV (fIPV)-only schedule for routine immunization, which will be
      important for post OPV cessation era. For fIPV, it will provide immunogenicity data on fIPV
      administered either intradermally (ID) or intramuscularly (IM) and allow a direct comparison
      of the two methods.

      Healthy infants 6 weeks of age will be enrolled at two study clinics in Dhaka, Bangladesh,
      and randomized to one of seven study arms. Infants will be followed-up until 10 months of age
      through clinic visits. Blood specimens will be collected to test for immunological response.
