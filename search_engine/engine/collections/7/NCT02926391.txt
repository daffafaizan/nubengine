      to anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) to treat cervical spondylotic myelopathy
      (CSM). However, the use of vertebral body replacement (VBR) cages is technically demanding,
      especially to adjust the size of the cage to the defect without compromising the endplate
      integrity increasing the risk of subsidence. Beside recent studies advocating the interest of
      the shape, size and design of an implant to achieve fusion and stability in cervical spinal
      diseases indications, 3D printing offering rapid and patient-specific manufacturing has
      emerged over the past years. Several materials and technologies can be used and clinical and
      radiological data are still sparse.
