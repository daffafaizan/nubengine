      undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation at 5 institutions in China. Recipients
      between ages of 14 to 60 years old were eligible. Eligible patients were randomized to
      receive once daily subcutaneous 5-7μg/kg/d GM-CSF (Molgramostim, TOPLEUCON®; Xiamen Amoytop
      Biotech Co., Ltd., China) (GM-CSF group), 5-7μg/kg/d G-CSF (G-CSF group), or a combination of
      2-3μg/kg/d GM-CSF and 2-3μg/kg/d G-CSF each (G-CSF+GM-CSF group). Administration of CSFs was
      started on day 5 post-transplant and continued until recovery from neutropenia (absolute
      neutrophil count [ANC] > 1.5×10(9)/L for 2 consecutive days). If absolute neutrophil count
      (ANC) decreased to < 1.5×10(9)/L within 5 days after withdrawal of CSFs, the same CSF would
      be resumed until the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) reached 1.5×10(9)/L again. All patients
      received antimicrobial prophylaxis with oral levofloxacin 500 mg daily and antifungal
      prophylaxis with oral fluconazole 200 mg daily.
