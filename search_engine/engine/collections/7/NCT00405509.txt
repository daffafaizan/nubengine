      in the bodies of adults and children with asthma and allergies and cause some of the symptoms
      of these diseases. Leukotrienes are increased in the bodies of adults who have common colds
      and are believed to cause some of the symptoms of the common cold. It is not known if
      increases in leukotrienes are related to the symptoms of the common cold in children. There
      are also genes that may control levels of leukotrienes and other chemicals in your body
      during the common cold. If you enroll your child in this study, he/she will be tested for
      allergies and for genes that may control the levels of leukotrienes and other chemicals.

      STUDY DESIGN:

      There will be 40 subjects enrolled into the study between the ages of 6 to < 14 years of age.
      However, approximately 80 participants may have to sign the consent form and undergo
      screening activities in order enroll these 40 subjects. The study will last approximately 1
      month and will require you and your child to return to our clinic approximately 7 times over
      the study duration. You and your child will be required to return to our clinic six days in a
      row for testing.

      Testing will include skin testing for allergies, nasal secretion collection, and skin cell
      collection.
