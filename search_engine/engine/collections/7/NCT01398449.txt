    
      Patient Population:

      Thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma after esophagectomy with at least 15 lymph nodes
      removed for adequate nodal staging.

      R0 resection; T1-2, N+, M0.

      Scheme:

      After esophagectomy, patients are firstly stratified by numbers of lymph node metastasis (<3
      or >=3). Then patients are randomized to 2 arms:

      Arm A:

      Adjuvant chemotherapy (4 cycles).

      Arm B:

      Adjuvant chemotherapy (4 cycles) + Elective Nodal Irradiation (bilateral supraclavicular
      fossa and mediastinum).
