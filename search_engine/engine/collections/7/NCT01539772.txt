      collect cohorts of Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) patients with in-frame deletions in the
      dystrophin gene. We will collect clinical data across multiple body systems and correlate
      these findings to the high-resolution deletion break-point mapping performed from the tissue
      samples. We will investigate the observed variability to deepen our understanding of
      molecular mechanisms relevant to the optimization of exon skipping therapeutic approaches.
