      surgery plus aggressive combination intraperitoneal chemotherapy may significantly alter the
      natural history of this disease. This study will define the maximum tolerated dose of
      paclitaxel and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) given as an early post-operative intraperitoneal (IP)
      dwell therapy after cytoreductive surgery and continuous hyperthermic peritoneal perfusion
      with cisplatin (CHPP).
