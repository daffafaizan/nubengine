      recruit and consent adult study participants (all comers). Clinic staff will draw 2
      ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) tubes, 1 heparin tube, and 1 acid citrate dextrose
      (ACD) tube from venous blood and obtain finger stick capillary blood. Clinic staff will
      perform the investigational SD Biosensor STANDARD™ G6PD Test for glucose-6-phosphate
      dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency and a HemoCue® hemoglobin test on finger stick capillary
      blood. An EDTA anti-coagulated venous blood sample will be sent to a Clinical Laboratory
      Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certified lab for G6PD reference testing by the gold standard
      assay: G6PD measurement by spectrophotometry; this sample will also have a hemoglobin
      measurement by a hematology analyzer. Deidentified blood samples collected in tubes with
      other anti-coagulants will be evaluated for equivalency across anti-coagulant types.
      Individuals identified as G6PD deficient or intermediate by the reference test will be
      notified of their results by the clinic and referred to their physician for follow-up.

      This study includes a nested repeatability study.
