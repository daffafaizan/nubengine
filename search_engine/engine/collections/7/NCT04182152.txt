      Subjects with pulmonary nodules who will undergo Video-assisted thoracoscopic sublobar
      resection will be randomly divided into two groups. In the experimental group, before the
      VATS operation, transbronchial ICG injection will be guided by electromagnetic navigation
      bronchoscopy to locate the nodule. In the control group, the subject will undergo CT guided
      hook-wire placement for nodule localization before VATS. The study is expected to enroll 188
      patients. Finally, the effectiveness and safety of the two methods will be compared.
