      efficacy data for the radioactive drug product (Technetium Tc 99m EC20), and assay masses for
      presence of folate receptors, in women with suspected ovarian or endometrial cancer. Twelve
      subjects will be enrolled, with a minimum of five malignant cases, as determined by
      histopathological evaluation.

      Women with a suspected ovarian or endometrial mass who either 1) have fixed, paraffin
      embedded tissue sample(s) available for immunohistochemical staining obtained from a previous
      pathological evaluation or 2) are scheduled for a procedure to obtain tissue for pathological
      evaluation that can be fixed and paraffin embedded for immunohistochemical staining are
      eligible for this study. The ovarian mass may be either an initial finding, e.g., found at a
      routine pelvic examination or to investigate symptoms, or the ovarian or endometrial mass may
      be a finding suspicious of recurrent or residual tumor at follow-up examination after
      surgical resection of confirmed ovarian or endometrial cancer. Patients may not be pregnant
      or breastfeeding at enrollment.
