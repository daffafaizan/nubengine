      those without BPD and 2) investigate ET-1 levels in infants with BPD-associated PH versus
      those without BPD-associated PH. This study will allow us to help define a high-risk
      population at LPCH-namely, premature infants with BPD-associated PH. It will also potentially
      allow us to focus further research efforts and treatment targets towards these infants who
      encompass some of our sickest patients at LPCH.

      In 2009 the Division of Lung Diseases of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI)
      published seven priority areas for research in pediatric pulmonary diseases, one of which was
      pulmonary vascular disease. An emphasis was made on finding 'clinical strategies that
      anticipate the development of PH [which] may allow earlier recognition and more aggressive
      therapy, thereby slowing the development of PH in many chronic lung parenchymal and vascular
      diseases'. This study attempts to address this goal. Specifically we aim to evaluate ET-1
      levels in premature infants diagnosed with BPD and with BPD-associated PH. If ET-1 levels are
      found to correlate with disease state the possibility of prediction and possible early
      treatment for PH in these infants is raised and merits investigation.
