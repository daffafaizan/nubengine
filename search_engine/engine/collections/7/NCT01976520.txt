      I. To evaluate the safety of vaccination with Oncoquest-Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)
      vaccine (autologous tumor cell extract vaccine).

      II. To evaluate the feasibility of Oncoquest-CLL production and administration to previously
      untreated patients with CLL.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the clinical response [as defined by the International Workshop on Chronic
      Lymphocytic Leukemia 2008 (iwCLL2008)] of the Oncoquest-CLL vaccine in treatment-naive
      patients with CLL.

      II. To evaluate the T and B cell immune responses against autologous leukemia cells induced
      with Oncoquest-CLL vaccine.

      III. To measure the progression-free survival of patients treated with the Oncoquest-CLL
      vaccine.

      IV. To evaluate the change in absolute lymphocyte count and lymphocyte doubling time before
      and after vaccine administration and correlate this with immune response.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive autologous tumor vaccine subcutaneously (SC) on Study Day 1 and 15, and then
      monthly for 3 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up monthly for 3 months, and then
      every 3 months for up to 1 year.
