      women do not seek help for their mental health for numerous reasons, including lack of
      awareness about symptoms, available treatments, and stigma. The Wellbeing Plan is a brief
      self-help leaflet developed by experts in perinatal mental health, and is designed to improve
      emotional wellbeing of women during and after pregnancy by providing information, raising
      awareness, helping a woman identify her own symptoms, provide coping strategies, and identify
      key people who can support the woman during this time. The Wellbeing in Pregnancy project is
      a online pilot randomized controlled trial which aims to evaluate the efficacy of the
      Wellbeing Plan in improving women's emotional wellbeing in pregnancy.
