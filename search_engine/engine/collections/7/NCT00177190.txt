    
      This is an in vitro evaluation of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma using patients blood and tissue
      to evaluate immune responses related to identified tumor populations and dendritic/ CD 8
      cells with the following objectives:

        -  Objective I: Evaluate the feasibility of the preparation of dendritic cells (DCs), CD8
           and Sezary cells (all CD4 positive) in vitro, obtained from the buffy coats or a skin
           biopsy from an area with tumor involvement of subjects with cutaneous t-cell lymphoma
           (CTCL) and Sezary syndrome (leukemic stage of CTCL) undergoing an approved FDA therapy,
           extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP).

        -  Objective II: Evaluate antigen loading of the DCs.

        -  Objective III: Test the functional capacities of the DCs derived from CTCL subjects to
           overcome immune tolerance to the tumor cells ex-vivo, by using modified Elispot assay in
           conjunction with Granzyme B Elispot assay as a measurement of cytotoxicity.
