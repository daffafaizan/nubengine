    
      Proliferative glomerulonephritis is a common and severe manifestation of systemic lupus
      erythematosus (SLE) that usually requires intensive therapy with high doses of
      glucocorticosteroids and cytotoxic drugs, such as intravenous (IV) cyclophosphamide (CYC).
      The objective of this Trial is to compare leflunomide (LEF) and azathioprine (AZA), in terms
      of efficacy and toxicity, as remission-maintaining treatment of proliferative lupus
      glomerulonephritis, after a remission-inducing therapy with a short-course IV CYC regimen.
      The hypothesis of this trial is that LEF is non-inferior to AZA.
