      prolapse with excellent outcome and low rates of recurrence. Compared to the similar vaginal
      sacropexy procedure a significant rate of postoperative constipation is reported. As the
      surgical technique is very similar for both procedures it could be possible that the exposure
      of the lower vaginal wall and placement and of the dorsal mesh and closer proximity to the
      colon in laparoscopic sacropexy might cause this. In this randomized controlled clinical
      trial we compare two different attachment sites for the dorsal mesh during laparoscopic
      sacropexy. One group is randomized for attachment in the middle of the dorsal wall of the
      vaginal stump and for the other group preparation and attachment for the dorsal mesh is
      performed deeper in the lower pelvis for an attachment at the distal part of the dorsal
      vaginal wall.

      Peri-operative data, intra- and postoperative complications and results of short-term
      (constipation) and long-term( recurrences rate) outcome are recorded.
