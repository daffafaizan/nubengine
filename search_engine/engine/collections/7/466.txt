3535. electron microscopic study of six cases of human renal amyloidosisthis study is particularly concernedwith  (a) the basal membrane in the differentstages; and (b) the intercapillary spacesin the early stages.  the conclusions maybe put as follows  (1) the amyloid substanceseems to have a fibrillar structurefrom the start.  (2) when the walls of theperipheral capillary loops are thickenedby voluminous amyloid deposits, thehyaline aspect of the primitive basal membranepersists, but its structure is altered bythe presence of multiple amyloid fibrils.(3) on the other hand, in the initial stages,amyloid fibrils cannot be seen in the'lamina densa' of the basal membrane; theyonly appear on the epithelial and endo-thelial surfaces of the membrane.  this suggeststhat amyloidosis represents anabnormal precipitate of extrinsic origin, ratherthan a transformation 'in situ'of the basal membrane.  (4) in the very early stagesof amyloid infiltration into theglomeruli the fibrillar substance is found first inthe intercapillary spaces, onlylater does it reach the peripheral capillary walls.
