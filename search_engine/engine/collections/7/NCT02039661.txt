      for endometrial sampling or women who will have control biopsies before surgery due to other
      pathologies. We have two groups; the first group consisted of patients who receive lidocaine
      spray. The second group consisted of patients who receive placebo spray. Patients will be
      asked to rate their pain level on a standard continuous 100-mm VAS to quantify the pain. Pain
      scoring will be performed at 3 different time points: immediately before to the procedure,
      during the procedure(immediately following the removal of the speculum from the vagina at the
      end of the endometrial sampling, the patients will be asked to score their pain level
      experienced during the procedure), and 15 minutes after the procedure.

      We will document the patients' demographics and medical information. All procedures will be
      performed by a single operator and the same team to avoid possible operator-dependent pain
      factors (counseling, patient preparation, attitude and operative steps during operation,
      moral and psychological support).
