      significant burden to society that is on the rise. Although many risk factors contribute to
      preterm birth, a short cervix is a well-established risk factor.The most common management
      for short cervix in Canada is vaginal progesterone, cervical cerclage, and hospital
      admission. Evidence suggests that vaginal progesterone and cervical cerclage improve
      outcomes, but there is very limited research on hospital admission or its efficacy. Due to
      the increased risk of preterm birth associated with cervical length ≤15 mm, some patients are
      admitted to hospital for observation even though labour is not imminent. The role of
      inpatient versus outpatient management is unclear and has not been explored. Hospital
      admission or modified activity has not been shown to improve pregnancy outcomes however, due
      to the increased risk of preterm birth, many women with short cervix are admitted for
      inpatient management.

      This project's objective is to examine whether inpatient or outpatient care results in
      similar pregnancy outcomes for women with short cervix.

      This is a multi-centre, non-inferiority randomized controlled trial in women with a singleton
      pregnancy and isolated short cervix (SC) (≤1.5cm by transvaginal scan (TVS)) at 23-28 weeks
      at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre (SHSC) and North York General Hospital (NYGH), in
      Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The intervention involves randomizing women to either inpatient or
      outpatient management and examining whether gestational age at delivery in women with SC
      (≤1.5cm by TVS) is comparable between arms. The investigators hypothesize that there will be
      no difference in the preterm birth rate and gestational age at delivery between the two
      groups.
