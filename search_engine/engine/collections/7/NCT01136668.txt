      Sick Children. A retrospective audit conducted at SickKids demonstrated significant
      intraoperative opioid use and significant requirements for rescue opioids in recovery.

      Concerns exist regarding the relative merits of opioid use in abdominal surgery. Opioids may
      decrease bowel motility leading to the increased incidence and duration of postoperative
      ileus. They may be associated with increased rates of post-operative nausea and vomiting and
      pruritus. Lastly children may under-report their pain or pain may not be recognized by
      medical staff leading to inadequate provision of analgesia. This suggests that the use of a
      regional technique may benefit children undergoing revision of ostomy.
