    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To compare the effect of prophylactic fentanyl buccal tablet (FBT), morphine sulfate, and
      placebo on the increase in the intensity of exertional dyspnea (0-10 point modified Borg
      scale) measured before versus at the end of a shuttle walk test (SWT).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the effects of prophylactic FBT, morphine sulfate, and placebo on SWT distance
      and dyspnea unpleasantness, average daily dyspnea (intensity and unpleasantness, oxygen cost
      diagram), personalized daily activity (ability to complete activity), personalized dyspnea
      response, symptom burden (Edmonton Symptom Assessment System [ESAS]), quality of life
      (EuroQol-5 Dimension-5 Level [EQ-5D-5L]), and dyspnea severity and functional impairment
      based on the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) dyspnea
      instruments.

      II. To explore the effects of prophylactic FBT, morphine sulfate, and placebo on
      neurocognitive function, addictive potential (Drug Effects Questionnaire), adverse effects
      (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE], Patient-Reported Outcomes version of
      CTCAE [PRO-CTCAE]), and pattern of opioid use.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 groups.

      GROUP I: Patients complete shuttle walk test on days 1, 5, 8, 12, 15, and 19. Patients also
      receive FBT sublingually daily on days 6-19.

      GROUP II: Patients complete shuttle walk test on days 1, 5, 8, 12, 15, and 19. Patients also
      receive morphine orally (PO) daily on days 6-19.

      GROUP III: Patients complete shuttle walk test on days 1, 5, 8, 12, 15, and 19. Patients also
      receive placebo (sublingually or PO) daily on days 6-19.
