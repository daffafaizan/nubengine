      patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. All patients will receive lenalidomide
      daily for days 1 to 21 of each 28 day cycle. Perifosine will be given daily qhs with food.
      Dexamethasone will be given on days 1-4, 9-12 and 17-20 for 4 cycles. After 4 cycles
      dexamethasone will be given only on days 1-4. Four dose levels will be studied:

        1. Perifosine 50 mg, lenalidomide 15 mg and dexamethasone 20 mg

        2. Perifosine 50 mg, lenalidomide 25 mg and dexamethasone 20 mg

        3. Perifosine 100 mg, lenalidomide 15 mg and dexamethasone 20 mg

        4. Perifosine 100 mg, lenalidomide 25 mg and dexamethasone 20 mg

      Six patients will be enrolled at each dose level until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is
      reached. Six additional patients will be treated at the MTD.
