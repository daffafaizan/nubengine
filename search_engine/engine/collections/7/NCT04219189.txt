      suppress appetite and increase resting metabolic rate, and also serves as a behavioral
      alternative to eating or a distraction from hunger or food craving. Data on the acute effect
      of e-cigarette use ('vaping') on ad libitum food intake are non-existent. Given that many
      e-cigarette users report vaping for weight control and that certain e-cigarettes are being
      actively marketed for weight management and/or suppression of food cravings, addressing this
      research gap is of the utmost importance.
