      or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer who have failed first-line therapy with a taxane
      when treated with T138067 sodium. II. Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxic
      effects of this drug in these patients. III. Determine the number of patients who progress
      when treated with this drug. IV. Determine the duration of response, time to disease
      progression, and median survival of patients treated with this drug. V. Correlate the toxic
      effects of this drug with peak plasma levels in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive T138067 sodium IV over 3 hours on days
      1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months after study completion.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-35 patients will be accrued for this study within 9 months.
