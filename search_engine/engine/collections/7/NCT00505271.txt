      Rexin-G using an adaptive trial design. Each treatment cycle will be six weeks: four weeks of
      treatment and two weeks of rest. Unlike a standard Phase I protocol, eligible patients may
      have repeat cycles after the safety data and objective tumor response/s are recorded.
      Continued Rexin-G treatment will enable the targeted nanomedicine to catch up with tumor
      growth, halt disease progression, and reduce tumor burden. The treatment strategy is to
      achieve tumor control as quickly as safely possible. The goal of the adaptive trial design is
      to confirm the over-all safety of Rexin-G and to determine the optimal dosing regimen for
      Rexin-G that would document the significant clinical benefits required to support a Phase II
      registration protocol for breast cancer.
