    
      Purpose:

      The aim of this study is to compare the clinical outcomes of the Standard CXL and the AC CXL
      in patients with progressive corneal ectasia post refractive surgery and penetrating
      keratoplasty.

      Setting:

      Menoufia University Hospital, Egypt

      Design:

      Prospective, randomised comparison.

      Methods:

      Patients scheduled to receive either Standard CXL (3mW/cm2 for a period of 30 min) or
      Accelerated CXL (18mW/cm2 for a period of 5 min).The main outcomes for comparison were the
      change in; Maximum-K reading (K-max), manifest refractive spherical equivalent (SE), central
      corneal thickness (CCT), and the best corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA).
