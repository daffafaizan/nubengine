      peri-implant contaminations during removal of syndesmotic screws should be compared and the
      clinical consequence of positive findings evaluated in follow up investigations up to 6
      months.

      Patients with ankle fractures (Weber B and C) treated operatively in our department by open
      reduction and internal fixation with plates and additional syndesmotic screw should be
      included. After patientsÂ´ informed consent, several microbiological samples should be taken
      for further microbiological analysis during the standard syndesmotic screw removal 6-8 weeks
      after the index surgery. At follow up of two weeks after screw removal a clinical examination
      and serological analysis for infection will be performed. The endpoint of study is fracture
      healing at six months.
