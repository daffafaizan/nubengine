    
      Secondary objectives include:

        -  Determine the intrinsic properties essential for the dissemination and chemoresistance
           of these cells capable of initiating tumors

        -  Identify a "molecular signature" for potential invasiveness and chemoresistance of cells
           initiating metastases.

        -  Describe the evolution of patients during 24 months of follow up and correlations with
           observed cellular profiles.

        -  Enrich the tumor bank of the institution.
