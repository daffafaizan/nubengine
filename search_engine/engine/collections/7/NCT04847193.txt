      Xanthohumol, Iso-alpha Acids or a combination of latter is given to the participants. A
      washout phase before intervention and between each intervention is introduced. On day one of
      each intervention blood is drawn in fasted state from each participant. Subsequently the
      study drink combined with a standardized breakfast is given to the participants following a
      second blood drawing one hour after the consumption of the study drink. On the last day of
      each intervention blood is taken from study participants in the same manner as on day one. To
      assess the effect of Xanthohumol and Iso-alpha acids or a combination of both, clinical
      chemical parameters e.g. ALT, AST, Î³-GT, blood lipids (triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL,
      LDL), blood glucose, uric acid and CRP are determined. Furthermore, PBMC's isolated from
      blood samples of each time point were stimulated for either 24 or 48 h. Protein levels and
      mRNA expression of markers of inflammation is measured in PBMC's and supernatant of
      stimulated cells.
