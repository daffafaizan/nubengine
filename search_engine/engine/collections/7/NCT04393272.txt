      (e.g. unwanted getting up in persons with risks for frequent falls) in several institutions
      in Europe and Switzerland. 3DS are capable to analyze completely anonymized data and alert
      nurses towards a dangerous (fall) or potentially dangerous (getting out of bed) event during
      day- and nighttime. Multi-sensor technology has been applied to assess activities of daily
      living in persons cognitive problems living at home. To our knowledge, 3DS technology has not
      been examined as part of a structured clinical protocol. In addition, the combination of two
      digital technologies (3DS and a server based software) as an integrative platform could help
      to develop algorithms to analyze complex human activities such as using a toilet. Automated
      analyses of such complex activities have the potential to support nursing staff in the
      future.
