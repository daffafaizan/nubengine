      contemplative-based and caregiver-inclusive intervention can modify pathogenic processes in
      systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Contemplative techniques such as meditation, mindfulness
      and yoga may have an impact on the disease burden and may decrease psychological distress,
      increase self-regulation capabilities, and reduce pain. Research also suggests that
      contemplative practices, such as an intensive mindfulness intervention, may have a direct
      effect on the underlying disease process itself by altering epigenetic control of gene
      expression, decreasing proinflammatory cytokine production and reestablishing immunologic
      homeostasis. It is also well documented that social relationships moderate physical health.
      Incorporating patients' caregivers may strengthen their relationships and thereby improve
      their health and well-being. It is anticipated that the successful outcome of the
      intervention described in this proposal will provide the basis for a new and effective
      contemplative-based and caregiver-inclusive therapy for SLE and other rheumatic diseases.
