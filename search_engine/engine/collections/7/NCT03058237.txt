    
      For Parts 1, 2 and 3, participants will attend the clinical unit for a screening visit up to
      28 days before dosing. For each treatment period, eligible subjects will be admitted to the
      clinical unit on the evening before dosing (Day -1). Participants will receive each regimen
      in the morning of Day 1 and will remain on site until 48 h post-dose. There will be a minimum
      washout period of 7 days between administration of each regimen. Where interim decisions
      occur, the interval between periods will be sufficient to permit the decision process.

      Arbaclofen Placarbil MR Prototype Tablets will be administered in Part 1 and one prototype
      will be selected for development in Part 2 where the release rate of modified release (MR)
      prototype formulations will be optimised using a design space concept (at a fixed low dose).

      A selected MR prototype formulation from Part 2 may be administered in Part 3 at up to 4
      different dose levels (low, mid-low, mid-high, high). The suggested doses in Part 3 may be
      modified based on emerging safety and PK data from Part 2 of the study.

      In Parts 2 and 3, there will be an option to dose selected Arbaclofen Placarbil MR Prototype
      Tablets in the fed state.
