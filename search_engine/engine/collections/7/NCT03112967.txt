      of liquid, has been used and now to a low-volume preparations because of its clear advantages
      in tolerability. The tolerability of bowel preparations is related to their volume, taste,
      and side effects, with this being a particular problem in the elderly. Meanwhile, a new oral
      sulfate solution (OSS, SUPREP, Braintree Laboratories, Braintree, Mass) formulation as an
      effective low-volume bowel cleansing agent, with a split-dose regimen was recently developed
      in 2009.

      Concerned about being able to better complete ingestion of bowel cleansing agent, OSS with
      lower volume and improved taste features, as long as it does not sacrifice safety, shuld be a
      better choice than PEG. Many studies have already looked at the efficacy and safety of OSS
      compared to PEG in average risk population, but there are no data available in solely at the
      elderly population. In this context, we hypothesized that OSS could be a good alternative to
      a standard 4L-PEG solution in elderly patients.

      In this report, we describe a multicenter, prospective, investigator-blind, randomized,
      controlled trial investigating OSS with 4L PEG for efficacy and safety in the elderly.
