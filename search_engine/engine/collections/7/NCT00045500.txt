        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of UCN-01 in combination with prednisone in
           patients with refractory solid tumors or lymphomas.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Assess the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Assess any tumor response in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of UCN-01.

      Patients receive oral prednisone daily on days 1-5 and UCN-01 IV over 36-72 hours on days
      3-5. Courses repeat every 28 days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of UCN-01 until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 3
      or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. At least 6 patients are treated at the
      recommended phase II dose.

      Patients are followed every 3-12 months for 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 24 patients will be accrued for this study within 18 months.
