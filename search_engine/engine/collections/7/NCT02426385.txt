      after implantation of the POD 26% FINEVISION TORIC with respect to the POD 26% TORIC This
      study includes both eyes of 24 patients implanted with the POD 26%FineVision Toric (group 1:
      12 patients) and the POD 26% Toric (group 2: 12 patients) .

      The study primary goal is to compare the near visual acuity in both groups. Distance and
      intermediate visual acuities, defocus curve, refraction and straylight will be compared.
