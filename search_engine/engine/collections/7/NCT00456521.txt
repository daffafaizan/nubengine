      been shown to result in nearly twice the average weight loss at one year (12.1 kg) as
      pharmacotherapy alone (sibutramine, 5.0 kg) or lifestyle modification counseling alone (6.7
      kg). Combining pharmacotherapy with a comprehensive program of diet, exercise and group
      lifestyle modification counseling may provide the best weight loss regimen. This study
      evaluated weight loss in subjects participating in such a comprehensive program who received
      a combination of naltrexone SR and bupropion SR, or placebo.
