    
      Aim:

      Develop an artificial intelligence based algorithm for unsupervised diagnostic and
      classification of childhood asthma exacerbation.

      Methodology: A Longitudinal prospective monocentric observational study will be performed in
      the Pediatric Emergency Division (PED) and the Pediatric Respiratory Unit (PRU) of the Geneva
      University Hospitals (HUG) during 24 months. This clinical study will include patients aged
      from 2 to16 years with acute asthma exacerbations. The intervention consists in recording
      auscultation of asthmatic patients at rest, during acute exacerbation and after treatment by
      bronchodilatators (Î²-2 agonists) inhalation in the PED, with a Digital Stethoscope (DS).
      Auscultation will be recorded during hospitalization every day, at home 7 days after the
      acute episode, combining intdoor and outdoor measures, and evaluating the exposome. A last
      record will be done at 6 to 8 weeks after the acute episode, with a lung function test if the
      patient is up to 7 years. A validation and training audio database will be constituted for
      the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms, allowing analysis of respiratory
      rate, inspiratory/expiratory time ratio, PRAM score, wheezing variation of intensity and
      unsupervised diagnosis.

      Expected results:

      Creation of a performant AI algorithm for unsupervised acute asthma exacerbation diagnosis,
      with > 70 % of Sensitivity and > 70% of Specificity compared to the expert. Response to
      treatment will improve patient empowerment and personalized medicine in childhood asthma
      management.
