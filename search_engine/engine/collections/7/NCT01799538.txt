      who have airflow obstruction respond to bronchodilators such as albuterol, a Beta2-adenergic
      receptor agonist, with an increase in forced expiratory flow in one second (FEV1) of 12% and
      200 ml above baseline values. Others however, have questioned these findings, reporting
      instead, a low rate of response of only six percent. Contrasting with our study, in this
      study albuterol was administered with a metered dose inhaler whereas in ours it was given by
      nebulizer. We propose to measure changes in lung function after administration of albuterol,
      respectively by metered inhaler and nebulizer, for 3 consecutive days in 100 LAM subjects.
      Our hypothesis is that albuterol administered by nebulization will produce a greater increase
      in FEV1 than two puffs of inhaled albuterol. If this hypothesis is confirmed, then we may
      recommend that patients with LAM and airflow obstruction use as a method of drug
      administration a nebulizer, rather than a metered dose inhaler.
