      required and recommended. The installation of an arterial catheter in intensive care is very
      frequent and subject to many complications. These complications are now well recognized in
      the literature, they are mainly vascular, infectious and thrombotic. They are directly
      influenced by the number of attempts to puncture and the time taken to perform the gesture.
      Many measures are taken to reduce the impact such as the choice of the site of installation,
      the strict aseptic techniques during the installation and the type of catheter used. However,
      despite these measures, it appears that the incidence of these complications remains high.
      Compared to anatomical marking, only the technique of laying the ultrasound-guided catheter
      has shown its effectiveness in reducing these complications. The management in intensive care
      of increasingly complicated, severe, elderly patients with significant comorbidities
      increases from year to year. To the knowledge of the investigator, there is no study on the
      impact of ultrasound arterial catheterization in patients in resuscitation.
