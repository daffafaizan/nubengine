    
      The standard program group will receive the TAU that comprises 5 monthly sessions of 30
      minutes that will include a personalized diet and physical exercise recommendations.

      The standard + intervention program group will receive the same TAU plus the acceptance and
      mindfulness-based group intervention program. The first ten sessions will be held weekly and
      the last five, biweekly. The duration of sessions will be 2 hours and will include a
      mindfulness practice, the session content (i.e. control as the problem, willingness, etc.),
      followed by a mindful eating practice to train the ability to pay attention to food and
      eating physical sensations. Finally, the session content will be briefly revised and
      practices for the week will be established.

      The following measurements will be evaluated at baseline prior to randomization, after the
      intervention, and seven months after the program has finished: anthropometric and body
      composition data, that is, weight and fat and muscle mass percentage (Bio-electrical
      Impedance Analysis, TANITA) and height (SECA 227); biochemical data in blood; waist
      circumference (Holtain inelastic tape); blood pressure; eating habits (24h recall and
      PREDIMED); level of physical exercise (IPAQ); general health (GHQ-28); emotional eating
      (DEBQ); quality-of-life (IWQOL-Lite); weight self-stigma (WSSQ); experiential avoidance
      (AAQ-II); self-compassion level (SCS) and mindfulness abilities (FFMQ).
