      regimen to improve the current and future health of pre-school children and infants.
      Praziquantel is cheap, highly efficacious and safe, presenting a realistic opportunity of
      using a pre-existing tool in a modified way to benefit child health and development. The
      study will focus on children aged 1 to 10 years of age, comparing the impact of single vs.
      double treatment with PZQ on the current and future health status of the children. The
      immediate health benefits of PZQ treatment in children aged 6-10 years of age have already
      been documented and therefore by including 6-10 year olds in the proposed study, we can
      determine if the effects of PZQ treatment on health and morbidity measures is age dependent.
      By killing worms PZQ stops the morbidity related to the presence of worms and eggs such as
      anaemia, abdominal pain, diarrhoea and blood in the urine. Therefore the study will
      investigate the immediate health benefits of treating pre-school children and infants.
