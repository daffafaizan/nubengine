      health care systems. Falls account for 50% of injury-related admissions to hospital, 40% of
      admissions to nursing homes, and a 10% increase in home care services. They are also the
      leading cause of fatal injury among Canadians over 65 years old. This represents a
      significant health burden. Fortunately, falls are preventable. There is strong evidence that
      the Otago Exercise Program (OEP), physiotherapist (PT)-led home-based exercise program of
      strength and balance training, is effective at preventing falls in older adults with complex
      medical conditions. Originally developed in New Zealand the OEP has been implemented
      worldwide, but adherence to the program is a challenge. We propose that the suboptimal
      adherence is partly due to a lack of focus on behaviour change techniques such as
      self-monitoring and action planning in the delivery of OEP.

      The investigators will use a mixed-methods approach, involving a RCT and in-depth interviews.
      The delivery of OEP+ vs OEP, from PTs, and its recipients, the older adults, will be
      determined at random. The training for the PT's will be provided by the Centre for
      Collaboration Motivation & Innovation (CCMI), a non-profit organization with a mandate to
      support the use of behaviour change techniques to improve health care. Prior to data
      collection, the PTs will attend a 2-hour workshop on the coaching protocol using the OEP app.

      The goal of this project is to assess OEP+ as an implementation strategy to improve OEP
      delivery (by PTs) and adherence (by older adults).
