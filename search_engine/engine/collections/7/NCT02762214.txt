    
      This multicentric prospective randomized Phase III trial is aimed to verify if the use of
      uterine manipulator for laparoscopic/robotic treatment of early stage endometrial cancer can
      influence the impact of peritoneal cytology and lymph vascular space invasion (LVSI) and the
      outcomes in terms of perioperative and oncological (disease free survival - DFS, overall
      survival - OS) outcomes.
