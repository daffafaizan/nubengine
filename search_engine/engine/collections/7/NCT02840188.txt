      goalkeeper's fracture" in the literature. While catching the soccer ball the child suffers a
      distal forearm fracture due to axial forces to the immature bone of the child. These
      goalkeeper's fractures on radiographs may be subtle or difficult to discriminate from normal
      radiographs.

      Retrospective study for the evaluation of radiographs of the forearm from 2005 - 2016 of
      children with history of catching a ball. Two radiologist are blinded for history, age, name
      and findings on final reports.

      First reading without measurement of distal tilt angle, second reading with measurement of
      distal tilt angle and after consensus meeting.

      Questionnaire: prospectively all patients with goalkeeper's fracture will answer a
      questionnaire concerning circumstances and risks during the accident.
