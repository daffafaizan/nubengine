      respiratory therapist driven protocol for post-extubation respiratory support to usual care.
      The primary outcome will be reintubation by 96 hours. All adults (age 18 or older) who
      receive at least 12 hours of mechanical ventilation and are extubated in the Vanderbilt
      Medical ICU will be enrolled in the trial. The ICU will be divided into 2 clusters, based on
      the geographic areas covered by the two respiratory therapist dedicated to that ICU. The
      study will occur in three month blocks. One cluster will be randomized to receive
      protocolized post-extubation respiratory support (as prescribed by a protocol and delivered
      by a respiratory therapist), while the other cluster receives usual care, which can include
      post-extubation respiratory support when requested by the clinical team. At the end of three
      months, the clusters will cross-over, such that each cluster will spend half of the study
      receiving protocolized post-extubation respiratory and half of the study receiving usual
      care. It is anticipated that approximately 630 patients will be enrolled from the medical ICU
      during the 18 month study period.
