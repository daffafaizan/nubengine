      of treatment are currently used:

      Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Percutaneous Interventions (PCIs) i.e: balloon
      angioplasty and stents[ bare metal (BMS) and drug eluting (DES)].

      CABG is a major operation but is considered to be safe and with good quality of life in the
      years to follow. The initial cost of CABG is high but usually stays low thereafter.

      PCI is less invasive but its downfall is a high rate of restenosis hence leading to the
      return of angina. The initial cost is low but due to the return of symptoms the cost
      increases.

      The goal of DES is to lower the rate of restenosis thus reducing the need for repeat
      hospitalizations and procedures. The initial cost of this stent is higher than that of the
      BMS but still lower than that of CABG.

      The goal of this study is to assess and compare the average annual cost of treatment for
      patients with multi-vessel disease who underwent one of the following procedures:

        1. CABG

        2. DES

        3. BMS

      The information for the study is derived from the data bases of the cardiology and
      cardio-thoracic surgery departments at Shaarey-Zedek hospital and from those of Clalit Health
      Services and Kupat Holim Meuhedet.

      The study design is historical prospective. The participants are insured by the above
      mentioned HMOs and were treated during 2000-2004.

      The final sample's size will be decided on according to a pilot study with 15 patients from
      each of the treatment groups.

      To our knowledge no studies comparing CABG and DES have yet been published. We believe that
      our study could become a mile stone in the process of choosing the most suitable treatment
      for the patient and for the health system.
