      All participants were administered the first dose of blinded study drug at the site following
      randomization and provided with web-based applications that provided supplemental cognitive
      training and recorded treatment compliance. Participants returned to the clinic weekly for
      safety, efficacy, and/or pharmacokinetic procedures. Participants continued the participant's
      antipsychotic treatment for the entire study and were followed for 14 days after the
      participant's last dose of study drug.
