      imbalances (high levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH), bone disease, formation of calcium
      deposits in the body, and blood-vessel disease).

      Current guidelines indicate that blood phosphorus levels should be maintained between 1.13 to
      1.78 mmol/L in patients who receive hemodialysis.

      This study is designed to investigate magnesium iron hydroxycarbonate's ability to lower and
      control patients' blood phosphate to the recommended levels and compare the average blood
      phosphate, calcium, calcium-phosphate product, PTH and magnesium concentrations and overall
      safety with placebo (or "dummy") tablets.
