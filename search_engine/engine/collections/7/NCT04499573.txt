        -  To investigate the incidence of adverse events of grade 3-5 within after CD19/CD22 CAR
           lymphocyte infusion by day 28,

        -  To evaluate the incidence of complete remission and MRD-negative CR by day 28

        -  To evaluate the long-term effectiveness of CD19/CD22 CAR-T therapy (cumulative incidence
           of relapse, event-free survival, overall survival) at 1, 2, and 5 years after infusion.

        -  To evaluate the persistence of CD19/CD22 CAR-T cells and duration of B-cell aplasia (<1%
           B-cells in the blood) and hypogammaglobulinemia In order to prevent the development of
           CRS, all patients will receive an infusion of tocilizumab at 8 mg/kg body weight on day
           0 before CAR-T cells infusion.

      Step-down and step-up dosing will be used to adapt the trial to the scenario of excess
      toxicity and/or suboptimal effect. Reevaluation of dosing will be done for each cohort
      separately after the enrollment 5th study subject reaches day 28 or earlier if the threshold
      for excess toxicity or suboptimal effect is achieved.

      Based on interim analysis in March 2021 after the enrollment 5th study subject reaches day 28
      study population will be divided into three cohorts:

        1. CD19-positive (both CD19 and CD22 expressed on over 50% of leukemia cells), low and high
           disease burden.

        2. CD19-negative (CD22 expressed on over 50% of leukemia cells) low and high disease
           burden;

        3. Allogeneic HSCT+ allogeneic CAR-T cohort
