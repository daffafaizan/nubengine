      retrospective study with existing serum values of vitamin B12 and holotranscobalamin 4
      strategies are simulated and the results and costs are compared.

      A cobalamin deficiency can have various causes: Dietary habits (vegetarian, vegan), advanced
      age, pernicious anaemia, gastrectomy, drug interactions (metformin, proton pump blocker).
      Therapy is often performed by intramuscular administration of cobalamin. However, oral
      preparations are also available in very different dosages. Investigators want to investigate
      with focus groups whether different patient groups are aware of a (potential) deficiency, how
      cobalamin is actually substituted (with registered or otherwise acquired products) and which
      therapy would lead to best adherence.
