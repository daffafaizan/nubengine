      research has been published on the relationship of job strain and the risk of cardiovascular
      disease. HTN can be caused by sympathoadrenal activation brought on by long-term exposure to
      stressors and an inherent biomarker that is associated with an increased risk of
      cardiovascular disease.

      The primary purpose of this study is to quantify differences in HTN prevalence, awareness and
      management in three distinctly different areas and shifts within an acute hospital. Blood
      pressure (BP) will be taken during working hours along with pre and post sleep hours. The
      secondary purpose is to identify the effect of shift work within an acute care hospital and
      effectiveness of: BP monitoring, increases in physical activity, positive nutritional
      changes, and the correlation between a primary care provider visits and lowering BP.
