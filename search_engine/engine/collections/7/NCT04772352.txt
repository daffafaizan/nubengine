      disease. NAFLD accounts for 49.3% of the total number of chronic liver disease patients in
      China. It is important to effectively prevent and control NAFLD and its related diseases.

      Previous studies show the level of serum uric acid is significantly elevated in patients with
      NAFLD. In a large cross-sectional study, the researcher were the first to confirm that serum
      uric acid level was significantly increased in patients with NAFLD. The results were
      published in J Hepatol. Xanthine oxidase is a key enzyme in uric acid metabolism. It is a new
      therapeutic target for NAFLD.

      This study is aimed to further confirm that hyperuricemia is a new risk factor for NAFLD
      through a large sample prospective study. Furthermore, this study explore whether Xanthine
      oxidase (XO), a key enzyme in uric acid metabolism, plays an important role in regulating
      NAFLD.
