      production of inflammatory mediators. Studies also suggest that COX inhibitors attenuate
      increases in corticosterone and eicosanoid levels after endotoxin injection. COX inhibitors
      also appear to have anticancer effects, inhibiting angiogenesis, tumor growth, and metastatic
      burden. These results suggest a role for IV ibuprofen in preventing untoward inflammatory
      responses, shortening post-surgical convalescence, improving patient satisfaction, and
      reducing the rate of complications occurring during the recovery from surgery. However, there
      are no studies that have evaluated the relationship between administration of IV ibuprofen,
      ensuing immunomodulation, and long-term outcomes.

      Study Objective. The aim of the proposed study is to examine the effect of intravenous(IV)
      ibuprofen on the inflammatory response in major surgery. More importantly, the investigators
      will correlate changes in the concentration of inflammatory mediators with meaningful
      clinical outcomes.
