      treated by replacing the pathological tissue with autologous chondrocyte-laden biphasic
      cylindrical plug of DL-poly-lactide-co-glycolide, with its lower body impregnated with
      -tricalcium phosphate as the osseous phase. The osteochondral lesion was drilled to fashion a
      pit of identical size and shape as the plug. The chondrocyte-laden plug was press-fit to fill
      the pit. Outcome of repair was examined by KOOS scale at 3, 6 and 12 months postoperatively,
      and tissue sample was collected with second-look arthroscopic needle-biopsy at 12 months. The
      primary outcome parameter was the postoperative change of KOOS; and the secondary outcome
      parameter was the regeneration of cancellous bone and hyaline cartilage at the repair site.
