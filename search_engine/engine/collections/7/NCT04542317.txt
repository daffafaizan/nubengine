      the efficacy of a psychosocial intervention to support Alzheimer's family caregivers in
      Vietnam. The cluster RCT will test the hypothesis that family caregivers who receive the
      intervention will show lower psychological distress and lower caregiver burden compared with
      those in the control group (primary outcomes). In addition, we will conduct secondary
      analyses to examine whether the intervention group has lower perceived stress and somatic
      symptoms. Exploratory analyses will be conducted to determine if intervention effects are
      mediated by caregiver self-efficacy or knowledge gain.
