      pediatric participants with nondialysis-dependent CKD. Study AMAG-FER-CKD-251 (NCT01155375)
      was a study evaluating the efficacy and safety of IV ferumoxytol in pediatric participants
      with dialysis-dependent CKD. Due to significant challenges with enrollment for both studies,
      Study AMAG-FER-CKD-252 was combined with Study AMAG-FER-CKD-251 and enrollment continued
      under Study AMAG-FER-CKD-251. The enrollment number (n=14) includes the number of
      participants for both AMAG-FER-CKD-251 and AMAG-FER-CKD-252 studies, combined.

      Participants were enrolled by age cohorts in a stepwise manner following a safety review by
      the Data Safety Monitoring Board of 1 age cohort prior to enrollment of a subsequent age
      cohort, with progression from oldest to youngest. Randomization was stratified by the
      following age cohorts: 12 to <18 years, 6 to <12 years, 2 to <6 years, and 6 months to <2
      years.
