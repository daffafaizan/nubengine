      arthroscopic bankart repair is up to 30%. The most important dynamic structure that prevents
      re-dislocation is the rotator cuff muscles. The aim of our study is to investigate the
      efficacy of contralateral training on patients with arthroscopic Bankart surgery. Patients
      with arthroscopic Bankart surgery will be included in the study. The patients will be
      randomly assigned into 3 groups and the first group will be the control group, the second
      group will be the concentric group and the third group will be the eccentric group. Standard
      rehabilitation program will be applied to all groups until 3 months after surgery. Between
      2nd and 12nd weeks after surgery, concentric strengthening program will be applied to the
      rotator cuff muscles with isokinetic dynamometer to the 2nd group. In group 3, the eccentric
      strengthening program will be applied to the rotator sheath muscles with the same isokinetic
      dynamometer from the 2nd week until 12nd week .

      The strength of the rotator sheath muscles will be measured in pre-op period, post-op week 12
      and post-op month 6 with the isokinetic dynamometer in all patients. In addition, functional
      tests will be performed in pre-op period and post-op 6 months (Y balance test for upper
      extremity, Closed Kinetic Chain Upper Extremity Stability Test and Medicine Ball Throw Test).
