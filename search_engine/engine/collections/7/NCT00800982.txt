      total of 12 weeks. In Phase II, all subjects will receive etanercept's maintenance dose, 50
      mg once a week, during Weeks 12-24. Those subjects randomized to the treatment arm will
      receive NB-UVB phototherapy 3 times a week during Phase II. In order to ensure homogeneity
      between the NB-UVB arm and non-NB-UVB arm, subjects will be randomized according to their
      Body Mass Index (BMI). The Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) score and Physician Global
      Assessment (PGA) will be calculated at each visit to determine the effectiveness of the
      etanercept and NB-UVB treatment during both phases of the study. The hypothesis is that the
      combination of NB-UVB phototherapy three times a week and etanercept maintenance dose (50 mg
      once a week) will enhance the efficacy of the maintenance dose alone in obese patients (BMI
      >30) with moderate to severe psoriasis.
