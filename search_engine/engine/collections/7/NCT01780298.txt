    
      At the screening visit, subject consent will be obtained prior to conducting any study
      related procedures. Informed consent may be obtained on registration/review visit at the
      Centre where it is conducted and thus prior to visit 1.

      The screening visit will involve obtaining demographic data and medical history information
      as well as performing safety assessments such as vital sign measurements, electrocardiogram
      (ECG), and clinical laboratory tests. An induced sputum sample will be obtained to ensure
      that subjects can produce an adequate sputum sample. Smokers will receive information on
      smoking cessation at the screening visit and follow-up telephone call.

      Subjects will come back to the center on up to four further occasions if they meet the
      inclusion/exclusion criteria at screening:

        -  visit 2: 4 to 21 days after screening,

        -  visit 3: 3-14 days post visit 2, and

        -  visit 4: 3-14 days post visit 3.

      A follow-up telephone call will be conducted 3-10 days post visit 4.
