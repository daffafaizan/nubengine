      strategy of motivational interviewing among patients with diabetic foot ulcers.

      A randomized controlled trial design will be used. From August 2020 to July 2022, 132
      patients hospitalized for diabetic foot ulcers will be recruited. They will be randomly
      assigned to either the experimental or the comparison group in the first year, and then they
      will be followed by one year. The control group will receive routine care; the experimental
      group will receive a discharge planning which use the strategy of motivational interviewing.
      The discharge planning will be provided individually at the following time points: before
      discharge, on post-discharge days 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, and then each month till one year.
      Outcome measures include diabetic foot ulcer self-care behaviors and self-efficacy, foot skin
      conditions, glycemic control (measured by HbA1C), the infection rate of foot, and the
      readmission rate. Data will be collected at baseline and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after
      discharge.

      The generalized estimating equation (GEE) will be used to evaluate the effect of the
      intervention on the diabetic foot ulcer self-care behaviors and self-efficacy, foot skin
      conditions, and the effect on glycated hemoglobin value reduction. The log-rank test will be
      used to compare the infection rate of foot, and the readmission rate between two groups.
