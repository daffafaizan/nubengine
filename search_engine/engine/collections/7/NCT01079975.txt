      considered to be one of the most common cause of neurological disability in young adults. The
      clinical and pathophysiological characteristics of the disease lead to the association of
      several conditions over time, among which the depression and/or the depression symptoms are
      one of the most important ones. The underlying mechanism of depression is not clear and the
      etiology of depression is considered to be multifactorial and especially associated to the
      psychosocial stress, to the presence of focal demyelinating lesions and to the immune
      malfunction. Several scales like Beck Depression Inventory Fast Screen (BDI FS), Mini Mental
      State Examination (MMSE), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) have been used to objectify
      the presence of depression symptoms in subjects with MS.

      OBJECTIVES

      Primary objective:

        -  Identification of the predictive factors for the development of depression symptoms in
           subjects with MS in Argentina

      Secondary objective:

        -  Evaluation of the proportion of subjects that develop depression symptoms during the
           follow up

      The subjects will be managed with the clinical and therapeutic elements that the treating
      doctors considered appropriate, without modifying their decisions due to the subjects'
      inclusion into the study.
