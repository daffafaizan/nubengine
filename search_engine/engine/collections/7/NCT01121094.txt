      study will be offered to mothers undergoing fetal MRI for any indication. Subjects will be
      required to sign an informed consent from. The addition of T2* sequences will add 2-4 minutes
      to the whole scan, not exposing the mother or the fetus to ionizing radiation or the
      administration of contrast material. A standardized scale has been created and multi-center
      studies have been conducted using different vendor scanners in order to verify the
      consistency of these scale. T2 and T2* sequences have been addressed anecdotally in the
      literature as non invasive options for the evaluation fetal iron deposition . However, a
      standardized scale of T2* values for fetal and neonatal iron organ overload have yet to be
      reported or devised.
