      Secondary objectives:

      To explore the effect of inhaled OligoG on various efficacy variables such as lung function,
      Quality-of-Life, rheology and other microbiological outcome measures.

      To evaluate the safety, tolerability and subject compliance with treatment The study will
      also evaluate the effect of inhaled OligoG on various efficacy variables such as lung
      function, Quality-of-Life, rheology and other microbiological outcome measures, and evaluate
      the safety and patient compliance with treatment.
