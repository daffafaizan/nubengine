      dysfunction and impaired myocardial reperfusion following successful PCI for non ST-elevation
      MI, and that endothelin receptor antagonism will improve microvascular flow. The study will
      provide new insight into the humoral regulation of the microcirculation in patients
      presenting with acute coronary syndromes.

      General methods: This section describes our approach to investigating the specific aims. The
      study is a prospective, double blind, placebo-controlled trial to assess the efficacy of a
      selective endothelin type A receptor antagonist (BQ-123), as adjunctive therapy for PCI for
      non ST elevation MI. The control group will receive placebo rather than another vasodilator
      in order to specifically elucidate the role of the endogenous endothelin system.
