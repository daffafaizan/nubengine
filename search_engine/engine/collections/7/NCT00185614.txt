      peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) collection by apheresis. Transplant conditioning is
      high-dose melphalan 200 mg/m2, followed by PBPC infusion as melphalan rescue [ie, autologous
      hematopoietic cells transplant (auto-HCT)]. Post-infusion support includes filgrastim 5
      µg/kg/day, starting 6 days following melphalan. Participants with stable or responsive
      disease at 4 weeks eligible to continue on to the planned allogenic HCT (allo-HCT). For
      allo-HCT, a sibling donor that is fully matched for human leukocyte antigen (HLA-matched) is
      identified. Participants receive a single dose of total body irradiation (TBI) 200 centigray
      (cGy) as well as immunosuppression with cyclosporine (CSP) 6.25 mg/kg and mycophenolate
      mofetil (MMF) 15 mg/kg. The HLA-matched donor begins filgrastim injections 16 µg/kg/day on
      day -4 continuing to Day 0, with apheresis collections on Day -1 and Day 0, to a target of >
      5 x 10e6 CD34 cells/kg. Allo-HCT is infused to participant on Day 0, with premedication
      hydrocortisone 100 mg IV and diphenhydramine 50 mg IV. CSP will be tapered beginning Day 56
      with a goal of discontinuing CSP on Day 180, adjusted as needed.
