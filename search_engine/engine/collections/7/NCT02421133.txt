      program, involving a dedicated advanced practice nurse, will include: 1) during the patient's
      stay in hospital: an individualized needs-based comprehensive discharge plan and a
      transitional care record ; the notification of the primary care physician about inpatient
      care and hospital discharge; 2) the day of the discharge: specific explanations about the
      organization of home care provided by the transition care nurse to the patient; 3) during 4
      weeks after discharge: monitoring patients and caregivers regularly through home visits
      and/or telephone contact,
