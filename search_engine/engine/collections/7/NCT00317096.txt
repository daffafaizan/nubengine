    
      Patients with relapsed centroblastic/centrocytic (FL), centrocytic (MCL)or lymphoplasmacytoid
      lymphoma are randomly assigned to either FCM chemotherapy alone or to FCM chemotherapy in
      combination with the monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody rituximab (R-FCM). FCM chemotherapy will
      be given for 4 cycles in intervals of 4 weeks.

      In patients assigned to cytoreductive therapy with FCM plus rituximab, the monoclonal
      antibody is given as one infusion (375 mg/m2) on the day before the respective FCM course for
      a total of four applications.

      Four weeks after the end of FCM chemotherapy patients with CR or PR are randomly assigned to
      either no further treatment or maintenance therapy with rituximab. Rituximab will be given 4
      times (one infusion per week with 375 mg/m2). After six months rituximab treatment will be
      repeated with another 4 infusions.

      In case of relapse patients will receive an alternative treatment according to the decision
      of the investigator.

      The aim of this phase III trial is to assess the safety and efficacy of treatment with
      rituximab in combination with FCM chemotherapy versus FCM chemotherapy alone for remission
      induction and to asses the safety and efficacy of rituximab maintenance versus observation
      only after response to induction therapy. Both questions are addressed in way of a
      prospective randomized comparison in patients with relapsed FCL, MCL and LP lymphoma.

      Primary objectives of this trial are to compare (1) the remission rates (CR and PR) achieved
      after FCM plus rituximab versus FCM alone and (2) the progression free interval of rituximab
      maintenance versus observation only.
