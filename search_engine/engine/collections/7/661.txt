problems of disease ofparathyroid glandsif biochemical tests indicate unequivocallythat there is a functioning parathyroid tumour,usually an adenoma, its removal will relievesymptoms and prevent any further damage toorgans such as the kidneys.  in 80 per cent,of such cases the operation is not particularlydifficult to anyone with experience of thyroidsurgery.  the tumour is seldom of great size,usually less than half an inch in diameter, buta careful search in the expected position, inclose apposition to the posterior surface of thethyroid lobes, will usually reveal it.  suchadenomata are usually more brown in colourthan the normal yellow gland; but in some 20per cent, of cases one or more of the glandsmay be aberrant, or possibly absent, and super-numerary glands may be present.  it is usuallyone of the lower pair of glands which occupiesan ectopic position and, as i explained in theoutline of the embryological development, itmay accompany the thymus into the mediasti-num, rather a vast area in which to seek a smalltumour.  such an exploration cannot be lightlyundertaken, but if the evidence is indisputablethe burden must be shouldered.  it is correctpolicy, i believe, first to carry out a thoroughexploration of the neck, and if this proves un-availing, to inspect the mediastinum through asternum-splitting incision some two weeks later,rather than completing this major undertakingat one session.
