    
      Objectives:

        1. To identify Measles IgG titre in SARS-COV2 infected patients .

        2. correlate level of Measles IgG titre with the clinical severity of COVID-19 disease.

      Secondary Objective To find an association of the postulated protective role of measles
      vaccine and SARS-COV2 infection

      Criteria:

      Inclusion criteria:included patients would be divided into 3 groups according to clinical
      severity of COVID-19 disease (mild ,moderate & severe)

        -  All patients with confirmed COVID 19 confirmed by positive PCR . .

        -  Any age or gender.

      Exclusion criteria:

      - Any patient refusing to be involved in the study.

      Methods:

        -  Informed consent will be taken from each subject

        -  Full clinical examination.

        -  Evaluation of Measles Antibody Titer:

      The measles virus IgG antibody titer will be determined quantitatively by ELISA for
      quantitative determination of IgG class antibodies against Measles virus in human serum or
      plasma (citrate, heparin).

      - Anonymous data will be retrieved from the admitted patients' files, such as:

        -  CBC, CRP, AST, ALT, ESR, Serum ferritin & SARS CoV 2 RNA PCR swab results.

        -  Chest X ray and/or CT chest.
