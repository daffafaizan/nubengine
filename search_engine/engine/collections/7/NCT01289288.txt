      culturally-tailored in-office based intervention on physicians. A total of 24 Chinese
      physicians in the Washington DC and Philadelphia areas and a total of 24 eligible Chinese
      patients from each physician will be recruited for this study. Physicians and their patients
      are randomized into two groups: A and B. Physician in the intervention group (A) will receive
      mailed printed materials including a CRC physician guide, patient brochure, flip chart and a
      poster and two sessions of in-office training aimed to reinforce learning of the topic
      covered by the mailed materials and provide physicians with hands-on experience in using
      communication skills with standardized patients. Physicians in the control group (B) will
      receive nothing until the end of the study. Patients will be followed 12-month later after
      their completion of the baseline survey and their self-reported CRC screening status will be
      verified by chart audit.
