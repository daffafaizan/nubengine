      and efficacy of Culotte stenting versus "Double Kissing" - Crush (DK-Crush) stenting in the
      treatment of the de-novo non-left main coronary bifurcation lesions with new generation
      everolimus-eluting stents.

      Study hypothesis In large coronary bifurcation lesions (main vessel ≥2.5mm, side branch
      ≥2.25mm) including significant ostial side branch disease, Culotte stenting compared with
      DKcrush stenting reduces maximal percent diameter stenosis at the bifurcation at 9-month
      follow-up by 25 %, relative.

      Study design Prospective, randomized, European multicenter study.

      Methods Four-hundred patients, in whom a double-stenting technique is intended for the
      treatment of a non-left main de-novo coronary bifurcation lesion will be randomly assigned to
      Culotte stenting or to DK-crush stenting with an approved drug-eluting stent (SYNERGY-Stent).
      As a part of usual care, patients will undergo 9-month angiographic follow-up with
      quantitative coronary angiography. Clinical follow-up is planned at 30 days, 6 months, 1 year
      and 2 years.
