      also the quality of life of patients. In 2017, the International DE Study Workshop (DEWSII)
      adjusted the definition of DE by particularly emphasizing the inflammation in the ocular
      surface, and this adjustment represented a major shift in the understanding of dry eye
      disease (DED) pathogenesis and the facilitation of DED treatment.1,2 The recurrence of
      chronic and low-grade inflammation plays an important role in long-term disease progression
      and gradually deteriorates the ocular surface.3 Previous studies have concluded that the
      inflammatory response is involved in the pathological process of DE.4-7 The concentrations of
      IL-1α and mature IL-1ß in the tear fluid are increased.4,5 The activity of MMP-9, a suggested
      biomarker associated with ocular surface diseases including DE, is significantly elevated in
      Meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD), Sjögren's syndrome (SS) and aqueous tear deficiency
      (ATD).6 Other studies have indicated that inflammatory mediators such as IL-6, IL-8 and TNFα
      are expressed proportionally to the severity of DE symptoms, indicating the involvement of
      inflammation.7 The identification of inflammation as a major factor in DE informs the
      treatment strategy, including anti-inflammatory medication, which results in improvements to
      the ocular surface condition and to ocular comfort in DED patients.8,9 A series of studies
      have demonstrated improvements in the subjective and objective signs and symptoms of DE after
      anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory therapies.8-11 To monitor the status of ocular surface
      inflammation and the ocular surface condition, traditional assessments, namely, evaluation of
      conjunctival hyperemia12 and corneal fluorescein staining using a slit lamp biomicroscope,
      are used. However, these methods are subjective and volatile and may not be sensitive
      indicators of the disease stage and treatment efficacy.13 A number of new tests have been
      used to distinguish inflammation.13-15 These new technologies include corneal confocal
      microscopy,15 conjunctival impression cytology16 and inflammatory tear-film cytokine tests in
      research and in the clinic.17 These newly implemented techniques have several limitations.
      Corneal confocal microscopy is a structure-based instrument with a narrow view of 400 × 400
      µm2 that is limited to localization and cell counting. Conjunctival impression cytology16 and
      inflammatory tear-film cytokine tests19 are not routinely used, possibly due to the
      invasiveness, high cost and discomfort of these techniques.5,18 Therefore, the development of
      new methodologies to noninvasively and subjectively evaluate the inflammation status of the
      ocular surface is crucial.

      The microvascular system of the bulbar conjunctiva can be easily accessed. The release of
      inflammatory cytokines on the ocular surface can cause vasodilation, which may result in
      alterations to the conjunctival microcirculation.19 Cheung et al. used a computer-assisted
      intravital microscope to evaluate vasculopathies of the conjunctival vessels and identified
      microvascular abnormalities in patients with diabetes20 and in patients who wore contact
      lens.21 Schulze et al. have also performed 'evaluations of the redness of the bulbar
      conjunctiva using fractal analysis and photometry.22 However, these studies did not directly
      measure the microcirculation. The microcirculation is an important aspect of the vascular
      system, may directly represent the hemodynamic response to ocular surface inflammation and
      may exhibit more sensitivity for monitoring vascular responses to anti-inflammatory
      treatment. Recently, Jiang et al. developed a functional slit-lamp biomicroscope that could
      be used to measure the conjunctival blood flow velocity (BFV) and vessel diameter.23 The goal
      of the present study was to characterize the microvasculature and microcirculation in the
      bulbar conjunctiva of DE patients in response to anti-inflammatory treatment.
