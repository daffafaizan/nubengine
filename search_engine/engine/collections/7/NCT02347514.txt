    
      Community health centers across the US are seeking to address the growing prevalence of
      diabetes in adults. The University of Chicago has partnered with the MidWest Clinicians'
      Network (MWCN) to conduct a research study to train community health center staff and
      providers to implement and sustain diabetes group visits, also referred to as shared medical
      appointments, at their health center. The study's aims are to: 1) Develop, conduct, and
      evaluate a training program for health center staff to implement a diabetes group visit
      intervention in their health center; 2) Assess the implementation of diabetes group visits in
      the community health center setting and determine the cost of implementation; 3) Assess the
      feasibility and cost of implementing a text-messaging intervention in addition to the
      implementation of diabetes group visits in the CHC setting at one health center and 4) Assess
      the impact of the diabetes group visits alone and diabetes group visits plus text-messaging
      on diabetes process measures, patient outcomes, and patient satisfaction compared to control
      patients from the same health center with six months of follow-up once the six-month group
      visit program ends.

      The MWCN Research Committee is looking for six community health center (CHC) teams comprised
      of three to four members to participate in the study. The study will last 18 months and will
      require study participants to complete the following activities as part of the study:

        -  Attend two mandatory learning sessions in Chicago in the spring and fall of 2015 that
           will each last two days (Friday and Saturday all day, 9am-5pm)

        -  Participate in a mandatory third learning session conducted through a series of 4 or 5
           weekly webinars in the spring of 2016

        -  Participate in monthly conference calls and/or webinars intended for tracking progress,
           trouble-shooting obstacles encountered, and further training in the months between each
           learning session

        -  Complete a training in the protection of human subjects in research

        -  Implement a monthly diabetes group visit intervention for at least six months at their
           health center

        -  Recruit 15 health center patients with diabetes who might benefit from participating in
           diabetes group visits to enroll in the program

        -  Complete four surveys (20-60 minutes each), one brief evaluation (10-15 minutes),
           monthly time and expense logs, and one telephone interview (25-40 minutes) between
           February 2015 and May 2016

        -  Collect patient data through survey administration at two time-points for patients who
           attend at least one group visit session and through telephone interviews for 1) patients
           who said they would enroll in the group visit program but who did not attend at least
           one session and 2) patients who attended less than four group visit sessions

        -  Collect patient data through EMR / chart abstraction for up to 15 patients who enroll in
           the group visit program at three study time points over the course of a year from
           mid-2015 to mid-2016 and for up to 30 patients who do not participate in the group visit
           program and who will serve as control patients for the study.at one point in mid-2016.

      The learning sessions will include various module topics that have been developed based on a
      review of the current literature of diabetes group visit interventions, preliminary research
      done through site visits to CHCs with diabetes group visit experience, and input from the
      MWCN Research Committee. The learning sessions will also provide the opportunity for each
      health center to share their own unique experiences and to learn from other health centers'
      experiences.

      The first learning session will provide an overview of the benefits of group visits, "best
      practices" for implementing a diabetes group visit program in a health center, the barriers
      and challenges that may arise in implementing diabetes group visits, strategies to overcome
      these barriers, and factors that facilitate the implementation of group visits and affect
      their sustainability. During the first learning session, participating health centers will
      also have some time to develop a detailed plan for the implementation of a group visit
      program at their center. In addition, they will learn how to evaluate the implementation of
      their program and the impact of their program on patient outcomes. Each team will also be
      given a patient curriculum guide which they can tailor to the needs of their patient
      population and use to implement the diabetes group visit program in their health center. The
      health center selected to implement the text-messaging intervention in addition to the group
      visit intervention will be asked to attend additional training modules relating to the
      implementation of the text-messaging intervention.

      During the six months following the first learning session, each health center will implement
      their individualized program implementation plan, using rapid "Plan-Do-Study-Act" quality
      improvement strategies to design, implement and evaluate their program. Ongoing conference
      call meetings, webinars and listserv communications will provide additional opportunities for
      sharing, problem solving, and peer support. The second learning session will occur after
      approximately six months, and is designed to allow CHC group visit teams to present
      de-identified and aggregated baseline group visit patient data and discuss any obstacles or
      challenges that they have encountered thus far. The third learning session will be held a
      year after the first session, during which time CHC group visit teams will present their
      six-month de-identified and aggregated group visit patient data, describe how they have
      overcame challenges that arose throughout implementation, and discuss concerns regarding
      sustainability. These team presentations will take place online via hour-long webinars that
      will take place each week for approximately one month.

      This collaborative effort will employ a standard method of data collection across
      participating health centers to assess CHC provider/staff training participant satisfaction
      with the training, their perceived utility and acceptability of the training, as well as
      their confidence in being able to implement and sustain a group visit program in their health
      center. Process outcomes will include the number of group visit sessions held; attendance
      rates; program costs; and challenges, barriers, facilitators and benefits identified during
      the process of implementing the group visits. Patient level data (A1c, blood pressure, BMI,
      self-care behaviors, satisfaction) will also be collected and analyzed to explore possible
      effects of the group visit intervention on patient outcomes.

      Expected products from this project include an evaluation of the training and the group visit
      intervention implemented in six Midwestern community health centers, the dissemination of
      best practices for implementing diabetes group visits in the community health center setting,
      and the subsequent development of this pilot program into a full scale randomized controlled
      trial across multiple community health centers. This pilot study will also help participating
      health centers problem-solve in order to overcome challenges in implementing and sustaining
      programs at their health center and understand how to provide better care to their patients
      in the areas of behavior modification and diabetes management. Finally the pilot conducted at
      the center selected to implement the text-messaging intervention in addition to the group
      visit intervention will provide information of the feasibility of additionally implementing a
      text-messaging intervention and explore whether such a combined intervention could have the
      potential to improve attendance at group visit appointments, change health behavior, and
      improve patient outcomes to a greater extent than group visits alone.
