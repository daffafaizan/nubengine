      patients with ischemic cardiopathy, stroke and intermittent claudication.

      Without doubt, the acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) is the most used antiaggregant product,
      nevertheless, and spite of being centenarian, it last some questions pending regarding the
      most appropriate dose, mechanism of action implicated, the association with other drugs, and
      the pharmaceutical form in order to improve the efficacy and the safety of the ASA.

      Some previous studies indicate that the slow release form of ASA has a different behaviour in
      the platelet effect in comparison with plain formulation.

      The aim of this study is to demonstrate the best antiaggregant and safety profile of a low
      dose of a slow release formulation of ASA.
