      significant healthcare burden and accounts for high annual hospitalizations. Chronic OA of
      the knee may lead to reduced physical fitness, mobility disability with a resultant increased
      risk of cardio-metabolic comorbidity and early mortality. Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is
      indicated in severe cases to improve long-term pain and function. (1) TKA involves extensive
      bone resection as well as soft tissue excision and therefore is associated with profound
      postoperative pain. (2) Inadequate perioperative pain control may prolong hospitalization,
      hinder early rehabilitation, and is also a strong predictor of persistent pain beyond 3
      months. (3) Adequate analgesia after TKA is therefore considered paramount to facilitate
      early hospital discharge and effective functional recovery. (4) The recently introduced
      adductor canal block (ACB) typically covers the anterio-medial aspect of the knee and
      preserves quadriceps function, which presumably enhances postoperative rehabilitation by
      allowing patients to actively participate in knee movement. The relative effectiveness of
      this ACB technique added to intrathecal morphine is limited to a single study (1) in which
      assessment of short-term functional recovery was done and dexamethasone was neither included
      in the LIA solution nor perineurally in the ACB. Thus, we hypothesize that adductor canal
      block as an adjunct to intrathecal morphine will have a better impact on functional recovery
      than peri-articular infiltration.
