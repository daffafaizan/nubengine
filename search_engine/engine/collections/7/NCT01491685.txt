      pregnant subjects to that of comparable non-pregnant volunteers; to evaluate the usefulness
      of a non-invasive technology, SDF imaging in pregnant and non-pregnant subjects.

      By improving our understanding of maternal microcirculation we not only add to the knowledge
      of maternal physiology, we hope to then translate this knowledge into further studies to
      improve maternal and fetal clinical outcomes through prevention and treatment of maternal
      hypotension especially in relation to spinal anesthesia.
