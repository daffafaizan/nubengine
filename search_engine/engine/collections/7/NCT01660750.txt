      dose of the combination of carfilzomib and cyclophosphamide with dexamethasone (Car-Cy-Dex)
      prior to autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) in patients with newly diagnosed transplant
      eligible multiple myeloma. The study will also explore the efficacy of Car-Cy-Dex including
      overall response after induction therapy, overall response at 3 and 6 months post ASCT, and
      time to progression, progression free survival, and time to next therapy if it occurs within
      6 months post ASCT.
