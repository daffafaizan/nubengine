      be selected by volunteers attending the Dermatology department of Sina Hospital, and eligible
      individuals will be selected among them. Subjects were randomized to use either Topical
      Herbal Solution or Topical Minoxidil 5% for 36 weeks.

      To our knowledge, this herbal solution for the first time covers all four major causes of
      AGA, including the 5Î±-reductase enzyme, androgen receptors, paracrine agents that affecting
      dermal papilla and hair cell apoptosis processes. Therefore it acts with the quadruple
      mechanism. The application of this new herbal solution for the treatment of AGA should be
      recommended.
