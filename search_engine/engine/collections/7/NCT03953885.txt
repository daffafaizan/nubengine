      between the immune system, related susceptibility loci, autoantigens and various
      environmental factors. In China, the prevalence is about 0.47%. Current treatment strategies
      for psoriasis mainly focus on developing new drugs that disrupt IL-23 or IL-17 cytokine, but
      this targeted therapy is not effective for all patients. A growing body of evidence indicates
      that psoriasis-related damage is not limited to the skin, but is closely related to coronary
      heart disease, stroke, metabolic syndrome, and chronic kidney disease. These comorbidities
      have, to a certain extent, increased mortality in patients with psoriasis. Traditional
      Chinese medicine (TCM) has always been used to treat patients with psoriasis in China. Blood
      stasis syndrome is one of the basic syndromes of psoriasis. which accumulates in meridians,
      viscera and limbs to form a variety of syndromes with psoriasis for a long time and is
      similar to many metabolic related diseases. Fire needle therapy is one of the traditional
      Chinese specialty treatments, which has effects of warming yang to expel cold, warming and
      activating meridian, dispersing stasis and relieving pain. Studies have shown that fire
      needle therapy of plaque psoriasis in stationary phase is effective, with fewer side effects,
      and can reduce the recurrence rate. This multicenter, randomized, single-blind,
      placebo-controlled trial will objectively and standardly evaluate the clinical effectiveness,
      safety and control of recurrence of fire needle therapy to obtain objective evidence of
      international standards and form clinical norms suitable for popularization and application.
