      diabetes self-management education and support (DSME/S) for African American/Black adults
      with type 2 diabetes living in Detroit. Participants interested in participating in this
      study will first be consented then they will complete a baseline health assessment including
      a questionnaire and physiologic testing. Using a 50/50 randomization scheme, participants
      will be randomized to either a control group or the virtual DSME/S group and be told of their
      placement. Participants randomized to the control group will receive community resources,
      diabetes specific newsletters, and pedometers. Participants randomized to the virtual DSME/S
      group will receive 10-weekly 1-hour virtual DSME/S sessions with a certified diabetes care
      and education specialists through Zoom for Health at the University of Michigan, a HIPPA
      compliant platform. After the intervention is complete and then again 3 months later,
      participants in both groups will be invited to complete an additional health assessment.
