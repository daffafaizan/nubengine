    
      This is a randomized, controlled single-blind pilot study to evaluate the safety and
      performance of AC5 following excision of lesions from the trunk or upper limbs under local
      anesthetic, in patients currently prescribed or not prescribed antiplatelet monotherapy.

      Each patient had sequential shave excision of two lesions (one treatment, one Control) at the
      same sitting. The sequence of wound treatment (AC5 first or Control first) was randomized.

      Study and Control treatments were administered immediately after lesion excision, followed by
      determination of time to hemostasis (TTH), and application of an occlusive water-resistant
      dressing
