      I. To establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of cisplatin in combination with UCN-01 in
      patients with advanced malignancies.

      II. To assess the toxicity and observe the potential antitumor activity of UCN-01 plus
      cisplatin in advanced malignancies at each dose level studies.

      III. To determine the pharmacokinetics of UCN-01 and cisplatin on this treatment schedule.

      IV. To perform laboratory correlative studies to investigate intermediate molecular markers
      of the activity of UCN-01 and cisplatin at the cellular level.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of cisplatin.

      Patients receive cisplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1 and UCN-01 IV continuously over 36-72
      hours on day 2. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of cisplatin until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 2-3 months for at least 1 year.
