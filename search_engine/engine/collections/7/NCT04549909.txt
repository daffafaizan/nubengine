      endometrium, it starts to secrete hCG that can be measured in the maternal blood as early as
      9 days after implantation. Only a minimal number of pregnancies get to newborn, and the
      majority are lost before reach the first trimester (Larsen et al., 2013).

      We are looking for the role of the embryo after controlling its chromosomal ploidy, and the
      endometrium after controlling its transcriptomic expression. We will also use a no exposed
      group to the controlled euploid embryo factor neither endometrial factor that is the oocyte
      donation group. This analysis expects to provide more information about the key role of
      embryo or endometrium in BPL.
