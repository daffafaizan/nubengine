      Anesthetic care will be standardized according to current institutional standards of care.
      Intraoperative clinicians will not be blinded to group assignment. Patients will be
      randomized to one of two groups:

        -  Group 1 - Opioid-free Anesthesia Patients: Patients who are not receiving opioids but
           the total intravenous anesthetic during surgery.

        -  Group 2 - Standard Anesthesia Patients: Patients who undergo the standard of care and
           receive opioids as part of their anesthetic regimen.

      Both groups employ strategies that are routinely used as part of standard clinical practice
      for TMJ surgery. Patients will otherwise receive the institutional standards of care for
      their surgical procedure and perioperative care.

      Following intraoperative drug administration patients will be followed until discharge from
      the PACU to assess study endpoints while in the hospital. At the time of discharge from the
      PACU, members of the study team will ask the patient to compete a brief survey on their
      satisfaction with pain management.

      Patients in this study will be anticipated to be discharged the same day as the surgical
      procedure. At the time of hospital or PACU discharge, the patient will be provided with a
      Medication Diary. This will be used to record pain medication administration in the first 48
      hours after surgery, as well as any pain or complication they might experience at home.
