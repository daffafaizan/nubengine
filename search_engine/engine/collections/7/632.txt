recovery of mycoplasmas in the study ofhuman leukaemia and other malignanciesnumerous reports have been published concerning thenecessity of testing for the presence of mycoplasmas beforethe interpretation of experiments performed in cellcultures.  such tests are especially important whenthe presence of viruses is suspected, since recent evidenceindicates that some mycoplasmas are capable of elicitinga transmissible cytopathic effect.in addition, some mycoplasmas and viruses shareproperties, such as size, filterability, morphology inelectron microscopy, sensitivity to ether, ability tohaemagglutinate and cause haemadsorption, interferencewith virus replication in vitro, lack of inhibition by certaincommonly used antibiotics and inhibition of growth byhomologous antiserum.  thus, the absence of ordinarybacteria and moulds in preparations eliciting a cytopathiceffect in cell cultures is an unreliable criterion for viralidentification.  great caution should be exercised inclassifying new agents as viruses, especially as myxo-viruses, without adequate testing to exclude their identityas mycoplasmas.
