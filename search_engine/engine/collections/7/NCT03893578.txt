    
      This is a prospective, non-randomized, multi-center early feasibility study designed to
      demonstrate that the Conveyor System can safely provide left ventricular access to deliver an
      Edwards SAPIEN 3 TAVR valve into the mitral valve position in a valve-in-valve procedure.
      This study will enroll patients with symptomatic heart disease due to a failing bioprosthetic
      mitral valve (stenosed insufficient, or combined).
