      I sites for ablation to prevent recurrent VT/VF.

      The trial hypothesis is: catheter ablation employing PEFA will, in comparison to published
      data, reduce the composite outcome of death at any time, appropriate ICD shock, ventricular
      tachycardia storm or treated sustained ventricular tachycardia below the detection rate of
      the ICD or incessant VT for patients with prior myocardial infarction and sustained
      ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation.
