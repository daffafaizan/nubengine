      assessing reduction in health deficit and improvement in quality of life using My Smart Age
      (MySAwH) application.

      MySAwH is an interactive mobile application designed to empower elderly HIV patients in
      health promotion through self assessment of ageing transition using a FI. FI is generated
      from health variables which include physical function data routinely collected by fitness
      tracking devices, Ecological momentary assessment data collected with smart phones and
      Physician health data collected during patient visits. The change in frailty index over time
      describes health transition. Although health generally worsens with age, the relationship
      between aging and health is dynamic and periodic improvement and stability in frailty index
      may be the result of the patients engagement in health promotion and improved life style.
