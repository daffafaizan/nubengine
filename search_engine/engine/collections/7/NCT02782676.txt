      intraocular lens (IOL) implantation and who meet all of the study inclusion and exclusion
      criteria in both eyes. Subjects who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria and agree to
      participate will be randomly assigned to receive the investigational OVD in one eye and the
      currently-available (i.e., commercial) OVD in the fellow eye (control). Thus, a single group
      of subjects will provide data for both the investigational OVD and the control OVD.
