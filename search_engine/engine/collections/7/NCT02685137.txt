      babies who did not develop severe hyperbilirubinemia (TSB <9 mg/dL) during the first 36 hours
      of age. This population is referred to as the untreated population of screened but not
      randomized patients. The second population of babies was defined as those infants who develop
      severe hyperbilirubinemia. These infants were randomized to treatment with either
      stannsoporfin or the sham injection and will be the focus of the efficacy and safety
      analysis. This population was referred to as the treated population.

      The treated population was used for the efficacy and safety analysis. These infants were
      randomized to either stannsoporfin or the sham injection treatment group.
