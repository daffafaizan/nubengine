      chemotherapy, followed by consolidation Sintilimab, will be safe and feasible to deliver to
      patients with resectable stage 3A Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

      This study also plans to observe the efficacy of this combination in the overall and
      biomarker-positive population.

      Study Design This is an open-label, single arm phase III trial of neoadjuvant chemotherapy +
      Sintilimab with concurrent radiation followed by surgical resection and consolidation
      Sintilimab in resectable stage 3A (N2+) NSCLC.

      Eligible patients will have biopsy-confirmed T1-3N2M0 (stage IIIA) non-small cell lung cancer
      (adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, or large cell/NSCLC not otherwise specified),
      performance status 0-1, adequate lung function and deemed medically resectable by a thoracic
      surgeon, adequate organ function for chemotherapy, and no contraindications to Sintilimab
      (i.e. autoimmune disorders or underlying pulmonary fibrosis).
