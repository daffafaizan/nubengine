    
      Specific Aim 1: To identify if differences in metabolic cost exist between barefoot versus
      cushioned shod FM strikers during an acute bout of running exercise. Hypothesis: The
      metabolic cost will be higher in the cushioned shod runners with forefoot and midfoot strike
      compared to the barefoot runners.

      Specific Aim 2: To identify if differences in peak impact forces exist between barefoot
      versus cushioned shod runners in forefoot-midfoot (FM) strikers.

      Hypothesis: Peak impact forces will be higher in the barefoot runners with a forefoot and
      midfoot striking running style compared to the cushioned shod runners with a forefoot and
      midfoot striking running style.
