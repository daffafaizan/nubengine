      the use of telemedicine to improve neonatal resuscitation is low.

      In this investigation and within a simulated environment, pediatric interns and residents
      will resuscitate a simulated 25 week infant at delivery assisted by a simulated nurse and
      respiratory therapist. Participants will be randomized to resuscitation performed either with
      or without telemedicine facilitated by a neonatologist. The primary outcome will be time to
      effective ventilation with other secondary outcomes including metrics derived from the
      American Academy of Pediatrics Neonatal Resuscitation Program.
