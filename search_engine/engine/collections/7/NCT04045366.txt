      patients receiving multiple dose treatment with echinocandins (caspofungin or anidulafungin).

      The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the echinocandins in plasma and BAL will be
      determined. Especially, the relative contributions of two pathophysiological alterations
      (capillary leak and hypoalbuminemia) encountered in critically ill patients, will be
      explored.

      Also other correlating covariates will be identified to provide a rationale for optimal
      dosing strategy in critically ill patients.
