      I. To determine whether pembrolizumab administered to small bowel adenocarcinoma (SBA)
      patients demonstrates antitumor activity as measured by the confirmed response rate.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess survival endpoints (overall survival [OS], progression free survival [PFS]),
      including stratified analysis by tumor site.

      II. To assess whether pembrolizumab is safe in SBA patients by assessing adverse events.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether PD-L1 expression, as measured by immunohistochemistry (IHC), or
      microsatellite instability (MSI) status is associated with the response rate overall.

      II. To determine if Bim levels in tumor-reactive CD11ahighPD-1+CD8+ peripheral blood T cells
      can objectively monitor responses to pembrolizumab and to determine if excessive release of
      soluble B7-H1 (soluble [s]PD-L1) by the tumor leads to Bim upregulation and treatment
      resistance in SBA.

      III. To determine if other tissue-based factors, such as total mutational burden, correlate
      with response to pembrolizumab.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat
      every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months until disease
      progression, and then every 6 months for up to 5 years.
