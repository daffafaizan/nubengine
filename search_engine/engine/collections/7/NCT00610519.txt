      citriodora, Eucalyptus globulus, Mentha piperita, Origanum syriacum, and Rosmarinus
      Officinalis, against placebo in the treatment of patients with acute viral
      Pharyngo-tonsillitis.

      In- vitro and clinical studies suggest therapeutic potential of aromatic herbs and trees oils
      in the treatment of Pharyngo-Tonsillitis. The pharmacological and clinical activity of
      Eucalyptus citriodora, Eucalyptus globulus, Mentha piperita, Origanum syriacum, and
      Rosmarinus Officinalis, include anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial and anti-viral activities.
      Some of these herbs and trees oils have direct activity on the respiratory tract, the
      coughing reflex and the airflow in the nasal tract.
