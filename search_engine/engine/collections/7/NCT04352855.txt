      antibiotics targeting nosocomial infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria. In recent
      years, ceftolozane-tazobactam was prescribed for treating complicated urinary tract
      infections (cUTI) and complicated intraabdominal infections (cIAI). Following the results of
      ASPECT-NP trial in 2019, it was approved as a therapeutic option in nosocomial pneumonia
      including hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

      The drug shows an excellent activity against ESBL-producing Enterobacterales and
      multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) strains of Pseudomonas
      aeruginosa. The latter is widely recognized as a common pathogen of nosocomial respiratory
      tract infections.

      There is still a need for observations of clinical experiences to better define the
      risk-benefit profile of ceftolozane-tazobactam. The aim of this study is to report our
      experience with ceftolozane-tazobactam and to evaluate its safety and efficacy in the
      treatment of ICU dependent nosocomial respiratory tract infections due to extensively drug
      resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Different dosing regimes of ceftalozane-tazobactam is
      evaluated and compared to the standard therapy of Colomycin.
