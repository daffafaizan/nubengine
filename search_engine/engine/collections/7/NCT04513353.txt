      are unresponsive to non-operative management including medications and physical therapies.
      Total knee arthroplasty is an effective treatment enhancing the joint range of motion as well
      as reducing pain and correcting deformities which leads to better patient function with
      better quality of life. Current method of post-operative rehabilitation is home-based self
      rehabilitation using brochure, combined with one or two times of education at the hospital
      before discharge. Patients often find difficulty in doing rehabilitation by themselves at
      home without supervision which resulted in decreased compliance.

      With development of technologies using multi-motion sensor and AR(augmented-reality) system,
      the investigators have developed a digital healthcare system(Uincare Homeplus) which can
      supplement patients' rehabilitation at home by giving them proper instructions as well as
      feedback. In this prospective randomized controlled study, the investigators aim to compare
      the efficacy of the newly-developed digital healthcare system with conventional
      rehabilitation program.
