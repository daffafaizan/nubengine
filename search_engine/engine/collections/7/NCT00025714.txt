      room during surgical procedures for drug resistant epilepsy. Our aim is to acquire and supply
      useful tissue specimens for intramural NIH research projects.

      The investigators will evaluate participants with medically intractable drug resistant
      epilepsy who are considered for surgery to determine whether surgical specimen may be
      available for this protocol. Surgery and standard care for these participants will be
      performed under a separate protocol, 11-N-0051 Epilepsy Surgery. The intent of this protocol
      is solely for procuring tissue that is resected for standard clinical care during surgery.
      This protocol is not designed to test any new treatments.

      These are the research aspects of the protocol: 1) Any brain tissue that is removed and is
      not required for diagnostic studies will be used for laboratory studies, consistent with
      institutional guidelines. 2) Blood tests to test for immune and inflammatory mediators will
      be performed. 3) Saliva will be collected to test for immune and inflammatory markers.
