    
      This is a prospective, multicenter, single-arm, feasibility study evaluating the safety of
      the Impella ECP device in adult patients undergoing an elective high-risk percutaneous
      coronary intervention (HRPCI). Additionally, this study will evaluate the feasibility of
      placing the ECP pump across the aortic valve without the use of a guidewire and assess the
      ability of the pump to provide sufficient hemodynamic support during a HRPCI. Investigational
      device products include: Impella ECP pump system (a percutaneous transvalvular micro-axial
      blood pump), 9Fr introducer sheath, and the automated Impella controller with revised console
      software to allow control of the Impella ECP.

      Following informed consent, subjects eligible for a HRPCI that meet all of the inclusion and
      none of the exclusion criteria will be enrolled into the study. The intended coronary
      intervention is then carried out under mechanical circulatory support by the Investigational
      Device. This device is inserted through a sheath that has been deployed through a femoral
      puncture, following crimping of the Impella ECP. After proper placement and wireless passage
      of the aortic valve, the device pumps blood from the left ventricle into the aorta. Once the
      interventional procedure is completed, the device is weaned and removed. Subjects will be
      followed up until 30 days post intervention.

      The primary and secondary end points will be summarized and presented without formal
      statistical testing. Safety will be assessed by the rate of composite Major Device-Related
      Adverse Events, evaluated at the end of the HRPCI procedure. Feasibility is defined as the
      successful delivery, initiation and maintenance of sufficient hemodynamic support to increase
      in or maintenance the MAP at physiologic levels (> 60 mmHg), evaluated up to the end of
      procedure.
