      patients will undergo imaging by mammography, ultrasound, and breast MRI. The primary and
      secondary objectives of the study are described below.

      OBJECTIVES

      Primary

      Treatment efficacy as measured by modified Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors
      (RECIST) criteria by Computed Tomography (CT) or Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging.

      secondary

      Safety using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 3.0 criteria.

      To describe the adverse events associated with IRE To prospectively gather pain assessment
      data on cryoablation and surgical resection Explore technical variables that may affect the
      success of IRE
