      to rPA in the presence and absence of Alhydrogel at the 2 lowest dose levels. The study will
      investigate whether use of an aluminum-based adjuvant results in an increase in the magnitude
      or the duration of the antibody response, thus providing information on the necessity of
      aluminum-based adjuvants in formulations used in the phase II clinical trials. The rationale
      for the use of BioThrax by two administration routes in this trial is to allow for
      preliminary comparisons of the immune response following the currently available vaccine to
      the response following the new recombinant product. Approximately 80 outpatient community
      volunteers from the Baltimore-Washington area aged 18-40 years will be recruited on the basis
      of good health, expressed interest in the study, and availability for follow-up as determined
      at a preliminary interview. Each eligible subject will be enrolled in 1 of 4 study groups,
      each with three arms, for 7 months. The subjects' randomly assigned and double-masked to Arms
      A and B will have a 30 day screening period in which they will receive two doses of IM rPA or
      IM rPA+Alhydrogel or IM BioThrax one month apart, with follow up days on 1, 2, 7, 14, 28, 29,
      30, 35, 42, 120, and 210. The subjects randomly assigned, but unmasked, to arms 1-C or 2-C
      will receive 3 doses of SQ BioThrax at 14 day intervals with follow up on days 1, 2, 7, 14,
      15, 16, 21, 28, 29, 30, 35, 42, 120 and 210. The information gathered from the study
      objectives will be used to determine the most probable optimal doses of rPA +/- Alhydrogel
      that are safe, well tolerated, and maximally immunogenic for use in future phase II trials.
