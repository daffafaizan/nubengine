      management of children with chronic liver disease. While liver biopsy is often used in the
      initial diagnostic evaluation of children with liver disease, subsequent surveillance liver
      biopsy is rarely performed in children because of its inherent invasiveness and risks.
      Therefore, our understanding of the natural history of fibrosis progression in children is
      limited. The patchy nature of fibrosis in many important pediatric liver diseases [e.g.
      biliary atresia (BA) and cystic fibrosis liver disease (CFLD)] limits the utility of
      sequential liver biopsy even if it were to be employed in clinical practice in pediatrics.
      Thus, non-invasive means of assessing liver fibrosis throughout the liver would be highly
      desirable and clinically useful in pediatric hepatology. ChiLDReN is poised and uniquely
      qualified to conduct a comprehensive longitudinal assessment of the utility of
      FibroScanâ„¢-specific elastography, liver stiffness measurement (LSM) as a measure of hepatic
      fibrosis in children with serious chronic cholestatic liver disease.
