      HSILs (High Grade Intraepithelial Lesions) randomized and double-blinded to two treatment
      arms. Half of the subjects will receive PepCan, and the other half will receive Candin®
      alone. The study design closely resembles the latest guidelines for treating young women with
      HSIL [14]. Study subjects will be patients attending the UAMS Obstetrics and Gynecology
      Clinics with untreated biopsy-proven HSILs and patients referred from other clinics. Four
      injections (one every 3 weeks) of PepCan or Candin® will be intradermally administered in the
      extremities. Clinical response will be assessed by comparison of colposcopy-guided biopsy
      results obtained prior to vaccination and at 12-Month Visit. Safety will be monitored from
      the time of enrollment through the 12-Month Visit. Blood will be drawn for laboratory testing
      and immunological analyses ("blood test") prior to injection, after the second vaccination, 6
      months after the fourth vaccination, and 12 months after the fourth vaccination. Blood will
      be drawn to aid T-cell analyses ("blood draw") after the first and third vaccinations, and
      possibly at the Optional Follow-Up and/or Optional LEEP visits. HPV-DNA testing will be
      performed at Screening and 6- and 12-Month Visits (Fig. 6). If a subject has persistent HSIL
      at the 12-Month Visit or if a subject is withdrawn due to excessive toxicity, she will be
      given an option to return for a LEEP visit. Alternatively, she may choose to exit the study
      and be followed by a gynecologist for up to 2 years of observation as recommended before
      surgical treatment
