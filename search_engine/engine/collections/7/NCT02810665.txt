      ophthalmic clinical trials due to its proven high repeatability comparing to other visual
      acuity chart. However, the original ETDRS alphabet chart could not be used in every
      individual around the world, especially those who are non-english speakers. Landolt C chart
      has been a recommended chart to test visual acuity in those living in a country where English
      is not a common language, however, some difficulties including right-left confusion occurred
      when testing with the Landolt C chart, leading to the unreliable results of visual acuity
      measurement using the Landolt C chart. Recently, the ETDRS numeric chart was introduced by
      some medical equipment companies but there is limited information regarding the repeatability
      and concordance of the new ETDRS numeric chart comparing to the original ETDRS alphabet and
      Landolt C chart.

      Therefore, this study aims to determine the repeatability and concordance of visual acuity
      level measured with the original ETDRS alphabet, the ETDRS Landolt C, and the ETDRS numeric
      chart. Results from this study would be able to suggest an appropriate ETDRS chart to be used
      in clinical studies in Thailand or other countries where English is not the native language.
