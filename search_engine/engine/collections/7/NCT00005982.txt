      I. Determine the response rate, failure-free survival, and progression-free survival of
      patients with recurrent or refractory cutaneous T-cell lymphoma treated with 506U78.

      II. Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients. III. Study the pharmacokinetics of
      this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive 506U78 IV over 2 hours on days 1, 3, and 5. Treatment continues every 28
      days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 6 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-35 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.
