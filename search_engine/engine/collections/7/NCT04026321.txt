    
      This is a single-center, double-blind, single-dose escalation study in healthy volunteers
      consisting of a 14-day Screening Period, 1-day Predose period, a 2-day Dosing and Evaluation
      Period, and a 5-day Follow-up Period, with a single Follow-up call scheduled on Day 7 Â± 1.
      Subjects will be confined to the study site for up to 3 days (admitted on Day -1 and
      discharged on Day 2 or 3, depending on cohort) and will be monitored for adverse events (AEs)
      and dose limiting toxicities (DLT) during the Dosing, Evaluation and Follow-up Periods.
      Subjects will also be monitored for concomitant medications and use of rescue medications
      throughout the study.

      Subjects will be allocated 1:4 to receive an infusion of saline control (0.9% saline for
      injection) or Shenqi Fuzheng Injection(SQ-001) continuously for about 1-4 hours. SQ 001 will
      be administered by intravenous route at a rate of 3 mL/min to one of four final dosages:
      Cohort 1 (125 mL/day/person), Cohort 2 (250 mL/day/person), Cohort 3 (500 mL/day/person), and
      Cohort 4 (625 mL/day/person). Each cohort will be enrolled sequentially. Per cohort, three
      subjects will be dosed initially on Day 1 and observed for 24 hours. If there are no observed
      AEs that meet the criteria under Stopping Rules, the remaining 7 subjects/cohort will be
      dosed. Dose escalation to the next higher dose will be based on the observation of results in
      safety and degree of AEs from the previous cohort and discussion between the Investigator and
      Sponsor.

      A maximum 17 PK samples will be collected over the course of the study in each cohort. The PK
      sampling time points will be grouped as (a) pre-infusion; (b) intra-infusion; (c) completion
      of infusion; and (d) post-infusion. See Table 10 for plasma PK sampling times. The last PK
      sample will be collected 24 hours after the end of infusion.
