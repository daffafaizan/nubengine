      (SSA) has led to a reduction in mortality and morbidity from HIV related opportunistic
      infections and some HIV related cancers. This improved survival has resulted in two
      phenomena: the first is the surfacing of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in the HIV
      population, especially in those on long-term ART, and the second is increased longevity
      leading to increasing numbers of elderly HIV infected individuals
