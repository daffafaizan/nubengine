      Cranial ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been used to detect structural
      abnormalities which may be useful in predicting neuromotor and neurocognitive deficits.
      However, up to 30% of extremely low birth weight infants with normal ultrasounds have adverse
      outcomes, and MRI is not feasible when an infant is critically ill. Amplitude-integrated
      electroencephalogram (aEEG) is a non-invasive, bedside instrument which allows real-time
      monitoring of brain function and may provide additional information for predicting outcomes
      in extremely premature infants.

      This observational study will enroll 85-100 infants between 401-1,000 grams birth weight OR
      between 23 0/7 and 28 6/7 weeks gestational age born at the 7 participating NICHD Neonatal
      Research Network sites. Eligible infants will undergo an aEEG recording in the first 72 hours
      of life, a second aEEG recording between 72-168 hours of life, and weekly thereafter up to 36
      weeks post-menstrual age.

      The study tests the feasibility of enrolling subjects and obtaining the required aEEG
      recordings. The information gathered will provide a framework for the design of a potential
      prospective, observational, multi-center study for prediction of death or neurodevelopmental
      impairment by 18-22 months of age.
