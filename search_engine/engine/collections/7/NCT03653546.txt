    
      This is a Phase II/III randomized, open-label, multicenter study to compare the efficacy and
      safety of first line single-agent AZD3759 vs. Erlotinib or Gefitinib treatment in patients
      with advanced NSCLC with CNS metastases.

      Eligible patients with documented EGFR mutation+ (L858R and/or Exon 19Del) TKI-na√Øve advanced
      NSCLC and documented intracranial disease will be enrolled.

      Primary Objective:

      The primary objective of this study is to determine if administration of single agent AZD3759
      compared to Standard of Care (SoC) EGFR-TKI as first-line therapy results in a significant
      increase in Progression Free Survival (PFS) in the study patient population by Blinded
      Independent Central Radiological(BICR) review.

      Secondary Objectives:

      Key secondary objective for this study is to determine if AZD3759 vs. SoC EGFR TKI
      administration demonstrates additional benefit in terms of safety, Objective Response Rate
      (ORR), Disease Control Rate (DCR), Duration of Response (DoR), and overall PFS using modified
      RECIST 1.1 criteria by investigator assessment.

      Additional secondary objectives include assessment of Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL),
      neurological function, and Overall Survival (OS).
