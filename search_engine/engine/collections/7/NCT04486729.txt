      syndrome (ARDS) secondary to coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) is emerging due to presumed
      differences with typical ARDS from other origin. Considering these issues, the effects of
      ventilatory strategies such as positive end expiratory pressure, end inspiratory pause and
      fraction of inspired oxygen on respiratory mechanics and gas exchange must be studied in
      order to characterize the behavior of COVID-19 ARDS during invasive mechanical ventilation
      and choose the best combination of ventilatory settings.

      In this study the investigators will evaluate the changes in respiratory mechanics and gas
      exchange produced by low and high positive end expiratory pressure, low and high inspired
      oxygen fraction and the application of end inspiratory pause during volume controlled
      mechanical ventilation.
