    
      The purpose of this study is to assess the potential of providing initial immunological
      protection to the neonate by providing passive placentally transferred serum antibodies and
      breast milk antibodies against pertussis antigens (PT, FHA, PRN, FIM). This will be
      accomplished by

        -  determining the rate of maternal antibody decline from time of immunization until 12
           months postpartum by measuring antibody levels in serum, saliva, and breast milk at
           specified intervals;

        -  determining levels of antibody transferred to the neonate relative to the interval from
           immunization to delivery;

        -  comparing levels of transplacentally transferred antibody with those achieved after the
           first, second, and third dose of the primary immunization series; and

        -  determining whether maternal immunization interferes with active antibody production
           following licensed DTaP-IPV-Hib in infants of women immunized during the mid third
           trimester of pregnancy.
