      fat diet (20% carbohydrate, 45% protein, 35% fat; CC-II) promotes more favorable changes in
      weight loss and health outcomes compared to a traditional high carbohydrate, low protein, low
      fat diet (55% carbohydrate, 15% protein, 30% fat; AHA) and the Curves moderate carbohydrate
      restricted, high protein, and low fat diet (30% carbohydrate, 45% protein, 25% fat; CC-I).
