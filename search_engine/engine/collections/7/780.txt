carcinoma of bladder: cobalt therapyfrom 1959 to 1962, 202 patients have receivedradiotherapy for carcinoma of the bladder.  radi-cal therapy with cobalt-60 has been done in 121of these cases.  these patients received tumordoses in excess of 5000 rad in 3 weeks.  of 49 pa-tients followed for 2 years after radical treatment,28 are alive.  sixteen out of 32 patients withstage b2, c or d tumors are alive; while 15 pa-tients survived out of 30 with tumors of grades3 and 4 (broders').  four of the 28 survivors hadcystectomy performed and none showed residualdisease in the bladder or lymph nodes.  the com-plications of radiotherapy presented were notconsidered to be excessive.we believe that radiotherapy should be theinitial treatment for patients with infiltrativecarcinoma of the bladder.  the survivals pre-sented at 2 years are better than those quoted forradical cystectomy (whitmore and marshall)and useful bladder function is preserved for themajority of survivors.  we reserve cystectomy forspecific indications.
