      changes in blood flow after psychological treatment in participants with coronary artery
      disease. This is a randomized controlled study. The aims of the study are to assess the
      effects of heart rate variability (HRV) biofeedback (versus usual care) on global and
      regional myocardial blood flow (MBF), peripheral vascular function, and autonomic changes
      during mental stress.

      All participants will undergo myocardial flow/perfusion imaging with positron emission
      tomography (PET) imaging at rest and after a standardized arithmetic mental stress test.
      Participants will then undergo repeat testing after 6 weeks. At 12 weeks, participants will
      also undergo a limited examination without myocardial perfusion imaging. The intervention
      group will receive biofeedback after enrollment, and the wait-list control group will receive
      the intervention between week 6 and week 12 study visits (without imaging).
