    
      This is a randomized, observational study where participants will be randomized into one of
      the four study cohorts. The primary goals of this study are to establish the test-retest
      reliability of the CAPS-5 and the PSSI-5 and to compare these with each other (Cohorts 1 and
      2), to test the convergent validity of the CAPS-5 against the PSSI (Cohort 3) and against the
      CAPS-IV (Cohort 4), and finally to investigate the consistency of response over 12 weeks on
      CAPS-5 (Cohort 1) and on the PSSI-5 (Cohort 2). In addition, on an exploratory level,
      possible biomarkers of PTSD and their relationship to each other and to diagnosis of PTSD
      will be evaluated.

      Participants will be 950 males and females recruited from the Cincinnati VA Medical Center
      (Cincinnati, OH), Trauma Recovery Center, and Tripler Army Medical Center (Honolulu, HI).

      the investigators anticipate that understanding the validity and reliability of the PSSI-5
      and the CAPS-5 and the biomarkers related to PTSD will provide necessary information for care
      provided to active duty military and veterans suffering from PTSD. It will also directly
      inform trial designs and increase the likelihood of technical and regulatory success for new
      treatments for PTSD.
