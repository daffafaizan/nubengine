      phenomenon with potentially long-lasting detrimental effects. However, there are currently
      limited data exploring the effects of gynecologic surgery on cognitive function. The
      population of patients treated surgically for pelvic floor disorders is typically older, and
      therefore at higher baseline risk for cognitive dysfunction. Therefore, it is of interest to
      determine the effects of pelvic floor surgery and anesthesia on this patient population. The
      investigators plan to conduct a prospective cohort study to assess cognitive function before
      and after pelvic organ prolapse surgery using sensitive tests of memory and other
      neurocognitive domains. Participants will be women undergoing surgery for pelvic organ
      prolapse. All participants will undergo cognitive tests at three time points: at their
      pre-operative clinic appointment, in the hospital the morning after surgery, and at their
      post-operative clinic appointment. In addition to the neurocognitive tests, patients will
      undergo a series of questionnaires regarding physical function, frailty, sleep quality, and
      incontinence symptoms.
