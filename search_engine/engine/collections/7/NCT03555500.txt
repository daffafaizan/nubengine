      the opportunity to participate. An invitation letter together with patient information
      leaflet outlining the study will be sent along with the pre-procedure appointment letter to
      give the patient time to read and think about the study. Once at pre-procedure assessment
      clinic, the study will be explained further including potential risks and intended outcome
      and patients concerns will be addressed. Patient will be given the opportunity either to take
      part in the study or abstain and follow the standard procedure. If the patient agrees then
      they will sign the consent form and then be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to either the fasting
      or non-fasting group and be allocated a patient identification number. This will be done at
      the pre-procedure assessment clinic.

        1. Fasting group (current practice): Clear fluids up to the time of the procedure and no
           food for at least 2 hours before the procedure.

        2. Non Fasting Group: Clear fluids and food up to the time of the procedure. The pre
           procedure preparation will then be documented in the notes. Intention to treat analysis
           will be used to avoid the effects of crossover and dropout providing unbiased
           comparisons among the treatment groups.

      Finally once the patient is ready for discharge they will be asked to complete an anonymous
      questionnaire relating to their experience and satisfaction.All patients will be contacted by
      phone on day 30 or the nearest working day thereafter to ensure no chest infections
