      compliance tends to be considerably inferior in routine treatment compared to scientific
      trials. This fact is caused by a narrow selection of motivated patients in the randomized
      trials. Perhaps, the information given to the patients in scientific trials is more thorough
      than information given in a routine setting.

      There are no trials available that document that compliance to medical treatment of patients
      with osteoporosis can be increased by intensive systematic information.

      Change of lifestyle is an important part in the treatment of these patients. The patients are
      encouraged to eat more healthy food combined with an intake of calcium and vitamins,
      reduction of alcohol and tobacco consumption if needed and prevention of fall incidence
      through changes in the house.

      The quality of life is often reduced, partly due to chronic pain, altered social status,
      physical handicap and partly due to the heavy knowledge of having a chronic decease.

      Adaption to the last-mentioned factors can possibly lead to a considerably better quality of
      life in spite of the unchanged physical handicap.

      Randomized trials on efficacy of systematic patient education has in general been positive in
      other contexts. Young patients with diabetes offered coping skills training have therefore a
      better metabolic control and quality of life.

      No similar randomized trials are available on the efficacy of a systematic education program
      in osteoporosis.
