    
      Primary Outcome Measures: Mean change from baseline in best corrected visual acuity [ Time
      Frame: 12 months ]

      Secondary Outcome Measures: Mean change from baseline in retinal thickness [ Time Frame: 12
      months ]

      Mean number of Conbercept injections required over 12 months [ Time Frame: 12 months ]

      Ocular and systemic adverse events [ Time Frame: 12 months ]

      Enrollment: 40

      Intervention Details: Drug: Conbercept

      20 patients will receive an intravitreal injections of conbercept 0.5 mg at baseline (visit
      1; month 0) then a subsequent intravitreal injection at month 1 (visit 2) and month 2 (Visit
      3). Patients will be reviewed every month thereafter for 12 months at which time it will be
      determined whether the patient requires retreatment with conbercept 0.5 mg based on
      measurements of visual acuity, Optical coherence tomography (OCT) findings, FFA and clinical
      appearance.
