      Primary hypothesis: A 10-week home-based exercise program, combined with tele-monitoring of
      functional outcomes, will not be inferior to an 10-week hospital-based rehabilitation at 3
      and at 6 months after total knee replacement (TKR) in improving physical function (fast gait
      speed).

      Secondary hypothesis 1: A 10-week home-based exercise program, combined with tele-monitoring
      of functional outcomes, will not be inferior to a 10-week hospital-based rehabilitation at 3
      and at 6 months after TKR in improving knee pain, physical impairments, and health-related
      quality of life.

      Secondary hypothesis 2: A 10-week tele-monitored home-based exercise program will be more
      cost-effective than the 10-week hospital-based rehabilitation in total TKR-related costs

      Approach and Methods

      This will be an assessor-blinded, parallel design, non-inferiority randomised controlled
      trial, with assessments preoperatively(baseline), 3 months, and 6 months after total knee
      replacement surgery. The protocol conforms to the CONSORT guidelines for non-inferiority
      randomized controlled trials. Post TKR, all participants will undergo daily inpatient
      rehabilitation. At discharge, they will be given a standard booklet with advice on ice
      therapy and home exercises to be performed. Two weeks post TKR, randomization will occur and
      participants will be randomised to receive either the telemonitored home exercise program or
      the hospital-based rehabilitation program.
