      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of bortezomib and celecoxib in patients with
           advanced solid tumors.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the overall pattern of toxicities associated with this combination, including
           the emergence of any cumulative toxicities, during multiple courses of this regimen.

        -  Describe the response rate and duration of response or disease stability during therapy
           in the subset of patients with measurable disease.

        -  Assess changes in plasma/serum sphingosine-1-phosphate, ceramide, and other markers of
           the apoptotic pathway before and during therapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive bortezomib IV on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 or days 1, 8, 15, 22, and 29 and oral
      celecoxib twice daily on days 1-21 or 1-42. Courses repeat every 21 or 42 days in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are evaluated every 2 courses.
      Patients achieving complete response (CR) receive 2 additional courses of therapy beyond CR.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of bortezomib and celecoxib until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at
      which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 36 patients will be accrued for this study.
