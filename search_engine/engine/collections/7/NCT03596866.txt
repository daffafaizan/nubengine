    
      The drug being tested in this study is called brigatinib. Brigatinib has been demonstrated to
      benefit people with ALK+ NSCLC.

      The comparator drug is called alectinib. Alectinib has been demonstrated to benefit people
      with ALK+ NSCLC. Both drugs belong to a class of drugs called anaplastic lymphoma kinase
      (ALK) inhibitors. Both drugs are taken by mouth. Both drugs are approved by the United States
      Food and Drug Administration (US FDA).

      The study will enroll approximately 246 participants. Participants will be randomly assigned
      (by chance, like flipping a coin) in 1:1 ratio to one of the two treatment groups:

        -  Brigatinib

        -  Alectinib

      All participants will be asked to take brigatinib or alectinib at the same time each day
      throughout the study.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States, Argentina, Austria, Canada,
      Chile, China, Croatia, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Italy, Mexico, Romania, Russia,
      South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, and Thailand. The overall time to participate in this
      study is 5 years. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic, and 30 days after
      last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.
