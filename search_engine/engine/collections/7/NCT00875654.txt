      stroke units, only thrombolysis has been shown to be efficient to treat acute ischemic stroke
      in the first three hours after the onset. Increasing brain plasticity after stroke represents
      an important alternative strategy. Cell therapy provides a functional improvement after
      cerebral ischemia in rodent models. This "restorative" therapy aims to replace destroyed
      cerebral tissue with a stem cells graft. Despite these encouraging experiments, we do not
      know yet the best way of administration of the stem cells, the best dose and the optimal
      delay of the graft. The pioneer clinical studies failed to reproduce this benefit for
      patients probably because of the limited number of studied patients. Therefore, more
      translational studies are needed to improve our knowledge in this promising field. Among
      different cell sources, mesenchymal (or stromal) stem cells (MSC) derived from bone marrow
      offer the advantage of arising from a non tumoral and no modified source and are not sources
      of immunological or ethical problems.

      Our research project involves a development of cell therapy in a phase IIa clinical trial of
      feasibility and safety in patients (randomised, controlled, open, with 3 parallel groups).
