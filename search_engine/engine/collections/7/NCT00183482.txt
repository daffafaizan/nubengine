      of life. Studies have shown that children of depressed parents are at a higher risk for
      developing depression than those whose parents have not experienced depression. Safe and
      effective treatments that can help prevent children of depressed parents from becoming
      depressed are needed. This study will compare CBT to depression education to determine which
      is more effective in preventing depression in the children of depressed parents.

      Families will be randomly assigned to receive weekly sessions of either CBT or depression
      education for 12 weeks. Parents in the CBT group will be taught skills to more effectively
      raise their children and to better manage their depressive symptoms; their children will be
      taught skills to cope with the stress of their parents' depression. Families in the education
      group will be informed about the ways that depression can affect individuals with depression
      and their families.

      Study visits will occur at study entry and at Week 12. Several follow-up visits will occur
      for up to 2 years after the interventional part of the study. At each visit, a clinician will
      make direct observations of the depressed parent's interaction with his or her children. In
      addition, families will be interviewed and will complete questionnaires about the parent's
      depressive symptoms and family interaction.
