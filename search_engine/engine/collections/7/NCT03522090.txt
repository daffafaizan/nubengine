      lung cancer but with little evidence for either. Routine lower neck CT is potentially
      associated with benefits of higher detection of neck lymphadenopathy leading to better
      staging, less invasive procedure with positive implications for patients experience and care.
      The potential harms are delay in diagnosis due to false positive findings and radiation
      exposure. There is limited evidence in this area so this study will potentially provide
      evidence to inform health policy decisions based on the risk benefit balance.

      This is a retrospective comparative study to assess the real-life impact of routine lower
      neck CT on the diagnostic and staging work up of patients with suspected lung cancer across
      two cohorts.
