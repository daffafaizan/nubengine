      permanent pacemaker has been increased and the number of patients with pacemaker undergoing
      surgery has been increased in company. However, in cases using electrocautery during surgery,
      there is possibility of malfunction of pacemaker due to electromagnetic interference. The
      factors associated with pacemaker malfunction during surgery have been reported; type of
      pacemaker, intrinsic heart rate, pacemaker dependency, type of electrocautery, position of
      generator, distance between generator/lead and electrocautery, duration and power of
      electrical energy. Conventionally, mode change to VOO before surgery and use of bipolar
      electrocautery are recommended before surgery but diverse suggestions regarding perioperative
      pacemaker mode change has been raised. The investigators aimed to contemplate the necessity
      of perioperative pacemaker mode change by prospective randomized trial. Patients with
      permanent pacemaker undergoing surgery are randomized into two groups by 1:1 ratio. No mode
      change is applied before surgery in the case group and VOO mode is applied before surgery in
      the control group. Exclusion criteria is thoracic surgery, 100% pacemaker dependency and
      unipolar pacing. The investigators will compare perioperative adverse events. The primary
      endpoint is asystole and the secondary endpoint is cardiac arrest, pacing inhibition,
      torsades de pointes and R on T.
