      DISH was a multicenter, controlled, randomized study conducted in 1980-1983 of 496 patients,
      who were formerly participants in the Hypertension Detection and Follow-up Program and who
      had their blood pressure well controlled with medication. At DISH baseline they were
      randomized to continue medication or to be withdrawn from antihypertensive medication to
      determine if weight reduction or sodium restriction/potassium increase interventions could
      maintain these people under blood pressure control without drugs. Only the main findings
      regarding diastolic blood pressure control under the different diet regimens, were analyzed
      and reported during the course of DISH funding. Many questions which could be uniquely
      addressed by this comprehensive data base remained unexplored.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      The investigators explored the questions dealing with demographic, clinical and physiologic
      predictors of relapse to the hypertensive state. They also analyzed the mortality experience
      of this cohort five years post DISH in relation to the DISH randomization groups and in
      relation to success in remaining off drugs during DISH. They did this by querying the
      National Death Index to determine who of the DISH participants died following the termination
      of DISH.

      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the "End Date" entered in
      the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.
