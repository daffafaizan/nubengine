      parents to plan about the outcome of pregnancy.

      Prenatal ultrasound has been well established for decades as the primary technique for
      evaluating the developing fetus in normal as well as in high risk cases. Advantages of US
      include widespread availability, relatively low cost and quick, lack of harmful effect to
      fetus or mother and real time imaging.

      Although ultrasound can characterize many anomalies accurately, it has many limitations as
      operator dependent, small field of view, and relatively poor soft-tissue contrast, beam
      attenuation by maternal adipose tissue and fetal bone, limited visualization of posterior
      fossa after 33 weeks gestation because of calvarial calcification. Also, ultrasound relies
      heavily on fetal positioning and presence of sufficient amniotic fluid to provide an adequate
      acoustic window fetus So, US findings are occasionally incomplete or inconclusive to guide
      treatment choices.

      Fetal brain MRI became embraced as a clinically important imaging technique useful for fetal
      assessment, which is helpful in formulating prognosis and perinatal management and can detect
      occult abnormalities in up to 50% of cases for certain indications.

      It can overcome many of ultrasound limitations as it is not limited by maternal obesity,
      fetal position, or oligohydramnios. Additionally, it has better soft tissue contrast
      resolution, as well as the ability to distinguish individual fetal structures such as brain,
      lung, liver, kidney, and bowel. In addition, visualization of the brain is not restricted by
      the ossified skull. Moreover, MRI provides multiplanar imaging as well a larger field of
      view, facilitating examination of fetuses with large or complex anomalies.
