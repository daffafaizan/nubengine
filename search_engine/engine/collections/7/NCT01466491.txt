      elective first-trimester surgical abortion. Subjects will be randomized to two different
      paracervical block techniques, but both the medications and the amount of medications will
      remain the same. Subjects will not know to which group they have been randomized as this
      knowledge may affect how much pain is felt.

      Primary Outcome:

      Patient reported pain with cervical dilation during first trimester surgical abortion. Pain
      is measured as mm distance from the left of the 100-mm visual analogue (VAS) scale with the
      anchors 0 = none, 100 mm = worst imaginable (reflecting magnitude of pain) and recorded
      immediately after completion of cervical dilation. The 100-mm VAS scale is a well established
      and validated study instrument.

      Secondary Outcomes:

        1. Socio-demographic and clinical data: age, race, gravidity, parity, gestational age,
           prior vaginal delivery, prior abortion, level of menstrual symptoms

        2. Pain (VAS scale):

             -  anticipated

             -  baseline

             -  with speculum insertion

             -  with placement of the PCB

             -  with aspiration

             -  30 min postoperatively

             -  intrapersonal pain changes (calculated in analysis)

             -  anxiety [baseline] (VAS scale; anchors 0 = none, 100mm = worst imaginable):

             -  of pain

             -  of surgery

             -  satisfaction (VAS scale; anchors 0 = not, 100mm = very satisfied):

             -  with pain control

             -  overall abortion experience

             -  adverse events

             -  need for additional intraoperative and/or postoperative pain medication

             -  participants' belief if they were in the intervention or control group
