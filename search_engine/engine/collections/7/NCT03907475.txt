    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the safety of adding MEDI4736 (durvalumab) to standard chemotherapy regimens.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the changes that occur in the immune microenvironment in response to
      chemotherapy and assess how these changes alter the pharmacodynamic effects of a checkpoint
      inhibitor.

      II. Investigate whether the response to immunotherapy correlates with patients' genetic
      aberrations and/or the activation status of tumor-infiltrating and circulating T cells.

      III. Explore the relationship between immune status of the tumor and overall tumor mutational
      load.

      IV. Assess preliminary antitumor activity of the MEDI4736 (durvalumab) and chemotherapy
      combinations.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 7 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive durvalumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on days 1 and 15 of
      cycles 1 and 2 and day 1 of subsequent cycles. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15
      and durvalumab IV over 60 minutes on days 8 and 22 of cycles 1 and 2 and day 8 of subsequent
      cycles. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      ARM III: Patients receive pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 60 minutes on
      day 1 and durvalumab IV over 60 minutes on days 8 and 22 of cycles 1 and 2 and day 1 of
      subsequent cycles. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM IV: Patients receive capecitabine orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-14, and
      durvalumab IV over 60 minutes on days 8 of cycle 1, day 8 and 15 of cycle 2, day 8 of cycles
      3, and day 1 of subsequent cycles. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM V: Patients receive carboplatin IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1 and durvalumab IV over 60
      minutes on day 8 of cycle 1, days 8 and 15 of cycle 2, day 8 of cycles 3, and day 1 of
      subsequent cycles. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM VI: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 60 minutes on day 1 and durvalumab IV over 60
      minutes on day 8 of cycle 1, days 8 and 15 of cycle 2, day 8 of cycles 3, and day 1 of
      subsequent cycles. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM VII: Patients receive nab-paclitaxel IV over 30 minutes on day 1 and durvalumab IV over
      60 minutes on day 8 of cycle 1, days 8 and 15 of cycle 2, day 8 of cycles 3, and day 1 of
      subsequent cycles. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up monthly for 3 months.
