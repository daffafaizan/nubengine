      standard practice in patients who are undergoing investigation for COPD. The core methodology
      involves capturing of data during a short period of measurement of breathing using SLP
      against spirometric outcomes.

      This study is a comparative study with two study visits (Part A and Part B ) to generate data
      to characterise the tidal breathing patterns and parameters with Thora3Di™againt spirometry
      FEV1/FVC and %predicted. Subjects will have a Part A visit 1(Development Phase), and a Part B
      visit 2(Validation Phase) after developing algorithms for COPD diagnosis from Part A. At Part
      A visit 1, subjects will have two 5-minute SLP measurements (Pre and Post bronchodilator). At
      Part B visit 2, subjects will be seen in the clinics and have three 5-minute SLP measurements
      (pre-bronchodilator, post-bronchodilator and post spirometry testing) along with spirometry
      testing (pre-bronchodilator and post-bronchodilator). The SLP measurement should be performed
      prior to standard lung function tests with minimal impact on clinical time and no change to
      hospital attendance. Also, each visit subjects will be asked to report concomitant
      medications and adverse events, and fill in COPD assessment test (CAT™).
