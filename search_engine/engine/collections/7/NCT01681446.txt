      with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). MiR-26 is a predictive marker for the effect of
      postoperative interferon-alpha treatment in patients with HCC. Our study is to identify the
      effect of postoperative IFN-alpha treatment in patients with a low miR-26 expression in tumor
      after resection of HCC.

      METHODS: A quantitative RT-PCR assays of miR-26 are performed on specimens which are
      collected from patients who underwent a curative resection of HCC. These patients with low
      miR-26 expression will return to the hospital 4 to 6 weeks after the resection following the
      baseline examination to rule out residual tumor. If all requirements are satisfied, these
      patients will be randomly assigned to the treatment group who received postoperative
      IFN-alpha therapy or the control group who will not receive any anti-cancer treatment.
      Disease-free survival, overall survival, time to recurrence and the side effects will be
      observed.

      Anticipated RESULTS: IFN-alpha treatment improved the disease-free survival in patients with
      a low miR-26 expression in tumor after curative resection of HCC, probably by inhibiting
      tumor recurrence.
