      that is refractory to therapy or that is considered high risk (i.e. low platelet count,
      progressive onset and greater than 50% of body surface area affected). Subjects must have not
      failed more than 2 immunosuppressive regimens in order to be considered for this trial.
      Eligible subjects will receive intravenous pentostatin every 2 weeks for 24 weeks. If the
      subject has had a complete response, the therapy will end at 24 weeks. If the subject has had
      a partial or mixed response or stable disease, they will continue on study receiving
      pentostatin for 52 weeks.
