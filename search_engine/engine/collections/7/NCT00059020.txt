      repair and is critical to epithelial tissue development and maturation of the central nervous
      system, among other functions. EGF is a natural focus of interest in cancer research because
      of its influence over mitogenesis, proliferation, and tumorigenesis. In addition, unregulated
      expression of its receptor, EGFR, has been identified as a common event in neoplastic
      transformation. In patients with the most malignant primary tumor of the brain, the
      glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), alterations in the EGFR or in its expression levels have been
      identified in approximately 50% of patients. We postulate that EGF-EGFR interactions may be
      important for the development, progression, and prognosis of human gliomas and that
      alterations of the EGF gene may predict the potential for glioma progression and the severity
      of disease.

      Patients suspected of having, or with prior biopsy proof of, a WHO grade II-IV central
      nervous system (CNS) glial tumor(s) seen in the Surgical Neurology Branch, NINDS, will be
      considered for entry into this study. Tissue samples of tumor resected as part of standard
      care will be collected at surgery and preserved for research. Blood samples will also be
      collected. Blood will also be collected from anonymous normal volunteers who donate blood at
      the NIH Blood Bank; these anonymous donors will serve as controls.
