      Primary

        -  To determine the median PSA recurrence-free survival of patients with nonmetastatic,
           biochemically relapsed prostate cancer who respond with a PSA ≤ 0.5 ng/mL when
           administered a brief (6-month) course of androgen ablation either alone or in
           combination with GVAX prostate cancer vaccine (CG1940/CG8711) immunotherapy.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the safety of combined treatment with androgen ablation and CG1940/CG8711
           immunotherapy in these patients.

        -  To determine median time to metastatic disease development in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to Gleason score (> 7
      vs ≤ 7), PSA doubling time (< 3 months vs 3-9 months vs > 9 months) and prior androgen
      ablation (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms at a 1 (arm I):2 (arm
      II) ratio.

        -  Arm I (androgen-ablation therapy): Patients receive oral bicalutamide once daily on days
           1-28. Patients also receive luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist
           treatment comprising leuprolide acetate or goserelin intramuscularly (IM) on day 8.
           Treatment with LHRH agonist repeats every 12 weeks for 24 weeks.

        -  Arm II (androgen-ablation therapy and vaccine): Patients receive androgen ablation as in
           arm I. Patients also receive GVAX prostate cancer vaccine (CG1940 and CG8711)
           intradermally (ID) on day 1. Beginning on day 1 of week 3, patients receive booster
           doses of CG1940 and CG8711 ID every 2 weeks for 24 weeks.

      Patients are evaluated on day 1 of week 25 to assess disease. If PSA > 0.5 ng/mL AND there is
      no evidence of metastatic disease on imaging studies, then patients can be treated at the
      discretion of the investigator. If PSA ≤ 0.5 ng/mL, and there is no evidence of metastatic
      disease, then patients are considered responders and continue having PSA evaluated every 4
      weeks until PSA relapse.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically for 5 years and then
      annually thereafter.
