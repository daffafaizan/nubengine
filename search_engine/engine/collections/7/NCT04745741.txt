      therapy as it offers improved target conformity. Xerostomia is still the most common side
      effect of radiotherapy in patients with NPC treated with IMRT. Most stimulated saliva is
      secreted by the parotid glands (PGs), while the submandibular glands (SMGs) produce most of
      the unstimulated saliva and mucins, which may influence the degree of a dry mouth
      sensation.There are still differences in the understanding of nasopharyngeal cancer experts
      at home and abroad on the delineation of clinical target volumes., suitable criteria for
      elective irradiation of neck level Ib need to be re-evaluated.Therefore, we conducted a
      retrospective study to assess the feasibility of recommendation to level Ib in the
      International Guideline for Delineation of Clinical Target Volumes.
