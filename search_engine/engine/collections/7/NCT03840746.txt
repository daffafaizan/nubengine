      bioavailability is generally low. The majority of plant polyphenols are poorly absorbed in
      the small intestine and enter the colon where the colonic microbiota metabolise them to
      release a range of phenolic acids, which are now thought to be the main bioactive components
      related to the reduction in disease risk. Very little is known about the impact of other
      constituents of the diet on the metabolism and bacterial catabolism of these polyphenols.

      Colonic bacteria are key agents in the release of the bioactive molecules from polyphenols
      but also ferment non-digestible carbohydrates (NDC) such as inulin to short chain fatty
      acids. It is likely that there are key interactions in the colonic bacterial metabolism of
      NDC and phenolics. The investigators hypothesize that combination of polyphenolics (in
      onions, tomatoes and lovage) with inulin (NDC) will increase the urinary output of bioactive
      phenolic acids over a 6 week feeding trial and impact on biomarkers of cardiometabolic
      health.
