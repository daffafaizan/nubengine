    
      This is a Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial comparing a single
      intra-articular 2.0 mL injection of either AlloGen or sterile saline. Patients will be
      evaluated at baseline, 1 week, 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 26 weeks. The patient will remain
      blinded to his or her treatment throughout the study duration. The investigator/assessor will
      also remain blinded throughout the treatment period. Only the individual(s) preparing the
      injection will not be blinded. Black tape over the injection syringe will mask the study
      treatment.

      Up to 30 adult patients with osteoarthritis of one knee that has failed to adequately respond
      to conservative non-pharmacologic therapy and simple analgesics, e.g., acetaminophen, will be
      enrolled at up to 5 sites in the US. The first 6 subjects will be staggered to evaluate any
      significant toxicity. Any adverse event data collected will be reviewed by the Data Safety
      Monitoring Board (DSMB) prior to treating the subsequent subject. Cumulative safety data from
      these 6 subjects will be reviewed by the DSMB.
