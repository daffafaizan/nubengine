      morbidity and mortality; treatment options are limited and have not been optimized by
      well-conducted clinical trials. The hypothesis that local delivery of CsA by aerosol
      inhalation will achieve higher intrapulmonary concentration than by systemic administration
      alone, with limited toxicity compared to similar systemic doses due to minimal absorption of
      drug into the blood circulation has been substantiated by previous studies. The objectives of
      this study are to assess the tolerability, safety, PK, and exploratory efficacy of two dose
      levels of aerosolized L-CsA vs placebo in addition to SoC therapy for the treatment of BOS in
      adult allogeneic HSCT recipients.
