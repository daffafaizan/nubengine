      trial. Seventy-three healthy male volunteers, aged 18 to 35 years will be recruited. The
      study will have 5 study groups that will include 49 volunteers who will be intravenously
      injected with PfSPZ Vaccine, 8 control volunteers who will receive normal saline and 16
      additional control volunteers who will be recruited at the time of controlled human malaria
      infection (CHMI) at 3 and 24 weeks. The control volunteers will help better assess the
      occurrence of AEs compared to background disease patterns that occur in this tropical area,
      and the performance of the vaccine.
