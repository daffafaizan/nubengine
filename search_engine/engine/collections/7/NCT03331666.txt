      platelet activation and an underlying pro-coagulant state. Hyperlipidemia primes platelets
      and increases platelet activation in response to various agonists. Plasma cholesterol levels
      appear to have a critical role in modulating platelet activity as hypercholesterolemia
      increases platelet activation more potently than hypertriglyceridemia. Increased platelet
      reactivity may contribute to the increased risk of atherothrombosis associated with
      hypercholesterolemia. Plasma levels of platelet activation markers such as
      thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT), soluble P-selectin (sP-selectin), soluble CD40L (sCD40L)
      or P-selectin exposure at surface of platelets are increased in hypercholesterolemic
      patients. Increased levels of the platelet activation markers are associated with increased
      platelet membrane cholesterol content in hypercholesterolemia.Statins may show antithrombotic
      properties.
