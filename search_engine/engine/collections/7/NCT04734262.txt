      phase II clinical trial in advanced triple-negative breast cancer patients. Subjects will be
      divided into two cohorts by different treatment dose of sitravatinib. Cohort A patients will
      receive 70mg sitravatinib (QD PO) in combination with 200mg tislelizumab (Q3W IV); Cohort B
      patients will receive 100mg sitravatinib (QD PO) in combination with 200mg tislelizumab (Q3W
      IV). Subjects in both cohorts will be treated until disease progression, toxicity is
      intolerable, informed consent is withdrawn, and investigators determine that medication must
      be discontinued. Drug efficacy and safety data will be collected.
