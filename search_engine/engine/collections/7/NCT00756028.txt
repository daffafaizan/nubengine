      =<36 y/>36 y, IVF/ICSI, and treatment centre.

      Methods: OHSS is quantified by consecutive measurements of weight, abdominal diameter,
      ultrasound measurements of ascites and ovarian volume, paraclinical parameters, and by a
      systematic patient questionnaire. Furthermore it is registered if the patients have been
      hospitalized and/or have had ascites drainage performed due to OHSS. Data from the first 100
      patients are used together with Golans OHSS-classification, to make a more precise definition
      of OHSS. This definition is applied prospectively on data from the remaining patients.

      Quality of life is gauged by a questionnaire. Child birth rate is ascertained by a pregnancy
      response questionnaire and by obtaining data from the Danish National Birth Registry.

      Statistics: The study is designed to be able to show a 50% reduction of OHSS comparing short
      to long protocol.
