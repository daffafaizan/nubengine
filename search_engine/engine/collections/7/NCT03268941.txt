      tested to treat people who have DG or IG. This study will assess the safety, tolerability,
      PK/PD and food effect of TAK-906 and will determine the effect of TAK-906 on gastric emptying
      (GE).

      The study enrolled a total of 51 participants. This study will be conducted in two parts:
      Part 1 and Part 2. Part 1 will consist of 48 participants enrolled in 3 active treatment
      groups and 1 placebo group. Participants in Part 1 will be randomly assigned (by chance, like
      flipping a coin) to one of the 3 active treatment groups or 1 placebo group-which will remain
      undisclosed to the participant and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent
      medical need):

        -  TAK 906 maleate 5 mg

        -  TAK 906 maleate 25 mg

        -  TAK 906 maleate 100 mg

        -  Placebo

      All participants who will complete Part 1 of the study will be eligible for enrollment in
      Part 2. Part 2 consisted of 21 participants who completed Part 1 and were assigned to the 2
      open-label treatment groups as follow:

        -  TAK-906 maleate 25 mg Fed + TAK-906 maleate 25 mg Fasted: crossover design, with a
           minimum 7-day washout in doses of each period.

        -  Metoclopramide 10 mg

      This multi-center trial will be conducted the United States. The overall time to participate
      in this study is approximately 8 weeks. Participants will make a final visit to the clinic
      10-14 days after receiving their last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.
