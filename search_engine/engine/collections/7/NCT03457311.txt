      single point (GSP) method, was developed to assess residual liver function by measuring
      galactose blood concentration 1 hour after galactose was administered (0.5 g/kg). The
      galactose single point (GSP) method has been used to evaluate liver function in both humans
      and rats, and GSP concentration has been found to closely reflect changes in enzyme activity
      and hepatic blood flow. The Federal Drug Administration of the U.S. has recommended the GSP
      method in its guidelines for industry pharmacokinetics for patients with impaired hepatic
      function (FDA 2003). The GSP method has also been successfully applied to measure the
      clearance of drugs that are excreted from the liver but not metabolized, such as promazine
      and cefoperazone, specifically in patients with various liver diseases. Hu et al.
      demonstrated that GSP concentration is strongly correlated with the severity of liver
      disease.

      This translate the traditional GSP method to oral galactose single point (OGSP) that will
      greatly improve the technical simplicity and reduce the burden to patients and will easily
      applied to patient both in hospital and home to measure the residual liver function.
