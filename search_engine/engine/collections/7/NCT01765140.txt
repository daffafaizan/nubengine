      and all patients have been referred to the PI for DAP treatment. This study enrolled minors
      and adults.

      CMS patients under age 18 years were included if their parent or guardian gave written
      permission. Minors who turn 18 while in the program will be re-consented as adults.

      The dose of DAP is determined individually for each patient. Adults are started with a dose
      of 10 mg 3-4 times daily, increased over several weeks to the dose that produces the maximum
      symptomatic response, not to exceed 100 mg daily. Pyridostigmine bromide (PB) may be added at
      low doses and increased to the dose that produced the best response, not to exceed 360 mg
      daily. In children, equivalent doses of these medications is calculated on a surface area
      basis. The doses of DAP and PB are periodically adjusted to assure that the smallest
      effective doses are used.

      Patients who achieve significant clinical benefit from DAP, as judged by the study PI and the
      patient, may continue taking DAP as long as the drug is available from the sponsor, and as
      long as they return for regular follow-up evaluations at the Duke MG Clinic. Patients who are
      unable to return for regular follow-up will be required to have their local physician obtain
      DAP for them from the sponsor.
