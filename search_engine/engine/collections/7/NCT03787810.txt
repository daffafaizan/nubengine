      cause left ventricular dysfunction including myocardial infarction, septic cardiomyopathy,
      post resuscitation syndrome, takotsubo syndrome etc. A number of studies have assessed
      cardiac dysfunction in specific conditions (e.g. sepsis, cardiac arrest) but only a few
      studies have assessed cardiac dysfunction in a general ICU-population. The study will focus
      on diagnostics of the different types of cardiomyopathy and differentiating between ischemic
      and non-ischemic left ventricular dysfunction in a general ICU population. The aim of this
      study is to assess the incidence and prognosis of the different types of left ventricular
      dysfunction in critically ill patients. Our hypothesis is that left ventricular dysfunction
      is common in the critically ill and is associated with an increased risk of short-term death.
