    
      This Phase 3, randomized, open-label, parallel-group multicenter study of the efficacy and
      safety of guadecitabine in adults with previously treated AML will be conducted in
      approximately 20 countries. There will be a 14-day screening period, a treatment period, a
      safety follow-up visit, and a long-term follow-up period. The study is expected to last
      approximately 2 years. Duration of individual subject participation will vary, and subjects
      may continue to receive treatment for as long as they continue to benefit.

      Approximately 404 subjects from approximately 100 study centers will be randomly assigned to
      either guadecitabine or treatment choice (TC) in a 1:1 ratio (approximately 202 subjects per
      group). TC is as follows:

        -  High intensity: intermediate or high dose cytarabine (HiDAC); mitoxantrone, etoposide,
           and cytarabine (MEC); or fludarabine, cytarabine, G-CSF, +/- idarubicin (FLAG/FLAG-Ida).

        -  Low intensity: low dose cytarabine (LDAC), decitabine, or azacitidine.

        -  Best Supportive Care (BSC).

      Guadecitabine will be given SC at a dose of 60 mg/m2 in 28-day cycles. In Cycle 1,
      guadecitabine will be given for 10 days on Days 1-5 and Days 8-12. Cycle 2 will be either the
      5-day regimen (Days 1-5) or 10-day regimen (Days 1-5 and 8-12) based on assessment of disease
      response and hematologic recovery at the end of Cycle 1. In subsequent cycles, guadecitabine
      treatment will be for 5 days only (Days 1-5).
