      postoperatively which has unfavorable effects on patients recovery and procedures outcome.
      Dexketoprofen has been reported to be one of the NSAİDs that can provide good results when
      compared with narcotics in many painful conditions and especially in the treatment of the
      moderate to severe postoperative pain that may develop after lumbal disc surgery. Tenoxicam
      is a thienothiazine derivative of the oxicam class of NSAİDs. There are some studies in which
      NSAİDs have been used to together with opioids for postoperative analgesia showing that they
      decrease opioid consumption and side effects
