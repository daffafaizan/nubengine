      neuropathic pain mainly because it can activate adenosine monophosphate-activated protein
      kinase (AMPK), which plays a crucial role in pain regulation as an important endogenous
      kinase controlling energy metabolism.(2)In addition, metformin can also inhibit ERK signaling
      pathway, further inhibit sodium channel, prevent the development of peripheral sensitization
      and achieve the effect of relieving neuropathic pain. (3)Metformin has been shown to
      alleviate bone cancer pain in rats by reducing STAT3 phosphorylation.Clinical research in
      this field is limited to basic research and ethical requirements are rarely reported at home
      and abroad. Li Chunye et al. of Jiangsu University designed a clinical trial to compare the
      efficacy of metformin and gabapentin combined with tramadol on neuropathic pain. The results
      showed that metformin had a better effect.

      The incidence of chronic pain after thoracic surgery is higher. Postoperative chronic pain is
      a complex pain. The nature and mechanism of chronic pain after thoracic surgery are still
      controversial. Some studies have shown that some chronic pain after thoracic surgery
      manifests neuropathic pain, the mechanism may be related to surgical incision, nerve injury
      caused by trauma and increased pain sensitization. Can metformin alleviate chronic pain after
      surgery? The research on this aspect is still blank at present.This study was designed as a
      prospective cohort study to observe whether there was a difference in the incidence of
      chronic pain after thoracoscopic lobectomy between patients taking metformin and patients
      injecting insulin to control blood sugar.
