      cells and platelets, alone or in combination. The only definitive treatment is stem cell
      transplantation. Unfortunately, treatment-related mortality precludes the application of this
      procedure for most patients older than 60 years and those lacking a suitable matched sibling
      donor. A proportion of patients have been shown to respond to a wide variety of
      immunosuppressive agents, including cyclosporine (CSA) and antithymocyte globulin (ATG).
      However, nonresponse and relapse continue to be problematic. Therefore, most patients with
      MDS receive supportive treatment with transfusions and growth factors, such as erythropoietin
      (EPO) and G-CSF, to improve blood counts. However, growth factors are not always effective in
      improving cytopenias and iron overload is an inevitable long-term complication of red blood
      cell transfusions.

      Recently, Abkowitz et al described clinically significant improvement in anemia in 3 of 9
      patients with Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) using metoclopramide, an inexpensive, commonly
      used medication with rare side effects. We hypothesize that therapy with metoclopramide might
      also benefit patients with other causes of refractory anemia, such as individuals with anemia
      due to MDS. We therefore propose this Phase II clinical trial to evaluate metoclopramide in
      the treatment of anemia in patients with MDS.
