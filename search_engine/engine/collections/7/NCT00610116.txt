      standard EASYTRAK™ II and EASYTRAK™ III leads from GUIDANT in combination with suitable
      devices for cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) allow for the non-invasive programming of
      different Left Ventricular Pacing (LVP) configurations. Hence, this Electronic Repositioning
      (ER) may help physicians to overcome problems in cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) such
      as ineffective biventricular pacing, high Left Ventricular Pacing (LVP) thresholds and
      phrenic nerve stimulation (PNS) without the need for an additional patient's operation to
      reposition LV leads. The ERACE study it a multi-center, prospective, non-randomized clinical
      study to document and evaluate appropriate performance of GUIDANT's Electronic Repositioning™
      in the clinical routine with respect to the following major aspects:

      avoidance of PNS and low LVP thresholds (for low battery consumption and extended device
      longevity) in standard cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT)
