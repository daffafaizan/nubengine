      intra-operatively. Anesthesiologists facing challenges from hemodynamic function,
      neurological function, coagulation function use monitoring instruments as a guide to make
      timely anesthetic judgement. As good as those well designed monitoring instruments displaying
      vital information, the investigators would like to explore any possible hidden data features
      which is not perceivable with naked eye.

      In this prospective observational study, the investigators will enroll 40 patients undergoing
      liver transplantation surgery for medical reason. Anesthetic management and surgery will be
      performed as usual clinical practice.

      The investigators will record the digital data exported from standard monitoring instruments,
      including cardiovascular system information (electrocardiography, photo-plethysmography ,
      blood pressure, cardiac output, and any additional monitoring items clinically required),
      parameters derived from pulse contour analysis (cardiac output, stroke volume, stroke volume
      variation... etc.), neurological system information (Bispectral index, Entropy, Surgical
      Plethysmography Index, cerebral oximeter ) and the respiratory gas monitoring (gas analyzer,
      respiratory waveform). All above data are provided by monitoring instruments routinely used
      for liver transplantation, including CARESCAPE Monitor B850 (GE Healthcare) FloTrac system
      (Edwards Lifesciences).

      The surgical steps will be noted with precise time stamps to establish temporal
      relationships. Registered events including anesthetic induction, intubation, disinfection,
      dissection stage, anhepatic stage , inferior vena cava clamping, reperfusion, neohepatic
      stage and other important surgical steps. The recording is ended before the end of monitoring
      in the operating room. All physiological data and demographic data will be stored in digital
      media after being de-linked from personal identification.

      Data analysis and Statistics will be particularly performed to explore the temporal effect
      and relationship. Methods including signal processing, modeling, classification and
      non-parametric spectral estimation will be used.
