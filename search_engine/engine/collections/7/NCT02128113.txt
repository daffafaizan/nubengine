      stress is also known to adversely impact corneal endothelial cells, and may be a factor
      resulting in the acute decrease in corneal endothelial cell density following ocular surgery.
      While corticosteroids provide potent anti-inflammatory efficacy in a wide range of acute and
      chronic inflammatory ocular diseases, their use is limited by their side effect profile,
      which includes the potential to elevate IOP and induce cataract formation. In addition, most
      available ophthalmic anti-inflammatory treatments, including corticosteroids, do not directly
      protect against the underlying oxidative stress component of the disease process.
      Consequently, there is a clinical need for agents that protect against oxidative stress and
      provide anti-inflammatory efficacy without inducing steroid-like side effects.

      This study will assess the safety and efficacy of omaveloxolone (RTA 408) Ophthalmic
      Suspension (0.5% or 1%) versus vehicle for the prevention of corneal endothelial cell loss in
      patients undergoing cataract surgery.
