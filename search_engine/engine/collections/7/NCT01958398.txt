      students' alcohol intake. This study tested two smartphone applications (apps) targeting
      drinking choices on party occasions, with the goal of reducing problematic alcohol intake
      among Swedish university students.

      Methods Students were recruited via e-mails sent to student union members at two
      universities. Those who gave informed consent, had a smartphone, and showed risky alcohol
      consumption according to the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) were
      randomized into three groups. Group 1 had access to the Swedish government alcohol monopoly's
      app, Promillekoll, offering real-time estimated blood alcohol concentration (eBAC)
      calculation; Group 2 had access to a web-based app, PartyPlanner, developed by the research
      group, offering real-time eBAC calculation with planning and follow-up functions; and Group 3
      participants were controls. Follow-up was conducted at 7 weeks.
