      reduce toxic side effects from chemo drugs when it was used synergy with chemotherapy. The
      new technology of modulated electro-hyperthermia (mEHT),trade name: oncothermia has been
      proven efficacy in lung cancer with minimal side effects.The investigators have accumulated
      some successful cases in the treatment of primary lung cancer by using vitamin C infusion in
      combination with oncothermia. One diagnosed with squamous cell lung cancer patient survive
      beyond 5 years only receiving intravenous vitamin C+ mEHT. Based on this, it is necessary to
      conduct an in-depth study to explore the best treatment protocol for NSCLC patients.
