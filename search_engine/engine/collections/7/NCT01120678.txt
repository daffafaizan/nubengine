      cultures sent were eligible for this study. Left-over blood from the time at blood culture
      was collected for research purposes. Study personnel separated the serum and stored samples
      at -80 degrees until analysis. Samples were analyzed in batch for neonatal sepsis biomarkers
      using an antibody-coated microsphere assay with dual laser detection. Clinical information
      collected included symptoms prompting the blood culture, CBC and culture results, and
      antibiotic therapy.
