    
      Patients undergoing vaginal pelvic reconstructive surgery for pelvic organ prolapse (POP)
      under general anesthesia will be randomized to receive:

        1. Bilateral trans- vaginal pelvic floor levator ani muscle injections (trigger point
           injections) with bupivacaine:

           - 0.5% bupivacaine will be injected at several sites for a total of 5ml on each side of
           the pelvic floor, with each injection site no more than 1 ml (Bupivacaine was chosen by
           the study team because of it has a longer half life then other common local anesthetics.
           We plan to use the same anesthetic and dosage to standardize the protocol between
           patients. Other local anesthetics will not be used in addition to the bupivacaine
           administered for research purposes. We will limit the amount of intravenous lidocaine to
           less than 5mg/ kg).

        2. Control- No additional treatment (standard of care).

      The patient will be blinded to their randomization (single blind). The post-operative pain
      regimen will be standardized when possible. Patients will receive a regimen of IV and oral
      narcotics and Ketorolac per our routine post-operative protocol. On discharge from the
      hospital, patients will be given prescriptions for a standard amount of oral narcotic, 20
      tablets of oxycodone (150 morphine equivalents), and 30 tablets of 600mg ibuprofen.
