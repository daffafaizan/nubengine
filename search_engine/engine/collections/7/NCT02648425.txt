      Regimen A or Regimen B, in patients with metastatic solid tumors, eligible to receive the
      cisplatin/5-fluorouracil or cisplatin/capecitabine regimen.

      Dose of ASLAN001 starts from 400mg BID; then, dose escalation to 500mg BID or dose
      de-escalation to 300mg BID will depend on DLTs observed in cohort.

      Regimen A: Depends on preferred medical practice, Cohort 1A will receive ASLAN001 400 mg BID
      in combination with cisplatin 80 mg/m2 IV infusion and 5 fluorouracil 800 mg/m2/day IV
      infusion for 5 days every 3 weeks; or will receive ASLAN001 400 mg BID in combination with
      Cisplatin 35 mg/m2 24-hour infusion for day 1 and day 8, 5-fluorouracil 2,000 mg/m2 and
      Leucovorin 300mg/m2 24-hour infusion for day 1, day 8 and day 15 every 4 weeks.

      Regimen B: Cohort 1B will receive ASLAN001 400 mg BID in combination with cisplatin 80 mg/m2
