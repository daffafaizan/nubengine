    
      The purpose of the VeClose study was to demonstrate safety and effectiveness of the VenaSeal
      SCS as being both 1) non-inferior to RFA therapy in achieving anatomical closure of lower
      extremity superficial truncal veins in patients with venous reflux through endovascular
      transcatheter embolization with coaptation of the GSV at 3 months, and 2) superior in the
      reduction of intraprocedural and post procedural pain and symptoms as compared to treatment
      with RFA.

      The study was designed to demonstrate safety of the VenaSeal SCS by follow-up visits that
      evaluated, via duplex ultrasound and physical exam, the presence of deep vein thrombosis
      and/or pulmonary embolus.
