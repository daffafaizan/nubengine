      antibiotics, conjunctival and nasopharyngeal swabs are procured with the Bacti-Swab transport
      system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). For conjunctival samples, a sterile swab is
      moistened with ophthalmic balanced salt solution and gently swept along the lower fornix from
      the medial to the lateral canthi, with all attempts to avoid the eyelashes and eyelids. For
      nasopharyngeal cultures, the sterile swab is inserted 2 cm into the naris and rotated against
      the anterior nasal mucosa for 3 seconds.

      Culture swabs are then plated onto 5% sheep blood plates and incubated at 37°C for 3 days.
      Colonies are isolated and identified with API (Analytical Profile Index) Microbial
      Identification Kits (bioMérieux Inc., Hazelwood, MO). Antibiotic susceptibility is determined
      using the Kirby Bauer disc diffusion method. Additional data collected includes age, ocular
      and systemic medical conditions, and the number of intravitreal injections along with
      anti-VEGF agents used.

      Statistical calculations for antibiotic resistance comprises of t-test and and multivariate
      analysis.
