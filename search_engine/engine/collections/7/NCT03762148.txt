      oxygen transport from the lungs to the tissues. Iron deficiency is still the most common and
      widespread nutritional disorder in the world according to WHO. Common iron supplements all
      have their limitations in terms of availability and compatibility. Prebiotic fibers, such as
      galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS), selectively enhance growth of beneficial colonic bacteria.
      Prebiotics in general enhance the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and thereby
      decrease luminal pH. Through the reduction in pH, prebiotics can enhance absorption of
      minerals such as calcium and magnesium and they have been proposed to potentially improve
      iron absorption.

      In a recent iron absorption study in adult women with low iron stores in our lab (publication
      under review), we found that 15 g of GOS given with an iron supplement in the form of iron
      fumarate acutely increased iron absorption when given with water and a bread based meal. The
      dose of 15 g of GOS was tolerated well by the participants. As a follow up to the study
      mentioned above, we want to investigate: 1) if acute iron absorption is affected by lower
      doses of GOS; 2) whether this acute effect occurs for other commonly used iron compounds as
      well, such as iron sulphate and iron phosphate; and 3) if there are potential interactions on
      absorption with other enhancers of iron absorption, such as vitamin c.
