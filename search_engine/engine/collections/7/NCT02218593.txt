      conditions such as arthrogryposis and muscular dystrophy. Nemours/A.I. duPont Hospital for
      Children alone has provided a WREX for about 80 children in the last 3 years. This is being
      done through the orthopedic and muscle clinics in the hospital. We would like to perform a
      retrospective study to see how well the children are doing with the WREX. We propose getting
      this feedback through a survey administered to families using the WREX. The survey will be
      performed in two parts. 1) A phone survey will use the Canadian Occupational Performance
      Measure (COPM). 2) an online survey with additional questions. The parents are asked to
      submit answers on behalf of the children if they are unable to.
