      is associated with hyperacute or delayed humoral immune responses against the graft after
      transplantation .

      In addition, these sensitized patients wait for a long time to find a cross-match negative
      kidney for renal transplantation . As a result, some modalities have been used for
      desensitization including plasmapheresis and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) in combination
      with immunosuppressive drugs .

      However, recently, the use of statins such as simvastatin, pravastatin and etc. has been
      proposed to be safer and more effective for desensitization .
