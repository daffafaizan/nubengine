      both known and unknown that present with symptoms and signs associated with the risk of overt
      or potential cardiovascular dysfunction. We will also study rare genetic modifiers and
      identify novel disease mechanisms contributing to common cardiovascular diseases. In so
      doing, we will expand our knowledge about these disorders and provide access to subjects
      interest for research, teaching, and clinical experience. Individual subjects seen under this
      protocol may initiate the establishment of specific disease-related protocols involving
      intensive natural history studies, disease discovery and potential innovative therapeutic
      studies. In addition to its role in investigating individuals who are of interest to the
      Center for Molecular Medicine (CMM) and the Cardiovascular and Pulmonary Branch (CPB) of the
      NHLBI, this protocol can provide a possible avenue for admitting subjects from other NIH
      programs such as the NIH Undiagnosed Diseases Program, the Center for Human Immunology
      Trans-institute program or other NIH protocols where subjects exhibit cardiovascular
      features.
