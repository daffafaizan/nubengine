    
      We test the effectiveness of an homeopathic drug versus placebo and a temporal control group
      (patient with no add-on treatment) following orthopedic knee surgery.

      All patients have a PCA of morphine for 24 hours after surgery. After this period they can
      take an oral tablet of morphine on request.

      Group A: Patients with study treatment (homeopathy) allocation. Double blind group with 70
      patients

      Group B: Patients with placebo allocation. Double blind group with 70 patients

      Group C: Temporal control group with patients who take only the morphine. Open group with 25
      patients

      The total power: 70 +70 + 25 = 165 patients

      Main Objective:

        -  To assess the effect of homeopathy in terms of morphine consumption delivered by PCA
           (patient control analgesia) for 24 hours after a knee ligamentoplasty.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To assess the effect of homeopathy in terms of total morphine consumption between H24
           and H72 after a knee ligamentoplasty.

        -  To assess the effect of homeopathy on the pain perception using a analogical visual
           scale for 72 hours.

        -  To asses the placebo effect of the homeopathic treatment.

      Main Assessment Criterion:

        -  Morphine consumption delivered by PCA between 0 and 24 hours after knee ligamentoplasty

      Secondary Assessment Criteria:

        -  Morphine consumption between 0 and 72 hours after ligamentoplasty

        -  Pain assessment at H0, H4, H24 and H72 using 10 cm Analogical Visual Scale

      Inclusion Criteria:

        -  age ranging from 18 to 60.

        -  patients candidates for a ligamentoplasty of the anterior cruciate ligament.

      Exclusion Criteria:

        -  patient with corticoid and immunodepressor treatment
