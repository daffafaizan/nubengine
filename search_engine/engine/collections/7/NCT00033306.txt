        -  Determine the clinical activity of BMS-247550, as measured by the tumor response rate,
           in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer previously treated with a fluoropyrimidine
           and irinotecan.

        -  Determine the safety of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the response duration, time to progression, and survival in patients treated
           with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive BMS-247550 IV over 1 hour on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 21 days for
      up to 18 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients
      achieving a complete response (CR) receive up to 4 additional courses of treatment beyond CR.

      Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 19-55 patients will be accrued for this study within 6 months.
