    
      Background and Rationale:

      Epacadostat (INCB024360) is an Inhibitor of Indoleamine 2,3- dioxygenase 1 (IDO1).
      Indoleamine 2,3- dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) is a 403 amino acid cytosolic haem enzyme encoded by
      the INDO gene on human chromosome 8p22. IDO1 is responsible for the catabolism of the
      essential amino acid tryptophan (trp) to kynurenine (kyn) within immune cells and a subset of
      tumor cells resulting in inhibition of antitumor cell-mediated immune responses. Increased
      IDO activity correlates with lower CR rates and shorter OS in AML.

      Objective:

      The primary objective is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and to characterize
      dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) of epacadostat when added to the cladribine/cytarabine
      chemotherapy in relapsed / refractory AML patients fit for intensive treatment

      Study Duration:

      Phase I part will last from 3 to 18 months (permitting the enrolment of minimum of 3 and a
      maximum of 24 patients).
