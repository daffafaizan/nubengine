      asphyxia can have timely and accurate diagnosis to receive therapeutic hypothermia within 6
      hrs of life, which has been shown to significantly reduce deaths and improve long term
      developmental outcomes.

      This study is designed to record EEG during birth transition through the first 10 minutes of
      life.
