      strategies have resulted in improved survival outcomes for patients. Most recently there has
      been interest in augmenting tumor response to chemotherapy by the addition of drugs which
      inhibit tumor cell growth and proliferation. Everolimus is a new cancer drug which works as
      an inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin (or mTOR), mTOR is a protein that is part of a
      signaling pathway which can cause cancer cells to divide. Everolimus when used alone as a
      single agent has produced some response as well as prolonged stable disease in both
      chemo-naïve and pre-treated non-small cell lung cancer. The goal of this study is to evaluate
      the safety of everolimus with combined other cancer drugs called pemetrexed, carboplatin, and
      bevacizumab. Pemetrexed and carboplatin are both chemotherapy drugs and bevacizumab inhibits
      the growth of new blood vessels.

      Patients will be entered onto dosing cohorts of 3 patients according to the following dose
      escalation scheme. The first cohort will begin at dose level 1. At least three patients on
      each dose level must have completed cycle one before the study leadership (principal
      investigators, study statisticians) will allow patients to be enrolled onto the successive
      dose level.

      Dose Levels: 1, 2, 3

      Pemetrexed (mg/m²): 500, 500, 500

      Carboplatin (AUC): 5, 6, 6

      Bevacizumab (mg/kg): 15, 15, 15

      Everolimus (mg/day): 2.5, 2.5, 5.0

      The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose, or MTD, for the
      combination of everolimus with pemetrexed, carboplatin, and bevacizumab in patients with
      Stage IV non-squamous, non small cell lung cancer.
