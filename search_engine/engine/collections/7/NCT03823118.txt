      resistant disease.These patients have a median survival of only 4 to 5 months when treated
      with further systemic therapy. Improvements in therapy for relapsed SCLC are much needed.The
      purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of S1 combination with Anlotinib
      in patients with small cell lung cancer whose cancer has progression or recurrence after at
      least one standard chemotherapy.
