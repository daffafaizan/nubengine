      I. To establish the safety of this treatment by determining its treatment-related mortality
      (TRM) within 30 days.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the relapse-free survival (RFS). II. To estimate the overall survival (OS).
      III. To quantify duration of infused allogeneic umbilical cord blood (UCB)-derived natural
      killer (NK) cells in the recipient.

      OUTLINE:

      PREPARATIVE REGIMEN: Patients receive carmustine intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on day -12,
      etoposide IV twice daily (BID) over 3 hours on days -11 to -8, cytarabine IV BID over 1 hour
      on days -11 to -8, melphalan IV over 30 minutes on day -7, and lenalidomide orally (PO) once
      daily (QD) on days -7 to -2 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients who are CD20+ also receive rituximab IV over 3 hours on days -13 and -7.

      NK-CELL INFUSION: Patients receive cord blood-derived expanded allogeneic NK cells IV over 1
      hour on day -5 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      STEM CELL TRANSPLANT: Patients undergo stem cell transplant IV over 30-60 minutes on day 0 in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      POST-TRANSPLANT: Patients receive filgrastim subcutaneously (SC) QD beginning on day +5.
      Treatment continues until white blood cell count recovers in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30, 100, and 180 days.
