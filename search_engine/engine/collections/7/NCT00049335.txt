        -  Determine the feasibility of enrolling patients aged 70 and over with unresectable
           metastatic or recurrent colorectal cancer to a structured phase II study.

        -  Determine the anticancer efficacy of capecitabine, in terms of objective response rate
           (confirmed and unconfirmed, complete and partial responses) and 2-year survival, in
           these patients.

        -  Determine the toxicity and tolerability of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the feasibility of using standardized self-report measures of comorbidity,
           depression, and functional status of patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the clinical pharmacology of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine whether patients under 60 years of age treated with this drug have clinical
           pharmacologic parameters similar to those reported in the literature.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to age (70 and over
      vs 18 to 59).

      Patients receive oral capecitabine twice daily on days 1-14. Treatment repeats every 21 days
      for up to 18 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 6 months for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 80 patients (60 patients aged 70 and over, 20 patients aged 18
      to 59) will be accrued for this study.
