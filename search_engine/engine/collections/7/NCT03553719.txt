      recommendations internationally, and staff training should take place accordingly. Prior
      studies have hinted at low implementation rates of delirium screening intensive care units
      and an overall low reliability of the documented scores.

      The study's rationale is to evaluate staff perceptions regarding delirium screening practice
      in their ICU, and evaluate the validity of routine delirium screening scoring (compared to an
      expert-screen). Subsequently, the effect of a training block for ICU staff on routine
      delirium screening frequency and validity will be assessed.

      The implemented training package contains online lectures, instructional videos, educational
      handouts, and a bedside teaching component over the course of 6 weeks.

      On each point-prevalence day three members of the ICU staff (attending/consultant, trainee
      physician, nurse) will fill out their respective questionnaire (attending CRF, physician CRF,
      nurse CRF). These questionnaires ask for estimates of delirium prevalence in their respective
      ICU, as well as estimates on the frequency of delirium screening implementation.

      Subsequently, the local study coordinator will evaluate all patients that have received
      treatment in the ICU during the past 24 hours according to the inclusion and exclusion
      criteria. Each included patient will receive a pseudonym and the study coordinator will fill
      out one electronic case report file (eCRF, see list of items) per included patient.

      A member of staff who is trained in administering the CAM-ICU screening tool will then
      evaluate all included patients, and enter the respective score result in each patient's
      "expert CRF".
