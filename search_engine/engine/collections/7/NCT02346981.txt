      randomized into training group (TG) or control group (CG) and submitted to 12 weeks of
      intervention. The intervention programs were divided into three phases: initial (first two
      weeks), intermediate (from week 3 to week 10) and final (last two weeks). The TG was
      submitted to a resistance training program that consisted of eight exercises performed in two
      sets of 10 to 15 repetitions, three times per week. The CG performed a stretching training
      program for the major muscle groups, in sessions of 30 minutes, twice a week. These
      interventions were maintained during the 12 weeks.

      During initial and final phases subjects of both groups were submitted to two acute
      experimental sessions: resistance exercise and control, which were performed in random order.
      The resistance exercise session was similar to those performed during the resistance training
      program (i.e., 7 exercises, 2 sets, 10-15 repetitions). In the control session participants
      remained seated for 40 min. Before and after each session the BP parameters were obtained.
      The chronic effect of resistance training on post-exercise BP were assessed by analyzing the
      changes (∆) in BP after acute experimental sessions at initial and final phases. The
      correlation between acute and chronic responses of blood pressure following resistance
      training was analyses correlating the acute blood pressure observed in initial phase with the
      chronic effect of resistance training on rest blood pressure.
