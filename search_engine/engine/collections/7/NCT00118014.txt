    
      The purpose of this study is to assess the extent of symptom remission in patients with
      trichotillomania following treatment with sertraline and/or behavior therapy.

      Following entry into the study, subjects will undergo a washout period if they are currently
      taking a psychotropic medication (two weeks for psychotropic medications except for
      fluoxetine, which requires a four-week washout). Subjects will then be given a single-blind
      placebo for two weeks and assessed for symptom consistency.

      Subjects will take sertraline or placebo in a double-blind design. Subjects will be assessed
      with the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D-17), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI),
      Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Clinical Global Impressions Scale (CGI), Hair Pulling Scale
      (HPS), Trichotillomania (TTM) Impact Scale, Psychiatric Institute Trichotillomania Scale
      (PITS), National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Scale, and Quality of Life Enjoyment and
      Satisfaction Questionnaire (Q-LES-Q) at the start of the washout period and at the end of
      week two in order to be randomized into the study. Subject randomization to a treatment arm
      will be based on the random table and in equal proportions.

      Subject change scores will be assessed for the above scales, and change scores for the four
      different treatment groups will be assessed.
