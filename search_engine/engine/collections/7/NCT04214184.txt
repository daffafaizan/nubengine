      issue. This project will utilize metabolomics approaches to identify potential mechanisms
      underlying increased cardiometabolic risk associated with insufficient sleep and to identify
      potential biomarkers in the blood that respond to insufficient sleep. Investigators will
      conduct a controlled in-laboratory insufficient protocol where participants will sleep in the
      lab for one night with sleep timing based on their habitual insufficient sleep schedule. In
      the morning, plasma will be collected for metabolomics analyses and participants will
      complete an oral glucose tolerance test for insulin sensitivity analyses. Participants will
      then complete a 4 -week increased sleep duration intervention targeting the recommended 7
      hours of sleep per night. Following this intervention participants will again sleep in the
      lab for one night on their new sleep schedule. In the morning, plasma will be collected for
      metabolomics analyses and participants will complete an oral glucose tolerance test for
      insulin sensitivity analyses. Investigators anticipate these findings will be the first step
      in developing biomarkers of impaired sleep under free-living sleep conditions, and to
      determine how such biomarkers relate to insulin sensitivity changes associated with sleep
      loss.
