      highly potent and HIV-specific broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (bNAbs) from B
      cells of HIV-infected individuals. It has been shown that certain bNAbs can prevent
      acquisition of the virus, suppress viral replication, delay and/or prevent plasma viral
      rebound following treatment interruption in Simian Immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected
      animals and block cell-to-cell transmission of laboratory-adapted HIV in vitro. In light of
      these encouraging outcomes, a number of clinical trials have been conducted in recent years
      in order to explore the feasibility of achieving sustained virologic suppression using a
      single bNAb in HIV-infected individuals following analytical treatment interruption (ATI).
      Despite the fact that repeated administration of a single bNAb was safe and well-tolerated,
      the vast majority of study subjects experienced plasma viral rebound following ATI, clearly
      demonstrating that successful passive immunotherapy will require different approach,
      including the use of a combination of 2 or more bNAbs to achieve extended periods of
      virologic suppression.

      Given a major emphasis on current HIV research lies in the possibility of achieving ART-free
      virologic remission, it is of great interest to investigate whether a combination of potent
      HIV- specific bNAbs, such as 3BNC117 and 10-1074, can prevent plasma viral rebound in
      infected individuals upon discontinuation of ART or suppress viral replication in subjects
      who are not taking ART.
