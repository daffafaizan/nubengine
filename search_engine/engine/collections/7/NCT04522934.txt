      arthroscopic rotator cuff repair took part in a multimodal physiotherapy programme and were
      allocated to two groups. Patients in the experimental group - PNE (n= 16) received multimodal
      physiotherapy along with pain neuroscience education, and the control group- PME (n=13)
      received multimodal physiotherapy along with biomedical education. The multimodal treatment
      included 1-hour sessions 3 times per week for 8 weeks (24 sessions). In addition, the
      education component (PNE, PME) consisted of 4 education sessions of 30 minutes duration, on a
      one-to-one basis, once per week at the start of the programme.

      Physiotherapists involved in the delivery of the interventions were previously trained on
      both, the theoretical and practical aspects related to the protocols of multimodal
      physiotherapy and specially on the education component.

      Outcome measures included pain intensity (pain intensity numerical rating score),
      catastrophizing, kinesiophobia, disability and quality of life.
