    
      Multicenter, randomized, controlled clinical trial conducted at 11 Investigational Sites in 4
      countries (Canada, United Kingdom, Denmark, and Brazil).

      Subjects underwent Baseline evaluations, Alair treatments or Control Visits, and follow-up
      evaluations at 12-Weeks, 6-Months, and 12-Months after the last Treatment or Control Visit.
      In order to maximize the power of the study, Baseline and Follow-up testing was conducted in
      2 parts. In the first part subjects continued to take their asthma maintenance medications
      (inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and long acting Î²2-agonists (LABA) during the test period.
      This is designated as the "ON-LABA" Phase. Following ON-LABA testing subjects were asked to
      abstain from LABA for the second part of the testing, and these results are designated as the
      "OFF-LABA" Phase.
