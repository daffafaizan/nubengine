      However, achieving good glycemic control remains elusive for many adolescents. This study
      evaluates two clinic-based approaches for improving glycemic control in adolescents with
      poorly controlled type 1 diabetes - an intensive diabetes support and education program alone
      and the same intensive diabetes support and education program together with continuous
      glucose monitoring - in comparison with standard diabetes care.
