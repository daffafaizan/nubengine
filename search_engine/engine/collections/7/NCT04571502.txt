      caregivers, and people with dementia (PWD), where 120 unique dyads of caregivers/PWD will
      participate and healthcare providers will participate in multiple triads. The team plans to
      enroll 60 triads at each of the two participating clinical sites. Participants will be
      randomly assigned to either the full intervention or a minimal intervention for a period of
      12 months, where they will be asked to communicate clinical and other relevant information
      with one another as part of regular caregiving and clinical care activities. Several
      psychosocial outcome variables for providers, caregivers, and PWD will be assessed. We will
      compare outcomes based on group assignment and different amounts and patterns of use of CH
      (e.g., minimal/non-users versus frequent users). The primary outcome variables are quality of
      life for caregivers and PWD.
