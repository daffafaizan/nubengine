      efavirenz (EFV) in combination with two nucleoside analogues is effective at achieving
      maximal viral suppression. This provides an alternative treatment to that of the more toxic
      PI-containing regimen. This trial examines whether a nonPI regimen with EFV is more
      beneficial than a PI-containing regimen when each is used in combination with the same two
      nucleoside analogues. A second part of the study looks at whether the addition of IL-2 may
      offer immunologic benefits as a co-administered drug.

      Patients are randomized to initiate antiretroviral therapy of a PI-based
      (stavudine/didanosine/ritonavir [RTV]/indinavir [IDV]) or nonPI-based
      (stavudine/didanosine/EFV) regimen. Within these treatment arms, they are stratified
      according to a positive or negative p24 antigen result. At Week 16, patients not achieving
      maximal viral suppression (lower than 50 copies/ml) have the option to add abacavir (ABC) or
      other drugs as intensification therapy. Those achieving virologic suppression (less than 50
      copies/ml) are randomized either to receive IL-2 or not. At study entry, and after 12 months,
      tissue samples of CSF, lymph node, and genital secretions are obtained, with permission.
      Patients have physical exams, women of child-bearing potential have pregnancy tests, and
      blood samples are drawn at clinic visits 12-16 times a year over 3 years so that virologic
      and immunologic evaluations may be performed. Compensation for time and transportation is
      given.
