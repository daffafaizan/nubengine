      marked by three distinct symptoms: asthma; eosinophilia, evidenced by an excessive number of
      eosinophils in the blood and tissues; and vasculitis involving the skin, lungs, nerves,
      kidneys, and other organs. Nerve involvement may also occur in EGPA, causing pain, tingling,
      numbness, and muscle wasting in the hands and feet. Because EGPA patients may not show any
      visible signs of active disease, current methods of monitoring disease progression usually
      represent a period of extended inflammation and disease activity. Thus, patients may go
      untreated during a period of undetectable disease when damage might be preventable. This
      study will use novel scientific methods to identify new biomarkers that can be used to
      monitor disease activity in EGPA patients. These biomarkers may be used to help direct
      clinical care for EGPA patients and assist in future drug development.

      Study visits will occur every 6 months, or annually. Blood and urine collection will occur at
      every visit. A physical exam and medical and medication history will at every visit; also,
      participants will be asked to complete several questionnaires to assess disease activity,
      health status, and tobacco, alcohol, and drug use.
