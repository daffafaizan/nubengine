      toothpaste formulations with 1450 parts per million (ppm) of fluoride as sodium fluoride
      (NaF) and 5% potassium nitrate (KNO3) versus a non-fluoride (0 ppm F)/KNO3 toothpaste as a
      negative control. The two experimental gel to foam toothpaste formulations differ in their
      relative dentine abrasivity (RDA) values which is an in-vitro measure of a toothpaste
      abrasivity to the dentinal tissues. A marketed toothpaste containing NaF and KNO3 will serve
      as a positive control.
