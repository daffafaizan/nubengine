    
      The Primary objective is to compare the quality of fixation of cemented and cementless
      designs of GMK-UNI unicompartmental knee replacement at 2 years of follow-up.

      The Secondary objectives include the evaluation of the patient improvement (subjective and
      objective) using the new Knee Society Score (KSS); the patient's anterior pain following UKA
      and any eventual patella-femoral disorder; Implant survival rate using the Kaplan Meier
      analysis; Post-op radiological findings and Adverse Events.

      The Primary outcome aims to compare the occurrence of radiolucency's lines (both partial and
      complete) between the two study groups. Secondary outcomes include New KSS, OKS, Kaplan Meier
      analysis and stability and fixation of UNI prosthesis.

      All patients who meet the inclusion criteria to take part in the current clinical study will
      be invited to participate before the surgery.

      Subjects will be randomized during the screening; half of them will receive the cemented
      GMK-UNI anatomical UKA and the other half the cementless GMK-UNI anatomical UKA.

      Clinical data will be recorded on CRF at those time-points:

        -  Before the surgery

        -  During the surgery

        -  After the surgery at 3 months, 1, 2, 3 and 5 years.
