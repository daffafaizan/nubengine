    
      The objective of this study is to compare the long-term efficacy of treatment with
      combination therapy with peginterferon plus tenofovir versus tenofovir monotherapy in the
      treatment of chronic hepatitis B.

      This is a randomized (1:1) parallel group design trial comparing (i) Tenofovir DF 300 mg
      daily for 192 weeks (4 years) and (ii) peginterferon alfa-2a 180 Âµg weekly for 24 weeks plus
      Tenofovir DF 300 mg daily for 192 weeks (4 years). Enrolled participants will be stratified
      by HBeAg status (positive/negative), genotype (A vs. all others) and cirrhosis (present vs.
      absent). After 192 weeks of treatment, participants meeting criteria for treatment
      discontinuation will stop treatment and be followed for 48 weeks (total duration of treatment
      and follow up is 240 weeks). Emtricitabine/tenofovir coformulated as Truvada, approved for
      treatment of HIV but not for treatment of HBV infection, will be offered to patients with
      primary nonresponse, partial virological response or confirmed virologic breakthrough.
