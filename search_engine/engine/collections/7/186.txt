protein synthesis and polyribosomes in the calf lens .a cell-free system capable of incorporating amino acid into proteinhas been isolated from calf lens . polyribosomes have been shown to bepresent in the ribosomal fraction and to be responsible for most of theprotein-synthesizing capacity of this fraction . the polyribosomes havebeen examined by electron microscopy and appear to be composed of longstrands of ribonucleic acid, ranging from 7,000 a to 20,000 a, and con-taining a large number of ribosomes with an average diameter of about140 a .
