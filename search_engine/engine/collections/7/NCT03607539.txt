      Chinese non-squamous NSCLC na√Øve patients will be investigated in this clinical trial.

      Additionally the correlation between PD-L1 expression and the response to Sintilimab
      treatment in Chinese non-squamous NSCLC as well as the role of iRECIST in immune checkpoint
      inhibitor treatment evaluation will also be assessed.
