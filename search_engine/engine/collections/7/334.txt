377. experimental study of sensitization to nickelsensitization was effected by epicutaneousapplication of nickel sulfate in15 guinea-pigs.  it was confirmed by theappearance of eczematiform lesions inskin tests with nickel sulfate.  for maintenanceof the animals in good generalcondition it was necessary to add vit. c andantiinfective agents to the diet.for this reason the allergenicity of the nisalt had to be augmented by the useof adjuvants (freund's complete adjuvant or alum).such adjuvants act bystimulating the res.  the method forsensitization of guinea-pigs to metal saltshaving been worked out, it is now proposedto study the mechanism of suchsensitization, the biological disturbancesinvolved and the possible existenceof cross-sensitizations.
