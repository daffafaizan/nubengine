      effectively treated with a combination of surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. However,
      patients with metastatic or relapsed disease have a very poor prognosis.

      For the past decade, efforts to increase overall survival and progression-free survival for
      patients with high-risk pediatric and young adult tumors, have evaluated the use of high-dose
      chemotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The proportion of patients
      who enter a complete remission with HSCT is high, ranging from 81 to 90%. While autologous
      HSCT renders a large proportion of patients temporarily disease-free, relapse develops in the
      majority of patients.

      Survival appears to have been most improved with this strategy for neuroblastoma, but
      relapses occur in the majority of patients. Similar strategies have also been tried for
      patients with advanced stage sarcoma and Wilms' tumor, but relapses are even more
      problematic.

      New approaches to the management of these difficult groups of patients are needed. There is
      evidence to suggest that solid tumors may be good candidates for immunotherapy approaches. In
      fact, recent experimental evidence indicates that the period of lymphopenia that occurs after
      HSCT may be an opportune time to use this treatment approach. In light of the very poor
      prognosis of young patients with advanced solid tumors, this treatment approach warrants
      further investigation.
