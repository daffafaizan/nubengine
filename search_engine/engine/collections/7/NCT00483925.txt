      EVIDENCE OF ABNORMALITIES OF CARBOHYDRATE METABOLISM

      Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a rare disease, usually affecting children although it
      has recently increasingly been recognized in adults with a prevalence of approximately
      1/560.000 cases ( , ). LCH is characterized by the aberrant proliferation of dendritic cells
      of the monocyte-macrophage system that resemble normal epidermal Langerhans' cells. These
      cells can infiltrate many sites of the body leading to either localized lesions or widespread
      systemic disease. Although LCH has been shown to be a clonal disorder ( ) it also exhibits
      features of an inflammatory disease, as altered expression of cytokines and cellular adhesion
      molecules important for the migration and homing of Langerhans cell has been documented ( ,
      ). In addition, LCH shows a particular predilection for hypothalamo-pituitary axis (HPA)
      involvement leading to diabetes insipidus and/ or anterior pituitary dysfunction in 15-50%
      and 5-20%, of patients respectively (3, , , ). These percentages may be higher in adult
      patients with multisystem involvement, being 94% and 59% respectively ( ).

      The ongoing inflammatory process and the presence of hypopituitarism are considered to be two
      independent risk factors for cardiovascular diseases probably through the induction of
      insulin resistance (IR) ( , , ). The various therapies used for the treatment of multisystem
      LCH, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and particularly glucocorticoids, may also adversely affect
      the cardiovascular system mostly through IR ( , ). It is therefore possible that patients
      with LCH represent a group at higher risk for cardiovascular diseases through the additive
      effect of a number of different contributing mechanisms known to induce IR. Insulin
      resistance besides producing an adverse metabolic profile can also lead to endothelial
      dysfunction and early vascular disease ( ). Early vascular disease can be detected by
      non-invasive surrogate markers, such as intima-media thickness (IMT) for vascular structure
      properties and flow-mediated vasodilatation (FMD) for vascular functional properties ( , , ).
      Carotid IMT is considered an established marker for early atherosclerotic disease and
      predictor of future cardiovascular events (16) whereas brachial artery FMD has been
      correlated with coronary endothelial function, a well-known predictor of future
      cardiovascular events (18).

      Main outcome measures: Cardiovascular risk factors assessment were estimated in patients with
      LCH and compared to controls; the effect of hypopituitarism, disease activity and/ or
      treatment were determined.

      SUBJECTS AND METHODS All patients have to fulfil the diagnostic criteria for "definitive
      diagnosis" of LCH ( ). Matched to sex, age, and BMI healthy individuals, in good health and
      not receiving any medication known to affect carbohydrate, sex hormone metabolism, and/or
      endothelial function for at least 3 months prior have also to be recruited for the study.

      Clinical data of the patients as well as hormonal and imaging assessment will be registered.

      All subjects do not have participate in strenuous physical activities and have to be on a
      balanced isocaloric diet for at least 4 weeks prior to the study. Current smokers will be
      asked not to smoke one day before the hemodynamic study.

      Cardiovascular risk factors assessment:

      Clinical cardiovascular risk:

        -  BMI

        -  waist circumference

        -  systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure Metabolic Profile

      The metabolic study of all patients will be performed after a 10h overnight fasting:

        -  Oral glucose tolerance test

        -  Glucose, insulin

        -  Total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides

        -  Indices of Insulin resistance [GIR ( ), HOMA ( ), QUICKI ( ), MATSUDA ( ), glucose and
           insulin response to glucose by calculating the area under the curve (AUC) during the
           OGTT performance for glucose (AUCGLU) and insulin (AUCINS), using the trapezoidal rule,
           predicted index of first phase of insulin secretion, predicted index of second phase of
           insulin secretion ( )].

      Hemodynamic studies

        -  The hemodynamic study will be performed, the day after the metabolic study. Both
           functional and structural arterial properties will be assessed by non-invasive, easily
           reproducible hemodynamic ultrasonographic methods, namely: IMT measurement in carotid
           arteries and both endothelium-dependent FMD and endothelium-independent nitrate-induced
           dilatation (NID) measurement in brachial artery. IMT, FMD and NID were measured by
           B-Mode high-resolution ultrasound imaging (VIVID PRO; GENERAL ELECTRIC) ( ).

        -  Arterial stiffness will be assessed by Applanation Tonometry (SphygmocorTM PWV MEDICAL)
           on radial artery.
