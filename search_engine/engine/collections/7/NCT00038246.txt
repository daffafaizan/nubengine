    
      1. Evaluate the maximum tolerated dose of oral daily thalidomide along with Paclitaxel (100
           mg/m^2 as a 3-hour infusion weekly * 2, every 21 days) and oral estramustine phosphate
           (140 mg by mouth three times/day 5 days per week * 2 weeks, every 21 days) for patients
           with metastatic androgen-independent prostate carcinoma.

        2. Evaluate the efficacy of this regimen for patients with metastatic Androgen-Independent
           Prostate Cancer who failed up to two prior non-paclitaxel containing chemotherapy
           regimens, as measured by:

             -  2A. The objective response rate and 'prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response rate'
                of the combination treatment in patients with AI-PCa progressing after
                chemotherapy.

             -  2B. Secondary endpoints: calculate time to disease progression, effect on
                performance status, analgesic consumption, and survival.

        3. To evaluate the toxicity of the combination treatment in patients with metastatic AI-PCa
           progressing after chemotherapy.
