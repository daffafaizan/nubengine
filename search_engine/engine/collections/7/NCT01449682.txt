      clinical trials. However, the duration and frequency of re-treatment have not been
      extensively explored. In addition, no prior studies have tested the efficacy of the DEX
      implant on retinal and macular function using diagnostic testing measurements such as
      multi-focal ERG, microperimetry and RAM testing. Since VA and OCT outcomes do not always
      correlate, these other assessments (mf-ERG, microperimetry, RAM testing) may be useful as
      early predictors of when or if patients should be retreated. This study will assess 2 groups
      (0.7mg PRN and 0.7mg Q16 weeks) and assess high resolution OCT, RAM testing, microperimetry,
      and Multi-focal ERG outcomes. For the PRN group retreated based on any fluid on OCT, we will
      investigate if microperimetry or multifocal ERG changes would have been an earlier predictor
      of fluid returning.
