      of three airtime incentive timings, some of all of that incentive being contingent on their
      completing the noncommunicable disease risk factor survey. This mobile phone survey was sent
      as an interactive voice response (IVR). In IVR surveys, participants use their touch tone key
      pad to answer pre-recorded questions. (i.e. If you are male, press 1; if you are female,
      press 2). This study was conducted in both Bangladesh and Uganda.
