      may still be enhancing AR activity despite reduced testosterone and DHT. Importantly, studies
      from several groups have shown that EGFR and Her2/Neu activation can enhance AR signaling and
      increase AR transcriptional activity in response to low levels of androgens. Evaluation in
      the clinic and lab has shown that there is increased expression of EGFR or Her2/Neu in CRPC.
      In addition to upregulation in EGFR and Her2/Neu protein expression, signaling through these
      receptors may be enhanced in some tumors by increases in growth factor levels or other
      mechanisms. Based on these results, the investigators suggest that EGFR and Her2/Neu
      contribute to enhancing AR transcriptional activity especially at low androgen levels. If
      this hypothesis is correct, then dual blockade of EGFR and Her2/Neu in CRPC should enhance
      the ability of KHAD to abrogate AR activity. Moreover, as androgens can protect PCa cells
      from cell death in response to EGFR/Her2/Neu/PI3 kinase pathway inhibition, we propose that
      KHAD plus lapatinib may be a particularly active combination therapy for CRPC.
