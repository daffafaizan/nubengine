      patients with ST-elevation acute myocardial infarction (STEMI). Data from registry studies
      have suggested that implantation of DES during primary PCI could be associated with an
      increased risk for stent thrombosis, probably due to delayed arterial healing. Unlike first
      generation DES, zotarolimus-eluting stents seems to be associated with complete and uniform
      neointimal coverage. The objective of this prospective study is to measure the completeness
      of strut coverage and vessel wall response to the ENDEAVOR zotarolimus-eluting stent vs the
      DRIVER stent (bare metal stent of identical metallic platform) implanted in STEMI patients.
      Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) that detects smaller degrees of stent strut coverage more
      accurately than IVUS will be used at 6 months follow-up. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) will
      be performed as per normal practice at any index procedures and at 6 months follow-up.
