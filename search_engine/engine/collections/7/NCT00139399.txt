      vivo conduits when used in coronary artery bypass grafting is also likely to be different.
      This may partly explain the predisposition of veins used as coronary conduits to accelerated
      atherosclerosis in comparison with the internal mammary artery grafts. There are presently
      few data describing the properties of the radial artery as an in-vivo coronary conduit over
      the longer-term.

      The study will compare angiographic patency of the radial artery or saphenous vein graft
      anastomosed to the native left circumflex coronary territory at 3 months and 5 years after
      surgery. A substudy will compare 5-year post-surgery diameter and blood flow of in-vivo
      radial artery and saphenous vein grafts in response to endothelium-dependent and
      non-endothelium-dependent stimuli when patients attend for their scheduled follow-up
      angiogram.
