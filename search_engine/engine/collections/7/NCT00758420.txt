    
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of polidocanol injectable foam vs
      placebo treatments in relief of symptoms using two disease specific questionnaires,
      establishment of a minimally important difference (MID) for the questionnaires, improvement
      in the appearance of visible varicosities by a patient and medical assessments aided by pre
      and post treatment photographs, and a central independent assessor evaluating pre and post
      treatment photographs. In addition, the study will evaluate the efficacy of polidocanol
      injectable foam vs the placebo treatment in the elimination of SFJ reflux or occlusion of the
      treated vein, and to determine whether the placebo procedure blinds the patient to treatment
      assignment.
