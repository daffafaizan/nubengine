    
      Septic shock is low blood pressure caused by an infection. Sepsis is the most common cause of
      death in non-cardiac intensive care units, and septic shock is the most severe form of
      sepsis. Treatment for septic shock includes giving antibiotics, intravenous fluids, and
      medications to raise the blood pressure (vasopressors).

      We would like to see if a protocol-driven management strategy for septic shock can shorten
      time on vasopressors and limit the number of side effects. We have constructed a protocol
      that will allow the nurse at the bedside, in conjunction with the physician's orders, to
      adjust the amount of fluids and medications that raise the blood pressure (vasopressors).
