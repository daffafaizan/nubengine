      National Taiwan University Hospital were retrospectively collected. The cancer registration
      database was searched for the patients with ovarian carcinoma who brain metastases were also
      diagnosed. The medical records of these patients were reviewed with particular attention to
      the results of histo-pathological and radiologic reports. Patients with other synchronous
      primary brain tumor were excluded. The initial management of primary tumor, including the
      surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy, and the clinical courses and disease status, such as
      remission, recurrence and progression, were all carefully reviewed. The intra-cranial lesions
      were all diagnosed by imaging studies, including brain computed tomography (CT) and magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Therapeutic strategies for the metastatic lesions in the brain
      were also reviewed. All statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS 13.0 statistical
      software for Windows. P<0.05 was defined as statistical significance. Survival was measured
      from the time of initial diagnosis of brain metastasis until the date of death or last
      contact, and was presented by Kaplan-Meier curves.
