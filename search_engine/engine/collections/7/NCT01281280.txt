      study directly comparing Best Medical Practice with and without adjunctive VNS Therapy.

      In July 2008, the decision was made to discontinue this study due to lower than expected
      enrolment, impairing the possibility to meet the primary objective with appropriate
      statistical power. However, the relatively large number of participants (n=121) randomized in
      the original PuLsE study offers the possibility to generate scientifically valuable and
      original findings if additional follow-up data can be gathered. After consultation with the
      PuLsE Investigators, Cyberonics decided to implement an observational long-term follow-up of
      the participants enrolled in the original PuLsE study.
