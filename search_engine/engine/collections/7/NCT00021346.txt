      patients with advanced solid tumors. II. Determine the dose-limiting toxic effects of this
      regimen in these patients. III. Evaluate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of this
      regimen in these patients. IV. Determine the observed responses in these patients receiving
      this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of gemcitabine. Patients are stratified according to
      prior therapy (no prior chemotherapy and/or prior radiotherapy to less than 20% of bone
      marrow vs prior chemotherapy and/or prior radiotherapy to at least 20% of bone marrow).
      Patients receive carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1 and gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes
      on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 1-3 patients receive escalating doses of gemcitabine until
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that
      at which 2 of 3 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed for
      survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 18 patients (9 per stratum) will be accrued for this study.
