      various forms of edema. Edema can limit function, range of motion (ROM) and increase pain
      after surgery. Studies have shown that decreasing edema can increase knee strength and
      functional performance on various standardized measures. MLD has been shown to be effective
      in patients with hind foot operations and increases ROM post total knee replacement (TKR)
      surgery. The aim of this study is to determine whether MLD on a sample of patients with TKR
      will decrease edema, increase ROM and decrease pain as compared to TKR patients who do not
      receive MLD.
