      inclusion criteria will be randomized intraoperatively, based on a complete assessment of
      eligibility, just before the mesh placement.

      Patients recruited in closed suction drain arm will receive suction drain(14 French sizes) in
      preperitoneal space via a separate incision. The patients without drain arm, the regular
      postoperative course will be followed.

      The drain will be removed once the output falls below 50 ml per day. Both groups will be
      followed up until three months post-surgery.

      Clinical suspicion of seroma in symptomatic patients will be confirmed by ultrasound. Seroma
      will be managed conservatively till three weeks in the post-op period.
