    
      Objectives:

      To show that (i) expression of mRNA and proteins of the RANKL pathway (RANK, RANKL, OPG) in
      liver and (ii) serum concentration of RANKL/OPG proteins are correlated with the gravity of
      the NAFLD.

      Study protocol:

      Identify patients with different stages of NAFLD (mere steatosis, NASH, and moderate or
      advanced fibrosis) from the database of patients who have undergone liver biopsy in the
      hepatology department of the Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital . From the hepatic tissue, the
      paraffin-embedded liver biopsies and the serum of these patients, study of the expression of
      mRNA (quantitative RtPCR) and proteins (immunohistochemistry, western blots) of the RANKL
      pathway (RANK, RANKL, OPG) in liver. In the serum of these patients, measure of concentration
      of RANKL and OPG proteins as described above.

      Study Type: monocentric, observational, case-control, analytical study Study duration: 18
      months (time for data collection, for cellular biological experimentations and for data
      analysis)

      Patient Population:

      5 groups of patients very well phenotyped and with liver biopsy (with at our disposal frozen
      liver tissue, paraffin-embedded liver tissue and serum for all the patients):

        -  1) steatosis group (n=10)

        -  2) NASH group without fibrosis (n=10)

        -  3) moderate fibrosis (n=10)

        -  4) advanced fibrosis (n=10)

        -  5) healthy control group without liver disease (n=10) Comprehensive clinical and
           laboratory data were observed at the time of the liver biopsy and are available for all
           the patients.
