      use it daily.The overall aim of this study is to pilot the program, evaluation metrics,
      implementation strategies, data collection and assessment procedures for a larger
      implementation trial. During the trial, participants will be prompted to complete the PHQ-8
      and GAD-7 every week. At monthly intervals, participants will be prompted within the app to
      complete the Depression Literacy Questionnaire and Anxiety Literacy Questionnaire to measure
      mental health literacy, the Knowledge and Beliefs about Services scale to measure knowledge
      of campus mental health services, the Barriers to Mental Health Help-Seeking questionnaire to
      measure treatment barriers, and the Cognitive and Behavioral Response to Stress Scale to
      measure cognitive and behavioral coping skills. Counseling center utilization data will be
      extracted from the participating counseling centers' electronic medical records.
