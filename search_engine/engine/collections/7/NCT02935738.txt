      Embryo Research, Erbil, Kurdistan Region, Iraq and the Baghdad University Teaching Hospital
      of the College of Medicine, University of Baghdad, Baghdad, Iraq between October 2014 and May
      2016. In all cases, the wife's ova were inseminated with the husband's semen samples.
      Identified men with positive ASAs were randomly assigned for treatment with or without
      prednisolone for three cycles. Infertile men were treated with prednisolone tablet, po, for
      21 days of their wife's menstrual cycles. Briefly, the prednisolone regimen was started with
      a dose of 5mg, tid, for two weeks followed by 5mg bid for five days. This was further tapered
      to one tablet of 5mg/day for two days. Patients were then given one week of rest from the
      treatment, before this prednisolone regimen was repeated for another two cycles

      Treated men that recovered from ASAs and control patients underwent SPA. Patients with
      positive or negative SPA results were then admitted to conventional IVF or ICSI cycles,
      respectively. Only the first embryo transfer cycle following IVF or ICSI was included in this
      analysis.
