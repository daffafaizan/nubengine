      2009 to 31st December 2022.

      Risk factors prompting MRI evaluation included: (1) premature rupture of fetal membrane,
      intrauterine distress or placental abruption before delivery; (2) asphyxia, resuscitation and
      rescue history, circulatory dysfunction and infection during or after delivery; and (3) early
      convulsions.

      1.2 Assessment of brain injury MRI scans were analyzed by a radiologist and a newborn
      pediatrician who were unfamiliar with the clinical history. WMI diagnosis was carried out as
      described by reference, with some improvements.

      1.3 Collection of clinical data Data, including delivery by cesarean section, gestational
      hypertension, diabetes mellitus, premature rupture of membranes and placental abruption, were
      collected for the mothers. Gestational age, weight, gender, whether small for gestational
      age, Apgar score, resuscitation history, circulatory disorders, early-onset sepsis,
      convulsions, and MRI data were collected for the newborns.

      History of resuscitation and rescue refers to positive pressure ventilation, tracheal
      intubation, chest compression or epinephrine application during labor; circulatory disorders
      include at least two of the following indicators: prolonged capillary filling time,
      hypotension, oliguria, increased heart rate and increased liver.

      1.4 Instrumentation MRI of the head was performed using an Intera Achieva 3.0T MRI system
      (Philips, Best, Netherlands). All infants were scanned by conventional MRI and
      diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). Because of the retrospective study design, there are
      differences in imaging schemes, sequences and parameters measured.
