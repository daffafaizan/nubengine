    
      Objectives: To evaluate patients with epilepsy

      Study Population: adults and children with epilepsy

      Design: In this protocol we will use standard clinical studies, including neurologic
      examination, antiepileptic drug levels, clinical neurophysiology (EEG, EMG, evoked
      potentials, simultaneous Video-EEG monitoring, polysomnography), computed tomography,
      structural functional, and spectroscopic magnetic resonance imaging, and other studies, such
      as FDG-PET (performed by nuclear medicine as a clinical procedure) and neuropsychological
      testing, to evaluate patients referred for uncontrolled or suspected seizures. Tests will be
      performed in patients when clinically indicated. The protocol will be used to screen patients
      for inclusion in other protocols, follow the natural history of seizure disorders, and train
      fellows in the evaluation and treatment of epilepsy. Both inpatients and outpatients will be
      studied. Standard clinical evaluation and drug treatment of epilepsy is performed under this
      protocol.
