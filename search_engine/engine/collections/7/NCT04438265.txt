      initially described for the management of postoperative pain in abdominal surgery due to its
      suggested effect on the T7-11 roots. The analgesic efficacy of type 1 lumbar square block
      (QL1) in hip surgery was subsequently published. Regarding chronic pain, QL2 has been
      successfully performed in posttherniorrhaphy pain or pancreatic cancer.

      This quadratus lumborum type 2 is performed in the patients with hip joint based on the
      innervation of the hip and taking the role of thoraco-lumbar fascia in the analgesia of these
      patients as a reference. The good results obtained in the first 5 patients have led us to
      evaluate whether this blockade can indeed be an analgesic alternative in patients with
      coxarthrosis.
