    
      A Phase 2, double-blind clinical study of multiple ascending doses of KHK4083 (or placebo)
      with an Long-term Extension Therapy (LTE) phase will be conducted in approximately 60
      randomized adult subjects with moderately active UC who have a documented unsuccessful
      previous treatment.

      The Treatment Period includes double-blind Induction Therapy (12 weeks) and Open-label
      Therapy (OLE) phase (40 weeks) for eligible subjects at Week 12. Subjects already enrolled in
      the double-blind, long-term extension (LTE) under preceding versions of the protocol who
      worsen may be eligible to transition to the OLE up to Week 28.

      The Follow Up Period after the last administration will be for up to 16 weeks.
