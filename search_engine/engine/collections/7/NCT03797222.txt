      that causes persistent and severe hypoglycemia starting at birth.
      Hyperinsulinism/hyperammonemia (HI/HA) syndrome is the second most common type of congenital
      HI and is caused by activating mutations in glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH). Patients with
      HI/HA exhibit fasting hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia, protein-induced hypoglycemia,
      hyperammonemia, seizures, and intellectual disability independent of hypoglycemia. These
      effects result from abnormal GDH activity in the beta cells, liver and kidney cells, neurons,
      and astrocytes. The only available treatment for HI/HA syndrome is diazoxide, which acts on
      the beta cells to decrease insulin secretion but has no effect on GDH activity itself or on
      other cell types. Thus, there remains a significant unmet need for improved therapies for
      this disorder. Preliminary data show that Vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) inhibits GDH activity
      in cell lines and improves hypoglycemia in a GDH HI mouse model. Based on these preclinical
      studies, Investigators hypothesize that Vitamin E will inhibit GDH activity and may impact
      hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia and hyperammonemia in subjects with HI/HA syndrome. This
      hypothesis will be tested in a future study. In this initial pilot study, investigators will
      assess the tolerability of oral Vitamin E supplementation in subjects with HI/HA syndrome.
