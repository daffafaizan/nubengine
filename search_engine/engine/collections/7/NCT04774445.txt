      unknowns after genetic testing. Many have results that are unclear and may or may not be
      associated with any risk for cancer (Variants of Uncertain Significance), or mutations in
      genes with very limited information about disease risk or the best medical management.
      Importantly, many of these uncertainties will be clarified over time, but there is a need for
      effective ways of communicating these updates to patients who had testing months or years
      ago. In some cases, there may be multiple updates over time. To address this, this study will
      provide patients access, using an Interactive Health Communication Application, MyCancerGene,
      to information about their genetic testing, their specific results and the implications, the
      ability to print reports and other materials for their relatives and other health care
      providers and to assess if there has been a change in the personal or family history.
      Additionally, patients can contact their genetic provider through MyCancerGene and the cancer
      genetics team can send out updates to patients about their individual results or about new
      information about risk estimates or screening recommendations. The study investigators
      hypothesize that MyCancerGene will be associated with increases in knowledge, decreases in
      distress, increases in communication with relatives and health care providers, and increases
      in cancer screening and risk reducing health behaviors. After 18 months, all patients will
      have access to MyCancerGene, which will aid in understanding who benefits most and least from
      this intervention.
