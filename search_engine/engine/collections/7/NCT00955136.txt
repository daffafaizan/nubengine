      perfluorocarbon-containing microbubbles, the ultrasonic power delivered from a diagnostic
      ultrasound transducer is capable of restoring microcirculatory flow and improving epicardial
      recanalization rates following acute coronary thrombotic occlusions. Since both diagnostic
      ultrasound and intravenous infusions of microbubbles are a Class I indication to assess
      regional and global left ventricular function and risk area in patients with ST segment
      elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), this pilot study will examine whether diagnostic
      assessments of left ventricular function and risk area size impacts epicardial recanalization
      rates and infarct size in STEMI.

      The aim of this study is to test whether guided high mechanical index impulses from a
      diagnostic transducer during a continuous infusion of intravenous microbubbles are capable of
      improving microvascular recanalization and epicardial recanalization rates in STEMI, as
      assessed by coronary angiography, and recovery of regional microvascular perfusion and
      function in the post-infarction period.
