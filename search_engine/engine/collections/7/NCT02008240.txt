      outcomes has been confirmed by several retrospective and prospective studies .

      Cochrane review of prospective randomised trials of laparoscopic salpingectomy confirmed the
      beneficial effect of laparoscopic salpingectomy on IVF-ET outcomes in patients with
      hydrosalpinges.

      Surgery is not usually safe especially in patients with extensive adhesions, morbid obesity
      or previous multiple laparotomies. Furthermore, many infertile couples refuse to undergo
      bilateral salpingectomy or proximal tubal occlusion because these procedures remove any hope
      of spontaneous pregnancy. Other less invasive options for patients with hydrosalpinges as
      ultrasound-guided aspiration of hydrosalpingeal fluid, antibiotics (alone or combined with
      aspiration) and hysteroscopic occlusion of fallopian tube were studied in order to find an
      alternative to salpingectomy . Although these methods are simple and getting popular, current
      data are inadequate to recommend these treatment options instead of salpingectomy because
      most of the supporting evidences for these methods come from small retrospective studies.

      A recent randomized controlled trial revealed that the aspiration of hydrosalpingeal fluid at
      the time of oocyte retrieval was associated with improved implantation rate and pregnancy
      rates.

      The aim of this randomized controlled trial is to compare the efficacy of ultrasound guided
      aspiration of hydrosalpingeal fluid with salpingectomy in the management patients with
      ultrasound visible hydrosalpinges undergoing IVF-ET
