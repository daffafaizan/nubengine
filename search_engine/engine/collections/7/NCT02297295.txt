      some cardiovascular aspects (first domain of ICF). But as the investigators know, there is no
      evidence that this improvement is connected with a significant benefit on the performance of
      daily live activities and social participation (second and third domains of the ICF).

      The investigators want to determine benefits of exercise medicine on all of these domains.
