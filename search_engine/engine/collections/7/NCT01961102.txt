      aspect in the hysteroscopy if it is a clearly benign result or if it looks suspicious or
      malign.

      In case of a hysteroscopical benign result the patient will be informed about the result
      after the operation.

      In case of a hysteroscopal suspicious or malignant aspect, the curettement will be sent for a
      rapid section. If the hysteroscopic result confirms the hysteroscopic suspicion the patient
      will be informed after the operation and the further treatment can be planned right away.
