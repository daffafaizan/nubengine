    
      A Phase IV randomized multi-site prospective study to assess PrEP acceptance and adherence
      among HIV-uninfected young women. All women who accept open-label daily oral PrEP will be
      randomized 1:1 to receive enhanced adherence counselling based on feedback from observed drug
      levels or standard adherence support. A subset of up to ~25 women per site (maximum 75), will
      participate in qualitative assessments of facilitators and barriers for PrEP acceptance,
      adherence and continuation.
