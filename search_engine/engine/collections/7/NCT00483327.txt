      of disease, of a standard hormonal regimen with the progestin Megace for the treatment of
      atypical endometrial hyperplasia or well or moderately differentiated endometrial carcinoma
      in women desiring conservative medical management of these conditions in the Women's Cancer
      Program at the NYU School of Medicine and at the Bellevue Gynecologic Oncology clinics.

      The major endpoint is pathologic complete response (pCR). For the purposes of this study,
      patients will be reevaluated for response every 12 weeks until complete response. Response
      will be assessed within 4 weeks of completion of 12 weeks of Megace, by endometrial biopsy or
      dilation and curettage (D&C)/hysteroscopy. An endometrial biopsy is sufficient to document
      progressive, stable disease or partial response. A D&C is necessary to confirm complete
      response.

      Patients whose disease has completely responded will discontinue treatment and be encouraged
      to pursue fertility. Those not desiring immediate fertility will be placed on low dose oral
      contraceptive pills for at least 6 months. Patients who have had either a partial response or
      stable disease will be recounseled and offered continued medical management or surgical
      therapy. Patients whose disease has progressed will be offered definitive surgical
      management. Those patients declining surgery will still be followed on study.
