    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of
      edodekin alfa (recombinant human interleukin [rhIL]-12) in combination with pembrolizumab
      (MK-3475).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the safety of the regimen by continuously monitoring adverse events that will be
      documented utilizing Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (v).5.0.

      II. Evaluate the overall response rate (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST]
      v.1.1) and the progression free survival of patients enrolled on the study.

      III. Measure CD8+ T cell infiltration by immunohistochemistry in tumor biopsies obtained
      pre-treatment, after one week of rhIL-12 and after 2 cycles of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in
      combination with rhIL-12.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Conduct exploratory translational laboratory correlative studies utilizing banked
      biospecimens (tumor, blood, and stool) obtained pre-treatment and during therapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of recombinant interleukin-12.

      Patients receive recombinant interleukin-12 subcutaneously (SC) on days 2, 5, 9, and 12 and
      pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 8 of cycle 1 and day 1 of subsequent
      cycles. Treatment continues for 28 days for cycle 1 and repeats every 21 days for subsequent
      cycles for up to 8 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patient then receive pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21
      days for up to 8 additional cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 12 weeks for 2 year and
      then every 24 weeks for up to 5 years.
