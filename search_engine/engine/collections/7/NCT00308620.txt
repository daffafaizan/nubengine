      A phase I randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial to investigate the efficacy of
      chloroquine to decrease T-cell activation and decrease viral load in early HIV.

      Scientific Rationale:

      Chloroquine has in vivo direct anti-HIV effects and an anti-inflammatory effect. These
      properties may be beneficial in reducing viral burden and immune activation therefore
      delaying HIV disease progression.

      Sample Size: 25

      Length of Study: 8 weeks, [enrollment + 2 follow up visits].

      Intervention:

        -  Arm 1a: Chloroquine 250mg orally once daily for 8 weeks.

        -  Arm 1b: Chloroquine 500mg orally once daily for 8 weeks.

        -  Arm 2: Placebo once daily for 8 weeks.

      Measurements:

        -  Blood draws at weeks: 0, 4, and 8 weeks.

        -  CD4, viral load measurements will be communicated to the referring provider (with
           subject consent).
