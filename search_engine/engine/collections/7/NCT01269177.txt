      high-risk patients could help in better locating human and technical resources and in
      deciding adequate treatment and site of care.

      The investigators planned a real life, multicentric, prospective, web-based observational
      study performed in Italian Emergency Departments.

      The investigators enroll consecutive patients admitted to the Emergency Department with acute
      cardiogenic pulmonary edema, that is defined as all the following: respiratory distress,
      bilateral rales and congestion on chest X-ray.

      Demographic, clinical and laboratory findings are collected on admission and during
      hospitalization to evaluate mortality and risk factors related to mortality.
