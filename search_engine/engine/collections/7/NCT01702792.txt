      twice and separated by one week. The first vaccination will be performed approximately 2
      weeks after surgery.

      Approximately one week after the second vaccination one or two vaccine-draining lymph node(s)
      will be removed. The lymph node(s) will be identified using SN technology. One or two lymph
      node(s) will be removed.

      Lymph nodes will be processed for recovery of B cells and formation of hybridomas.
