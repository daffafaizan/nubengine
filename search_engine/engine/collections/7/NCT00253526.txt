      Primary

        -  Compare the disease-free interval in patients with adenocarcinoma of the pancreas
           treated with surgical resection followed by adjuvant gemcitabine hydrochloride with vs
           without bevacizumab.

      Secondary

        -  Compare overall survival in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Evaluate tumor gene expression profiles and levels of tumor angiogenesis markers to
           establish prognostic indicators for response in patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, controlled study.

      All patients undergo surgical resection for the pancreatic tumor. Within 4-8 weeks after
      surgery, patients are stratified according to projected 2-year survival (≤ 5% vs > 5% and ≤
      33% vs > 33%). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 100 minutes on days 1, 8, and
           15, and bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15. Treatment repeats every 28
           days for 6 courses. Patients then receive bevacizumab IV alone every 2 weeks for up to 2
           years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 100 minutes on days 1, 8, and
           15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression
           or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 130 patients will be accrued for this study.
