    
      This randomized controlled trial is intended to be the first in a series of trials that will
      assess the efficacy of drugs, which relieve neuropathic pain, on stimulus-evoked pain (here:
      mechanical hyperalgesia to static punctate stimuli). Most drugs in this class (e.g.
      Gabapentin or NMDA receptor inhibitors) have NNT beyond 3 in patients with chronic pain, due
      to a response rate of 30 to 50 %. One potential reason for this low overall efficacy might be
      the presence of different pathophysiological mechanisms in subgroups of patients, who suffer
      from the same disease (e.g. postherpetic neuralgia, diabetic neuropathy). These mechanisms
      may include central sensitization on one hand and peripheral degeneration of afferent fibers
      on the other hand.

      In this trial, we will use a battery of mechanical and thermal Quantitative Sensory Tests
      (QST), using non-nociceptive and low-intensity painful stimuli, to identify a subgroup of
      patients with mechanical hyperalgesia. To overcome the well-known low response rate in trials
      with neuropathic pain patients, an enriched design comparing active drugs with placebo will
      be performed, including only patients with high intensity of on-going pain in combination
      with mechanical hyperalgesia as sequelae of different, but well defined neurological
      disorders. The blinded phase of the trial will be restricted to so-called responders, i.e.
      patients with a clinically meaningful pain reduction of at least 30% in the primary end point
      (mechanical hyperalgesia). The second objective of this trial is to evaluate, whether the
      anti-hyperalgesic effect of the active drug is dependent on the QST profile.
