    
      Flow-controlled ventilation (FCV) is a novel ventilation method with promising first results
      in porcine studies as well as clinical trials. A more efficient and maybe lung protective
      ventilation strategy would be crucial in the challenging situation of one lung ventilation
      during thoracic surgery, when the whole gas exchange has to be provided by just one half of
      the lungs. It could not only improve respiratory values, but also decrease the incidence of
      postoperative pulmonary complications, which is a major cause of death after thoracic
      surgery.

      Thus, individualized FCV, based on compliance guided pressure settings, will be compared to
      best clinical practice pressure-controlled ventilation in thoracic surgery requiring one lung
      ventilation in a randomized controlled trial. Based on a previous preclinical trial improved
      oxygenation will be expected and thus arterial partial pressure of oxygen (pO2) is the main
      primary outcome parameter of this study. Furthermore, improved recruitment of lung tissue due
      to controlled expiratory flow in FCV will be anticipated without the need of recruitment
      maneuvers, which may cause deleterious effects on lung tissue.
