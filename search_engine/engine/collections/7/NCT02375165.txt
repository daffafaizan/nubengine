      vascular insufficiency would represent a highly significant development for the patient
      community. Accurate bioassay for the presence of lymphatic vascular insufficiency should help
      to pave the road for future human clinical trials of experimental drugs and therapies
      designed to treat human lymphatic diseases. Molecular profiling will be performed in human
      tissues (skin) obtained by biopsy. The insights gained from these initial analyses will
      determine the targets for assay in human body fluids (blood). A subset analysis will be
      performed to assess the molecular profile of responses to ketoprofen, which has been
      identified to have a therapeutic benefit in lymphedema.
