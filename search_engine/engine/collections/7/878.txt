hypopituitarism: a study of growthhormone and other endocrine functions.pituitary function was evaluated in 25 adults withevidence of hypopituitarism or enlargement of the sellaturcica.  growth hormone secretory function was measuredby radioimmunoassay of plasma samples takenbefore and after insulin-induced hypoglycemia in a standardizedtest of growth hormone reserve.  all patientsexhibited significant defects in growth hormone secretion,as indicated by the failure of this hormone to riseto normal levels in response to hypoglycemia.  the orderof frequency of hormonal loss was: growth hormone,gonadotropin, adrenocorticotropic hormone, thyroidstimulating hormone.  no pattern of deficiency was characteristicfor any particular etiology of hypopituitarism.one patient with asymptomatic enlargement of the sellaturcica (accidentally discovered) had an isolated lossof growth hormone secretory capacity.  two patients inthe series demonstrated intrinsic deficiency of thyroidas well as pituitary secretion, and both had elevatedliters of antithyroid antibodies.  this study representsthe first direct evaluation, by radioimmunoassay ofgrowth hormone function in a series of hypopituitaryadults.  it demonstrates a remarkably high prevalenceof growth hormone loss, and suggests that the growthhormone response to hypoglycemia may be one of themost sensitive tests for the diagnosis of hypopituitarism.
