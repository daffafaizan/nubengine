      Breast MRIs have been reported to have higher sensitivity than mammograms for detecting early
      breast cancers, particularly in dense breasts where mammograms are not as effective. Although
      breast MRIs may add important information not provided by mammograms, the MRI must be used
      selectively. This is because the MRI is very sensitive and may show a false positive test (a
      test that shows cancer when there is none there).

      Study Procedures:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, the following procedures will be
      performed 1 time a year.

        -  You will have a breast exam.

        -  You will have a mammogram. A mammogram is a breast x-ray used to detect breast cancer
           and look for abnormalities in the breast.

        -  You will have an MRI of your breasts. For the MRI, you will lay on your stomach while a
           large donut-shaped scanner takes images of your breasts.

      If any abnormality is found, you will have routine follow-up procedures performed. Routine
      follow-up may include additional imaging scans or biopsies. These will follow the standard of
      care, and the information will be collected and stored in your medical record.

      Length of Study:

      You will be on study for 20 years, with annual check-ups with breast imaging studies at M. D.
      Anderson. You will be taken off study if there is a change in your health that will not allow
      a breast mammogram or MRI, such as becoming pregnant.

      This is an investigational study.

      Up to 223 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.
