      indispensable method for acquiring a pathological diagnosis in a variety of clinical
      conditions. It has been widely used due to the high sensitivity, specificity and safety. In
      order to improve the puncture efficiency of FNA, many domestic and oversea scholars have
      conducted several clinical trials. Among them, there are many studies on the type of needle,
      needle pattern, slow pull or vacuum suction, and there are only two related reports on wet
      suction (saline) and dry suction technique. There still have many controversies in the
      researchers about which technique is more dominant in the wet or dry suction. The wet suction
      technique is relying on pre-flushing the needle with saline to replace the column of air with
      fluid followed by aspiration at the proximal end, using a prefilled suction syringe with
      saline. It has been suggested that the presence of a saline-solution column might keep the
      needle from getting clogged while avoiding the inherent inconvenience of a metal stylet, so
      that it can improve the quality of specimens, diminish the contamination of blood, and
      increase the diagnostic yield and accuracy. Wet suction may become the development trend of
      EUS-FNA in the future because the application of wet suction is expected to improve the
      diagnostic efficiency and the quality of samples in FNA.
