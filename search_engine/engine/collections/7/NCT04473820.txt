    
      Lidocain-Prilocaine combination cream is two amide-type local anesthetics used for topical
      skin anesthesia. Vapocoolant spray is also another method for providing appropriate analgesia
      through crayoanesthetic mechanisms. Although there are some contraindications and adverse
      effects, these are widely used in the Emergency Department (ED) for IV cannulation pain.
