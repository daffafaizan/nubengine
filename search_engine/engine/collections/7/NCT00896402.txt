        1. The femoral nerve catheter will be removed after 48 hours and a culture of the distal
           tip of the femoral nerve catheter will be performed between the 2 arms.

        2. immediately before skin antisepsis, a culture of the the skin will be performed to
           identify baseline skin flora.

        3. immediately after antisepsis with both betadine and chlorhexidine, a culture of the skin
           will be performed to assess antiseptic efficacy.

        4. just prior to removal of the femoral nerve catheter, a culture of the skin/catheter
           interface will be performed between the 2 arms.
