      Gingival recession defects were randomly divided into two groups. Tunnel technique +
      connective tissue graft was applied to 20 patients in the control group (51 defects) and
      tunnel technique + concentrated growth factor membrane was applied to 20 patients in the test
      group (57 defects). The results at baseline and 6 months were evaluated for the following
      clinical parameters: Mean root coverage, complete root coverage, probing depth, clinical
      attachment level, gingival recession depth, gingival recession width, keratinized tissue
      width and gingival thickness.
