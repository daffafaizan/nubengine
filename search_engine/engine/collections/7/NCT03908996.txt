      program for a period of 12 months. They will work with a Profile lifestyle coach weekly to
      develop a personalized nutrition plan, discuss their activity, and lifestyle behavior as done
      with all Profile members. A comparison of similar retrospective chart reviews based on age,
      weight in pounds and stage of cancer will be conducted using the Electronic Medical Record
      (EMR). All enrolled subjects will collect and return a fecal specimen prior to beginning the
      weight management plan and again after 6 months of participation. The stool sample will be
      used to understand gut health.
