      of a rapid evaluation pathway for suspected ACS using the Beckman hs-cTnI assay. As the new
      protocol is executed across 9 EDs within an integrated health system, the investigators will
      study its effects on patient and system-level metrics. A modified stepped wedge design will
      be utilized that allows comparison of the RACE-IT pathway with standard of care management
