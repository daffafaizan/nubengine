      measurements in a total of 330 children ( 660 samples) in the age from 4 to 16 years ols.
      This samples are going to be used to define a reference range for saliva cortisol in
      children.

      The investigators are then collecting 24 hour urine and saliva samples ( morning and late
      evening) from children at the obesity clinic Haukeland University hospital for verification
      of the reference range , and to estimate if the test is good enough to identify the patients
      that have Cushings syndrome.

      Since the diagnose is very seldom in children, we will get help from a 3. line referral
      center in London to include patients with true Cushings syndrome.
