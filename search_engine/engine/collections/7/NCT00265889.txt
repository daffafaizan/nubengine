      Primary

        -  Determine the 3-year progression-free survival of patients with progressive or recurrent
           Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with tandem autologous stem cell transplantation (2 courses
           of high-dose therapy with autologous stem cell rescue).

        -  Determine the response rate in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study. Patients are stratified according to risk (poor risk [primary
      progressive, recurrent, or resistant relapse] vs good risk [first recurrence]).

        -  Salvage therapy (for patients with relapsed disease after achieving a previous complete
           response): Patients receive at least 2 courses of salvage chemotherapy or radiotherapy.

        -  Autologous hematopoietic stem cell collection: Patients undergo autologous hematopoietic
           stem cell collection. Patients with an inadequate number of collected stem cells are
           removed from the study.

        -  First preparative regimen: Patients receive high-dose melphalan IV continuously over 16
           hours on day -1.

        -  First autologous stem cell transplantation (SCT): Patients undergo autologous SCT on day
           0. They also receive filgrastim (G-CSF) IV over 30 minutes once daily beginning on day 5
           and continuing until blood counts recover. At least 4-8 weeks later, patients proceed to
           second preparative regimen.

        -  Second preparative regimen: Patients receive high-dose carmustine IV over 1-2 hours on
           days -6, -5, and -4, etoposide IV over 4 hours on day -3, and cyclophosphamide IV over 2
           hours on day -2. Beginning 36-48 hours later, patients proceed to the second autologous
           SCT (day 0).

        -  Second autologous SCT: Patients undergo second autologous SCT on day 0. Patients also
           receive filgrastim (G-CSF) IV over 30 minutes once daily beginning on day 5 and
           continuing until blood counts recover.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 34 patients will be accrued for this study.
