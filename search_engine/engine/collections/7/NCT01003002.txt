      movements (dyskinesias; LID) caused by the gold standard treatment, Levodopa. The severity of
      these movements can range from subtle to extremely debilitating and may or may not interfere
      with normal activities such as putting on a coat or brushing ones teeth. Current estimates of
      the prevalence of LID widely range from 12 % to 100% affected after one year. The purpose of
      this study is to estimate the median onset time of levodopa induced dyskinesia in newly
      treated Parkinson's disease patients. All participants will complete seven overnight visits
      at the OCTRI Inpatient unit over 5 years. During the next day, participants will complete a
      mental task while standing on a force plate for one minute every half hour until the end of
      the study. A levodopa IV infusion will occur from 0900 to 1100.
