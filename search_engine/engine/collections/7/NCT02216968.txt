      the amount of vegetable's (V) intake consumed by preschool children who are predominately
      African-American (AA) and Hispanic-American (HA).The primary endpoint will be changes in V
      consumption in high school children with the hypothesis that a puppet intervention will
      increase their V consumption by preschool children. To achieve the project goal, our specific
      aims (SA) are to: SA1: Successfully recruit 6 preschool (PS) centers and 168 AA and 168 HA
      children 3 to 5 y enrolled there. SA2: Conduct individual interviews for formative assessment
      of the PUPPET shows. SA3: Develop the manual of operation and intervention protocols SA4:
      Develop 4 videotaped theatre-based PUPPET shows that are developmentally and cognitively
      appropriate for use with 3- to 5-year-old AA and HA children SA5: Pilot-test the feasibility
      of the PUPPET intervention with 3 intervention and 3 control HS centers. SA6: Use the data
      collected in Aim 5 to estimate parameters required to conduct a group randomized trial for an
      evaluation of the efficacy of the intervention. The primary hypothesis (H1) to be tested is
      that children who receive the PUPPET intervention will demonstrate increased V consumption in
      HS compared to children in the control group.
