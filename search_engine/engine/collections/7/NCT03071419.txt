    
      All participants (low-income father and child dyads) will receive an 8 session (2
      hours/session) (DAD) including community-based, hands-on, nutrition and parent education
      intervention with between-session technology enhancements. Dyads will be randomly assigned
      within groups of 10 to DAD or a wait-list control group (DELAY). Assessments will be
      conducted at pre, post and 1 month post including a subset of data from cohabiting mothers to
      assess moderating influences on outcomes.
