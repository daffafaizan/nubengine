      reference product or vice versa. There was a washout period set to 14-21 days between the
      first and second treatment period. Through an indwelling IV cannula, the subjects received
      either 5 mg/kg NeuroSTAT® (test) or 5 mg/kg Sandimmune® (reference), infused at a constant
      rate over 4 h with a syringe pump. A total of 22 blood samples for Cyclosporine analysis were
      obtained pre-dose and at pre specified time points with last sample 48 h after start of
      infusion.
