    
      This investigational study is designed to compare effectiveness of using the standard-of-care
      hemostatic therapy only, versus the standard-of-care hemostatic therapy plus an additional
      hemostatic treatment using Nexpower for patients with nonvariceal, upper gastrointestinal
      bleeding from ulcers with high-risk stigmata (Forrest classification Ia, Ib, or IIa).

      The primary end-points will be evaluated by assessing the rates of re-bleeding, which occur
      over three (3) days following initial hemostasis achieved with the standard-of-care
      hemostatic therapy.

      Secondary end-points consist of evaluating three items: 1) Ease of use of Nexpowder applied
      for the test group after reaching initial hemostasis, 2) Nexpowder device malfunction and 3)
      safety follow-up to check occurrence of adverse event(s)/re-bleeding at 30-day (+5) time
      point.

      Only the subjects whose initial hemostasis has been achieved will be registered for this
      investigation but those who initial hemostasis has failed to be reached with the
      standard-of-care therapie(s) shall not be registered for this investigation.
