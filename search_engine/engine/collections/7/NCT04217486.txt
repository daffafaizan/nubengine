      undergoing primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA) after photographing final knee range of
      motion immediately postoperatively and sharing these photographs with patients at their first
      follow-up appointment versus a group that does not see a photograph. The knee will be
      photographed in maximum flexion and extension. The primary objectives will be to compare the
      range of motion of the operative knee at 2 weeks and 6 weeks postoperatively. In the
      investigator's institution, patients who have failed to achieve 90 degrees of flexion at a
      postoperative period of 6 weeks undergo manipulation of the knee under anesthesia (MUA). The
      investigators will also measure how many patients require MUA in the photograph group and
      non-photograph group. MUA will be performed if patients fail to achieve 90 degrees of flexion
      at 6 weeks post-op.
