    
      Multi-site phased study, conducted within the Military Health System that includes a
      user-centered design phase and a patient centered medical home (PCMH)-based feasibility
      trial.

      In Phase I the investigators will assess both patient and clinician preferences and usability
      regarding the enhancement of the enabling technology capabilities for Type 2 diabetes chronic
      self-care management. The data from the experience will be coded and analyzed by the research
      team and the technology will be adapted accordingly before Phase II.

      Phase II research is a single-blinded 12-month feasibility study that seeks to include the
      enabling technology to support diabetes self-care management with tailored behavioral
      messaging aimed at reinforcing and encouraging self-care behavior based on patients'
      readiness. We have included safety thresholds that alert patients and clinical team under
      certain conditions.
