    
      The aim of the study is to evaluate neuroprotective effect of mixture of propofol and
      ketamine (ketofol) as compared to propofol after open heart surgery.

      Induction;

        -  Pre-oxygenation with100% O2 for 3 min.

        -  Morphine 0.1-0.15 mg/kg

        -  Fentanyl, dose 3-5 mcg/kg.

        -  hypnotic agent differs for each group:

        -  Propofol group: Propofol, dose 0.5-2 mg/kg.

        -  Ketofol group: Ketofol,( dose 0.25-1 mg/kg propofol plus 0.25-1 mg/kg ketamine diluted
           in normal saline with maintained 1:1 ratio between propofol and ketamine. )

      Catheterization:

        1. Central venous catheter: A suitable central venous catheter will be inserted into Right
           subclavian vein under complete aseptic technique using seldinger technique.

        2. Jugular bulb catheterization: Patients is placed in supine position with mild neck
           extension. The head is placed in neutral position with mild tilt to the opposite side of
           insertion. Under complete aseptic conditions, the anatomical landmarks for the right
           internal jugular vein will be identified (at the level of cricoid cartilage, medial to
           the sternomastoid muscle and lateral to a palpable internal carotid artery). The
           internal jugular vein will be then cannulated by retrograde insertion of a catheter for
           sampling of the jugular venous bulb blood. Catheter will be advanced till resistance of
           the skull base is reached then withdrawn about 1 to 2 mm.

      Position of the catheter will be confirmed by antero-posterior and lateral neck C-arm x-ray
      to verify the correct placement of the catheter tip in the will be sutured to the skin and
      dressed with sterile gauze
