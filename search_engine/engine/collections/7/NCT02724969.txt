    
      The purpose of the MILK Trial is to examine and compare the effectiveness, feasibility, and
      acceptability of a semi-automated, text-based, theory-driven intervention ("MILK"
      intervention) to prevent perceived insufficient milk and its potential inter-related
      sequelae, including maternal anxiety and early breastfeeding cessation, among mothers without
      breastfeeding experience who intend to exclusively or nearly exclusively breastfeed.
      Specifically, the investigators will:

        1. Determine the effect of the MILK intervention on perceived insufficient milk supply
           (PIM) and related maternal psychological and behavioral sequelae.

           Compared to the control intervention group ("Text4Baby"), the investigators hypothesize
           that MILK participants will have a perception of greater breast milk volume/supply,
           higher self-reported breastfeeding confidence, lower anxiety scores, and longer duration
           of exclusive breastfeeding.

        2. Assess the feasibility of a semi-automated text-based PIM intervention (MILK) for
           mothers.

      The investigators will compare characteristics of women who are and who are not eligible for,
      chose to participate in, and complete this randomized pilot intervention study. The
      investigators will also conduct post-study individual interviews with mothers to determine
      how the interventions were used and perceived (e.g., burden, challenges).
