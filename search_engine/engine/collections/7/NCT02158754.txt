      possible obstructive coronary artery disease who received a Corus CAD (Age/Sex/Gene
      Expression score - ASGES) result compared to patients who did not have the test performed
      (matched control patients). The data collected will be from primary care practices and will
      also assess one to two year health outcomes (MACE, procedure complications). Furthermore, in
      these real world practice settings, the study will investigate the economic impact of Corus
      CAD (ASGES) usage at each practice using practice specific data, when available.
