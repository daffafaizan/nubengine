    
      A total of 12 children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder with developmental
      delays and12 children with typical development will be enrolled.

      The following evaluations will be evaluated by the investigator who is blinded to the group's
      classification.

      Working task-related functions, such as Beery-Buktenica Visual-Motor Integration, Sensory
      Profile, the Chinese version of Swanson, Nolan and Pelham version IV, and Chinese version of
      Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-IV)

      Non-working memory-related functions, such as Pediatric Outcome Data Collection Instrument
      (PODCI), Child Health Questionnaire- Parent Form (CHQ-PF 28), Pediatric Quality of Life
      Inventory (PedsQL), and physical function (10 meters normal and fast walking, stair ascent,
      stair descent, and 5 times chair rising and timed up and go test)

      All participants will be investigated by magnetoencephalography and eye-tracking system to
      identify the difference of brain network activation during resting and performing tasks and
      between-group differences.

      Brain magnetic resonance image study will be performed for matching of brain localization.
