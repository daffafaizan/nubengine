      prior pilot 50mg tablet, a double blind, placebo controlled study will follow, which proposes
      to define primarily the value of low dose Pazopanib on nose bleed duration, in the context of
      assessing perceived nose bleed severity. A 3mth follow-up period will support safety and
      efficacy elements. Secondary endpoints will be interrogated, including ongoing blood loss,
      use of iron and blood products, quality of life, and drug safety.
