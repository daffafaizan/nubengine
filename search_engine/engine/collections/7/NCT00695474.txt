      insufficiency. It is well known that vitamin D deficiency causes osteoporosis, increases the
      risk of fracture and causes muscle weakness. But there is now evidence that calcium
      malnutrition and hypovitaminosis D are predisposing conditions for various common chronic
      diseases such as malignancies (particularly colon, breast and prostate) chronic inflammatory
      and autoimmune disease (inflammatory bowel disease, multiple sclerosis) as well as metabolic
      disorders (metabolic syndrome, hypertension).

      It has also been reported that vitamin D deficiency may predispose to glucose intolerance,
      altered insulin secretion and type 2 diabetes mellitus.

      The purpose of this study is to determine vitamin D status among type 2 diabetics in our
      outpatient clinic and examine the relationship between vitamin D status , calcium and
      phosphorous metabolism, inflammatory markers, glycemic control, blood pressure and lipid
      profile.

      Moreover the patients are asked to answer a questionnaire regarding lifestyle, exercise, sun
      exposure and food intake.
