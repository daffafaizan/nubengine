    
      At the first visit (Visit 1E; Day 1) in this study, all subjects will complete Patient
      Acceptable Symptom State (PASS) and pain numeric rating scale (NRS) assessments, and then
      receive a blinded study injection into their target knee (the same target knee injected in
      the parent-study), with subjects receiving the same treatment (either 0.07 mg lorecivivint or
      placebo) as they received in the parent-study. Subjects will have clinic visits at Visit 2E
      (Week 24) and Visit 3E (End of Study; Week 48) for subsequent pain and function assessments
      and for collection of adverse events. Subjects will also undergo knee radiographs at Visit 2E
      and Visit 3E.
