    
      The study was composed of a screening period followed by 3 sequential on-treatment periods,
      as follows:

        -  Screening Period (up to 28 days): determination of eligibility and discontinuation of
           antiparkinsonian disease medications other than levodopa-carbidopa immediate release
           (LC-oral) prior to nasojejunal (NJ) tube placement.

        -  NJ Test Period (2 to 14 days): first hospitalization period, Baseline assessments,
           placement of NJ tube, and optimization of levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG)
           treatment via NJ tube and infusion pump (participant was hospitalized for NJ tube
           placement but hospitalization was not required for entire duration of LCIG treatment
           optimization).

        -  PEG-J Period (2 to 14 days): second hospitalization period; placement of PEG-J tube;
           further optimization of LCIG treatment.

        -  Post PEG-J Long-Term Treatment Period (Day 28 to Day 378): LCIG administration via a
           permanent PEG-J tube and infusion pump, with dosage adjusted according to clinical
           condition.
