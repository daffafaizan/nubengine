      morbidity, predominantly affecting women and preschool aged children in resource-limited
      settings. Iron-deficiency in infancy has been linked to neurodevelopmental delay.

      Current methods of iron repletion and supplementation have proved inadequate. The Lucky Iron
      Fishâ„¢ is a iron ingot, the size of a small bar of soap, that is made of pure iron. When
      boiled, it releases bioavailable iron into water, which is then used for food preparation
      and/or drinking. Participants in the LIF arm are instructed to acidify the water with citrus
      juice (provided).

      All participants are followed at the same intervals to complete questionnaires and
      study-related labs.
