      left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF, %), European system for cardiac operative risk
      evaluation II (EuroSCORE II), pre-operative hematocrit, and serum creatinine levels were
      recorded. The surgical type was classified as coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), valve
      surgery, combined surgery including CABG and valve surgery, great vessel surgery including
      aortic dissection, and other surgeries. The priority of surgery was classified as elective,
      urgent, and emergent. The intra-operative variables included CPB time, aortic cross-clamp
      time, initial lactate level at the beginning of the operation, and the peak lactate level
      during CPB.
