      and 30 patients undergoing conventional laparoscopic surgery for bening gynecologic disorders
      will be included in the study. All surgeries will be performed in the same hospital by the
      same surgeon. 6 months after the surgery the patients will be called and will be informed
      about the trial. After confirming that the questionnaires can be sent to them by e-mail, 4
      questionnaires will be sent to the patients via e-mail. To evaluate cosmesis, patient
      satisfaction and quality of life VAS (visual analogue scale), SF-12 (short form-12) health
      survey, BIQ (body image questionnaire) and POSAS (the patient and observer scar assessment
      scale) will be sent to the patients 6 months after the surgery. Patients who have not
      completed the questionnaires will be called for reminders after 1 week. Patients will be
      expected to complete the questionnaire completely and accurately.
