      clinical pregnancy rate (35%), and even lower live birth rate (25%), per cycle started. Low
      embryo quality, poor endometrial receptivity, difficulties during the blastocyst hatching
      process are frequently denoted as the main reasons for the low implantation rate in humans.

      The artificial rupture or thinning of the zona pellucida before embryo transfer-assisted
      hatching (AH)-has been proposed to foster spontaneous hatching and improve embryo
      implantation rates. Despite great effort, the clinical relevance of AH remains controversial
      and elusive.

      There is a great importance of AH during frozen embryo cycles. Due to previous studies there
      is no precise answer about the value of AH performed on cryopreserved-thawed embryos. As far
      as is known, there is no clinical data to indicate the effects of AH on vitrified-warmed
      embryo transfer.

      The objective of this prospective study is to assess the possible impact of assisted hatching
      on the implantation, pregnancy rate and delivery rate after transfer of vitrified-warmed
      human embryos.

      Eligibility criteria: women age 18-42, cleavage-stage embryo transfer, less than seven IVF
      cycles with fresh embryo transfer, high quality embryos.

      Procedure: mechanical Assisted Hatching

      Primary Outcome: delivery rate Secondary Outcome: implantation rate, pregnancy rate and
      delivery rate.
