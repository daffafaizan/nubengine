      the ICU stay. Psychological trauma during ICU stay, related to medical management, can be
      very deleterious at short and long term, inducing psychological troubles as post-traumatic
      stress disorder and delaying the return to a normal social and professional life. For this
      reason, managing patients' distress is particularly important in the intensive care setting.
      There has been an increasing number of new technologies for the distraction of patients in
      different settings. a Today, a large amount of electronic distraction is available. TV and
      radio are available in each ICU, music therapy has already been studied and it is currently
      used in some ICUs. Virtual reality (VR) is used to improve attention and memory in stroke
      patients. Furthermore, VR seems to decrease stress post trauma disorders and phobia, as well
      as pain and anxiety during surgical procedures and physiotherapy. Our first step study will
      help us to determine which electronic distraction has the most effect on the top five
      discomfort symptoms frequently observed in ICU: pain, anxiety dyspnea, thirst and sleep
      privation.
