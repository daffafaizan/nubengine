      glucose level. Low GI foods are recommended as they have a lower impact on blood glucose
      concentrations and also reduce total food intake. There is very little information on how
      eating high and low GI foods affect daily blood glucose concentrations in Asians. Therefore,
      the objective of this study is to observe the effect of eating high and low GI breakfasts and
      snacks on 24 hour blood glucose concentrations and food consumption in Asian males. Healthy,
      normal-weight, Chinese males will be recruited. There will be two sessions (consisting of
      four days for each session) where they will consume either a high or low GI breakfast or
      snack, and a standardized ad libitum lunch buffet. Their glycaemic response will be measured
      using a Continuous Glucose Monitoring System (CGMS) throughout the period. The proposed
      research for the first time demonstrates how the consumption of high and low GI breakfasts
      and snacks affect subsequent energy intake and 24 hour blood glucose profiles in Asians.
      These findings will have significant public health benefits for optimum weight and dietary
      control.
