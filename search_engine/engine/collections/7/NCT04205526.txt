      physiotherapy improves function after a stroke, the frequency and intensity of therapy in a
      standard clinical rehabilitation session is insufficient to invoke these changes.
      Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a safe, non-invasive method of stimulating the
      human brain. Repetitive TMS (rTMS) may have the potential to enhance the brain's ability to
      re-learn specific functions and reduce the amount of standard therapy required to achieve
      certain functional gains after stroke. Although two recent multicenter studies have begun to
      test the benefits of applying rTMS during stroke rehabilitation, large scale clinical trials
      demonstrating the efficacy of rTMS for post-stroke functional motor recovery are lacking. The
      use of rTMS interventions in stroke rehabilitation trials has been limited by a lack of
      consensus regarding the optimal protocol for the clinical application of TMS in stroke
      populations. The Canadian Platform for Trials in Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation (CanStim) is
      a national platform that aims to facilitate multicenter clinical trials for non-invasive
      brain stimulation interventions to augment recovery from stroke. As a first step, CanStim
      investigators convened a multidisciplinary team of experts in rTMS from institutions across
      Canada to form the CanStim Consensus Working Group and develop consensus recommendations for
      a protocol to deliver rTMS as an adjunct to standard therapy in a national stroke
      rehabilitation clinical trial.
