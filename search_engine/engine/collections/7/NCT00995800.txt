    
      The study consists of two 4-week treatment periods, each preceded by a 14-21 wash-out period.
      Subjects will be randomised to receive two of the three study treatments - FlutiForm® pMDI
      50/5 µg, FlutiForm® pMDI 250/10 µg, or placebo (dummy inhaler). During the wash-out periods,
      subjects will take only salbutamol, if required, as rescue medication.

      Subjects will record a daily diary for PEFR, study medication use, rescue medication use,
      asthma symptom scores, and sleep disturbance due to asthma. Assessments performed at study
      clinic visits include inhaled adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) challenge test, induced sputum
      test, exhaled nitric oxide (eNO) test, and spirometry tests. Safety will be assessed by lab
      tests, vital signs, ECG and adverse events.
