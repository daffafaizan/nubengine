      participants will take SN1011 and another group will take the placebo. The effects seen in
      participants taking the study drug will be compared to the effects seen in participants who
      are taking the placebo.

      This study will look at how participants react to and how the human body uses SN1011 at
      different dose levels.

      The design of the study is double-blind, randomised and placebo-controlled. In total there
      are planned to be 2 parts to the study. Part A will look at the effects of a single dose of
      the study drug and Part B will look at the effects of multiple doses of the study drug.
