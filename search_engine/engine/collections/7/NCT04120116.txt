      phase 2a study will assess the exploratory efficacy, as well as the local and systemic safety
      of single and repeat intratympanic doses of FX-322 compared to placebo in approximately 96
      subjects with stable mild to moderately severe sensorineural hearing loss, with a medical
      history consistent with either excessive noise exposure or idiopathic sudden sensorineural
      hearing loss.
