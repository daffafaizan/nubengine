      mitochondrial (dys)function in muscle of individuals with PD, who are 65-85 of age, read and
      speak English, have a Hoehn & Yahr score between 2 and 3 (bilateral disease, not severely
      disabled) and have a clinical diagnosis of PD. Bioenergetic markers and muscle functional
      properties will be compared to a control dataset collected over the last few years from
      healthy elderly subjects in the same age range to provide a foundation for future
      intervention studies.
