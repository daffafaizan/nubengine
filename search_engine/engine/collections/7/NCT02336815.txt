    
      This is a Phase 2b, single-arm, open-label, multicenter study of selinexor 80 mg plus
      dexamethasone 20 mg (Sd), both dosed twice weekly in each four-week cycle, in patients with
      MM previously treated with lenalidomide, pomalidomide, bortezomib, carfilzomib, and
      daratumumab and refractory to prior treatment with glucocorticoids, an immunomodulatory agent
      (IMiD), a proteasome inhibitor (PI), and daratumumab.

      This study consists of two parts:

        -  Part 1 enrolled patients with both quad-refractory MM and penta-refractory MM.

        -  Part 2 will enroll patients with penta-refractory MM only.
