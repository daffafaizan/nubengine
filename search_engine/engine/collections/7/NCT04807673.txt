      advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) in the NCCN guidelines. But many patients
      refused or abandon radiotherapy because of the intolerable adverse effects. The purpose of
      this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab plus paclitaxel, cisplatin
      as neoadjuvant therapy followed by surgery, and pembrolizumab as adjuvant therapy, compared
      with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and surgery for locally advanced ESCC in multicenter. The
      primary study hypothesis is that Event Free Survival (EFS) is superior with pembrolizumab
      plus neoadjuvant chemotherapy compared with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy in participants
      with ESCC.
