        -  Compare the efficacy and toxicity of docetaxel (arm I) vs trastuzumab (Herceptin) (arm
           II), followed by a combination of docetaxel and trastuzumab in patients with
           androgen-independent or hormone-refractory metastatic, Her2/neu-positive prostate
           cancer. (Arm I closed to accrual effective 07/30/2001.)

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour weekly for 6 weeks. Treatment continues
           every 8 weeks for at least 2 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. (Arm I
           closed to accrual effective 07/30/2001. Arm I patients crossover to arm II.)

        -  Arm II: Patients receive trastuzumab (Herceptin) IV over 30-90 minutes weekly for 8
           weeks. Treatment continues every 8 weeks for at least 2 courses in the absence of
           unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients with progressive or stable disease after 2 courses of single-agent therapy receive
      docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1 of each week for 6 consecutive weeks and trastuzumab IV
      over 30-90 minutes on day 1 of each week for 8 consecutive weeks. Treatment continues every 8
      weeks for at least 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients with complete or partial response to single-agent therapy continue on that therapy
      until experiencing progressive or stable disease. The patients then proceed to combination
      therapy.

      Patients are followed until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 108-160 patients (54-80 per treatment arm) will be accrued for
      this study. (Arm I closed to accrual effective 07/30/2001.)
