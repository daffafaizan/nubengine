      with follicular lymphoma that has relapsed following rituximab-containing therapy.
      Bendamustine was approved by FDA for the treatment of in patients with indolent B-cell
      Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL) that did not respond to rituximab or a rituximab-containing
      regimen during or within 6 months of the last rituximab treatment.

      Biologics have demonstrated enhanced efficacy when added to chemotherapeutic combinations in
      the frontline treatment for indolent NHL. The combination of ofatumumab and bendamustine may
      provide additional clinical benefit and efficacy to those who no longer respond to rituximab
      or rituximab-containing regimens.

      The objective of this study is to determine the effect of ofatumumab and bendamustine
      combination therapy in patients with indolent B-cell NHL that did not respond to rituximab or
      a rituximab-containing regimen during or within 6 months of the last rituximab treatment.
