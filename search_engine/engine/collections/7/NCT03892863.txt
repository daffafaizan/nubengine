      progressive loss of central and peripheral motor neurons. ALS leads to death usually within 3
      to 5 years from the onset of the symptoms. Available treatment can prolong the disease
      duration but cannot modify the disease course. Depression is a frequent complication of ALS,
      which further decreases quality of life and the available data concerning effectivity of
      antidepressant drugs are conflicting. Similarly, the apathy may also complicate ALS and
      worsen the prognosis. Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) is a noninvasive
      method of modulation of brain plasticity with proved antidepressive effect in patients
      suffering from major depression and in depression associated with several neurological
      disorders such as Parkinson's disease or stroke.

      The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness rTMS in improving the depression
      and - as a secondary outcome - the apathy and daily functioning in patients with ALS.

      Intervention will include ten daily sessions of rTMS. In each session 3000 magnetic pulses
      will be administered over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Stimulation intensity will
      equal 120% of the motor threshold value for the right first dorsal interosseus.

      Assessment of depression severity and of apathy and daily functioning will be made before and
      after therapy, as well as two and four weeks later.
