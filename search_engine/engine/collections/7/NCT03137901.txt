      However, PPV can be time-consuming to calculate (manual determination), is not always
      displayed on monitoring screens nor reliable through visual assessment and needs additional
      devices to be displayed. A new Android application (Captesia) automatically calculates the
      PPV utilizing a digital photograph of the arterial waveform from the monitor. The application
      determines the PPV by selecting peaks and troughs of the arterial curve.
