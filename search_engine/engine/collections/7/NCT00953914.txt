      with diabetes mellitus. Cholinesterase inhibition with pyridostigmine bromide increases heart
      rate variability in normal individuals and congestive heart failure subjects but its effects
      on patients with diabetes mellitus is unknown. Based on those evidences, we will test if the
      short-term administration of pyridostigmine bromide increases heart rate variability in
      patients with diabetes mellitus.
