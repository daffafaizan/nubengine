    
      Rationale: The current gold standard for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is the
      second generation drug-eluting stent (DES). The most commonly used DES is the
      everolimus-eluting stent (EES). New stent delivery systems for PCI with EES are developed to
      optimize strength, flexibility and pushability of the catheter. The effect on procedural time
      of new stent delivery systems has not yet been investigated in clinical practice.

      Objective: To evaluate and compare the performance of two stent delivery systems for PCI with
      EES.

      Study design: Randomized comparative trial with 500 patients in the University Medical Center
      Groningen (UMCG).

      Study population: All patients undergoing PCI with EES, aged 18 years or older, will be
      considered for eligibility. Patients will be excluded when scheduled for chronic total
      occlusion (CTO) PCI or if verbal informed consent cannot be obtained.

      Intervention: The first group will undergo PCI with the XIENCE EES using the Alpine stent
      delivery system, the second group will undergo PCI with the Xpedition stent delivery system.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary endpoint is the proportion of procedures with
      crossing time (from introduction of guidewire to stent deployment) longer than 30 minutes.
      Secondary endpoints include procedural time (from heparin administration to removal of
      catheter sheath, mins), use of additional materials, total procedural costs, radiation dose
      (Î¼Gym2), radiation time (mins), and contrast dose (ml).
