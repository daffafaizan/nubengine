      and Middle East regions will participate.

      Primary analyses may include, but will not be limited to, the following: procedural
      complications, incidence of stroke and death. Descriptive statistics will be used for
      baseline, procedure and follow-up data collected through the study.

      Each patient will be followed for a period of two years after implant according to the
      schedule and standard practice at the enrolling centers. There will be no additional visits,
      nor procedures, for subjects who participate in the study. Subjects are expected to be
      followed at implant, then at one post-implant visit (typically between 1-3 months of
      implant), and then annually through 2 years post implant. An intermediate visit may be
      scheduled in a number of patients, per physician discretion. In order to reliably capture
      patient status at study end, a follow-up window of 24 +/- 3 months will be considered
      acceptable for scheduling the last visit. For subjects who are not scheduled to visit the
      clinical for a follow-up, a subject contact (e.g. phone call) will ensure capture of the
      endpoint related information; however, it is recommended to perform an in-office visit for at
      least the first annual visit.

      Enrollment is expected to be completed in 21 months; therefore the total study duration is
      estimated to be 48 months.
