    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of PS-341 (Velcade, Bortezomib) in
      combination with 17-allyamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) in patients with relapsed or
      refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).

      II. To determine the MTD of PS-341 in combination with 17-AAG in patients with relapsed or
      refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL).

      III. To define the specific toxicities and the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) of PS-341 in
      combination with 17-AAG in the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory hematologic
      malignancies.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the pharmacokinetics of 17-AAG alone and in combination with PS-341 in
      patients with AML, ALL, CLL, and NHL.

      II. To evaluate 20S proteasome inhibition following combination therapy with 17-AAG and
      PS-341 in patients with AML, ALL, CLL, and NHL.

      III. To assess the relationship between FLT3 mutational status and leukemic cell response to
      PS-341 and 17-AAG in patients with AML.

      IV. To assess the relationship between Bcl-2 over-expression and response to 17-AAG and
      PS-341 in patients with AML and NHL.

      V. To evaluate the effects of the combination of PS-341 and 17-AAG on Hsp90 and NF-kappaB and
      their downstream targets including Hsp70, Akt, phosphorylated Akt, p21, and caspases 3 and 9
      in patient-derived primary AML and NHL cells.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients are stratified according to diagnosis
      (acute myeloid leukemia [AML] or acute lymphoblastic leukemia vs chronic lymphoctyic leukemia
      or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma [NHL]).

      Patients receive 17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) intravenously (IV) over
      1-6 hours on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 and bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds on days 4, 8, and 11 of
      course 1 and on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of all subsequent courses.

      Treatment repeats every 21 days for 3-12 courses provided patient is receiving clinical
      benefit. Patients achieving objective response may discontinue therapy to undergo stem cell
      transplantation.Cohorts of 3-6 patients with receive escalating doses of 17-AAG and
      bortezomib until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the
      dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      After the MTD is determined, an additional 20 patients (10 per stratum with AML or follicular
      NHL) are enrolled and receive 17-AAG and bortezomib as above at the MTD.
