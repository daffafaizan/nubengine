      sequential cohorts until determination of the MTD, followed by an expansion phase in 5 tumor
      type-specific cohorts (i.e., ovarian cancer, colorectal cancer, non-triple negative breast
      cancer, renal cell carcinoma, and cervical cancer). Each expansion cohort was to include 15
      subjects treated with the identified MTD or maximum dose tested in the dose-escalation phase.

      Subjects received durvalumab and tremelimumab over 12 to 13 four-week cycles during the Core
      Study, with continuous monitoring for safety, clinical efficacy, and biological activity,
      followed by optional treatment extension with durvalumab for subjects maintaining at least
      stable disease if agreed upon by the Investigator and Sponsor. After study treatment
      completion, study assessments were continued for up to 90 days after the last administration
      of study treatment or until start of alternate therapy, with long-term follow up after study
      completion for clinical outcomes at least every 6 months for up to 3 years following
      initiation of treatment.

      Study treatment in the Core Study continued for up to 12 months or until confirmed
      progressive disease (PD), initiation of alternative cancer therapy, observation of
      unacceptable toxicity, or any other criteria for treatment discontinuation.

      Optional treatment extension beyond the Core Study was permitted for subjects who completed
      the Core Study with a tumor response of stable disease or better and upon agreement by the
      Sponsor and Investigator. Extended treatment comprised durvalumab monotherapy administered at
      the recommended fixed dose of 1500 mg administered every 4 weeks (Q4W).
