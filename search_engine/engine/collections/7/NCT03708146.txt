      study between 28 and 3 days before the first dose. Eligible subjects will be admitted 2 days
      before dosing (Day -2) for all regimens, and will remain resident in the clinic until 72 h
      after the last dose (Day 13). On Day -1, blood samples will be taken in all cohorts for PD
      assessments at pre-defined time points. These time points will be time matched to Day 1 PK
      and PD time points. Subjects in Cohorts 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 11 (fed cohorts) will also undergo
      continuous cardiac monitoring via 24 h Holter recordings on Day -1.

      Subjects in Cohorts 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9 will receive oral doses of BIA 5-1058 or matching
      placebo once daily from Day 1 to Day 10, administered in the morning of each day after a
      minimum of 8 h fast and will remain fasted until 4 h post-dose. Subjects in Cohorts 2, 4, 6,
      8, 10 and 11 will receive oral doses of BIA 5-1058 or matching placebo once daily from Day 1
      to Day 10, administered in the morning of each day, 30 minutes after the start of a moderate
      breakfast containing approximately 550 kcal with fat contributing approximately 150 kcal.
