    
      The objective of this clinical study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the
      SimplifyÂ® Disc for treatment of DDD compared to conventional ACDF for reconstruction of the
      disc space at one level between C3 to C7 for DDD defined as intractable radiculopathy (arm
      pain and/or a neurological deficit) with or without neck pain or myelopathy due to a
      single-level abnormality localized to the level of the disc space that is unresponsive to
      conservative management.
