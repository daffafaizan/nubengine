      Patients were assigned to two groups: Group I: IOL was traditionally implanted after all
      nuclear fragments were completely removed, while in Group II, IOL was innovatively implanted
      in the bag before last residual nuclear fragment was removed. This novel adjusted surgical
      procedure, featured by using IOL as a protective barrier (named "IOL-shell technique"), not
      just as a refractive alternative, was conceptual different from the traditional step-by-step
      procedure. Clinical examinations including uncorrected visual acuity, central corneal
      thickness (CCT), temporal clear corneal thickness and the corneal endothelial cell density
      were carried out.
