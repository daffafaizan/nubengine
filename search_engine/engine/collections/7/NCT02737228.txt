      The phase I clinical trial is to identify the MTD and DLT of CG200745 PPA in combination use
      of Gemcitabine and Erlotinib. Initial dose of CG200745 PPA is 187.5 mg/m^2, and it will be
      extended to 250 mg/m^2, 312.5 mg/m^2 or it will be reduced to 125 mg/m^2 based on the results
      of the cohort of 3 subjects per dose level.

      Based on the 3+3 dose escalation study design, Gemcitabine and Erlotinib are administered as
      fixed doses, whereas CG200745 PPA is to be administered as in four different cohorts
      according to the dose level. Each cohort consists of 3 or 6 subjects.

        -  Dose level 0: CG200745 PPA 125 mg/m^2 puls Gemcitabine 1000 mg/m^2) and Erlotinib 100 mg

        -  Dose level 1: CG200745 PPA 187.5 mg/m^2 puls Gemcitabine 1000 mg/m^2) and Erlotinib 100
           mg

        -  Dose level 2: CG200745 PPA 250 mg/m^2 puls Gemcitabine 1000 mg/m^2) and Erlotinib 100 mg

        -  Dose level 3: CG200745 PPA 312.5 mg/m^2 puls Gemcitabine 1000 mg/m^2) and Erlotinib 100
           mg

      <Part II - Phase II trial>

      In the phase II clinical trial, the subjects will be administered with the dose which is to
      be identified as a recommended dose based on the results of Phase I study. The whole one
      cycle is consisted of 28 days, same as the phase I. The entire treatment period is 6 cycles
      and tumor assessment is evaluated every 2 cycles.
