        -  To determine whether CYP3A (Cytochrome P450 3A) and/or P-glycoprotein mediated
           interactions exist between garlic supplements and oxycodone (a commonly used oral opioid
           analgesic) in healthy volunteers.

      OUTLINE:

      This is a single-blind, randomized, crossover study. Participants are randomized to 1 of 2
      arms. Each arm entails two 30-day treatment periods, with a washout of at least 4 weeks in
      between.

        -  Arm I: In Period 1, participants receive oral garlic powder twice daily on days 1-28 and
           oral oxycodone on day 28. In Period 2, participants receive oral placebo twice daily on
           days 1-28 and oral oxycodone on day 28.

        -  Arm II: In Period 1, participants receive oral placebo twice daily on days 1-28 and oral
           oxycodone on days 28. In Period 2, participants receive oral garlic powder twice daily
           on days 1-28 and oral oxycodone on day 28.

      In both periods of each arm, participants receive a combination of oral midazolam and oral
      digoxin for CYP3A and P-glycoprotein phenotyping on day 29. Blood samples are collected
      periodically and analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS).

      Blood and urine samples are collected after receiving oxycodone for pharmacokinetic
      characterization. Plasma concentrations of oxycodone and its metabolites are measured by
      LC-MS.

      Response to experimentally induced pain by the Cold Pressor Test (CPT) is assessed at
      baseline and periodically after oxycodone treatment. Subjective ratings of opioid side
      effects are assessed by validated questionnaires for somatic side effects and cognitive
      function impairments.
