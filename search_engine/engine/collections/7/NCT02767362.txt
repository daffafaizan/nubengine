      women who are to undergo surgical staging for endometrial cancer. After recruitment is
      completed, 24 paired endometrial biopsies and hysterectomy specimens from endometrial cancer
      patients treated at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill will be retrospectively
      obtained from the Department of Pathology to serve as controls. These cases will be matched
      for stage and grade to the endometrial cancers of those women enrolled on this phase 0
      clinical trial and will undergo the same immunohistochemical analysis. Two previous phase 0
      window studies of metformin in endometrial cancer have found no difference in Ki-67
      expression between preoperative endometrial biopsy and hysterectomy specimen in control
      patients, although a difference was seen in metformin treated patients. However, the
      investigators plan to include a control group to ensure that changes found between pre- and
      post-atorvastatin treated patients are due to the effects of this drug versus differences in
      the type of specimen examined (i.e. endometrial biopsy specimen obtained in clinic versus
      hysterectomy specimen obtained at the time of surgery). In addition, enrolled patients will
      undergo repeat endometrial biopsy post- atorvastatin treatment at the time of their surgical
      staging. Thus, study investigators plan to compare pre-treatment endometrial biopsies to both
      post-treatment endometrial biopsies and hysterectomy specimens as well as have a historical
      control group.
