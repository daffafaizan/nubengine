      antipsychotic medications. Clozapine has been shown to be more effective in treating
      schizophrenia than typical antipsychotic drugs. However, only an estimated 30% to 60% of
      people who are unresponsive to treatment with typical antipsychotics will respond to
      treatment with clozapine. Taking clozapine with pimozide, an antipsychotic drug, can increase
      clozapine's effects. However, sufficient research on this approach has not yet been
      performed. This study will assess the effectiveness of pimozide in enhancing the effects of
      clozapine in the treatment of schizophrenia.

      Participants in this double-blind study will receive a stable dose of clozapine for eight
      weeks prior to enrollment. For the first 4 weeks following enrollment, baseline measurements
      will be taken. Once a week, participants will report to the study site, where symptom
      severity, cognitive ability, and functional status, including reading level, will be
      assessed. In addition, participants will receive a standard medical examination, which will
      include blood tests and an EKG. Upon completion of this initial phase, participants will be
      randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups: clozapine combined with pimozide; or
      clozapine combined with placebo. This phase will last for 12 weeks. Study visits will
      continue to occur weekly, and will be used to re-assess the measurements obtained during
      baseline. In addition, participants will have an EKG at each study visit for the first 4
      weeks of treatment. All baseline measurements will be repeated in Week 12.
