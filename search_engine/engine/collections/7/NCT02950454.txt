      intensity interval training in people with progressive multiple sclerosis. A control group of
      people with progressive multiple sclerosis will undergo continuous moderate intensity
      exercise, twice weekly for 8 weeks.

      The training program will entail 6x1.5 minute intervals working at 80-95% heart rate max on a
      cycle ergometer. Each interval will be interspersed with 1.5 minutes of working rest at a
      light resistance of the participant's choosing.

      The continuous moderate intensity exercise program will entail 20 minutes on a cycle
      ergometer working at 60-70% heart rate max.
