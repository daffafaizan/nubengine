      requiring mechanical ventilatory support and adequate airway control. The therapeutical
      choice of performing a tracheostomy is supported by a number of clinical benefits, such as
      less use of drugs for sedation, fewer days of mechanical ventilation and hence shorter
      Intensive Care Unit (ICU) length of stay, as well as better resource rationalization.
      Actually there is no agreement on the best timing for tracheostomy. The aim of this study is
      to verify if an early tracheostomy (one to three days after intubation) increases ventilator
      associated pneumonia-free days. Secondary endpoints are: increase of ventilator free-days and
      mortality reduction.
