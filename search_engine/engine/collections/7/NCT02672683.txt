      terminal heart failure.

      Despite considerable progress in immunosuppressive regimens, allograft rejection remains a
      major cause of graft loss.

      Majority of cardiac allograft rejection are asymptomatic. Only severe rejection goes along
      with cardiac dysfunction. This clinical latency makes the cardiac rejection diagnostic
      difficult and has ruled modalities of detection of cardiac rejection.

      The cornerstone of rejection diagnosis and post-transplant follow-up relies on endomyocardial
      biopsy (EMB) and classical histopathology assessment. Echocardiography and MRI are neither
      sensitive nor specific enough to replace EMB. Majority of transplant centers thus evaluate
      rejection using iterative protocol biopsies. These cardiac allograft monitoring protocols are
      heavy, with 15 to 20 EMB in the first year of transplantation and 1 to 2 EMB each year after
      the first year. EMB are invasive procedure with a low but not zero risk of severe adverse
      events. Repetition of EMB is associated with tricuspid regurgitation due to valvular
      complications. Moreover incidence of cardiac rejection explains the cost-effectiveness of
      EMBs: 50 to 70% of biopsies are normal.

      The goal is thus to detect rejection in the blood by measuring expression levels of 4
      circulating microRNAs in patients' sera by RT-PCR. The seric expression levels of these 4
      circulating microRNAs will be compared to the histopathological diagnosis made on concomitant
      endomyocardial biopsy.
