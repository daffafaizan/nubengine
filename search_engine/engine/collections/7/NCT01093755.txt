      randomized (using concealed allocation, like the flip of a coin) to either intensive acid
      suppression with dexlansoprazole 60-90 mg/day or to symptom guided acid suppression with
      escalating doses of omeprazole (20-60 mg/day) for 6 months. Control of reflux will be
      assessed using 24 hour ambulatory pH monitoring. The need to escalate drug dosage at the 3
      month visit will be determined by presence of excessive acid exposure on ambulatory pH
      monitoring. Biopsies of esophageal tissue will be obtained at baseline, then at 3 months and
      6 months following randomization to measure changes in inflammatory biomarkers.
