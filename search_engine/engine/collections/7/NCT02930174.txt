      injury and increase morbidity and mortality. There currently is not an easy method of
      assessing the impact ventilator settings have on the degree of lung inflation. Computed
      tomography (CT), the gold standard for visually monitoring lung function, can provide
      detailed regional information of the lung. Unfortunately, it necessitates moving critically
      ill patients to a special diagnostic room and involves exposure to radiation like an X-ray.

      A technique introduced in the 1980's, electrical impedance tomography (EIT), can
      non-invasively provide similar monitoring of lung function, and without the exposure to
      radiation. This imaging technique applies small alternating currents of electricity to
      surface electrodes to construct cross-sectional images of the lung.

      Over that past several decades EIT has moved from the research lab to commercially available
      devices that are used at the bedside. EIT has also been applied to study the effects of
      various devices used to provide non-invasive ventilation. EIT may prove useful to optimally
      adjust non-invasive ventilation settings to improve ventilation and oxygenation. One such EIT
      system is manufactured by Draeger Medical. It is available in Europe and Canada but is not
      yet FDA approved for use in the United States.

      This study is being done with healthy volunteers to further the investigators' knowledge of
      the EIT system and to see if measures between two non-invasive ventilation systems routinely
      used clinically are equivalent.

      As this is a preliminary study looking at the EIT system vs 2 other devices, outcomes
      measures may be modified as the study progresses.
