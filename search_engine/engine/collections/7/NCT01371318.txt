      synthesizes data about complex wound problems from multiple sources and is innovative in its
      capability to performing these critical tasks: i) identification of the information needed to
      make treatment decisions at the point of care in real time ii) use intelligent search and
      report features to identify patients who require emergency interventions, and iii) provide
      evidence-based clinical decision support to clinicians. Use of the OWEMR includes digital
      photography as an objective measurement of wound healing rates.
