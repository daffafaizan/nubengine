      which the leukocytes in a limited volume of patient's blood are radiolabeled with indium-111
      or technetium-99m, re-introduced into the circulation, and their subsequent trafficking and
      accumulation in areas of active inflammation is visualised by scintigraphic imaging. This
      methodology is routinely used for diagnosis of inflammatory conditions and pharmacodynamic
      changes have been documented in the literature. As it is intended that this technology could
      be used in future drug intervention studies.

      However, because this sub-population labelling methodology remains exploratory, this study
      will investigate the utility of such techniques for use in future clinical trials in Crohn's
      patients.

      Two parallel exploratory approaches will be investigated to enrich for lymphocyte populations
      expressing leukocyte trafficking inhibitors. In the first, whole blood will be fractionated
      on a ficoll gradient to purify a heterogeneous population of all the peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells (PBMC) for labelling. Secondly, T lymphocytes will be further enriched by
      depletion of monocytes and B cells from PBMC fractions. In part A one scintigraphy scan will
      be performed in healthy volunteers to confirm that the purification and labelling procedure
      does not show abnormal biodistribution compared to the known physiological distribution of
      labelled mononuclear cells [Bennink, 2008].

      In part B, Crohn's disease patients will then be recruited to undergo two scintigraphy scans
      48-72 hours apart to establish intra-patient variability and feasibility of the repeated
      procedure that will be used in subsequent studies for therapeutic intervention. Analysis of
      SPECT images will be performed using a standardized scoring system.
