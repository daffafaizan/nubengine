    
      -  The medical intensive care unit will be split into two groups, assigned as either early
           palliative care consultation or standard of care. Current standard of care in the ICU is
           that primary clinician providers determine the need and time for palliative care
           consultation, which can occur approximately 5 - 14 days after admission.

        -  A palliative care screening tool will be used to determine if a newly admitted patient
           is eligible for palliative care consultation.

        -  Up to two patients per ICU per weekday will be enrolled into the study, due to workload
           limitations on the palliative care consult team.

        -  For patients in the intervention group, a palliative care consultation will be performed
           within 48 hours of ICU admission and patients will be followed throughout their
           hospitalization.

        -  Patients in the standard of care group will receive usual care. Palliative care may be
           consulted at the primary team's clinical discretion.

        -  The two medical ICU groups will be crossed over after three months with a washout period
           of six weeks, for a total of approximately eight months of study

        -  Electronic medical records will be reviewed after patient discharge to collect data on
           clinical outcomes as described elsewhere
