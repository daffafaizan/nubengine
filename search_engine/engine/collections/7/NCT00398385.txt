      Primary

        -  Compare the time to recurrence in patients with stage IB or II non-small cell lung
           cancer treated with neoadjuvant versus adjuvant gemcitabine hydrochloride and cisplatin.

      Secondary

        -  Compare overall survival of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the toxicity of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Compare quality of life of these patients.

        -  Compare the complete resection rate with and without neoadjuvant gemcitabine
           hydrochloride and cisplatin.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified by disease stage (IB vs II) and
      histology (squamous cell carcinoma vs nonsquamous cell carcinoma). Patients are randomized to
      1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I (neoadjuvant chemotherapy): Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30
           minutes and cisplatin IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 15. Treatment repeats every 4
           weeks for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease recurrence or unacceptable toxicity.
           Within 8 weeks after initiating course 4 of chemotherapy, patients undergo complete
           surgical resection.

        -  Arm II (adjuvant chemotherapy): Patients undergo complete surgical resection. Beginning
           within 8 weeks after complete surgical resection, patients receive gemcitabine
           hydrochloride IV and cisplatin IV as in arm I.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and periodically for up to 5 years.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically for at least 5 years or
      until disease recurrence.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 170 patients will be accrued for this study.
