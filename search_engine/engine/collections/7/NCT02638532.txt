      when autologous fat is used to treat plantar fat pad atrophy of the foot. The etiology of fat
      pad atrophy may be age-related, due to abnormal foot mechanics, obesity, steroid use, or
      collagen vascular disease. Displacement or atrophy of the fat pad can lead to osseous
      prominences in the foot that may be seen with painful skin lesions. Disease states, such as
      diabetes, may have loss of soft tissue integrity. Fat pad atrophy may result in significant
      pain or compensatory gait leading to callous formation or ulceration. In sensate patients,
      the pain can lead to emotional and physical pain, leading to productivity and financial
      losses.

      Fat grafting to the feet is as a cosmetic surgery option. Although fat grafting is used often
      in standard care plastic surgery, for cosmetic reasons, it is considered part of the research
      in this trial. What happens to the fat after injection has not been well studied.
      Approximately 50 adults who experience pain from fat pad atrophy, either of the fore foot or
      heel will have fat pad grafting. The study will utilize MRI before and at 6 months
      post-procedure to assess changes in the quality of the bone of the foot as well as the 3D
      morphology of the fat. Specifically, the investigators want to know how the fat redistributes
      around the bone. In addition, the Adipose Stem Cell Biology Laboratory will assess the stem
      cell characteristics of the fat used for autotransplantation. This study will help build new
      collaborative efforts between Foot and Ankle Specialists, Stem Cell Biologists, and Plastic
      Surgeons, combining expertise in foot biomechanics with reconstructive fat grafting.
