      neuropathic in many patients concerned [1,2]. The suspected origin of neuropathy is a direct
      traumatism of intercostal nerve(s) [3]. Among the possible preventive treatments that can be
      administered during the initial aggression, ketamine [4,5] appears as the easiest to use, as
      it is already commonly administered intra and postoperatively for improvement of analgesia
      [6]. This study compares two groups of patients undergoing thoracotomy for partial
      pneumonectomy, one receiving intravenous ketamine since the beginning of procedure and then
      during 48 hours, the other receiving inactive normal saline (placebo). The study is
      prospective, randomized, and double-blinded. The primary endpoint is to reduce chronic pain
      (on visual analogue scale) at the 4th month after surgery with ketamine. The objective is to
      obtain a mean value under 20/100 in the ketamine group, considering that the expected mean
      value for the control group is 38/100 (based on personal observations). The secondary
      endpoints are lower scores of neuropathic pain in the ketamine group, assessed by the NPSI
      questionnaire [7]. The impact of treatment on quality of life, assessed by a questionnaire
      (SF-36), is also studied. The data collected by clinical and psychophysical examination
      performed on all patients at the 4th month after surgery will be also considered for
      analysis, in order to understand better the features of post-thoracotomy neuropathic pain.
