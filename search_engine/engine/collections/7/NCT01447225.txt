    
      This study was a Phase 1 and pharmacologic dose-escalation trial of MM-121 in combination
      with certain anticancer therapies. The dose-escalation portion of the study employed a 3 + 3
      design to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of MM-121 administered weekly
      in combination with certain anticancer therapies in patients with advanced/recurrent cancer.
      Doses of MM-121 and/or the anticancer therapy were escalated until either the MTD is
      identified or the combination was shown to be tolerable at the highest planned doses.
