      focus of abnormal tissue on computed tomography (CT) and no greater than 3cm in maximum
      diameter. Pulmonary nodules are not uncommon. A systematic review of CT screening lung cancer
      trials noted that a lung nodule was detected in up to 51% of study participants. More than
      95% of detected nodules are benign and have a wide variety of causes, including infections,
      granulomatous disease, hamartomas, arteriovenous malformations, round atelectasis, and lymph
      nodes.

      Pulmonary cryptococcosis is caused by Cryptococcus spp., a ubiquitous budding yeast-like
      basidiomycete that is endemic in many countries. Previously, Pulmonary cryptococcosis was
      thought to be an important opportunistic invasive mycosis in immunocompromised patients, such
      as AIDS, immunosuppressor used after organ transplantation, but it is also common in
      immunocompetent patients. Pulmonary cryptococcosis often manifests as isolated or multiple
      nodules, easily mimicking lung cancer clinically and radiologically, which ascribes the poor
      sensitivity of Cryptococcus culture and rarely positive of Cryptococcal antigen test in the
      absence of disseminated disease.

      Therefore, the aim of this multicenter observational study was to develop a predictive
      scoring system from the perspective of available clinical indicators, to differentiate
      cryptococcosis from adenocarcinoma in pulmonary nodules, which might be beneficial for the
      delicacy management of pulmonary nodules.
