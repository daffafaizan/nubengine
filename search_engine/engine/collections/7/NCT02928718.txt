      will be gathered to investigate the possible genetic variation associated with post-ERCP
      pancreatitis using whole genome sequencing. DNA for whole genome sequencing will be extracted
      using DNA extraction kit (Qiagen Inc., Hinden, Germany) and the concentration & purity of DNA
      will be measured using Nanodrop (Nano Drop Technologies, Wilmington, DE, USA) or fluorometric
      quantitation(Qubit fluorometer). Genetic variations which are associated with acute
      pancreatitis will be searched using whole genome sequencing. Post-ERCP pancreatitis is the
      primary outcome. Medical records and data of genetic variations will be reviewed for
      identifying possible risk factors and genetic variations associated with post-ERCP
      pancreatitis.
