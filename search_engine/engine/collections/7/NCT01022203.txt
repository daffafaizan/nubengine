      treatment, called Structured Approach Therapy, by randomly assigning 57 Iraqi war Veterans
      and their partners to either a 12-15 session Structured Approach Therapy program, or to a
      12-15 session PTSD Family Education comparison condition. The efficacy of the two
      experimental conditions will be ascertained by obtaining measures of PTSD severity from
      Veterans and measures of relationship functioning and emotion regulation from Veterans and
      their partners prior to treatment, immediately after treatment, and three months after the
      last treatment session. The investigators will test the hypothesis that couples participating
      in Structured Approach Therapy will show significantly greater improvements on all three
      clinical outcome measures than couples participating in PTSD Family Education. These
      hypotheses will be tested with an intent-to-treat analysis using general linear mixed models
      with main effects of treatment, time (baseline, end of treatment, and 12 week follow-up), and
      treatment by time interactions to model the longitudinal trajectories of the outcome,
      separately for the Veterans and their partners. The objectives of the Structured Approach
      Therapy intervention are to decrease PTSD severity, improve relationship and family
      functioning, and decrease problems in emotion regulation in a group of young Veterans at risk
      for developing chronic PTSD, and to reduce emotional distress and relationship and family
      problems in their partners.
