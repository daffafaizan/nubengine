    
      This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of an investigational
      intervention and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational
      intervention to use for further studies.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved Ricolinostat as a treatment
      for any disease. The FDA has approved Paclitaxel as a treatment option for Ovarian, Fallopian
      Tube, or Peritoneal Cancer . The FDA has approved Bevacizumab in combination with
      chemotherapy as a treatment option for Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, or Peritoneal Cancer .

      In this study, we are hoping to learn what is the highest dose of Ricolinostat that can be
      given safely together with Paclitaxel on a weekly basis or with Paclitaxel on a weekly basis
      and Bevacizumab every other week. Ricolinostat is a drug that stops cancer from growing by
      blocking the action of a protein called HDAC.
