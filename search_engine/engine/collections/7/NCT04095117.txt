    
      Adult patients from either sex with BMI from 30-39.9 kg/mÂ², scheduled for lower abdominal
      operations or surgeries on the lower extremities under epidural anesthesia will be eligible.
      Pregnant women will be excluded.

      The sagittal abdominal diameter (SAD), which is the anteroposterior diameter of the abdomen
      in the supine position at L4-5 level will be measured in all subjects along with the BMI
      prior to epidural placement.

      The epidural space will be accessed at the L3-L4 or L4-L5 interspace with a 16-G or 18-G
      Tuohy needle using a loss of resistance to saline technique. The proper placement of the
      needle in the epidural space will be confirmed by connecting the hub of the epidural needle
      via a rigid extension tubing to a saline filled pressure transducer to demonstrate the
      characteristic epidural space pressure wave changes described by Arnuntasupakul and his
      colleagues (2016), which is a pulsatile waveform synchronized with arterial pulsations.

      The distance from skin to epidural space will be marked on the needle with a sterile marker
      and will be recorded.

      An epidural catheter will be passed into the epidural space and the epidural block will be
      activated in the usual way until adequate sensory and motor block is established in both
      lower extremities (Bromage score 3-4).

      Successful placement of the epidural needle will be considered if the following two criteria
      are fulfilled: (1) Detection of the characteristic epidural pressure wave form as described
      above and (2) Establishment of adequate sensory and motor block.

      Simple linear regression will be used to deduce an equation relating the skin to epidural
      space distance to the sagittal abdominal diameter or to the BMI.
