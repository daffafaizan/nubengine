      externalizing problems (aggressive, antisocial behaviors) and internalizing problems
      (anxiety, depression). Adolescence is a critical juncture in the development of these
      disorders because of the increased incidence and differentiation of clinical problems
      particularly along gender-based lines. This is a biobehavioral, longitudinal investigation of
      the role of emotion in the development of psychopathology in adolescence. The focus is on
      socialization experiences and biological processes that contribute to emotion dysregulation
      and disorder. Younger (11-13) years) and older (14-16 years) male and female adolescents are
      followed over time to assess outcomes (psychiatric and psychological problems; adaptive
      functioning). Groups studied include (1) comorbid externalizers and internalizers, (2)
      externalizers, (3) internalizers, and (4) asymptomatic youth. Longitudinal analyses will
      examine factors that contribute to continuation, exacerbation, shifts, or improvement in
      symptoms over time. Time 1 data collection is complete and 30% of Time 2 cases have been
      seen. The current anticipated number of patient days per year is 150 for adolescents and
      mothers. Data collection will be completed by January, 2003.
