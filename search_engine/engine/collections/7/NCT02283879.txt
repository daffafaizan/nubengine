      neural cells, which have been confirmed in in vivo and in vitro experiments. There have been
      few clinical reports describing umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells for treatment of
      cerebral hemorrhage.

      To investigate the effects of hUC-MSC treatment for cerebral hemorrhage sequela, 20 patients
      with cerebral hemorrhage will be enrolled and receive 4 times of hUC-MSC transplantation.
