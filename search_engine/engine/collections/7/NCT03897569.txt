      are thought to be important contributors to patellofemoral pain (PFP). The closed chain
      nature of single leg tasks means that hip kinematics can be influenced by more distal
      mechanics, such as foot pronation.

      One of the often-studied distal movements theorized to cause PFPS is pronation of the
      subtalar joint. Pronation is a tri-planar movement that includes dorsiflexion, eversion, and
      abduction of the foot. Many studies have examined eversion characteristics of PFPS patients,
      but the dorsiflexion aspect of the movement has been shown to be a possible risk factor,
      restricting dorsiflexion was shown to increase medial knee displacement in young healthy
      adults. Conversely, when available dorsiflexion ROM is increased, medial knee displacement is
      thought to decrease.

      Patients with PFPS were observed to have a decreased DFROM (dorsiflexion range of motion) as
      compared to normal individuals, though this topic has not thoroughly been investigated.
