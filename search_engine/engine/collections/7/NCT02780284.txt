      is the third most common cancer in men and women. CRC risk factors include genetic
      predisposition, host factors and modifiable lifestyle behaviors (e.g., diet, physical
      activity, obesity). There are very limited data on the differences in the gut microbiota
      among populations at different levels of CRC risk, as well as the effects of behavioral
      interventions to alter the gut microbiome.
