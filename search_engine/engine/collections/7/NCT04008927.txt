      temporary community care facility (the research site), located outside the existing care
      facilities in the city, participants will benefit from HCV/HIV/HBV screening, on-site
      measurement of HCV-RNA and liver fibrosis, early treatment, treatment follow-up and risk and
      harm reduction tools related to their risk practices. Peers will be present in this unique
      structure and will accompany participants throughout their treatment. Participants will be
      referred during treatment to existing care facilities but followed up in the research up to
      44 to 48 weeks after initiation of treatment to assess the rate of re-infection. The number
      of active DUs in the population will be estimated by using a capture/recapture method nested
      in the RDS survey

      Secondary objectives of the research are:

        -  To estimate the seroprevalence of hepatitis C in active DUs in Montpellier;

        -  To estimate the size of the active DUs population in the city of Montpellier using a
           capture/recapture method;

        -  To estimate HCV care cascade steps in active DUs in Montpellier;

        -  To identify the factors associated with HCV treatment failure;

        -  To determine the proportion of treated and cured HCV patients who re-infect within
           months after end of treatment;

        -  To estimate the seroprevalence of hepatitis B and HIV infection in active DUs in
           Montpellier.
