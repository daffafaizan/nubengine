      Medellín and Bogotá (Colombia). This study was conducted in compliance with the ethical
      principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and with Good Clinical Practice guidelines. Written
      informed consent was obtained from all subjects or they parents in patients under 18 years.
      Ethical committee of University of Antioquia (Medellín, Colombia) approved the protocol.
      Considering the large number of articles that demonstrate the efficacy of antihistamines as
      first-line treatment in patients with urticaria, the ethics committee request that all
      participants would receive an antihistamine during the two months of the study because a
      placebo group would provide little information for the principal objective and the high risk
      of airway angioedema. Thirty heath subjects were used as a control group to evaluated the
      characteristics of the wheal in the prick test with histamine.
