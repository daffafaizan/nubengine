      Primary

        -  Determine the efficacy of sunitinib malate, in terms of objective radiographic response
           of brain lesions, in patients with brain metastases secondary to renal cell carcinoma or
           melanoma.

      Secondary

        -  Determine overall and progression-free survival.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral sunitinib malate once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every
      6 weeks for up to 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically.
