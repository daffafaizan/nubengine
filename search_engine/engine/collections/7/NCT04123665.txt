      parallel group, 24-week clinical study in healthy adult volunteers with moderate gingivitis.
      Eligible participants will be stratified based on gender and baseline mean whole mouth
      modified gingival index (MGI) score (Low: less than or equal to [<=] 2.00/High greater than
      [>]2.00) to ensure a balance in gingivitis across both treatment groups, and then randomized
      into one of two treatment groups. Treatment effect will be evaluated by comparing MGI ,
      bleeding index and plaque index scores after 12 and 24 weeks use of a dentifrice containing
      0.454% w/w stannous fluoride to a negative control dentifrice. During the 24 week treatment
      period, participants will apply a full ribbon of dentifrice to the head of a study toothbrush
      and brush their teeth in their usual manner at home for one timed minute twice daily (morning
      and evening) and record on their study diary completed brushings.
