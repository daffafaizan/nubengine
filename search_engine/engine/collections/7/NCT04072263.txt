    
      Study the feasibility and safety of TIL administration in the window of opportunity created
      by carboplatin-paclitaxel chemotherapy with or without interferon alpha (IFNα). Furthermore,
      exploratory studies will be performed to analyze and confirm the proposed underlying
      mechanisms.

      Intervention:

      Cohort 1

        -  Carboplatin-paclitaxel day1, q3 weeks, 6x, plus

        -  TIL starting 14 days after the 2nd chemotherapy cycle, q3 weeks, 3x.

      Cohort 2

        -  Carboplatin-paclitaxel day1, q3 weeks, 6x, plus

        -  TIL starting 14 days after the 2nd chemotherapy cycle, q3 weeks, 3x, plus

        -  IFNα (3x10e6 U daily) starting one week before the first TIL infusion for 12 weeks in
           total.
