      peroxidation) and Thiol levels between patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls. For
      patients taking risperidone, there were significant decreases in serum Thiol levels. In
      addition, there were also significant differences in age of onset of PPAR gamma coactivator
      1α (PGC-1α) polymorphism for schizophrenia patients. Therefore, we want to know the
      relationships between oxidative stress-, apoptosis-related markers, mitochondria DNA copy
      numbers and the clinical psychopathology of schizophrenia, including severity of positive and
      negative symptoms, obesity and metabolic syndrome.

      In past study, we also found that there were significant differences in 10 SNPs located in
      the D-loop region-related genes between patients and healthy controls. Three SNPs could be
      found in Mitomap data, but another seven SNPs not been found in the Mitomap and they could be
      more confirmed. In addition, Tanaka et al. found that haplogroup N9a was related to diabetes
      and metabolic syndrome in Asia. Therefore, we were interested to clarify the relationships
      between above related mitochondria genes and clinical phenotypes in Taiwanese populations,.

      In addition, we also want to see whether these biological markers could be as clinical
      markers in schizophrenia for a long-term follow-up study.
