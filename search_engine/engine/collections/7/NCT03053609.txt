    
      This is an observational retrospective study to describe the association between
      cardiorespiratory (CR) and gastroesophageal reflux (GER) events in infants who underwent
      synchronized 24h Multichannel Intraluminal Impedance/pH-metry (MII/pH) and CR monitoring for
      GER disease symptoms and CR events. Data are collected from medical records and database of
      the University Neonatal Intensive Care Unit of the Sant'Anna-Regina Margherita Children
      Hospital (Turin).

      The symptom association probability (SAP) index is used to identify those infants with
      significant associations between GER and CR events. In the group of infants with a positive
      SAP index the differences in reflux characteristics are compared according to whether a
      reflux preceded or followed a cardiorespiratory event (30 s time window).
