      10 centers in Belgium. In a subset of patients, the 6-week treatment phase will be preceded
      by a single-dose cross-over phase with 1 week of wash-out. While the objective of the study,
      due to its exploratory design, is to assess any effect of the study medication on MRI or
      clinical outcome, the study medication is expected to improve the residual (remaining)
      positive symptom(s) of patients. In addition, genetic and pharmacokinetic testing may be
      performed to learn more about the disorder and its treatment.
