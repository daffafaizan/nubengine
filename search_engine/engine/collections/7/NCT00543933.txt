      Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF). Though well-tolerated for years, long-term PI can lead to
      structural changes in the right ventricle, the sequelae of which include right heart failure,
      arrhythmia, and sudden cardiac death. The only current treatment for severe symptomatic PI is
      pulmonic valve replacement. We hypothesize that inhaled nitric oxide (iNO), a selective
      pulmonary vasodilator, can acutely decrease PI as assessed by cardiac magnetic resonance
      imaging (CMR). Methods: 22 consecutive patients with PI in the setting of corrected TOF or
      post pulmonic valve balloon valvuloplasty will undergo a clinically indicated CMR. Nitric
      oxide gas will be delivered via facemask through a specialized delivery device at 40ppm.
      After 5 minutes, flow velocity mapping and gradient echo sequences will be repeated to assess
      pulmonary regurgitant fraction, right ventricular volumes, and ejection fraction. Nitric
      oxide will be discontinued after acquisition of the last picture. Wilcoxon rank-sum for
      paired data will be used to assess effect of intervention. Significance: If decreasing
      pulmonary vascular resistance decreases PI, medical therapy with long-acting pulmonary
      vasodilators may be an attractive therapeutic option with the goal of delaying or even
      obviating pulmonic valve replacement.
