      medicine and when, and (2) reduces the number of times per day patients would take a
      multi-drug regimen. In this study, UMS tools will be exported into a second electronic health
      record platform to demonstrate ease of dissemination. Also, as patients may require
      assistance outside of clinic visits to adapt their prescription regimen to the UMS, this
      study will test the potential benefit of daily short message service (SMS) text reminders via
      cell phone.

      We will conduct a three-arm, provider-randomized controlled trial among English and
      Spanish-speaking adults taking three or more prescription drugs to evaluate the effectiveness
      of the UMS strategy, with and without SMS text reminders, to improve patient understanding,
      consolidation, and adherence compared to usual care.We will conduct a three-arm,
      provider-randomized trial at two community health centers in Chicago, IL to evaluate the UMS
      and UMS+SMS text reminder strategies compared to usual care. English and Spanish-speaking
      patients who are prescribed three or more medications will be recruited and assessed by phone
      at baseline, three months, and six months.
