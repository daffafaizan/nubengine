      child's skeleton, know how much growing they still have to do and predict how tall they will
      be as an adult. The Xray requires the child to keep their hand flat and still and in the
      correct orientation. Some children, especially young ones, find this difficult and therefore
      the quality of the Xray can mean that aging the skeleton is difficult and may require the
      Xray to be taken again.

      This study will see if the introduction of a hand outline on the Xray plate on which the
      child rests their hand will improve the quality of the Xray and reduce exposure to additional
      radiation by not having xrays repeated. The child will be asked to stretch their hand flat to
      match the outline, thus ensuring the correct position.
