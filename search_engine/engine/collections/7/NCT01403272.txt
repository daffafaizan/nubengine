        -  To evaluate healing of pressure ulcers already present or pressure ulcers that develop
           during the study.

        -  To evaluate the effectiveness of DermaTherapyÂ® bedding and alternative diapers to reduce
           the potential for bacterial contamination associated with patients' bed linens,
           underpads, gowns and pajamas, and thereby help reduce the incidence of facility-acquired
           infections.

      Study nurses will assess the skin of the subjects once or twice a week for the presence of
      pressure ulcers and measure the size of the pressure ulcers if they are present. Study nurses
      will also obtain bacterial culture swabs of the bedding weekly for the first eight weeks of
      the study from five participants in each group.
