      tolerated dose (MTD) (or the maximum administered dose [MAD]) and/or the selected dose(s) of
      Sym024 in patients with solid tumor malignancies.

      Part 2 of this study will assess the safety and tolerability to establish the MTD (or the
      MAD) and/or the selected dose(s) of Sym024 when administered in combination with Sym021 in
      patients with solid tumor malignancies.

      Part 3 of this study will assess the safety of Sym024 when administered alone or in
      combination with Sym021 in expanded cohorts of patients with solid tumor malignancies.
