      outpatient clinics in the University of Illinois Hospital and Health Sciences System (UI
      Health). Participants will be randomly assigned to receive intervention or usual care
      control.

      The I-CARE2 intervention synergistically integrates the PEARLS program for depression care
      the GLB program for weight loss. The PEARLS program provides problem-solving therapy (PST) as
      first-line for treating depression, with as-needed antidepressant medication intensification.
      Adapted from the original Diabetes Prevention Program, the GLB program promotes healthy
      lifestyle change for weight loss and increased physical activity. For combination treatment,
      the I-CARE2 intervention provides 9 individual counseling sessions (4 weekly, 2 biweekly, and
      then 3 monthly; 1 hour each) and participant self-study materials (GLB videos, handouts,
      weight and activity tracking) over 6 months.

      In response to the funding mechanism for this project, the specific aim of the ENGAGE-2 pilot
      study is to test the degree to which engaging the validated self-regulation target(s)
      produces desired behavior change important for weight management and mood.
