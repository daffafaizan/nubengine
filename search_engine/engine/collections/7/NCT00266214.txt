    
      Patients with carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS)as determined by electrodiagnostic testing and
      moderate to severe pain will be randomized to receive either the lidocaine patch 5% or
      placebo patch q24h. The total duration of the double-blind treatment phase of the study will
      be 8 weeks.

      At baseline and at periodic visits to the clinic, patients will perform pain and
      functionality assessments. Patients with bilateral CTS will identify the "index" wrist (i.e.,
      the more painful wrist), which will subsequently be the wrist used for all efficacy
      assessments throughout the study.

      Treatment Regimen and Route of Administration: Patients will apply one patch (either a
      lidocaine patch 5% or a matching placebo patch) to the volar aspect of each affected wrist
      once every 24 hours.
