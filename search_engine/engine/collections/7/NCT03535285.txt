      On the conventional surgical side, (the control side), the intersepital bone was undermined
      by two vertical cuts on the mesio-buccal and mesio-palatal line angles of the first premolar
      socket. They were connected at the base of the socket by an oblique cut. The surgical round
      bur was held parallel to the long axis of the canine and moved buccolingually, while shaving
      the interseptal bone buccolingual (back-and-forth) shaving movements were reduced the
      thickness of the interseptal bone by approximately 1 mm

      II- Modified surgical technique:

      In the surgical modification side, (the experimental side), intra-alveolar mesio-buccal and
      mesio-palatal cuts and interseptal bone shaving were done by surgical round bur and copious
      irrigation, without the oblique cut since it was done blindly in the original surgical
      technique. A buccal semilunar flap was opened on the apical area of canine-premolar region.
      The surgical pin helped also in location of the point of initial drilling of the apical
      horizontal cut from buccal approach, when the surgical pin's socket arm rested on the depth
      of the socket, the vestibular arm marked the point of access. It also estimated mesiodeistal
      extension of the apical horizontal cut. The apical horizontal cut was started from the socket
      apex to half way of the interseptal bone mesiodistally as an extension and for the depth,
      Mallet and Chisel were used from the cortical bone to reach the mesio-palatal cut. The flap
      was sutured. This surgical modification step provided more predictability and safer surgery
      than the blind oblique cut in the original surgical technique.
