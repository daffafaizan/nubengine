    
      Staggered enrollment is planned for this trial.

      Prior to initiating the study in the pediatric age group (6-17 years old), 30-99 eligible
      adults (ages 18-45 years) will be randomized 2:1 to tocilizumab or placebo, respectively.
      Once the first thirty adult participants have completed 12 weeks of treatment, the FDA and
      Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review available data (e.g., interim analysis)
      to weigh potential risks and benefits before opening the trial to pediatric participants.

      As of â‰¥ May 15, 2017: Study enrollment limited to participants ages 6 to 17 years inclusive.
