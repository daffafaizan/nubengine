    
      The study consists of two cohorts: A1 and A2.

      Subjects in Cohort A1 will be administered the investigational medicinal product (IMP) in a
      fasted state and subjects in Cohort A2 will be administered the IMP in a fed state.

      Each subject will change cohort during study participation, so that dosing will be done over
      two periods: either first fed and then fasted, or first fasted and then fed. The two periods
      will be separated by a period of 28 days (+7 days) where no investigational medicinal product
      is given.

      All subjects will be confined to the clinic from one day prior to dosing until Day 4 (72
      hours post-dose) in each dosing period.
