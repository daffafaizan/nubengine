      toric contact lenses as compared to spherical lenses in an astigmatic cohort of patients.
      Primary Hypotheses: Subjects will have better near visual acuity and near visual performance
      with toric, as opposed to spherical, contact lens correction. As such, the following
      hypotheses will be tested: H01: There is no statistically significant difference in near
      visual acuity or near vision performance between contact lenses corrections Ha1: There is a
      statistically significant difference in visual acuity or vision performance between contact
      lenses corrections
