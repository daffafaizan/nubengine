2753. left ventricular function following replacement of theaortic valve.  hemodynamic responses to muscular exerciseevaluations of left ventricular myocardialfunction were carried out in 14 patients4-16 mth after stenotic or regurgitantmalformations of the aortic valve had beencorrected by valve replacement.  thecirculatory responses to exercise, judged bythe increases in cardiac output in relationto the increases in oxygen consumption,were normal or only mildly reduced in 12patients.  in 5 patients the relationshipsbetween the change in the left ventricularend-diastolic pressure and the alterationin the stroke volume were also normal, afall or an increase in left ventricularend-diastolic pressure of less than 3 mmhg being accompanied by an increase instroke volume.  in 8 patients, however,abnormal increases in the left ventricularend-diastolic pressure occurred duringexercise, and in 4 the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was increased to levelsabove 12 mm hg.  variable alterations inthe stroke volume accompanied these increasesin end-diastolic pressure.  it issuggested that in the 3 patients who exhibitedsimultaneous increases in left ven-tricular end-diastolic pressure and strokevolume, the changes were either a mani-festation of the frank-starling mechanism,or primarily the result of a positiveinotropic influence.  in the 5 patients whoexhibited increases in left ventricularend-diastolic pressure, but no change or afall in stroke volume, it is proposedthat a distinct depression of left ventricularperformance was present.  thus, whilethe cardiac output response was adequate tomeet the stress of exercise in themajority of the patients studied following aorticvalve replacement, determinationof the relationship between the left ventricularend-diastolic pressure and the strokevolume permitted the detection of abnormalitiesin the function of the left ventricle.
