    
      This study is designed to run parallel to our currently IRB approved protocol #0810010013
      entitled "Direct CNS Administration of a Replication Deficient Adeno-associated Virus Gene
      Transfer Vector Serotype rh.10 Expressing the Human CLN2 cDNA to Children with Late Infantile
      Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis," which will assess the safety and efficacy of the virus
      AAVrh.10 to deliver the CLN2 gene to children in the early stages of the disease. This
      current study proposes to assess the safety and efficacy of the administration of the same
      biologic to children who do not fit the criteria for IRB protocol #0810010013.

      The differences between protocol #0810010013 and the proposed "parallel" protocol is that
      inclusion criteria have been modified to include children with any genotype (not only the 5
      most common genotypes as in the currently approved protocol) and/or those who score below a 6
      but at least a 1 on the Weill Cornell LINCL scale. The reason for expanding the eligibility
      criteria is to obtain a range of safety data for all children with LINCL, not only those with
      limited genotype and/or severity. Only 8 subjects will be administered the gene transfer
      vector in this "parallel" protocol. Subjects will be accrued through IRB approved protocol
      #0901010186 entitled, "Genotype-Phenotype Correlations of Late Infantile Neuronal Ceroid
      Lipofuscinosis (2)." Those who do not fit all criteria for the already approved gene transfer
      protocol (#0810010013) may have the opportunity to be enrolled in this proposed "parallel
      protocol" (Figure 1). The subjects in the new protocol will be compared to the 16 treated and
      16 untreated children enrolled in IRB protocol #0810010013 and #0901010186, respectively.
