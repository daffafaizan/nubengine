      impairment by enhancing acetylcholine through inhibition of the enzyme, acetylcholinesterase.
      We propose an open-label pilot feasibility study of short-term (6 weeks) treatment with
      galantamine.

      Sixteen chronic smokers will undergo a validated procedure for screening new medications.
      Following an initial 4-week drug run-up phase (8mg daily of galantamine-ER), medication dose
      will be increased to 16 mg daily of galantamine-ER during the fifth and sixth weeks of the
      study. At the beginning of Week 6, smokers will receive brief counseling and make a 7-day
      quit attempt.

      Following completion of the study, participants will be offered standard smoking cessation
      treatment. Subjects will perform a working memory task (Visual/Spatial N-Back), a sustained
      attention task (Continuous Performance Task; CPT), a recall memory task (Word Recognition), a
      cognitive flexibility task (Wisconsin Card Sort Test), and a response inhibition task (Stop
      Signal Task). The primary outcome is the ability to remain abstinent during a 7-day quit
      attempt. Secondary outcomes include change in cognitive performance, adherence, and side
      effects.

      This pilot study will provide information about the role of the cholinergic system during
      brief abstinence and whether enhancing acetylcholine reduces abstinence-induced cognitive
      symptoms that promote smoking relapse. Information obtained in this study may further
      establish cognitive performance measures as endophenotypes for nicotine dependence.
