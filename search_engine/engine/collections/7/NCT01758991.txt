    
      tDCS will be used in a double-blind, randomized control trial in acute stroke patients
      suffering from dysphagia.

      After informed consent and recruitment, patients will be randomly (computer method) allocated
      to real or sham tDCS, that will be applied during swallowing exercices/therapy or supervised
      feeding.

      Baseline and follow-up outcomes about dysphagia will be collected.
