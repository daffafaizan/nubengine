      I. Assess the estimated probability of relapse at 2 years after autologous peripheral blood
      stem cell (PBSC) transplant.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Estimate the probability of transplant-related mortality (TRM) at 100 days following
      autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT).

      II. Estimate probabilities of overall and disease-free survival. III. Assess if biological
      and molecular correlative studies can predict better outcome.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive targeted busulfan intravenously (IV) or oral (PO) every 6 hours on days -7
      to -4 and etoposide IV on day -3. Patients then undergo autologous stem cell transplant on
      day 0.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up yearly for 2 years.
