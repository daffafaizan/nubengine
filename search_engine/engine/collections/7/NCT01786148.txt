      Network (LN) program and manual for rural persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) and develop
      into a mobile application.

      2.0 Conduct a randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of the program. When compared
      with an educational music control condition at 3, 6, and 9 months post-baseline, those
      randomized to the LN will have: H1: Significantly higher mean antiretroviral therapy (ART)
      adherence rates (measured by pill counts, self report).

      H2: Significantly higher mean levels of ART drug levels in hair sample analyses.

      H3: Significantly better clinical indicators: higher mean CD4 lymphocyte counts and percents,
      a larger proportion achieving virologic suppression (proportion with HIV RNA PCR <50
      copies/ml), and smaller proportion with evidence of drug resistance, all as measured by
      medical record review.

      3.0 Explore: a) the effects of LN on symptoms and symptom management; b) the roles of
      self-efficacy, outcome expectancies, and personal goal setting as mediators, and depression
      and health literacy as moderators of adherence.
