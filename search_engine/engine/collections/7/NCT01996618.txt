      ventricular beats (using 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring) for subjects
      with symptomatic palpitations. Subject population will consist of seventy-two adult subjects
      of both sexes who have greater than 1,000 premature ventricular beats during initial
      monitoring.
