      hip screw in intertrochanteric proximal femoral fractures. The current lierature focus on
      outcome questionnaires, pain scores and basic functional tests alone does not delineate the
      functional benefits clearly enough. A key factor in whether a person, post hip fracture,
      returns to independent living is gait speed. The cost implications on the healthcare provider
      of having 30% of this ever increasing group losing their independence and requiring admission
      to a care facility post hip fracture is a growing problem.

      Shortening of the abductor lever arm is a particular concern with the SHS, and the resultant
      biomechanical alterations impairs gait, including decreased cadence and increased double
      support time on the injured side.

      The difference in cost between a nail and a SHS is a driver to prevent routine use of nailing
      in this population unless a clear benefit is demonstrated. Fracture union is not a problem
      for the most part and, as such, the focus must be on achieving better functional outcome,
      less morbidity and less mortality in this group.

      The key question to answer is whether a IM Nail (TFNA) results in a greater functional
      benefit in A1/A2 intertrochanteric fractures compared with the SHS.
