           IL-1Î², CB1, HSP in the incidence of shoulder stiffness.

        2. Second year: Investigators intend to conduct a prospective randomized double-blind study
           for the clinical effect of ESWT on patients with shoulder stiffness.

        3. Third year: Investigators wish to test the biologic effect of ESWT on patients with
           shoulder stiffness and to elucidate the molecular mechanism for this effect through a
           randomized comparative study.
