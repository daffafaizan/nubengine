      tumor operable or to allow conservative surgery in the case of a T2-T3 tumor. Therefore,
      treatment is expected to induce a maximum tumor shrinkage within a short period. In addition
      and based on the anti-angiogenic MoA, bevacizumab (Avastin) is to be administered as early as
      possible during the disease stages. Bevacizumab has already been tested in the neoadjuvant
      setting with encouraging results. In a first trial patients with inoperable locally advanced
      breast cancer received docetaxel with or without bevacizumab with five clinical Complete
      Responses and 24 Partial Responses. In a second trial there was also reported the results of
      the combination of bevacizumab with doxorubicin and docetaxel for the treatment of
      inflammatory breast cancer. Then, a set of studies of primary therapy exploring the activity
      of different regimens have confirmed the role of baseline pathological features of the tumor
      in predicting the responsiveness to primary therapy. A 22% pathological complete responses
      (pCR) rate has been achieved in a study combining bevacizumab together with Xeloda and
      Taxotere suggesting that bevacizumab addition to chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant treatment is
      feasible showing promising activity while no unexpected toxicities were reported.

      Thus, a very high interest exists from our clinicians mostly within our cooperative groups
      which cover the largest national oncology centers to be involved and run such a study.
