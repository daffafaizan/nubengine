      information including risks, benefits and alternatives must be clearly communicated, and the
      acceptance of treatment must be voluntary. The consent process usually occurs in the office
      setting through physician-led verbal communication. Despite satisfying the three criteria of
      informed consent, many patients leave the office with an inadequate understanding of the
      treatment they have consented to.

      The purpose of this study is to use an interactive patient education pathway as an adjunct to
      the informed consent process for patients undergoing hysteroscopy. This will be done using a
      randomized controlled trial design.

      Patients will be randomized to the control group (standard consent process) or the education
      group (standard consent process augmented by access to an interactive hysteroscopy teaching
      platform).

      All patients will undergo the standard physician-led informed consent process. Patients from
      both groups will be asked to complete a post-informed consent questionnaire to assess their
      understanding of their upcoming procedure, preparedness for the procedure, and satisfaction
      with the informed consent process, be that through the traditional method or the interactive
      patient education portal.
