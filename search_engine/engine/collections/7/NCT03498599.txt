      evaluate the neural correlates of fear conditioning and extinction. During fear conditioning
      participants see a picture of a face that predicts a mild electrical shock to the wrist.
      Participants then return the next day to the scanner for a test of fear expression 24-hours
      after fear conditioning. The investigators are simultaneously measuring autonomic arousal in
      the scanner using measures of skin conductance responses (i.e., sweating).

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate different forms of Pavlovian fear
      extinction in patients who suffer from pathological anxiety. The investigators are interested
      in the effects of extinction and extinction retention over a delay in regions that are known
      to show abnormalities in anxiety populations. This includes the amygdala, ventromedial
      prefrontal cortex, and the hippocampus.

      The study is testing behavioral strategies and does not include any pharmacological
      manipulations.
