      than traditional serology to enterocyte injury in celiac patients who do not a gluten free
      diet. In this study a pediatric population of celiac patients will be tested for I-FABP
      levels during initial endoscopic diagnosis and during one year of follow up. Their levels
      will be compared to a control group of pediatric patients undergoing endoscopy for reasons
      other than suspicion of celiac disease. During the period of follow up, the test group will
      undergo repeat testing for I-FABP levels, as well as the traditional follow up testing for
      serology in celiac patients and a questionnaire regarding. The results will be analyzed in
      the hope of finding a way to use I-FABP as a more direct, accurate marker of disease
      activity, and of correlations between it's level and the patient's Marsh score at diagnosis.
