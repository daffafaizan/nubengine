      an antacid. A prior study found an interaction with another medicine like raltegravir called
      elvitegravir and an antacid. The elvitegravir levels were reduced by half. The same
      interaction may occur with raltegravir and an antacid based on the structure of this medicine
      and how it works. When the levels of HIV medications are reduced, people with HIV can "fail"
      their treatment. The virus can multiply when the drug levels are too low and the medications
      can stop working. We need to be sure that antacids will not cause this problem with
      raltegravir.
