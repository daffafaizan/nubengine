      I. To demonstrate the feasibility of continuous, accelerometer-based evaluation of patient
      activity levels before, during, and after treatment with fractionated external beam
      radiotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To demonstrate the feasibility of performing weekly quality of life assessments during
      fractionated external beam radiotherapy.

      II. To explore how accelerometer-based metrics change throughout patients' treatment courses
      and if these changes are associated with quality of life assessments, treatment
      interruptions, hospitalizations, and clinical outcomes.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients wear an activity monitor throughout and up 4 weeks after completion of radiation
      therapy. Patients who are willing may continue to wear the monitor through routine follow up
      appointments. Patients also complete questionnaires at evaluations, which take place prior to
      radiotherapy initiation, weekly during radiotherapy, and then 2 and 4 weeks after the
      completion of radiotherapy.
