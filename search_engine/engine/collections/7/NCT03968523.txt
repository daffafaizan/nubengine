      work. TAP block is the gold standard technique in this type of hernioplasty. Our aim is to
      compare TAP block with a novel local infiltration technique that uses direct laparoscopical
      vision. Patients will be randomized into two arms of intervention that will be compared by a
      blind analysis. Primary outcomes will be postoperative pain evaluated systematically until 30
      days postoperative, and analgesic consumption.
