      must meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria and return tactile sensitivity scores within
      protocol-specified parameters at both the screening and baseline visits.

      Run-in will consist of a 2-week period during which subjects will use a sodium fluoride
      dentifrice. At the start of the first phase, subjects will attend a Screening Visit. They
      will participate in the informed consent process, complete a medical/dental history, and be
      evaluated for tactile sensitivity to Yeaple probe and response to a cold air stimulus.

      Subjects who qualify through screening will begin a run-in period that will last
      approximately two weeks. The run-in period will be followed by a Baseline visit. Subjects who
      continue to qualify through Baseline will be randomized to one of three treatment groups.

      During the four-week treatment period, all subjects will brush their teeth twice daily for at
      least one minute in their usual manner, with their assigned toothpaste. After brushing,
      subjects assigned to the mouth rinse group will rinse with water, and then rinse with 10 mL
      of the experimental mouth rinse for 60 seconds.

      The study duration is approximately six weeks with each subject visiting the clinical site
      six times.

      Adverse events will be observed and collected by querying each subject at each visit for new
      or continuing symptoms.
