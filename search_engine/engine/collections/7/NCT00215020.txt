      Elevated tissue, serum, and urinary isoprostane levels have been described in a number of
      inflammatory diseases. The goal of this study is to determine utility of measuring urinary
      isoprostane levels in pediatric patients with inflammatory and non-inflammatory
      gastrointestinal disease. Urine samples will be collected from pediatric patients undergoing
      procedures in the Children's Hospital endoscopy unit. Clinical disease activity will be
      assessed using a standardized clinical disease activityiIndex. Gross endoscopic and
      histologic findings will be graded. Previously obtained laboratory studies will also be
      recorded. Urinary Isoprostane levels will be determined using a commercially available assay.
      Isoprostane levels will be compared across conditions (IBD vs. non-inflammatory, Crohn's
      disease vs. ulcerative colitis) and tested for statistical significance. Similarly, disease
      severity and urinary isoprostane levels will be assessed. The sensitivity, specificity, and
      positive and negative predictive values of elevated urinary isoprostane levels at
      discriminating pediatric patients with inflammatory and non-inflammatory gastrointestinal
      disease will be calculated.
