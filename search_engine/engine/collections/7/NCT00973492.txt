    
      This is a prospective, open, non-controlled study with an individual benefit for the
      participant. This study is designed to assess whether functional insulinotherapy decreases
      blood glucose variability at 3 months and 6 months, compared to initial values in type 1
      diabetes patients.

      All 30 patients with type 1 diabetes attended a 4-day functional insulinotherapy class,
      taught by 2 nurses, 2 dieticians and 2 physicians. The participants were recruited among
      metabolically stable patients who had already been prescribed functional insulinotherapy.

      To assess the impact of functional insulinotherapy on blood glucose variability, HbA1c will
      be measured at 0, 3 months and 6 months along with 4 blood glucose variability indicators:
      MAGE, ADRR, LI and LBGI.

      This trial also has a secondary objective: to measure the effect of functional
      insulinotherapy on oxidative stress. Therefore, a measure of insulin antibodies by ELISA at
      baseline. At baseline and 6 months, LTE4, TXB2, 8-iso-PGF2alpha, anti-transglutaminase and
      anti-endomysium antibodies will also be assessed.
