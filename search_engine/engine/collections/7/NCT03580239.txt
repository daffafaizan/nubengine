      ideal therapeutic strategy.Further clarifying its mechanism and finding more effective
      therapeutic targets on this basis are the clinical problems to be solved urgently. More and
      more studies have confirmed that the role of PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway in the
      development of castration resistance to prostate cancer.By next generation sequencing of 115
      patients with CRPC, investigators found that 22% of the patients had mutations in the
      PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling related genes.Investigators found that 50% of the patients could
      benefit from the mTOR inhibitors.But the specific clinical significance and molecular
      mechanism are urgently needed to be elucidated. This project is based on the hypothesis that
      Everolimus can target CRPC patients with PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathways
      deficiency.So,investigators intend to peform a prospective, randomized,
      controlled,multicenter clinical study to find potential therapeutic targets and treatment
      strategies for CRPC patients.
