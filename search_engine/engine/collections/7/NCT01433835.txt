      benign infection in the majority of humans, with a 90% prevalence in the adult population1.
      However, CMV infection continues to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality in
      immunosuppressed patients, particularly recipients of solid organ or bone marrow transplants.
      CMV is also known for its association with severe blinding retinitis, pneumonia and
      gastrointestinal inflammation in AIDS patients. However, with the successful introduction of
      HAART (highly active anti-retroviral therapy), the problem of CMV infection in AIDS patients
      has decreased substantially. CMV remains the most important cause of congenital viral
      infection in the United States, and CMV infection of neonates is associated with deafness,
      mental retardation and mortality. In addition, CMV is a suspected pathogenic agent in
      cardiovascular disease and can persist in large-vessel endothelial cells and infect all cell
      types involved in cardiovascular lesions. CMV has been implicated in the restenosis of
      diseased coronary arteries following angioplasty and has been associated with myocarditis. In
      severely immunocompromised patients with CMV infection, prolonged antiviral therapy is often
      necessary, which increases the risk of resistant viruses. Currently available therapy has
      limitations that preclude their long-term use including toxicity, poor oral bioavailability
      and the development of drug-resistant strains. MBX-400 is a nucleoside analog that is
      structurally related to ganciclovir and acyclovir and is being developed for the possible use
      in the prevention and/or treatment of CMV. MBX-400, has been shown to be a potent inhibitor
      of viral DNA synthesis and therefore may be useful in treating and/or preventing CMV
      infection.
