      States, and screening has been shown to reduce mortality from CRC. Screening is underutilized
      in the United States, particularly in some communities such as Blacks/African Americans,
      American Indians/Alaskan Natives, and rural populations, contributing to disparities in
      mortality.

      For CRC screening, mt-sDNA testing is one of several tests that are recommended by the United
      States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF). As part of a quality improvement program at
      our institution, those who are due for CRC screening are identified using a validated
      electronic algorithm and a kit is mailed directly to each patient. Our intervention is
      initiated on non-respondents to the mailed mt-sDNA outreach by testing the use of a
      technology-enabled reminder system.

      Thirty days after being mailed a mt-sDNA kit, patients who have not completed the screening
      will be randomized to receive a reminder to complete the mt-sDNA screening by one of three
      mechanisms (time 0):

        1. Automated reminder using the EHR patient portal messaging system.

        2. Automated reminder using a customized interactive voice response (IVR) system

        3. Personalized reminder phone calls from the clinical team

      This will allow for an empirical test of processes that can be employed to improve delivery
      of CRC screening and reduce preventable deaths in populations that are underserved with
      evidence-based interventions.
