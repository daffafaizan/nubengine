      and chronic disability. The studies on the association between vitamin d and osteoporosis
      have yielded conflicting results. While some have shown a positive correlation, others have
      concluded that there is no association at all. Recent reports have shown vitamin D
      supplementation do not prevent fragile fractures. This might be because the actual vitamin D
      status, which should be the free vitamin D, has not been measured.
