      mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor and a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor
      for epigenetic targeted therapies.

      Subjects will receive RAD001 and LBH589 given in two to thirteen, 28-day cycles. Subjects
      will be assessed for disease status after 2 cycles and then after every 4 cycles. Subjects
      with progressive disease will stop after 2 cycles. Subjects with stable disease or better les
      may receive up to 13 cycles. LBH589 was given at 40mg when the study first opened and was
      changed to 20mg po shortly thereafter. LBH589 is taken on days M/W/F. RAD001 was given at
      10mg po daily for Part 1. In Part 2, LBH589 is given at 15mg and RAD001 is given at 7.5mg.

      Treatment will be administered on an outpatient basis. Patients will be followed for up to 2
      years after completion of therapy or until progression of disease or death.
