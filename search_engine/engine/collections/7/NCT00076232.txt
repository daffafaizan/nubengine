      HIV infection. Acyclovir is the most widely studied and clinically utilized antiviral for the
      suppression of HSV-2 infection. This study will evaluate the efficacy of twice-daily dosing
      of acyclovir in preventing HIV infection in both WSM and MSM with genital herpes. For this
      study, WSM will be enrolled in Lusaka, Zambia; Harare, Zimbabwe; and Johannesburg, South
      Africa; MSM will be enrolled in Lima and Pucallpa, Peru; Seattle, Washington, USA; New York
      City, New York, USA; and San Francisco, California, USA.

      Participants will be enrolled for 12 months in this study and will be randomly assigned to
      one of two study arms. The first arm will receive 400 mg acyclovir twice daily; the second
      arm will receive placebo. Follow-up visits will occur monthly. Participants will be tested
      for STDs, including HIV and syphilis, at each visit and treated as necessary; participants
      will also be given adherence and condom counseling, risk behavior and sexual history
      questionnaires, and genital symptoms questionnaires at all study visits. Medical history will
      be assessed and participants will undergo blood work at Months 3, 6, 9, and 12.
