basal metabolic rate after cardiovascular surgery .the basal metabolic rate and respiratory equivalent of patients weredetermined during 8 days of convalescence from cardiovascular surgicaloperations performed with or without cardiopulmonary bypass . theresults were compared in patients who had undergone operation fordifferent diseases . metabolic rate in the majority of cases wasincreased but was commensurate with body temperature . some patients,particularly those requiring open operation on the aortic valve, hadraised metabolic rates which could not be explained solely by pyrexia .all types of patients in this series had elevated respiratoryequivalents which persisted throughout convalescence . these equivalentswere greater in patients treated with cardiopulmonary bypass than inpatients treated without bypass .
