    
      -  This is not a treatment study. A treatment regimen has already been decided upon by the
           patient and doctor.

        -  At the screening visit for this trial the following will be performed: a medical
           history, physical examination, CT scan to measure the amount and size of the tumor(s),
           and a PET scan using glucose that has been attached to a small amount of radioactivity
           to determine how well the tumor takes up glucose.

        -  Patients will then be randomized into one of 2 treatment groups. Group 1 will receive
           both 5-FU and bevacizumab on the first day of chemotherapy. Group 2 will receive just
           5-FU on the first day of chemotherapy.

        -  Patients will undergo a PET scan that uses water that has been attached to a small
           amount of radioactivity to measure how well the tumor takes up water prior to the 5-FU
           adminstration.

        -  After patients receive 5-Fu they will undergo a PET scan during which a small amount of
           5-FU has been attached to a small amount of radioactivity to measure how well the tumor
           takes up 5-FU.
