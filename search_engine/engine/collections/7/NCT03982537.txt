    
      Primary Objective(s) I. To determine whether short duration pre-treatment with N-acetyl
      cysteine reduces the rate of severe mucositis that develops during the standard concurrent
      chemoradiotherapy in patients with locally advanced Head and Neck Squamous Cell Cancer.

      Secondary Objective(s) I. Identify the effect of N-acetyl cysteine on the oral microbiome.

      II. Identify the effect of short duration pre-treatment with N-acetyl cysteine on the
      duration and delay onset of severe radiation-induced mucositis developed during the standard
      concurrent chemoradiotherapy in patients with locally advanced Head and Neck Squamous Cell
      Cancer.

      III. Bank saliva and blood for future studies of biomarkers that will be correlated with
      changes in the oral microbiome and the duration of mucositis.

      IV. Determine if there is any effect of short duration pre-treatment with N-acetyl cysteine
      on tumor response to standard CRT as measured within the first year of treatment.

      V. Determine the relationship between human papillomavirus status and smoking status and the
      baseline microbiome as well as well as the possible differential effect of N-acetyl cysteine
      on the structure of the oral microbiome in human papillomavirus positive patients vs smokers.

      VI. Gather data on the incidence, severity, duration and onset of severe radiation-induced
      mucositis as well as data on saliva and blood biomarkers and evaluation of the oral
      microbiome in patients receiving standard of care primary or adjuvant chemoradiotherapy to
      gather preliminary data for use in designing future Phase 3 studies.
