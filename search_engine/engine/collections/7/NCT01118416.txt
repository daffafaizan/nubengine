    
      This study is a randomized clinical trial. A sample of 300 non-treatment seeking YMSM (ages
      18-24) who report risky sex and club drug use in the past 90 days are being enrolled using
      active and passive community-based recruitment strategies in NYC. After baseline assessment,
      participants are being randomly assigned to one of two study arms: a Brief Risk Reduction
      Intervention Condition - a four session MET intervention piloted for feasibility and
      acceptability among YMSM, designed to increase readiness to change club drug use and
      unprotected sex; or an Education Comparison Condition - four sessions of facilitated
      education regarding the effects of club drugs and unprotected sex. Participants undergo
      follow-up assessments 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after baseline.
