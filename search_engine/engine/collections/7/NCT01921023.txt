    
      The PROX006 study is an open and non-randomised study that will be conducted to assess the
      performance of the Proxima (a CE marked Medical Device)on a wide range of patients with a
      variety of conditions. This study will allow the performance of the Proxima and the
      institution's conventional blood gas analyser to be compared when used in the Intensive Care
      Unit and Operating Theatre.

      The PROX006 investigation is an observational method comparison study - the results obtained
      from the Proxima will be compared with those obtained on the institution's conventional blood
      gas analyser (BGA). The potential for bias by the user will be negated in this study by
      directly comparing the results from the BGA and Proxima.

      The data/results documented in the Case Report Form (CRF) will be verified during monitoring
      visits.
