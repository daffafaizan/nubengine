      rehabilitation interventions, a great proportion of patients suffers from motor disability in
      the upper limb. Recently, several studies have shown that post CVA patients exhibit great
      neural plasticity as a direct consequence of their condition.

      Interestingly, the transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive electro
      stimulation technique that allows for a modulation of cerebral activity. It has been shown
      that when applied to the cerebellum, tDCS increases learning performances of healthy
      subjects. Yet, motor rehabilitation after a CVA highly relies on motor (re)learning. The
      cerebellar tDCS thus appear as a promising method to enhance the performance of post-CVA
      motor learning and consequently the benefits of post-CVA rehabilitation.

      The current study aims to promote the post CVA neural plasticity by using the tDCS in order
      to enhance motor learning of the upper limb.
