      electronic medical records. In this project, the investigators will combine high-throughput
      sequencing, asthma case database, electronic medical record and informatics to investigate
      the feasibility of combining lncRNA with electronic medical record for asthma diagnostic
      model. The expected results will establish the foundation for the diagnosis and treatment of
      childhood asthma and open up new ideas.
