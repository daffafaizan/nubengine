      (standard of care) or the intervention group of standard of care with the addition of
      adopting a 10 hour eating window for one year (TRE). For the first 3 months of intervention,
      participants will be monitored closely by the research team. For the following 9 months,
      participants will be in a self-monitored intervention period. Investigators will evaluate the
      impact of TRE on blood glucose levels, biomarkers, sleep/mood, and weight loss. These
      assessments will be made at baseline, at the end of the 12-week monitored intervention
      period, and every 3 months (months 6, 9, and 12) during the self-monitored intervention
      period for one year. Food/drink intake, activity, and sleep will be monitored with the
      smartphone myCircadianClock application ("mCC app") throughout the study. A continuous
      glucose monitor, a wrist-worn actigraphy device, and questionnaires will also be used during
      the study.
