      reasons for people attempting suicide and the major modifiable risk factors are depression,
      anxiety, insomnia, and agitation. The standard treatment for all suicidal patients includes
      medication, admission to a hospital and reducing the risk factors. Medications have potential
      side effects and concerns about the drug interactions. One of the biological treatment
      alternatives to medication is cranial electric stimulation. This technique uses a device to
      stimulate the brain through electrical current. Using an Alpha-StimÂ® device, current is
      applied to the brain using skin electrodes which can be easily clipped on to the earlobe. The
      amount of current used is very low and is 1/1000 th of the current used for electroconvulsive
      therapy (ECT) and 1/10 th to 1/20 th of the 1-2 milliamperes used with transcranial direct
      current stimulation (tDCS). Our goal is to examine the safety and efficacy of this device
      when used as an add-on or adjunctive treatment to the usual treatments during the inpatient
      stay.
