      stability training programme is effective in improving balance, mobility and balance
      confidence in ambulant individuals with Multiple Sclerosis (MS). The secondary aim is to
      determine the relative effectiveness of this 12 week Pilates based core stability training
      programme compared to a standardised physiotherapy exercise programme. Finally we intend to
      explore the underlying mechanisms of change associated with these exercise interventions by
      directly measuring changes in muscle thickness and activation in the deep abdominal core
      stabilising muscles of a sub-set of participants.
