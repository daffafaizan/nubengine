    
      Leber Congenital Amaurosis (LCA) is a diagnosis for a group of severe, autosomal recessively
      inherited rod - cone dystrophies that typically result in complete visual loss in the third
      or fourth decade of life. One form, LCA2, is caused by a mutation in the gene encoding RPE56,
      an RPE-specific 65-kDa isomerase. Non-functional RPE65 results in photoreceptor cells that
      are unable to respond to light resulting in these patients being visually impaired.

      In preparation for human clinical trials, a detailed prospective phenotypic study will be
      undertaken to investigate the natural history of RPE65-LCA. Such a study will help identify
      suitable patients for therapeutic intervention. Furthermore through greater phenotyping an
      optimal window for intervention and specific parameters to help quantify effect and identify
      clinical end points may have been ascertained .
