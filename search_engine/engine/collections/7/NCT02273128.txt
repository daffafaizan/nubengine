      nonmodifiable risk factors. The non modifiable risk factors include genetic polymorphisms
      like metabolism associated genetic polymorphisms ( Vitamin D and Calcitonin).

      Osteoporosis is a systemic skeletal disease characterized by low bone mass and
      micro-architectural deterioration of bone tissue with consequent increase in bone fragility
      and susceptibility to fractures.

      Bone loss is a common feature shared between periodontal disease and osteoporosis.

      Out of all genetic factors Calcitonin gene polymorphism contributes to the development of
      both osteoporosis and chronic periodontitis.
