      commence. Subjects will be randomized into one of two groups. Binary randomization for
      microneedle pretreatment of the right vs. the left hand (Dominant hand has higher strength
      which may skew side effect reporting of weakness).

      The evaluation of sweat production will be done using the subjective patient reported
      Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Scale (HDSS) and objective gravimetric measurement.
      Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Scale (HDSS) is a scale from 1 to 4. Values of 1 or 2
      represent Mild/moderate disease, and 3 or 4 represent severe disease. Successful treatment is
      indicated by improvement from 3 or 4 to 1 or 2. One point improvement in HDSS score is
      associated with 50% reduction in sweat production and a two-point improvement with an 80%
      reduction, according to the Canadian Hyperhidrosis Advisory Committee.

      Gravimetric measurement includes collecting sweat secretion on standardized filter. Prior to
      any measurements, the subject will be asked to sit in a climate-controlled room for 15 min to
      allow for acclimatization. Filter paper is first weighed on a high-precision laboratory
      scale. The filter papers are then placed in the subject's palms for 5 minutes, and weighed
      again. This technique has already been used in other studies of hyperhidrosis [5]. The
      difference in the weight (g) will allow calculation of sweat secretion in grams per 5
      minutes.

      The subject's palm will be cleansed with gauze. Then the microneedle pretreatment versus sham
      microneedle pretreatment will be performed. This will consist of rolling the microneedles or
      sham microneedles into the skin for several seconds on the sides of the palm that have
      respectively been randomized to the microneedle or control treatment. Sham microneedles will
      consist of a flat roller without the presence of the microneedles. The microneedles are solid
      and are long enough to penetrate the stratum corneum and enter the epidermis. Microneedles
      that are less than 700 micrometers in length have been shown to induce minimal pain, and our
      ongoing work with microneedles that were 650 micrometers in length was rated a 1 out of 10 on
      a visual analog pain scale. For this study, subjects will rate pain on a visual analog scale
      after the microneedle pretreatment as well.

      Next a Transepidermal Water Loss Meter (Tewameter) will be used to measure the water
      evaporation gradient on the skin. Measurements will be performed with non-invasive devices
      that have been widely used for the study of skin barrier function. Each device has a flat-top
      electrode (approximate diameter of 1cm) that will come in contact with the skin surface
      during measurements. This device does not deliver any energy into the skin. The subjects will
      not experience discomfort during and after the measurements. The electrode tip will be
      cleaned with alcohol wipes between subjects.

      Next, the subject will asked to grade their discomfort with the pretreatment step on a 10 cm
      visual analog pain scale.

      Next, botulinum toxin A solution will be mixed per standard protocol in the dermatology
      clinic and will be applied and evenly spread over the palm. This will be followed by
      occlusion with an occlusive wrap such as saran wrap or a silicone based gel. The subject will
      be asked to keep the saran wrap in place for 1 hour. Botulinum toxin A is an FDA approved
      product for the treatment of hyperhidrosis.

      Follow-up visits will be at 4-6 weeks post treatment. During the follow-up visit the patient
      will be asked about side effects or any adverse events. Also a repeat evaluation of sweat
      production will be done using the subjective patient reported Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity
      Scale (HDSS) and objective gravimetric measurement. They will also complete a global
      satisfaction survey.

      Split-hand Botulinum Toxin A group: After the subject has been consented, the Treatment Visit
      will commence. Subjects will be randomized into one of two groups. Binary randomization for

      skew side effect reporting of weakness).

      The subject's palm will be cleansed with gauze. Then the microneedle pretreatment will be
      performed on both palms. This will consist of rolling the microneedles into the skin for
      several seconds on the sides of the palm. The microneedles are solid and are long enough to

      analog scale after the microneedle pretreatment as well.

      Next a VapoMeter will be used to measure the water evaporation gradient on the skin. The
      Vapometer measures the transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and evaporation rates. Measurements
      will be performed with non-invasive devices that have been widely used for the study of skin
      barrier function (Figure 1) [6]. Each device has a flat-top chamber (approximate diameter of
      1cm) that will come in contact with the skin surface during measurements. This device has a
      humidity sensor and does not deliver any energy into the skin. The subjects will not
      experience discomfort during and after the measurements. The electrode tip will be cleaned
      with alcohol wipes between subjects.

      Next, the subject will asked to grade their discomfort with the pretreatment step on a 10 cm

      Next, botulinum toxin A solution will be mixed per standard protocol in the dermatology
      clinic and will be applied and evenly spread over the palm that was randomized for treatment
      with botulinum toxin A. The other palm will be treated with a placebo (saline). This will be
      followed by occlusion with an occlusive wrap such as saran wrap, a silicone based gel, or
      glove. The subject will be asked to keep the saran wrap, silicone gel, or glove in place for
      1 hour. Botulinum toxin A is an FDA approved product for the treatment of hyperhidrosis.

      Follow-up visits will be at 4-6 weeks post treatment. During the follow-up visit the patient

      production will be done using the subjective patient reported Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity
