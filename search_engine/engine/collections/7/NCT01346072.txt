      identifying patients at the high or low end of the spectrum of copeptin levels for
      outpatients with stable heart failure. This will be accomplished by blinded review of
      copeptin levels obtained during screening.

      The primary endpoints for analysis will be 24 hour urine output and the change in body weight
      over 24 hours during the inpatient stay.
