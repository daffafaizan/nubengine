        -  Determine the efficacy and feasibility of celecoxib combined with docetaxel as
           first-line therapy in elderly or poor performance status patients with advanced
           non-small cell lung cancer.

        -  Determine the response rate of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral celecoxib twice daily (beginning on day -7 of the first course) and
      docetaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve a complete response
      (CR) receive 2 additional courses after CR. Patients who achieve stable disease (SD) or a
      partial response (PR) receive a minimum of 2 additional courses after SD or PR. At the
      discretion of the treating physician, patients then receive maintenance therapy comprising
      celecoxib only.

      Patients who discontinue therapy for disease progression or unacceptable toxicity are
      followed for at least 6 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 21-39 patients will be accrued for this study within 13-28
      months.
