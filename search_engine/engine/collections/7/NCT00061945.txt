    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the feasibility and toxicity profiles of escalating doses of Campath-1H
      (alemtuzumab) given subcutaneously during post-remission intensification treatment of adults
      with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).

      II. To determine the disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) when Campath-1H is
      used during post-remission intensification treatment of adults with ALL.

      III. To determine whether antibody treatment with Campath-1H can further reduce minimal
      residual disease states in adult ALL.

      IV. To obtain preliminary descriptive data on serum levels of Campath-1H during course IV,
      module D using limited pharmacokinetic sampling during the phase I and II components of the
      study.

      V. To obtain feasibility data on the addition of imatinib to Cancer and Leukemia Group B
      (CALGB) induction and postremission combination chemotherapy for patients with Philadelphia
      chromosome positive (Ph+) ALL.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of alemtuzumab.

      COURSE 1 (module A): Patients receive allopurinol orally (PO) 4 times daily (QID) on days
      1-14, cyclophosphamide* intravenously (IV) over 15-30 minutes on day 1, daunorubicin
      hydrochloride IV on days 1-3, vincristine sulfate IV on days 1, 8, 15, and 22, dexamethasone
      PO twice daily (BID) on days 1-7 and 15-21, asparaginase subcutaneously (SC) on days 5, 8,
      11, 15, 18, and 22, and filgrastim SC on days 4-11. Patients who are Ph+ also receive
      imatinib mesylate PO on days 15-28.

      *Note: Patients who are = 60 years old do not receive cyclophosphamide.

      COURSE 2 (module B): Patients receive methotrexate intrathecally (IT) on day 1, cytarabine IV
      over 3 hours on days 1-3, dexamethasone as eye drops QID on days 1-4,
      trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole PO BID 3 times weekly on days 1-29, and cyclophosphamide,
      asparaginase and filgrastim as in course 1. Patients who are Ph+ also receive imatinib
      mesylate PO on days 1-28.

      COURSE 3 (module C): Patients receive vincristine sulfate IV on days 1, 15, and 29,
      methotrexate IV over 3 hours and IT on days 1, 15, and 19, methotrexate PO every 6 hours on
      days 1-2, 15-16, and 29-30, mercaptopurine PO on days 1-35, leucovorin calcium IV on days 2,
      16, and 30, leucovorin calcium PO every 6 hours on days 3-4, and
      trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole PO BID 3 times weekly on days 1-43. Patients who are Ph+ also
      receive imatinib mesylate PO on days 1-42.

      COURSE 4 (module D): Patients receive alemtuzumab SC 3 times weekly for 4 weeks and begin
      acyclovir PO QID for 6 months (continuing through course 8).

        -  Phase I Cohort 1: 10 mg

        -  Phase I Cohort 2: 20 mg

        -  Phase I Cohort 3/Phase II MTD: 30 mg

      COURSE 5 (module A): Patients repeat course 1, minus allopurinol.

      COURSE 6 (module B): Patients repeat course 2.

      COURSE 7 (module C): Patients repeat course 3.

      COURSE 8: Patients receive mercaptopurine PO, vincristine sulfate IV on day 1, dexamethasone
      PO on days 1-5, methotrexate PO on days 1, 8, 15, and 22, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole
      PO BID 3 days weekly. Patients who are Ph+ also receive imatinib mesylate PO on days 1-28.
      Courses repeat every 28 days for up to 24 months in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 10 years.
