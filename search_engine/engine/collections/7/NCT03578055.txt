      cholecystitis occurs. BDD and UDCA drugs are known to be effective in preserving liver
      function. The use of BDD and UDCA drugs in patients with cholecystitis is expected to inhibit
      elevated liver enzyme levels and to maintain liver function. The aim of this study is to
      analyze the effects of BDD and UDCA medication on postoperative changes in hepatic enzyme
      levels and quality of life in patients LFT elevated cholecystitis.
