      anesthesia and postoperative analgesia during breast surgery. For patients receiving a PVB
      alone or in combination with general anesthesia significant lower resting, evoked and worst
      pain scores compared with other analgesic treatment strategies indicating that a PVB provides
      improved postoperative pain control in patients undergoing breast surgery. Furthermore, there
      might be a reduced need for postoperative opioid requirements and consecutively a decrease in
      opioid-induced adverse effects in patients receiving a PVB. Anyways there are always fear of
      pleural injury and pneumothorax in addition to epidural and intrathecal spread of the block.
      A novel newly introduced field block has been described recently to block the hemithorax
      under ultrasound guidance that is the Serratus Anterior Muscle Plane SAM block. Still this
      technique to the investigators knowledge is not tried in randomized clinical studies. The aim
      of this study is to find out that this new technique is comparable to PVB in patients
      undergoing breast surgeries with or without axillary node dissection.
