      Mexican-Americans in the United States. South Lawndale, a predominately-Mexican neighborhood
      of Chicago, has a disproportionately high diabetes related mortality rate in comparison to
      the rest of Chicago and the U.S. Many church-based interventions have shown promise improving
      health outcomes among minority populations; but data on church-based interventions for Latino
      populations is scarce. Mobilizing community resources to develop church-based, diabetes
      self-management interventions may lead to sustainable, culturally tailored interventions, and
      improve outcomes in Latinos with diabetes. Considering the growth of the Hispanic population
      and their disproportionate burden of chronic diseases, developing programming aimed at
      decreasing the health disparities in this population is crucial. Our study proposes to fill
      this gap.
