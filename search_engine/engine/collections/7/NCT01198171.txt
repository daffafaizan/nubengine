      I. To identify racial categorization as the proportion of genetic background of
      African-American or European-American women with endometrioid endometrial cancer (EEC).

      II. To evaluate the association of racial genetic admixture with clinicopathologic variables
      and outcomes.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the concordance between racial genetic admixture and self-designated race
      categorization.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified by race (African-American vs
      European-American) and disease stage (I vs II vs III vs IV).

      DNA from archived frozen normal tissue samples is genotyped for the ancestry informative
      markers. Clinicopathological and demographic characteristics associated with each sample are
      also collected.
