    
      Standardized anesthesia and perioperative care will be provided to all patiens with
      positioning for neurosurgical or spinal procedures, where the head is elevated, extended.
      flected or rotated. In group A before the start of general anesthesia, the baseline level of
      cerebral tissue oxygenation (rScO2) will be measured using the near-infrared spectroscopy
      NIRS (Invivo Medtronic) . Continuous measurement of rScO2 will be used for detection of
      cerebral tissue desaturation. Each desaturation episode will be managed according to a
      standardized protocol - correction of extreme head position will be followed by
      optimalisation of mean arterial pressure (MAP), arterial hemoglobin oxygen saturation, end
      tidal carbon dioxide concentration and a level of hemoglobine concentration. In group B
      neither measurement of rScO2 nor interventions are provided. Cognitive dysfunction will be
      assessed by Adenbrooke test before operation and on the fifth postoperative day.
