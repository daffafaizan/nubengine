    
      The primary objective is:

      - To evaluate the effect of luspatercept in non-transfusion dependent β-thalassemia-patient
      versus placebo on anemia, as measured by mean hemoglobin concentration in the absence of
      transfusions over a continuous 12-week interval, from Week 13 to Week 24, compared to
      baseline.

      The secondary objectives are:

        -  To evaluate the effect of luspatercept versus placebo on β-thalassemia related symptoms,
           as measured by non transfusion dependent β-thalassemia-patient reported outcome
           (NTDT-PRO) over a continuous 12-week intervals (from Weeks 13 to 24 and from Weeks 37 to
           48) compared to baseline.

        -  To evaluate the effect of luspatercept versus placebo on functional and health-related
           quality of life (QoL) as measured by Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form (SF-36)
           and Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F) questionnaires

        -  To evaluate the long-term effect of luspatercept versus placebo on anemia, as measured
           by mean hemoglobin concentration in the absence of transfusions over a continuous
           12-week interval from Week 37 to Week 48, compared to baseline

        -  To evaluate the effect of luspatercept versus placebo on iron overload, as measured by
           liver iron concentration (LIC) and iron chelation therapy (ICT) daily dose

        -  To evaluate the effect of luspatercept versus placebo on iron overload, as measured by
           serum ferritin

        -  To evaluate the duration of erythroid response

        -  To evaluate the effect of luspatercept versus placebo on physical activity measured by
           6-minute walk test (6MWT)

      Safety and Pharmacokinetics (PK) Objectives

        -  To evaluate safety and tolerability of luspatercept, including immunogenicity

        -  To evaluate population pharmacokinetics (PK) of luspatercept in subjects with β-
           thalassemia

      The exploratory objectives are:

        -  To evaluate the effect of luspatercept versus placebo on measures of extra-medullary
           hematopoietic (EMH) masses, bone mineral density, splenomegaly, pulmonary hypertension,
           and leg ulcers, when present

        -  To evaluate the effect of luspatercept versus placebo on the β-thalassemia severity as
           measured by the NTDT severity score system

        -  To examine the relationship of baseline and change in serum Growth Differentiation
           Factor 11 (GDF11) and other related biomarkers with response to treatment with
           luspatercept

        -  To examine the effect of luspatercept on fetal hemoglobin (HbF)

        -  To examine the effect of luspatercept on Health Resource Utilization (HRU)
