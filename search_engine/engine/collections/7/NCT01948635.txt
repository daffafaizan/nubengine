      respiratory tract of intubated critically ill patients. Tracheobronchial colonization might
      progress to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) when the quantity and virulence of bacteria
      are high and when local and general host defenses are weak.

      Recent in vitro and animal studies suggest that tapered-cuff tracheal tubes could be
      associated with reduced microaspiration of contaminated secretions and might be helpful in
      preventing VAP.
