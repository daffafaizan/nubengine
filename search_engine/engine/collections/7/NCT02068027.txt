      group study of Clonidine Gel in the treatment of pain associated with PDN. Subjects were
      randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive 1 of 2 treatments applied topically TID to both
      feet for 85 days: Clonidine Gel (3.9 mg of clonidine HCl total daily dose), or Placebo Gel
      (vehicle without clonidine). Approximately 140 adult subjects with symmetrical distal PDN
      were expected to be randomized into the study. However, a pre-planned fully blinded interim
      analysis was performed when 70 subjects had completed the study for the purpose of re
      estimating sample size. Following the recommendation of the independent, third party
      statistician who conducted the interim analysis, the sample size was adjusted to allow
      approximately 260 subjects to be randomized into the study.

      The study included 5 phases: Screening Phase (up to 21 days duration), Baseline Phase (Day 14
      to Day 8), Placebo Lead in Phase (Day -7 to Day 1), Double blind Treatment Phase (85 days),
      and a Post-treatment Follow up Phase (7 days, only for subjects not enrolling in the open
      label long term safety study, CLO 311).
