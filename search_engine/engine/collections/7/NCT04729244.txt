      of CBD on the management of chronic pain, anxiety and insomnia.

      Subjects will be pre-screened from new and existing patients as well as from referral sites
      for the diagnosis of chronic pain. Potential subjects will be screened for pain >3 months who
      are using oral analgesic including narcotics and or physical therapy to reduce pain.

      Those meeting all inclusion and exclusion criteria will receive a comprehensive history and
      physical exam and undergo informed consented at the Screening Visit. Baseline survey data
      will be collected including various pain rating surveys. The patient's will be monitored for
      compliance to complete the weekly rating using a research phone application.

      Subjects will receive either CBD tincture or CBD topical cream.This will be dosed daily for a
      total of 4 weeks. Patients will be evaluated on three pain rating scales: On initial
      evaluation and 4th week evaluation, patients will be asked to fill out The Brief Pain
      Inventory and Pain Disability Index. Once weekly, a Numeric Rating Scale.

      On initial evaluation and at 4th week evaluation, narcotic dosing will be reviewed and
      recorded. Quality of sleep and anxiety scale will also be recorded for the four weeks using
      the Hamilton Anxiety scale and Sleep Quality Assessment at the start and end of the 4 weeks.
      At initiation and conclusion of study blood work to evaluated levels of CBD in each patient.
