      the functional organization of memory and attention in humans, using functional neuroimaging
      techniques. The study of human cognition with functional brain imaging in conjunction with
      pharmacologic probes that alter cognitive processes provides an opportunity to examine
      another dimension of the organization of human neural systems. In addition to identifying the
      anatomical structures that participate in specific cognitive functions, this approach can
      reveal how different neuromodulators can influence processing in those structures.
      Additionally, the combined use of functional brain imaging and pharmacological manipulation
      can be used to evaluate the role of neurotransmitter dysfunction in disease states that
      produce cognitive impairment and may direct us to potential therapeutic approaches.
