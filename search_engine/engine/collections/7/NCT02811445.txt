      increased disability, hospitalization, morbidity and mortality. Because older adults are the
      fastest growing global subpopulation, identification of mechanisms that underlie the
      maintenance of lean mass and physical function will be important for addressing the public
      health priority of healthy aging.

      Gut bacteria may be involved in mechanisms that underlie the maintenance of lean mass and
      physical function. In support of this hypothesis, in multiple publications the investigators
      recently reported significant associations between circulating gut bacteria-related
      metabolites with these outcomes in older adults. Accordingly, the overarching study
      hypothesis is that is gut bacteria are associated with, and are causatively involved in
      mechanisms that underlie the maintenance of lean mass and physical function in older adults.
      To test this hypothesis, the investigators propose to: characterize the association between
      fecal bacteria with lean mass and physical function (AIM 1), test the causative role of gut
      bacteria on the maintenance of lean mass and physical function by colonizing germ-free mice
      with fecal bacteria from older adults (AIM 2), and examine potential mechanisms that link gut
      bacteria with these outcomes by identifying associations between gut bacteria and serum
      metabolites with lean mass and physical function (AIM 3).
