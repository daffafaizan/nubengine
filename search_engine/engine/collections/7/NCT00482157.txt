      (DN101, 45 micrograms once weekly) or placebo. Baseline laboratory assays, including serum
      PSA, serum and urine calcium and creatinine, will be performed and the EPIC questionnaire
      (expanded prostate cancer index composite, validated HRQOL tool for prostate cancer patients)
      will be completed. Patients will also undergo prostate needle biopsy [4 cores taken under
      transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) guidance] to establish baseline levels of gene expression.
      Follow-up at the end of 2 weeks (just prior to the third dose) will include a history and
      physical, and a repeat of all baseline blood and urine tests. Follow-up at 3 months will
      include a history and physical, repeating all blood and urine tests, and the EPIC
      questionnaire. At 6 months, in addition to the history and physical, blood and urine tests,
      and the EPIC questionnaire, a TRUS-guided prostate needle biopsy will be performed. This will
      be a standard 12-core scheme and 4 of these cores will be used for laboratory analysis. Renal
      ultrasounds will again be performed on men in the calcitriol arms to look for stones.
      Patients who show no evidence of clinical progression will be offered to remain on study, in
      their designated treatment arm, for an additional 6 months. Any patient exhibiting clinical
      progression at any time will be withdrawn from the study and offered standard treatment
      options. For patients remaining on study at 12 months, an end-of-study biopsy will be
      requested (12-core scheme with 4 cores used for laboratory analysis)
