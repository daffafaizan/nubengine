      cells are increased, blocking normal blood cells production) no standard therapy exits.
      Response rates are similar for different chemotherapy treatments. Allogenic stem cell
      transplant remains the only curative option

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of combined chemotherapy treatment (CLAG
      regimen) with Imatinib Mesylate (Gleevec). The CLAG regimen is a combination of the
      chemotherapy drugs cladribine and cytarabine, as well as, neupogen which increases the white
      blood counts.

      Imatinib Mesylate is believed to work by interfering with the abnormal protein by blocking it
      from telling the body to keep making more and more abnormal white blood cells. Imatinib
      Mesylate is approved by the FDA for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and some
      types of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Its use in combination with CLAG regimen is
      considered experimental for the treatment of Acute Myeloid Leukemia / CML blast crisis

      The goal of the study is to find out what effects (good and bad) Imatinib Mesylate
      (Gleevec)combined with chemotherapy (CLAG regimen) on acute myeloid leukemia.
