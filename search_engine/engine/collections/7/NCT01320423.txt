      craniotomy to evacuate the haematoma with initial conservative treatment, following
      spontaneous superficial intracerebral haemorrhage affecting the lobar region only. Only
      patients for whom the treating neurosurgeon is in equipoise about the benefits of early
      craniotomy compared to initial conservative treatment are eligible for the trial. Outcome is
      measured at six months via a postal questionnaire including the Glasgow Outcome scale,
      Modified Rankin Scale, EuroQol and Barthel. Six hundred patients will be recruited to the
      trial over thirty months. Follow-up will take six months with analysis and reporting taking
      one year.
