      by an Ophthalmologist to include visual acuity, fundus photography, fluorescein angiography
      and optical coherence tomography prior to treatment.

      Participants will receive radiation using protons for 2 consecutive days. Each treatment will
      take 30 minutes. They will receive a total dose of 24 cobalt gray equivalent (CGE) in 2
      treatments. A total of 10 participants will be enrolled on this study.

      A comprehensive eye exam by an Ophthalmologist will be performed 30 days after radiation
      treatment with protons. Additionally, a physical examination per a Radiation Oncologist
      including a toxicity evaluation and comprehensive eye exam by an Ophthalmologist will be
      performed every 3 months for 1 year following radiation treatment.
