    
      This is a Phase 3, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-arm,
      single-dose study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Mentor Purified Toxin for the
      treatment of glabellar rhytides. Approximately 400 subjects will be enrolled in the study.
      The subjects will be randomized 3:1 (300 Mentor Purified Toxin: 100 placebo) to receive
      either intramuscular injections of 30 U of Mentor Purified Toxin or placebo
      (preservative-free saline).

      Injected subjects will be observed for 180 days of post treatment follow-up. Follow-up clinic
      visits are scheduled for post treatment days 3, 7, 14, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180.

      The study will be conducted at up to ten clinical sites. Safety, tolerability, clinical
      efficacy, onset and duration of effect will be studied during the study

      The effectiveness of Mentor Purified Toxin will be determined by the degree of frown line
      reduction, during maximum forced frown and at rest (neutral expression):

        -  as assessed live by the study doctor,

        -  as assessed live by the subject, and

        -  as assessed by an independent reviewer based on subject photographs

      Frown lines are graded on level of severity based on this scale:

      Severity

        -  Minimal (0)

        -  Mild (1)

        -  Moderate (2)

        -  Severe (3)
