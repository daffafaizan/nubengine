    
      This study is a double-blind (neither the researchers nor the participants know what
      treatment the participant is receiving), randomized (study drug assigned by chance),
      placebo-controlled (an inactive substance; a pretend treatment [with no drug in it] that is
      compared in a clinical trial with a drug to test if the drug has a real effect), sequential
      cohort exploratory study to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of JNJ-26113100 in the
      treatment of adult AD that is moderate in severity, including its effect on inflammatory
      biomarkers (biological molecule found in blood, other body fluids, or tissues that is a sign
      of a normal or abnormal process, or of a condition or disease). Participants will be
      sequentially assigned to 50 milligram (mg) once daily, 100 mg once daily, 100 mg twice daily
      or 250 mg twice daily cohort and randomly assigned to receive JNJ-26113100 or matching
      placebo.

      The total duration of the study will be approximately 8 weeks. Participants will be asked to
      follow-up at the end of Week 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. A study termination visit (Day 57) will be
      conducted at the end of Week 8. Skin biopsies from atopic dermatitis lesions will be
      collected during the study to assess changes in the inflammatory disease state. Participants
      developing flares of their disease may be treated with triamcinolone acetonide 0.1 percent
      ointment twice daily for up to 7 days. Efficacy will be assessed using Investigator's Global
      Assessment (IGA), Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) and Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Blood
      and urine samples will be collected for standard safety laboratory tests, to measure the
      level of drug and effect of the drug on inflammatory biomarkers. Participant's safety will be
      monitored throughout the study.
