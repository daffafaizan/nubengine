    
      The study is a phase II, randomized, open-label, parallel, 4 active treatment arms study to
      evaluate the safety, tolerability and PK/PD profile of MOD-4023 in pre-treated, normalized,
      GHD adults.

      The study is conducted in 2 stages. Stage I is a 4-week treatment period with 4 different
      dose levels/dosing regimens.

      Stage II is a 16-week treatment-extension period in which all the patients will start with
      the same dose (derived from stage I) and will be dose titrated to maintain IGF-1 levels
      within the normal range.
