      Asian participants with advanced nonhematological malignancies for whom standard anticancer
      treatment is not available or is no longer effective. This study will assess the safety,
      tolerability, PK and will determine the RP2Ds of TAK-228.

      The study will enroll approximately 46 participants, including at least 6 Japanese
      participants at RP2D dose level. Participants will be assigned to one of the following
      treatment arms:

        -  TAK-228 Once Daily

        -  TAK-228 Once Weekly

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in South Korea, Taiwan, and Japan. The overall time
      to participate in this study is up to 12 months, unless in the opinion of the investigator
      and sponsor the participant would derive benefit from continued therapy beyond 12 months.
      Participants will be followed for 30 days after last dose of study drug for a follow-up
      assessment.
