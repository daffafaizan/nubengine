      and feet lacerations in the pediatric population (2-17 yrs). Our hypothesis is that there is
      no statistical difference in cosmetic outcomes between suture repair and non-repair of these
      injuries. This study has been performed in the adult population, but has not yet been done in
      children. The researchers would like to be the first to show that conservative repair can be
      done in our pediatric population. The suture group will have their injuries repaired with
      non-absorbable sutures (nylon) which remain the gold standard in cosmetic repair of hands and
      feet. The conservative group will have identical cleaning and preparation of the wound, but
      the laceration will be covered with antibiotic ointment and sterile gauze without repair.
      Secondary outcome measure include patient satisfaction, infection rates, pain during repair,
      time of initial ED visit stay, and cost of supplies used in repair. Our patients will return
      in 10 -14 days for follow up and in 4 months for evaluation of the wound and for digital
      pictures to be taken of the wound. Wounds and scars will be evaluated at both 10 -14 days and
      4 months by both the researchers and the parents or care givers. A satisfaction survey will
      be administered to the parent or guardian. At 3-4 months, digital photographs of the healing
      lacerations will be graded for appearance by clinicians blinded to the repair method. The
      initial visit will be billed to their insurance and the follow-up visits will be free.
