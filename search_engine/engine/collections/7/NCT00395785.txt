      complications following carotid endarterectomy (a surgical procedure that removes blockages
      in the carotid artery). Recently, these patients have been treated effectively with the
      implantation of a carotid stent (a metallic mesh tube). When implanting the carotid stent,
      physicians use devices called embolic protection devices to prevent particles from the
      blockage from flowing up to the brain. The TriActiv® ProGuard™ System is an embolic
      protection device that uses a small balloon to temporarily stop blood flow within the
      diseased carotid artery while the stent is implanted. Then, the TriActiv® ProGuard™ System
      removes any particles that may have been released from the blockage during stent implantation
      before blood flow is restored. This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of the
      TriActiv® ProGuard™ System during carotid stent placement in patients who are considered to
      be at a high risk for complications from surgical endarterectomy.
