      support -. The Impella 2.5 is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and is being
      tested to see if it helps keep the patient's blood pressure stable during the cardiac
      ablation procedure. The Impella 2.5 Circulatory Support System works by placing a small pump
      into the left pumping chamber of the heart which will then help the heart circulate blood
      throughout the body. The Impella 2.5 Circulatory Support system will be removed once the
      heart no longer needs help with the pumping action which can be at any time from just after
      the completion of the heart procedure up to several days post procedure as determined by
      physician.
