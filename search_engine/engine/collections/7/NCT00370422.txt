      for diabetic macular edema is laser therapy, which may be neither effective nor curative in
      some patients. Corticosteroids may have a beneficial effect on diabetic macular edema. Other
      newly introduced medications for macular edematous lesions are anti-VEGF vascular endothelial
      growth factor)drugs. In this randomized, sham-controlled, multicenter, three-arm clinical
      trial,we try to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravitreal bevacizumab alone and in
      combination with intravitreal triamcinolone in the treatment of refractory diabetic macular
      edema.
