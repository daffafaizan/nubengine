      sulfoximine (BSO) and melphalan (L-PAM) in pediatric patients with progressive neuroblastoma.
      II. Determine the pharmacokinetics of BSO/L-PAM in pediatric patients. III. Assess the
      ability of BSO to deplete glutathione by at least 90% in tumor metastatic to bone marrow, in
      normal marrow, and in peripheral blood lymphocytes. IV. Estimate the response rate in these
      patients treated with BSO/L-PAM within the confines of a pilot study.

      OUTLINE: The following acronyms are used: BSO Buthionine sulfoximine, NSC-326231 L-PAM
      Melphalan, NSC-8806 G-CSF Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor, NSC-614629 Single-Agent
      Chemotherapy with Drug Resistance Inhibition. L-PAM/BSO.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: At least 18 patients will be entered to provide an adequate number of
      patients with marrow involvement; if the BSO dose is increased to achieve adequate GSH
      depletion in the marrow, an additional 12 patients will be entered. If less than 50% of
      patients have tumor metastatic to marrow at entry, there will be a proportional increase in
      the total number of patients required.
