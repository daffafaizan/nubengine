      drug and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational drug to use for
      further studies. "Investigational" means that the drug is being studied.

      As part of this research study, the participant will receive Volasertib in combination with
      two other chemotherapy drugs, Idarubicin and Cytarabine. The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug
      Administration) has not approved volasertib as a treatment for any disease.

      Idarubicin and Cytarabine are chemotherapy agents that are commonly used to treat individuals
      diagnosed with AML. Volasertib inhibits proteins called "polo-like kinases," which are
      necessary for cell division. Volasertib binds to these proteins and this inhibits the growth
      of cancer cells. Volasertib has been used in laboratory studies and those studies suggest
      that volasertib may slow down the growth of Cancer. In a previous clinical trial in patients
      with the participant type of leukemia where Volasertib was given along with low doses of
      Cytarabine, this drug was found to have some clinical activity against AML. In this study,
      researchers would like to combine Volasertib with standard chemotherapy (Cytarabine and
      Idarubicin) in order to see if it can be given safely with chemotherapy in individuals with
      AML.

      The primary purpose of this research study is to determine the highest dose that Volasertib
      can be given with Idarubicin and Cytarabine without severe or unmanageable side effects. The
      dose identified in this study will be used in future research studies.
