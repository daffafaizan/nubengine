    
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 2 study of
      maintenance Vigil Ovarian (gemogenovatucel-T) engineered autologous tumor cells (EATC) in
      women with Stage IIIb, IIIc or IV high-grade papillary serous/ clear cell / endometrioid
      ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer. Subjects will have had a minimum of 4
      and a maximum of 12 doses of Vigil prepared and stored from ovarian tumor cells obtained at
      the time of primary surgical debulking or initial diagnostic / evaluative laparoscopy (tissue
      for immunotherapy manufacture must be procured prior to initiation of neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy). An equal number of placebo doses will be manufactured. Subjects will have
      achieved a clinically defined complete response following primary surgery and adjuvant
      chemotherapy.

      Investigational treatment must start no less than 3 weeks and no more than 8 weeks following
      completion of chemotherapy.

      Approximately 86 subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive either monthly intradermal Vigil
      or placebo for at least 4 to a maximum of 12 administrations. Randomization will be
      stratified by (i) extent of surgical cytoreduction (complete/microscopic versus macroscopic
      residual disease) and (ii) neoadjuvant versus adjuvant chemotherapy. The objective is
      determining RFS of subjects randomized to Vigil versus placebo.
