    
      Aim 1: Compare the effectiveness of breast cancer screening using digital mammography alone
      versus digital mammography plus supplemental screening (digital breast tomosynthesis or MRI)
      by extent of breast density.

      Sub aim 1: Evaluate whether the performance of tomosynthesis improves with years of
      experience, and whether any "learning curve" depends on radiologist specialty (i.e., breast
      imaging specialist vs. general radiologist).

      Aim 2: Compare the effectiveness of preoperative MRI versus no MRI by extent of breast
      density among women with an initial, pathologically confirmed diagnosis of DCIS or invasive
      breast cancer.

      Covid-19 Enhancement Aim and Hypotheses:

      Develop patient-focused messaging content through focus groups that radiology facilities can
      use when scheduling appointments to inform women of the safety to schedule or postpone breast
      screening or diagnostic services.
