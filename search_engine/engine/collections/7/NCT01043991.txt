      Study design: Open-label, placebo-controlled, single-blinded. Patient in treatment group will
      receive intracoronary single bolus of EPO (150 µg), as soon as significant reperfusion is
      obtained (as measured by TIMI flow 2 or 3). In control group, placebo will be used. Placebo
      must be presented exactly the same as the drug.

      Length of Treatment: One shot during reperfusion procedure.

      Follow-up Period: 72nd hour post-admission for plasma kinetics of cardiac enzymes 5th to 7th
      day after revascularization procedure for MRI measurements, and echocardiography3th month
      post-MI MRI, echocardiography3th month: phone contact.

      Sample Size: 27 patients in each arm, 54 patients total.
