      (COPE-P) in Black and Hispanic women experiencing emotional distress in two sites (New York
      and Ohio) to determine if the intervention leads to better health behaviors, better
      psychosocial health (anxiety, stress, and depressive symptoms), and improved birth and
      post-natal outcomes in women experiencing emotional distress. Developing scalable prenatal
      interventions designed to improve birth outcomes as well as maternal physical and
      psychosocial health is essential to decrease health disparities in pregnant minority women.
