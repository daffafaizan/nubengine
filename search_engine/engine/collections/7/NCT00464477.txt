      strong genetic basis, no clear etiology has been identified to date. Recently, two studies
      have demonstrated an increased risk of autism in children born to fathers over the age of 40.
      However, given the large male-to-female predominance of autism, it is likely that new
      mutations on the X chromosome account for a significant number of affected cases. Due to the
      maternal origin of the X chromosome in males, we hypothesize that advanced
      maternal-grandpaternal age may also be a risk factor for autism. Precedence for this theory
      exists with other X-linked disorders such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy and Rett syndrome.
      Additionally, it has been demonstrated that maternal psychiatric illness, but not paternal
      psychiatric illness, is more prevalent among parents of children with autism. Using anonymous
      surveys of families with autistic children, we seek to identify the ages of grandparents at
      the time the parents were born in order to determine if advanced maternal-grandpaternal age
      is associated with an increased risk for autism when adjusted for advanced maternal and
      paternal age. Additionally, we will seek out sister-pairs in order to identify any
      statistical significance between the ages of the maternal grandfather at delivery of each
      sister. If advanced maternal-grandpaternal age is, in fact, a risk factor, it would help
      direct molecular researchers towards genes on the X chromosome as potential etiologies for
      autism. Also, further study of potential mutagenic exposures in the environment of
      grandparents may help elucidate the reason for the increasing incidence of autism in recent
      decades.
