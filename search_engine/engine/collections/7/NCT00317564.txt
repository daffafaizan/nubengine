      patient. An HCP who contacts the Registry may request an authorization for release of medical
      information packet or have the eligible patient contact the Registry directly. Once an
      eligible subject provides consent and permission to obtain information from her HCP, the
      Registry will contact the obstetric HCP and obtain information on demographics, history of
      previous pregnancies, maternal risk factors, pregnancy outcome, and neonatal health. Data
      will be collected from the maternal HCP at enrollment, during the second trimester (around
      week 20), and at outcome. Data on live born infants will be collected from the pediatrician
      at 4 months of age. If a birth defect is reported, targeted follow-up may be conducted.
