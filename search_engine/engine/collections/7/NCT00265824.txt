      Primary

        -  Compare Progression-free survival during maintenance period ("Maintenance PFS")in
           patients with unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the duration of disease control and overall survival of patients treated with
           these regimens.

        -  Compare the tolerability of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Compare the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the occurrence of secondary surgery in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the chemotherapy-free intervals and response rates in patients treated with
           these regimens.

      INDUCTION THERAPY

      Bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1, combined with either:

        -  modified FOLFOX7 (IV : oxaliplatin, folinic acid, fluorouracil),

        -  XELOX2 (IV : oxaliplatin, oral capecitabine day 1 to 8),

        -  FOLFIRI (IV : irinotecan, folinic acid, fluorouracil).

      Treatment repeats every 2 weeks.

      RANDOMIZATION Patients with stable or responding disease then receive maintenance therapy
      with bevacizumab alone or bevacizumab+erlotinib

      MAINTENANCE THERAPY

        -  Arm A : bevacizumab alone : bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1

        -  Arm B : bevacizumab+erlotinib : bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1 and oral
           erlotinib once daily on days 1-21.

      In both arms, treatment with bevacizumab +/- erlotinib repeats every 3 weeks in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ACCRUAL: A total of 700 patients will be accrued for this study.
