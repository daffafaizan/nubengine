fibrin and thrombosis in the central nervous systemin children with particular reference tocongenital hydrocephaluswhile rare metabolic and degenerative diseases ofthe central nervous system in children are reportedat great length, the much commoner diseasesrelating to vascular incidents are rarely discussed.only those aspects of disease of the centralnervous system related to thrombosis and thedeposition of fibrin will be discussed here; diseasesrelated to general vasculitis and aneurysm areomitted.  the conditions discussed here fall into twomain categories: first, the presence of thrombosis insmall blood vessels or in the large superficial veinsdraining the brain, and second, the deposition offibrin either in the ventricles or on the membranesoverlying the brain in association with thromboticlesions, haemorrhage, or infiltration.
