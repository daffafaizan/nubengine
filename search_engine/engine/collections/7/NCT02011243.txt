    
      The secondary objectives of this study are :

      A- To estimate and compare the prevalence of Internal Rotation Deficit within groups

      B- To assess the association between the Internal Rotation Deficit and the appearance of a
      shoulder pain and/or discomfort when throwing

      C- To assess the association between Internal Rotation Deficit and the appearance of a
      shoulder pathology demonstrated by clinical examination by at least one abnormality in one of
      the following three tests: the arming apprehension test, the relocation test or the O'Brien
      test

      D- Assess changes in values of IRD 2, the ratio IRD 2/GRE 2, and the Total Range of Motion
      over the training season

      E- Evaluate the association between the values of IRD 2 and the appearance of shoulder pain
      or discomfort when throwing

      F- To evaluate the association between IRD 2 values and the appearance of a shoulder
      pathology (at least one anomaly in one of three tests: the arming apprehension test, the
      relocation test or the O'Brien test).

      G- To assess the association between values of the IRD 2/GRE 2 ratio and the appearance of
      shoulder pain or discomfort when throwing

      H- To assess the association between values of the IRD 2/GRE 2 ratio and the appearance of a
      shoulder pathology (at least one anomaly in one of three tests: the arming apprehension test,
      the relocation test or the O'Brien test).

      I- To estimate the optimal threshold value of the IRD 2/GRE 2 ratio that would define an
      Internal Rotation Deficit in a more relevant fashion as compred to the IRD 2 alone
