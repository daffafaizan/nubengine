      half-life of approximately 1 hour and the favourable toxicity profile of NGR-hTNF,
      characterized by transient constitutional symptoms occurring during the first day of
      administration, an additional cohort of 24 patients will be randomized and the 12 patients
      enrolled in arm A will receive the same dose of NGR-hTNF 0.8 mcg/m2 given as 60 minutes
      infusion every week. the weekly schedule of NGR-hTNF 0.8 mcg/m2 has previously been tested in
      several studies
