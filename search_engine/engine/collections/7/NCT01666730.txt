      I. To determine if metformin (metformin hydrochloride) when added to FOLFOX ( leucovorin
      calcium, fluorouracil, oxaliplatin) improves overall survival in patients with metastatic
      pancreatic cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess response rate (RR). II. To assess progression free survival (PFS). III. To
      assess toxicity in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer receiving FOLFOX and metformin.
      IV. To identify tumor/serum correlative markers.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive metformin hydrochloride orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-7
      for an introductory period before the addition of FOLFOX. After the introductory period,
      patients will continue metformin twice daily and FOLFOX therapy comprising leucovorin calcium
      intravenously (IV) over 120 minutes, fluorouracil IV continuously over 46 hours, and
      oxaliplatin IV over 120 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 14 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients
      are followed up for periodically.
