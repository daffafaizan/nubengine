      hospitals in Barcelona. Inclusion criteria will be equivalent sample size of patients with
      restrictive lung disease, neuromuscular pathology and hypoventilation-obesity.

      Digital diagnosis platform will be used to incorporate and unify signals of different medical
      devices: a pneumotachograph on branch ventilator that captures pressure and flow-time
      signals, inductance plethysmography used to like a patient effort sensor and portable pulse
      oximeter recordings. Nocturnal polygraphic or polysomnographic tracings performed and
      recorded on sites will be processed systematically by main asynchronies diagnosis algorithms
      between patient and ventilator. These algorithms providing global and fractionated
      asynchronies count based on time, leaks or saturation criteria which will be used to compared
      effective ventilation phases and phases with nocturnal desaturations. Therefore, prevalence
      and asynchronies model on home NIV can be determine establishing the correlation between
      desaturation phases and respiratory events and identifying minimum tolerable leak level to
      keep adequate ventilation.
