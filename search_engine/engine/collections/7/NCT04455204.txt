      pregnant women with Preeclampsia, and on healthy non-pregnant women. All participants will be
      recruited from the Outpatient Clinic of Obstetrics and Gynecology Department at Menoufia
      University Hospital (Shebin El-Kom, Egypt). The study will be approved by the Research Ethics
      Committee of Menoufia University and all the involved subjects will give their written
      informed consent.

      This study will involve a total number of 60 women who will be further classified into: 20
      non-pregnant women who serve as the control group (group 1), 20 pregnant women with normal
      pregnancy at their third trimesters (group 2) and 20 pregnant women with Preeclampsia at
      their third trimester (group 3) will be screened to fit the inclusion and exclusion criteria.
      The pregnant women will be assessed in their third trimesters and further re-evaluated 4
      weeks after delivery. The gestational ages will be determined conventionally and re-affirmed
      by ultrasonographic measurement.
