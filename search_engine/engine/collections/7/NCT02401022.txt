      two different doses of AZD8529 (1.5 and 40 mg) in smoking cessation. Up to 2 weeks will be
      allowed for the Screening Period, followed by a 1-week, single-blind run-in period. At the
      end of Study Week 1 (on Study Day 8), medication compliance will be one of the factors used
      in a predictive enrichment strategy.
