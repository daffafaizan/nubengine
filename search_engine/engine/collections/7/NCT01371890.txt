    
      Specific Aim #1 To determine in a crossover study of 15 maintenance hemodialysis patients
      with intradialytic hypertension whether standard dialysis with ultrafiltration (dialysate Na
      of 140), dialysis without ultrafiltration (dialysate Na of 140), or ultrafiltration alone (no
      dialysate) is associated with the an increase in systolic blood pressure during hemodialysis

      Specific Aim #2 To determine in a crossover study of 15 maintenance hemodialysis with
      intradialytic hypertension whether standard dialysis with ultrafiltration, dialysis without
      ultrafiltration, or ultrafiltration alone is associated with change in either endothelin-1 or
      nitric oxide during hemodialysis

      SUBSTUDY AIMS

      Specific Aim #1 To determine in a randomized 3-week, 2 period crossover study of 15
      maintenance hemodialysis patients with intradialytic hypertension whether high vs low
      dialysate-to-serum Na gradients impairs release of NO, increases ET-1 or causes an acute
      intradialytic increase in systolic BP,.

      Specific Aim #2 TO determine in a randomized 16-week, 2-period crossover study of 30
      hemodialysis patients with intradialytic hypertension the effects of 8 weeks of high
      dialysate-to-plasma Na gradients to 8-weeks of low Na gradients on EC function (FMD and ADMA)
      and 44 hour ambulatory BP.
