      treatment period) and Part B (the safety treatment period), whose objectives are as follows:

      Primary Part A: To evaluate the efficacy of Cannabidiol Oral Solution in treating refractory
      infantile spasms (IS).

      Secondary:

      Part A:

        -  To evaluate the safety of Cannabidiol Oral Solution in treating refractory infantile
           spasms.

      Part B:

        -  To assess the long-term safety of Cannabidiol Oral Solution as an adjunctive treatment
           for subjects with Infantile Spasms (IS)

        -  To establish the continued efficacy of Cannabidiol Oral Solution in maintaining seizure
           control in subjects with IS

        -  To assess the global status of subjects taking Cannabidiol Oral Solution for an extended
           period of time determined by various qualitative assessments

        -  To monitor for changes in plasma levels of Cannabidiol Oral Solution during long-term
           treatment of subjects with IS
