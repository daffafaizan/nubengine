    
      Objective: the aim of this study is to identify risk factors associated with the development
      of pyogenic liver abscesses (PLA) in adult liver recipients (ALR) and to describe the
      experience of the Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires (HIBA) in the diagnosis and therapeutic
      management of these patients.

      Background: adult liver recipients differ from the general population with PLA as they
      exhibit: reconstructed biliary anatomy, recurrent hospitalizations, regular performance
      status and are subjected to immunosuppression. However, the scientific evidence regarding PLA
      developed in transplanted organs is still scarce and the management of this disease continues
      to be based on experience in non-transplanted patients.

      Methods: between 1996 and 2016, 879 adult patients underwent liver transplantation (LT) at
      our institution. Patients who developed PLA after LT (cases) and controls are matched
      according to the time from transplant to abscess in a 1 to 5 relation. The investigators
      performed a logistic regression model to establish PLA risk factors considering clusters for
      matched cases and controls. Independent risk factors will be identified using multivariate
      regression analysis.
