      plays a role in the increased risk of family history is not known. In this prospective
      single-center study, we are recruiting children with and without a family history of
      premature atherosclerotic disease, defined as occurring < 55 years in males and <65 years in
      females. Children are recruited primarily from a pediatric preventive cardiology clinic at
      Children's Hospital Boston. We measure anthropomorphic characteristics, fasting lipid
      profiles and inflammatory marker levels, including high sensitivity C-reactive protein
      (hsCRP), intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), P-selectin, and tumor necrosis factor
      alpha receptor 2 (TNFÎ±R2).

      In this sample of high-risk overweight children, Lp(a) and inflammatory markers could reflect
      cardiovascular risk outside lipid profiles.
