      which increases their risk for negative long-term physical health complications. Consistent
      with the Institute of Medicine's (IOM) emphasis on patients transitioning from treatment to
      cancer survivorship and increasing long-term healthy behaviors in these survivors, we
      conducted a pilot RCT to address the increasing overweight/obesity rates among PCS by
      targeting their caregivers as agents for PCS behavior change. We focused on parents'
      behaviors, attitudes and roles in promoting healthier eating and physical activity (PA) in
      PCS and adapted an evidence-informed, manualized parent intervention - NOURISH - found to be
      effective for parents of overweight and obese children and adolescents in reducing child and
      adolescent BMI. We adapted NOURISH for caregivers of 5 - 13 year old PCS (6 months -4 years
      off active cancer treatment). Our pilot feasibility RCT - NOURISH-T (Nourishing Our
      Understanding of Role modeling to Improve Support for Healthy Transitions) evaluates: 1) the
      preliminary feasibility efficacy of NOURISH-T for PCS, compared with an Enhanced Usual Care
      (EUC) control condition, and 2) factors to consider to improve future adaptations of the
      intervention. The project enrolled caregivers of PCS at two pediatric oncology clinics into
      the 6-week intervention (or EUC) with assessments of both caregivers and PCS occurring pre-
      and post-6 weeks of intervention, and at a 4-month follow-up. In comparison to EUC, we
      hypothesized that caregivers and PCS assigned to the NOURISH-T condition would show greater
      improvements in dietary intake, physical activity, and in anthropometric health indicators
      over time.
