    
      Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is actually used in elderly
      patients with small renal tumors (diameter â‰¤ 4 cm) and presenting a high risk of surgery (due
      to co-morbidity) and/or reduced renal function. RFA is a minimally invasive technique,
      considered as an alternative to surgery to limit morbidity and to preserve kidney function.
      The technique is well known and has proven his efficacy for the treatment of small tumors.

      An enlargement of the indications of RFA to patient without contra-indication to surgery will
      depend on the efficacy of the technique.

      The main objective of the study is to evaluate the local efficacy of the ablation based on
      the technical success, and on the evaluation of local cancer recurrence over 5 years.
