      can experience symptoms of discomfort, blurry vision, redness, and pain. DED can also cause
      tears to become unstable which could result in damage to the front surface of the eye.

      There are two types of DED. The one the investigators are studying is called evaporative dry
      eye disease. This type of DED occurs because the pores on the eyelids are not functioning
      properly. In preliminary studies, a new treatment called Intense Pulsed Light (IPL) has shown
      promise to reduce signs and symptoms of evaporative DED. IPL is a non-invasive and non-laser
      light treatment that was approved in 1995 by the FDA for dermatology. It is commonly used for
      treatment of facial rosacea, acne, and hair, wrinkle and lesion removal. It is not currently
      approved for the treatment of dry eye disease. This treatment is thought to provide relief of
      evaporative DED symptoms and improve the expression of the pores on the edge of the eyelid.
