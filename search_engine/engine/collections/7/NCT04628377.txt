      revascularization of STEMI patients. Previous study presented that index of microcirculatory
      resistance (IMR) in culprit vessel of STEMI patients showed significant association with the
      risk of cardiac death or heart failure admission. Recent technical development enabled
      angiographic derivation of IMR without pressure wire, hyperemic agents, or theromdilution
      method. In this regard, the current study will evaluate prognostic implication of
      angiography-derived IMR in STEMI patients who were successfully revascularized.

      The study cohorts consist with 2 separate cohort: first, diagnostic accuracy cohort, which
      will evaluate diagnostic accuracy of angiography-derived IMR for invasive IMR. For this, 31
      patients with culprit vessel IMR measurement at the time of primary PCI will be evaluated.
      The patients cohort is the subgroup of previous registry (NCT02186093). Second, prognosis
      cohort, in which angiography-derived IMR will be measured in the culprit vessel after
      successful revascularization. Those patients have follow-up data after 10 years from index
      procedure. This cohort is STEMI subgroup derived from Institutional registry of Samsung
      Medical Center, whose results were previously published (JACC Cardiovascular Intervention.
      2019 Apr 8;12(7):607-620.) Among 490 STEMI patients from the overall study cohorts, 309
      patients with available angiograms and who were suitable for angiographic FFR and IMR
      measurement will be analyzed. Primary clinical outcome will be cardiac death at 10 years from
      index procedure. Secondary outcome will be any myocardial infarction, ischemia-driven
      revascularization, definite or probable stent thrombosis, congestive heart failure admission
      at 10 years from index procedure.
