      every 5 deaths in 2005. In 2009, approximately 1.3 million Americans will have a
      new/recurrent myocardial infarction. Coronary heart disease (CHD) includes myocardial
      infarction, stable or unstable angina, demonstrated myocardial ischemia detected by
      noninvasive testing, and a history of coronary artery procedures (such a stent or bypass).
      Currently, "statins" are recommended by the AHA to manage elevated low-density
      lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C). Unfortunately, the discontinuation of statins is quite
      substantial. For example, a large cohort study of older patients found that 2-year statin
      adherence rates were approximately 40% for acute coronary syndrome patients, 36% for chronic
      coronary artery disease, and 25% for primary prevention and is associated with increased
      mortality, hospitalizations, and costs. Recently, the kinesin 6 (KIF6) gene has been
      associated with a 30-55% increase in cardiovascular events in individuals carrying one or two
      risk variants (~57% of the white population) in multiple prospective studies. Furthermore,
      KIF6 carriers receiving a "statin" have a substantial greater cardiovascular risk reduction
      (-34 to 50%) when using a "statin" compared to those that are non-carriers using a statin (6
      to 20%). In this prospective, open label, trial, recruited subjects recently started on
      statin therapy will be provided information about their KIF6 carrier status and followed for
      6 months to determine their "statin" adherence. Additionally, quality of life and factors
      adherence will be measured at baseline and after 6 months. Finally, pharmacy records will be
      evaluated for up to 1-year to determine statin discontinuation rates.
