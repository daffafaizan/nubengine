      during pulmonary lobectomy in general and video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS). Using CT
      angiography and 3D reconstruction, the investigators sought to identify anatomic variations
      of the pulmonary arterial tree and assess their respective frequencies. Methods the
      investigators retrospectively studied 88 pulmonary arterial trees in 44 patients having
      undergone VATS lobectomy for lung cancer over an 18-month period in Amiens University
      Hospital's Department of Thoracic Surgery. Each CT angiography with 3D reconstruction of the
      pulmonary arterial tree was performed by two experienced operators, according to a
      standardized procedure.
