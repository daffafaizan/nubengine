      to treat depression in adults who have major depressive disorder (MDD). This study looked at
      MDD relief in people who took varying doses of vortioxetine.

      The study enrolled 600 patients. Participants were randomly assigned (by chance, like
      flipping a coin) to one of the four treatment groups-which remained undisclosed to the
      patient and study doctor during the study (unless there was an urgent medical need):

        -  Vortioxetine 5 mg

        -  Vortioxetine 10 mg

        -  Vortioxetine 20 mg

        -  Placebo (dummy inactive pill) - this was a capsule that looked like the study drug but
           had no active ingredient.

      All participants were asked to take one capsule at the same time each day throughout the
      study.

      This multi-center trial was conducted in 14 countries in Europe and Asia. The overall time to
      participate in this study was up to 13 weeks. Participants made weekly visits to the clinic
      during the first 2 weeks of the 8-week treatment period and then every 2 weeks up to the end
      of the 8-week treatment period. Participants who completed the 8-week treatment period
      entered a 2-week discontinuation period to assess potential discontinuation symptoms 1 and 2
      weeks after the end of the 8-week treatment period. A safety follow-up contact (visit or
      phone call) was made 4 weeks after completion of the 8-week double-blind treatment period (2
      weeks after the end of the 2-week discontinuation period).
