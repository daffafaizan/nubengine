    
      This is a Phase 1 single-center, open-label, non-randomized, dose-escalation study, to be
      conducted in 2 phases. The Dose Escalation Phase will determine the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) of Nerofe and evaluate its safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics,
      immunogenicity, and preliminary clinical effects. The subsequent Dose Confirmation Phase will
      be a cohort expansion at or below the MTD of Nerofe. Subjects will be treated with IV doses
      of Nerofe thrice weekly (on alternating days) in consecutive, 28-day cycles. Subjects will be
      evaluated regularly for safety. Subjects who tolerate the drug and who do not experience
      progressive disease, intolerable toxicity, or meet any of the other withdrawal criteria may
      continue to receive Nerofe for up to 6 cycles, at the discretion of the Principal
      Investigator. Throughout the trial, oversight will be provided by the Clinical Safety
      Committee.
