      enrolled into ART care in two urban communities participating in the HPTN 071 (PopART) trial.
      The two community models are: 1) adherence clubs, groups of 20-25 stable patients who receive
      ART care in the community every 3 months, and 2) home-based ART delivery in which a community
      health worker delivers ART care to an individual at home every 3 months. The standard of care
      is delivery of ART care at the local clinic.
