      situation that is out of proportion to the actual danger or threat. SP is the most prevalent
      anxiety disorder with substantial impairment and comorbidity. Animal fear is one of the most
      prevalent subtypes of SP. In vivo exposure is the treatment of choice for this problem, but
      this technique is associated to limitations in its implementation related to the access and
      acceptability (i.e., low acceptance on the part of patients and therapists, high dropout
      rates, limited access to the treatment and, difficulties in its application in the clinical
      context). Augmented Reality (AR) offers some advantages in delivering the exposure technique:
      1) Exposure to multiple virtual stimuli; 2) Going beyond reality; 3) Allowing complete
      control over the situation; 4) It allows privacy and confidentiality. Particularly, the most
      significant aspect of AR is that the virtual elements add relevant and helpful information to
      the physical information available in the real world.

      The study will follow the guidelines of a multiple-baseline single case design with
      alternating treatments. Participants (N = 4) who received a diagnosis of SP for cockroaches
      (DSM-5), will be randomly assigned to different baselines (ranging between 8 and 14 days) and
      all of them will receive the two experimental conditions: 1) AR exposure therapy with
      multiple stimuli and; 2) AR exposure therapy with a single stimulus. Five evaluation moments
      will be included: pre-intervention (baseline), post- intervention, and follow-up at the first
      month, 6 and 12 months.
