    
      A 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the effects of
      once-daily dapagliflozin 10 mg on heart failure disease-specific biomarkers (NTproBNP and
      BNP), symptoms, health status, and quality of life in patients with chronic heart failure
      with preserved systolic function. An imaging substudy will also be conducted to explore the
      effects of dapagliflozin vs. placebo on various echocardiographic parameters.
