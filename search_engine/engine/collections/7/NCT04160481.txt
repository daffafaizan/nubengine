      Data from animal studies suggest that certain polyphenols are extensively metabolized by the
      gut microbiota which may impact bioactivity including TMA/TMAO production. It was previously
      shown that a polyphenol-rich cranberry extract attenuated diet-induced metabolic syndrome in
      mice in a gut microbiota-dependent manner. In another mouse study the polyphenol resveratrol
      attenuated TMAO-induced atherosclerosis by decreasing TMAO levels and increasing hepatic bile
      acid neosynthesis via gut microbiota remodelling. However, human studies on polyphenol effect
      on TMAO levels and the gut microbiome are sparse. In a recent study TMAO serum levels were
      reduced in healthy subjects upon supplementation with a grape pomace polyphenolic extract.

      This clinical study will provide new insight into the effect of tomato extract on TMAO levels
      and the gut microbiota composition and thus potential new mechanisms responsible for the
      cardiovascular protective effects.
