      high-risk (HR) features (defined as: elevated Ki67 and/or blastoid cytology and/or TP53
      mutation after central pathology review) with Venetoclax (ABT-199), which has demonstrated
      relevant single agent activity in relapsed/refractory MCL in a Phase 1-2 trial.

      The updated Progression Free Survival curves of the R-BAC500 trial has shown that the
      expected 2-years PFS for patients with HR disease is 40% (H0), as compared to low-risk
      patients (LR) that have a 2-years PFS of 100%. The addition of Venetoclax to HR patients
      after R-BAC is expected to improve results and efficacy of this regimen in this "difficult
      -to- treat" population, that represents approximately 40-45 % of newly diagnosed elderly
      patients with MCL. It appears reasonable to treat with the experimental drug also LR patients
      that do not respond appropriately (less than CR) at the end of R-BAC. Since the number of
      such LR patients is hardly predictable based on the present experience with R-BAC500 trial,
      the analysis of this sub-cohort will be of exploratory nature, and thus assessed separately.

      The study objective is to evaluate whether the addition of venetoclax after R-BAC to HR
      patients improves the results of the standard R-BAC, in terms of Progression Free Survival .
