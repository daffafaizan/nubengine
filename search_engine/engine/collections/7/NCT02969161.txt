      Option B+ PMTCT services at ten facilities in Swaziland. These facilities were included in
      another study on Option B+ called Safe Generations in which routinely collected patient-level
      data was abstracted from medical registers. This study has three parts: the first is a review
      of alternative patient medical records among women and their infants who were documented as
      LTF in the Safe Generations study. The second component consists of tracing women who are LTF
      on the phone or in the community to administer a questionnaire. Lastly, an in-depth interview
      will be conducted among a sub-group of women to explore patterns of care.
