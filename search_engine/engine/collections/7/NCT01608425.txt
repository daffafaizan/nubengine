      approach to wound care can be used as an alternative to traditional attendance at a wound
      clinic and document whether this consultation form provides a greater patient-satisfaction
      and cost savings. The project will document that telemedicine is equivalent to conventional
      outpatient attendance from a therapeutic aspect in terms of number of hospitalizations,
      number of extra controls, acute interventions and wound healing.

      The project is also investigating the extent of time spent on the personnel side using
      telemedicine consultations compared with conventional outpatient appearances.
