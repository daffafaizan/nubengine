      (NASH) and recently, low-grade inflammation has been hypothesized to be the causative link.
      From animal studies, it is known that the compound resveratrol (RES) has strong
      anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects and perhaps the potential to neutralize
      obesity-induced diseases. RES is already widely used as a food supplement though the precise
      effects are unknown. This project focuses on the effect of RES on fatty liver disease. In a
      double-blind controlled clinical trial, the researchers investigate the effects of RES 500 mg
      or placebo treatment x 3 daily for 6 months on NAFLD/NASH in 48 obese patients in a
      double-blind, randomised, controlled clinical trial. The researchers hypothesize that RES
      improves the ALT levels and reduces liver fat and inflammation assessed by MR spectroscopy
      and histological evaluation.
