      women. For study 1, 17 participants randomly consumed 4 eucaloric diets containing
      standard-protein (SP; 76±1g protein/d) or high-protein (HP; 126±1g protein/d) for 7
      consecutive days/treatment. The SP treatments contained all plant proteins (PLANT) or a
      combination of beef and plant proteins (BEEF) that were evenly distributed throughout the day
      (EVEN). The HP treatments were also BEEF provided as EVEN or an uneven distribution (UNEVEN)
      pattern. For study 2, 17 participants randomly consumed 3 energy restriction (1250 kcal/d)
      diets containing SP-PLANT (EVEN) and SP-BEEF (EVEN) (both, 48±1g protein/d) or HP-BEEF (EVEN)
      (123±1g protein/d). During day 6 of each treatment (for both studies), the participants
      completed a 12-h controlled-feeding, clinical testing day which included repeated appetite,
      satiety, food cravings, and mood questionnaires; blood sampling; and cognitive
      function/performance testing. During day 7 of each treatment (for both studies), the
      participants completed a free-living, ad libitum testing day at home/work to assess ad
      libitum (voluntary) daily intake and food choice. Each of the 7-day dietary patterns occurred
      during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle; thus, there were 2-3 week washout periods
      between dietary treatments.
