      of the tumor, followed by radiotherapy (fractionated local field irradiation in daily
      fractions of 2 Gy given 5 days per week, Monday through Friday for 6 weeks, for a total of 60
      Gy) plus temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy (75 mg per square meter of body-surface area per
      day, 7 days per week from the first to the last day of radiotherapy). After a 4-week break,
      up to 6 cycles of maintenance TMZ (mTMZ) will be administered according to the standard 5-day
      (oral intake) schedule every 28 days. TMZ dose will be 150 mg per square meter for the first
      cycle and will be increased to 200 mg per square meter beginning with the second cycle, so
      long as there is no hematologic toxic effect. Immunotherapy will follow radiochemotherapy and
      will comprise 4 vaccinations every second week (injections I, II, III, IV), 2 further monthly
      vaccinations (injections V, VI) and a final vaccination (injection VII) 2 months after the
      sixth one. Injections I, V, VI and VII will contain 10 million tumor lysate-loaded DC, while
      the others will be of 5 million cells only. In correspondence to the third vaccine injection
      (week 13), mTMZ will start. On the basis of the patient clinical status, further vaccine
      boosts will be considered as appropriate addition at the standard vaccination cycle.
