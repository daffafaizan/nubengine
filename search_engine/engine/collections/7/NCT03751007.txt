    
      This Phase 1b/2a, multi-center study will be conducted in participants with clinical
      recent-onset Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1D).

      The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of different
      doses of AG019 alone as well as AG019 in association with teplizumab. The secondary
      objectives of this study are: to obtain pharmacodynamic (PD) data of AG019 alone as well as
      AG019 in association with teplizumab; and to determine the potential presence of AG019 in
      systemic circulation (safety - systemic exposure) and the presence of L. lactis bacteria in
      fecal excretion (local exposure): Pharmacokinetic (PK) profile.

      This study consists of 2 phases:

      Phase 1b: this open-label part of the study will investigate the safety and tolerability of 2
      different doses of AG019 in 2 age groups (18-40 years of age and 12-17 years of age).

      Phase 2a: this randomized, double-blind part of the study will investigate the safety and
      tolerability of AG019, in association with teplizumab, in 2 age groups (18-40 years of age
      and 12-17 years of age).
