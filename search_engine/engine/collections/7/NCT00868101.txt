      ischemic preconditioning) or control treatment. RIPC was induced by four 5-minutes cycles of
      lower limb ischemia and reperfusion using a blood pressure cuff. Measurements of troponin I,
      brain natriuretic peptide, interleukines 8 and 10, real time PCR to NFKB and clinical
      parameters were obtained and compared postoperatively (4, 12, 24 and 48 hous after).
