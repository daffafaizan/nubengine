      approach. Individual interviews will be held with bladder cancer and caregiver dyads who
      participated in the Stoma Bootcamp study. Interviews will explore the patient's and
      caregiver's experiences and perceptions of ostomy surgery prior to the Bootcamp and after the
      Bootcamp from a physical, psychological, social, and spiritual perspective. Semi-structured
      interview guides will be developed using Engel Biopsychosocial Model (BPS),5 one guide geared
      towards patients and the second toward caregivers.
