    
      PURPOSE: Women present to the Reproductive Endocrinology clinic with different concerns.
      These may involve conditions such as pelvic pain, endometriosis, Mullerian anomalies,
      polycystic ovary syndrome, abnormal uterine bleeding, menopausal symptoms, or infertility.
      Understanding the meaning of different biologic markers in their blood serum or tissues could
      help advancing the medical knowledge in the different conditions.

      RATIONALE: To understand the meaning of different biologic markers in the patients' blood
      serum or tissue samples.

      POPULATION: Patients identified among all women presenting to the reproductive endocrinology
      clinic.

      Patients may undergo endometrial biopsy or surgery to evaluate their condition. In these
      instances, the investigators will ask the patients whether a small portion of their
      specimen/s could be collected and banked for future research purposes.

      DESIGN: Prospective blood/tissue collection.

      PROCEDURES: A small portion of the patient's blood or tissue specimen collected at the time
      of a medically indicated blood draw or surgical procedure will be collected and banked for
      future research purposes. Sample collection will be performed on existing specimens, once the
      specimens have been obtained for medical indications. No additional procedures will be
      performed on the patients for research purposes only.

      OUTCOME MEASURES: Creation of a blood serum/tissue specimens bank for future clinical
      research studies.
