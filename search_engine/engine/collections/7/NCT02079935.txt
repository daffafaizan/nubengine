      included continuously by screening interviews. There will be a randomization into two
      treatment groups (cognitive behavior, or physical activity and nutrition education) to be
      followed for 16 weeks. Each week includes one meeting of group therapy (90 minutes) and
      homework related to treatment, and for 4 weeks midway there will be two therapy meetings pr
      week (a total of 20 meetings). Post tests are planned at week 17, and at 6, 12, and 24 months
      after treatment.

      Participants reqruited during ongoing treatment groups are placed on a waitlist, serving as
      controls to the treatment groups.
