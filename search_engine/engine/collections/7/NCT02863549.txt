      terms of success rate and short-term clinical follow-up at 30 days. In this context
      procedural success was defined as reduction of at least one TR grade. At 30-days after the
      procedure, a clinical follow up was performed in the heart failure outpatient clinic of our
      department including transthoracic echocardiography for the evaluation of TR grades.
      Furthermore, the investigators determined NYHA functional class and the incidence of major
      adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE).

      Secondary objectives were the assessment of right ventricular function, the 6-minute walk
      distance, NT-proBNP as well as quality of life as assessed by the Minnesota Living with Heart
      Failure Questionnaire (MLHFQ) score at 30-days follow up.
