      Coronavirus, are very similar to those observed during acute respiratory distress syndromes
      in adults. Macrophages present in the pulmonary parenchyma appear to play a central role in
      the severity of the inflammatory response and the production of proinflammatory mediators,
      notably chemokines leading to secondary leukocyte infiltration. The recent monocytic origin
      could explain the particular severity of this inflammatory response whose usual control is no
      longer assured. The alteration of infectious control by alveolar macrophages during ageing
      also tends to confirm the central role of these cells in the pattern of respiratory distress
      observed during COVID-19 infection, which is particularly severe in the elderly.

      In many situations, the endotoxin (or lipopolysaccharide, LPS) plays a major role in the
      pathophysiology and even the severity of respiratory damage, in particular, due to the
      existence of circulating endotoxin from the pathogenic agent responsible (Gram-negative
      bacteria), but also due to translocation of digestive origin in the context of sepsis
      (systemic inflammatory response) which is associated with (if not responsible for)
      respiratory aggression. Such an alteration of the mucous membrane is particularly noticeable
      in cases of obesity. The importance of this mechanism during pulmonary aggression of viral
      origin is, on the other hand, unknown.

      Few data are available on the prediction of early onset of respiratory distress syndrome in
      low respiratory infection in the absence of mechanical ventilation.
