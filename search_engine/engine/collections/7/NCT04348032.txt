      patients over the age of 18 years with platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian cancer. patients
      who meet the criteria for enrollment are randomly divided into two groups, including
      experiment group and control group. This study will be divided into three stages: 1. Baseline
      period (within 21 days before the start of treatment): Patients will complete screening tests
      during the baseline period to assess whether they meet the selection criteria. 2. Treatment
      period (from the first administration to the completion of the last treatment cycle). The
      tumor will be evaluated every 8 weeks during this period. If the treatment is effective, the
      chemotherapy does not exceed 6 cyclesï¼Œthen experiment group receives oral apatinib
      maintenance therapy until the disease progresses or toxicity could not be tolerated. Control
      group is followed up. 3. Follow-up period. After the end of chemotherapy, the survival status
      and follow-up anti-tumor therapy are collected by telephone or research centers visit every 3
      months until death or loss of follow-up.The primary endpoint is the progression-free survival
      time(PFS) of patients and is judged according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
      Tumors, version 1.1. Adverse events are classified and recorded according to the National
      Cancer Institute's Standard of Common terms for adverse reactions (NCI-CTCAE) version 4.0.
