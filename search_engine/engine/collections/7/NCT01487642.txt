      quit smoking and every year a substantial part of smokers makes a quit attempt. However, the
      majority of smokers tries to quit unassisted and existing smoking cessation interventions are
      underused. In this study we test the effectiveness of four different smoking cessation
      interventions in a randomized controlled trial. The study provides knowledge on factors
      important for recruitment and gives indication on potential reach of interventions among the
      general population. This knowledge can help us in designing interventions that is both
      effective but also have a high reach in the general population.
