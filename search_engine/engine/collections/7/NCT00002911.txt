      placebo on overall survival in patients with Stage III non-small cell lung cancer who have
      minimal residual disease following chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and/or surgery. II. Assess the
      effect of marimastat on time to disease progression in these patients. III. Assess the safety
      and tolerability of marimastat in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind study. Patients are randomized no less than 2 and
      no more than 8 weeks after the last prior treatment modality received. Patients are
      stratified by participating institution. Patients are randomly assigned to receive either
      oral marimastat or oral placebo twice daily. Treatment begins within 5 days of minimization
      and continues for up to 18 months after the last patient is enrolled, unless disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity intervenes. Patients deriving benefit at end of study
      may continue treatment if desired. Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 504 patients will be entered over 30 months from approximately
      60 centers.
