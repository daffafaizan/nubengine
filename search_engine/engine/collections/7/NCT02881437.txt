    
      Open-label, one arm study conducted in France in subjects with PI to IgG trough level at
      steady state after standard SCIG dosing and after HyQvia administered every other week and
      every 3-4 weeks at equivalent dose. The study will have three periods:

        -  The first period is a one-week ramp-up period. The first administration of HyQvia will
           be with a one-week dose as specified in the summary of product characteristics of
           HyQvia.

        -  During the first three-month follow-up period, HyQvia will be administered, every other
           week at a dose equivalent to the dose administered with the previous treatment (standard
           SCIG).

        -  At the end of this first follow-up period, the dose of HyQvia will be increased for the
           next infusion to reach a 3-week equivalent dose. If it this volume is well tolerated,
           the following dosing will be a 4-week equivalent dose. HyQvia will then be administered
           every 3 or 4 weeks for three months.
