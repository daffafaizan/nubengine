      affected adversely by postoperative discomfort. Post-thoracotomy pain syndrome (PTPS) is a
      well-recognized complication of thoracotomy. Post-thoracotomy pain control improves patient
      satisfaction and decreases postoperative complication morbidity. Epidural analgesia used to
      be considered as the best method of pain relief after major surgery despite its side-effects,
      which includes hypotension, respiratory depression, incomplete or failed block, etc.
      Recently, paravertebral block is an alternative technique that may offer a comparable
      analgesic effect and a better side-effect profile for post-thoracotomy pain.
      Dexmedetomidine(DEX) is a Food and Drug Administration-approved, parenteral, selective
      Î±2-agonist that induces anxiolytic and analgesia without respiratory depression. It could
      provide dose-dependent sedation , analgesia , anti-anxiety and inhibition of sympathetic
      nerves and other effects . Current studies with regard to the effectiveness of DEX as an
      adjunctive medicine, used in ultrasound-guided continuous thoracic paravertebral blocks for
      PTPS. The mechanical withdrawal threshold and VAS scores are recorded. The consumption of
      opioid and general anesthetics during perioperative period are also recorded. To compare the
      incidence rates of side effects, such as nausea, vomiting, dizziness, hypotension and
      bradyarrhythmia in the first 3 days after operation among the groups.Also,to measure and
      compare the level of inflammatory factor in different group.A questionnaire is adopted to
      investigate whether there are chronic pain symptoms happen at 6 months after the operation
      which aim to PTPS.
