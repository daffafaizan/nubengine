      Affect and Stereotypes (BIAS) Map. Psychometric evaluation includes testing the reliability
      (intern consistency, test-retest reliability) and validity (exploratory and confirmatory
      factor analysis, construct validity incl. convergent and discriminant validity,
      criterion-related validity).

      and physical health condition and complete measurements of quality of life, mental health,
      depression, public stigma, expected stigma, self-stigma, intention to seek help and actual
      help seeking (behavior).
