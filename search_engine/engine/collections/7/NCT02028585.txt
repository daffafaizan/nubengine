    
      A randomized, controlled, parallel, dietary intervention study was designed. Subjects with
      metabolic syndrome and body mass index â‰¥23 kg/m2 were randomized to the low-fat milk group,
      which were instructed to consume 2 packs of low-fat milk per day (200 mL twice daily) for 6
      weeks, and the control group was instructed to maintain their habitual diet. Metabolic
      markers were evaluated at baseline and at the end of the study.
