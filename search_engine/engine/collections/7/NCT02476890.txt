      two treatment periods with a minimum 48-hour washout between the treatment periods. At
      Baseline and during each treatment period, cough sensitivity was measured by standard
      clinical methodology incorporating four cough challenges. Daytime cough monitoring was
      performed at Baseline and during each of the two treatment periods (chronic cough
      participants only).
