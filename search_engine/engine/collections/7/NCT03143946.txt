      This study aims to investigate if the proportion of NET patients with normal vitamin values
      can be increased, with vitamin suppletion and a personalized diet.

      Methods:

      This is a single center 18-week open-label, non-comparative, single-arm, intervention study.
      After inclusion and the first measurements, adult patients with metastasized or irresectable
      NET will continue with four weeks of standard treatment. After these four weeks participants
      with vitamin values below normal will get vitamin suppletion for each deficient vitamin and
      all participants will get the dietary intervention during 14 weeks. Effects of the
      intervention will be evaluated by quantitative analysis of blood and urine and
      questionnaires. The measurements, including; baseline characteristics, quantitative analysis
      of blood and urine and questionnaires will be performed at baseline (t=0), after 4 weeks
      (t=4) and after 18 weeks at end of study (t=18). Furthermore at t=18 a semi-qualitative
      interview will be performed.
