      patch and bupropion, and with the removal of the box warning, research is needed to assess
      whether smokers can use varenicline without a prescription and formal behavioral support. To
      test this, the primary goal of the proposed research is to test whether varenicline is a
      candidate for switching from prescription (Rx) to OTC, and whether a dose lower than that
      currently approved is as effective in an OTC environment. To understand the within-person
      mechanisms explaining how and when OTC varenicline might improve cessation outcomes, the
      investigators also propose to assess experience with OTC varenicline via (a) ecological
      momentary assessment (EMA).

      Primary Objectives:

        1. To assess the safety and effectiveness of the current FDA-approved 1 mg b.i.d.
           varenicline for smoking cessation in comparison with placebo when used in a simulated
           OTC study condition.

        2. To assess the safety and effectiveness of .5mg b.i.d. varenicline in comparison with 1mg
           b.i.d. varenicline and placebo when used in a simulated OTC study condition.
