      increased risk of preterm birth, cesarean section, and maternal intensive care. The
      objectives of this study are to: (a) evaluate the full impact of SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy to
      inform testing strategies, (b) examine the factors that impede testing during pregnancy, and
      (c) use study data to devise implementation strategies that improve SARS-CoV-2 testing in
      pregnancy and prenatal care during the pandemic. Investigators will prospectively enroll two
      cohorts of pregnant women: 1) exposed (SARS-CoV-2 positive), and 2) unexposed (SARS-CoV-2
      negative as defined by antibody testing at the beginning of pregnancy, every trimester, and
      at delivery). Women who initially enroll as unexposed but later test positive for SARS-CoV-2
      antibodies will cross over to the exposed cohort. In Aim 1, investigators will evaluate
      patients' and providers' perceptions of SARS-CoV-2 testing during pregnancy and the influence
      of COVID-19 on maternal care-seeking behavior and anxiety via surveys and semi-structured
      interviews. In Aim 2, investigators will determine the effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection during
      pregnancy on the risk of preterm birth and other adverse pregnancy outcomes in symptomatic
      and asymptomatic disease. It is hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 infection will increase the risk
      of preterm birth by 12%. In Aim 3, investigators will estimate the risk of mother-to-fetus
      SARS-CoV-2 transmission and viral presence in umbilical cord blood, placenta, and amniotic
      fluid by assaying for viral RNA in the neonate, cord blood, and placenta. Collectively, Aims
      1-3 will be interpreted by investigators, the Scientific Advisory Board and the Community
      Advisory Board who will apply data to devising targeted implementation strategies designed
      for rapid community dissemination to improve testing and prenatal care.
