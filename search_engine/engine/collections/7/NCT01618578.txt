      sense of body ownership are well-known. To investigate the body schema and body image
      stability of these patients in comparison to patients with upper limb pain of origin other
      than CRPS and healthy subjects, we conducted a series of rubber hand illusions. This well -
      established paradigm is elicited by visuo-tactile stimulation of oneÂ´s own real hand and a
      visible hand and forearm prosthesis. The present study investigates 1) if and how far
      patients with CRPS are susceptible to experience the illusion 2) how far the illusion
      strength differs between CRPS and patients with unilateral pain of the upper limb of other
      origin and healthy subjects 3) how far parameters, e.g. neglect-like severity symptoms, body
      plasticity, empathy, duration of disease and pain intensity influence the illusion strength.
