      All patients will have a cartilage biopsy taken from the knee cartilage non-weight bearing
      zone. Chodrocytes will be extracted and cultured for 4 weeks. Patients then will receive
      chondrocyte injection under the guide of fluoroscopy. Patients will be evaluated post
      injection for 6 months at time intervals. Parameters considered being evaluated are, adverse
      effects, pain intensity and joint physical function and cartilage repair. These effects are
      measured by Visual Analogue Scale, WOMAC, Harris Hip Score questionnaire and MRI.
