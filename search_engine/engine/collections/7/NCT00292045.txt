      with CpG 7909 (2.5 mg) administered intradermally every 3 weeks for 4 doses. Patients who
      demonstrated stable disease, minor response, partial response, or complete response at Week
      13 may have continued to receive vaccinations until disease progression. In patients with
      mixed response, single progressive lesions may have been resected and vaccination may have
      been continued.

      Safety was monitored continuously. Blood samples were obtained for clinical hematology,
      biochemistry and immune response assessments, including antinuclear antibody (ANA) and
      anti-dsDNA, NY-ESO-1 and/or LAGE-1 specific antibodies, and NY-ESO-1 specific cluster of
      differentiation (CD)4+ and CD8+ T cells.

      A tumor sample, resected prior to immunization, was tested to determine NY-ESO-1 and/or
      LAGE-1 expression. Delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) testing was performed at baseline and
      on study.

      Disease status was assessed at baseline and on study in patients with measurable disease.
