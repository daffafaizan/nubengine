      fitness levels in patients with myotonia, and thereby reduce the symptom of myotonia in
      everyday life. The effect on myotonia is assessed by a standardized myotonia scale with six
      statements concerning self-rated myotonia, and a number of performance tests that objectively
      describes the degree of myotonia.

      The effect of the training program is assessed by an incremental test, measuring maximal
      oxygen uptake, maximal heart rate and maximal workload. The muscle enzyme creatine kinase
      (CK) is measured in plasma to follow muscle injury and safety during the training.
