      combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel in patients with locally advanced and metastatic
      (Stage IIIb and IV) non-small cell lung cancer. The phase Ib part of the study evaluated dose
      levels of DMXAA at 600 mg/m2, 1200 mg/m2 and 1800 mg/m2. In the phase II part of the study,
      patients were randomized to receive carboplatin and paclitaxel alone or in combination with
      ASA404 1200 mg/m2. An additional single-arm study was undertaken to evaluate further patients
      at the 1800 mg/m2 dose level.
