attenuation curves of the human eye under normal and pathologicalconditions .a method is described which allows the determination of /attenuationcurves/ of the human eye . those curves are obtained by plotting thecritical depth of modulation (cmd) as a function of the critical fusionfrequency (cff) . routine experiments were carried out for a 2 testfield showing a sinusoidal periodical variation of its luminance,surrounded by an extensive area with a luminance equal to the averageluminance of the test field . attenuation curves were obtained fornormal observers under different experimental conditions and for anumber of patients . it is shown that this method affords us informationwhich cannot be obtained by means of the classical methods for measuringthe cff .
