    
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, randomized, 2-panel, 4-way crossover study in healthy adult
      participants to assess the relative bioavailability of rilpivirine following single dose
      administration of oral pediatric formulation candidates (two dispersible tablet formulations
      and one granules formulation), compared to the commercially available 25-mg tablet (EDURANT)
      and to assess the effect of food and different food constituents on the oral bioavailability
      of rilpivirine following single dose administration of one selected formulation candidate.
      The study will consist of 2 panels: Panel 1 and Panel 2. In each panel, participants will be
      randomized to receive treatment A, B, C, D and E, F, G, H, respectively. Pharmacokinetic
      parameters will be evaluated primarily. Safety will be monitored throughout the study.
