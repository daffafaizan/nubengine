    
      This study is intended to collect data on the rate of vascular complications in subjects
      having transfemoral TAVI when the SoloPathÂ® Balloon Expandable TransFemoral Introducer is
      used as a guide for introduction and delivery of TAVI devices. The use of a small profile
      sheath could possibly reduce the incidence of post procedure vascular complications
      associated with TAVI and further enhance the safety of accessing the femoral delivery route.

      In addition, this study will examine the impact of arterial morphology and other subject risk
      factors as a predictor of clinical outcomes within 30 days following TAVI.
