    
      This is a randomized, prospective, double-blinded study evaluating the efficacy of Fortiva
      Porcine Dermis versus Strattice Reconstructive Tissue Matrix in 120 patients with large
      complex abdominal wall ventral hernias undergoing single stage repair. The patient will be
      blinded to treatment as well as an independent qualified evaluator to confirm evidence of
      reoccurrence. This post-market study compares two FDA cleared biologic hernia materials.
      Fortiva™ porcine dermis, processed by RTI Surgical, Inc., a non-cross linked porcine dermis
      will be compared to Strattice™ Reconstructive Tissue Matrix by Life Cell, a non-cross linked
      porcine dermis for reinforcement during the single stage open reconstruction of abdominal
      wall defects. The primary outcome will be hernia recurrence at 1 year. Outcomes will be
      evaluated at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months and 24 months.
