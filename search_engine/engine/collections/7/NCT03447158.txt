      which may cause serious restriction of daily activities and reduce quality of life. There are
      many ways in treating rotator cuff disorder with bursitis, including medication, physical
      therapy, kinesiological taping, acupuncture and local injection. Protholotherapy, which
      inject hyperosmolar dextrose to soft tissue, is a novel management in musculoskeletal
      disorders. However, only few trials exist in studying hyperosmolar dextrose injection for
      rotator cuff disorder with bursitis and most of them have small sample size and not
      randomized. The aim of this study was to figure out the effects of sonographically guided
      subacromial bursa injection with hyperosmolar dextrose in rotator cuff disorder with bursitis
      by a randomized controlled trial.
