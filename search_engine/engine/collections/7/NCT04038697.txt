      improvements in: walking speed, leg strength, neuromuscular fatigability and the hyperemic
      blood flow response to muscle contractions, and vascular endothelial function and aerobic
      exercise capacity. A randomized control design will be used with three groups of chronic
      stroke survivors enrolled for four weeks of training (3x/week; 12 sessions total). The groups
      are: IC + Treadmill Training, IC Sham + Treadmill Training, and IC only. We will also enroll
      a group of age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects who will undergo IC + Treadmill
      Training. All Aims will be tested concurrently over a five-year period. All studies will be
      performed in Cramer Hall at Marquette University in the Integrated Neural Engineering
      Rehabilitation Laboratories, the Human Performance Assessment Core, and the Physical Therapy
      Clinic.

      Randomization of stroke patients to the three intervention groups will be performed by using
      randomized block designs (randomly chosen block sizes of 3, 6 and 9). This number accounts
      for possible dropouts and the use of non- parametric methods.
