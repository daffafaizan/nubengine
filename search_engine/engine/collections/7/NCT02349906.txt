      and efficacy of Treosulfan-based conditioning compared to Busulfan-based conditioning in
      paediatric patients. Based on the given clinical experience with either Treosulfan-based or
      Busulfan-based conditioning in combination with Fludarabine no increased risk for graft
      failure is expected in paediatric patients. A potential benefit for study patients is
      expected with respect to a probably low non-haematological toxicity of treatment compared to
      myeloablative TBI-based conditioning or high-dose Busulfan-based conditioning in combination
      with Cyclophosphamide.

      However, the allogeneic HSCT procedure itself potentially involves serious risks with regard
      to severe or life-threatening conditions like graft versus host disease (GvHD) and/or
      infectious complications as well as graft failure.

      In summary, the primary goal of this study is to evaluate the Treosulfan-based myeloablative
      conditioning regimen as an alternative in children and to contribute to the current PK model
      for Treosulfan to be able to finally give age (or body surface area [BSA]) dependent dose
      recommendations. The treatment regimens given in the protocol MC-FludT.16/NM are based on
      sufficient clinical safety and efficacy data. Considering the vital indication for allogeneic
      HSCT of the selected patient population, the risk-benefit assessment seems to be in favour of
      the study conduct.

      Moreover, planned interim analyses will ensure the early identification of unexpected risks.
      Therefore, the conduct of the protocol MC-FludT.16/NM is considered reasonably justified.
