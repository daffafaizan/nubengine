      I. To determine time to progression in patients with high risk CLL.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Overall response rate including (complete remission [CR]+partial remission [PR]) of
      lenalidomide.

      II. To determine the incidence of immune mediated flare reaction. III. To characterize the
      toxicity profile of single agent lenalidomide in previously untreated B-CLL.

      IV. To correlate expression of B-CLL co-stimulatory ligands and clinical efficacy of
      lenalidomide in this patient population.

      V. To conduct correlative studies.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive lenalidomide orally (PO) once daily for 4 weeks. Treatment repeats
      every 4 weeks for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3
      months for 5 years.
