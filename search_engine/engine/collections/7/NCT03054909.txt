      followed by a 4 week rest (no treatment). As it is not known how intraperitoneal (IP)
      administration (a route of drug administration frequently used for gynecologic cancers) of
      ALT-803 compares to subcutaneous (SQ) administration, both routes of administration will be
      tested. The primary objective of this trial is to select one method of delivery for further
      testing.
