      randomly assigned to escitalopram (10 mg daily) plus PS128 (a psychobiotic) (300 mg two times
      daily, equivalent to 3 Ã—1010 CFU two times daily) or escitalopram (10 mg daily) groups. The
      rating scales and instrument, including Clinical Global Impression-Severity, 17-item Hamilton
      Rating Scale for Depression, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, Global Assessment of Functioning,
      Heart Rate Variability, Depression and Somatic Symptoms Scale, Work and Social Adjustment
      Scale, Short form 36 and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, are used to measure treatment
      outcomes at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. UKU Side Effect Rating Scale and Gastrointestinal
      Symptom Rating Scale-Irritable Bowel Syndrome are used to measure side effects. Generalized
      estimating equations model will be used to analyze the differences between two groups with
      respect to efficacy and safety measures on time after adjusting for baseline severity, sex,
      age and age at onset of illness.
