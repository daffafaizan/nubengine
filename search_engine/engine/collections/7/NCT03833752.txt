      tool in urology.Compared with flexible endoscopes, rigid instruments offer better image
      quality, a wider lumen of the working channel, improved irrigant flow and superior handiness.
      However, flexible cystoscopes provide more options for patient positioning, enable smooth
      passage over an elevated bladder neck or median lobe, facilitate full inspection of the
      bladder because of their movable tip and, what is most important is it significantly improve
      patient comfort(patient can be positioned in any comfortable position).
