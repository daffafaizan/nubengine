      of prematurity. Humidified high flow nasal cannula devices (flows 1-8 lpm) have also been
      used in neonatal intensive care units.

      This study is to evaluate the feasibility of using a pressure limited nasal cannula system
      instead of a high flow nasal cannula system in the management of premature babies with
      respiratory distress.
