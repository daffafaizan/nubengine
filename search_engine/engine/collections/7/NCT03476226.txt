      combination of all disciplines. However, breast cancer therapies have at times demonstrated
      distressing effects in patients/survivors during and/or following treatment. One area that is
      found to cause distress for the breast cancer patient is changes in cognitive function.

      Areas most commonly impacted by changes in cognitive function as a result of chemotherapy
      include executive functioning (including judgment, hindsight and foresight), processing speed
      or reaction time, working memory, and organizational skills.

      Due to the limited amount of research involving quality of life as related to cognitive
      dysfunction, there is a clear need for additional investigation. Treatment typically focuses
      on the physical and psychosocial aspects of patients/survivors, however emphasis should also
      be placed on the impact of quality of life during treatment and survivorship due to the
      potential for far-reaching effects as previously discussed.

      Oncology nurses may be instrumental in identifying patients with Cognitive Dysfunction. In
      doing so, the nurse may then communicate with the patient/survivor as to the impact of
      Cognitive Dysfunction on quality of life. The nurse can provide appropriate education and or
      additional support options.
