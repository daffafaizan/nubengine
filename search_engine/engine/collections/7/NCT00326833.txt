      neurological disorders. Therefore, a proper and timely diagnosis and treatment is important.
      The use of sensitive biochemical markers such as methylmalonic acid for the diagnosis of
      vitamin B12 deficiency have increased since the 1980s. Consequently, the number of
      individuals treated with vitamin B12 has increased significantly.

      The objective of this project is to study the actual need for vitamin B12 injections in the
      group of individuals who have already started treatment. In order to investigate this, the
      investigators stop vitamin B12 treatment in this group, and look for signs of vitamin B12
      deficiency by monitoring changes in biochemical and hematological markers. Furthermore, they
      will test if the individuals are able to absorb a physiological dose of vitamin B12 using a
      recently developed absorption test (CobaSorb). If a physiological dose can be absorbed, the
      vitamin B12 injections can be replaced with tablets. In the end, the investigators hope to be
      able to divide the patients into three groups:

        1. need life long injections with vitamin B12,

        2. only need supplementations with a small dose of oral vitamin B12, and

        3. no need for further vitamin B12 treatment.

      The perspective is that the new information from this study might be used for a future
      strategy for vitamin B12 treatment.
