      diverticulosis experience abdominal symptoms and, eventually, complications such as episodes
      of diverticulitis or bleeding. The distinction between patients with uncomplicated or
      complicated diverticulitis affects the clinical management: medical therapy for the first,
      interventional therapy for the latter. CT imaging with intravenous contrast has become the
      gold standard in the diagnosis and staging of patients with suspected acute diverticulitis
      but, unfortunately, CT involves radiation exposure, is expensive and has contraindications.
      UltraSound (US) is a real-time dynamic examination with wide availability and easy
      accessibility and may be useful in diagnosing and managing critically ill patients who cannot
      be moved to CT. In a recent meta-analysis, US exam performed by Radiologists showed a pooled
      sensitivity of 90% (vs 95% for CT, p = 0.86) and a specificity of 90% (vs 96% for CT, p =
      0.04). US is increasingly used at bedside to rapidly assess patients presenting to the
      Emergency Department. No previous studies have investigated the diagnostic accuracy of
      abdominal US performed by physician at bedside as an extension of physical examination. This
      study evaluates the diagnostic accuracy of bedside abdominal US.
