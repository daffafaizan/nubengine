      can targeted intervention in an interactive environment, immediate and sensitive feedback
      about the user's performance, a motivating effect due to game-based feature. Unlike
      commercial camera systems such as Kinect or force platforms, the systems require a continuous
      sightline or restrict the base of support which may increase risk of falling. Few of studies
      had investigated the rehabilitation effects on balance with Pablo for patients with stroke.

      PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of virtual reality training
      through Pablo system in patients with chronic stroke.

      METHODS: Patients with mild to moderate motor deficits (N=38) participated 18 VR plus
      standard rehabilitation sessions or 18 standard therapy sessions. The performance was
      assessed for 2 times before and after therapy. The outcome measures included Berg Balance
      Scale, Functional Reach Test, and Timed Up and Go Test (cognition) for balance evaluations,
      Gait analysis for gait evaluation, Activities-specific Balance Confidence scale for balance
      confidence, and Stroke Impact Scale for quality of life. The pleasure scale and adverse
      events were also recorded after each training session. Collected data will be analyzed with
      sample T test by SPSS version 20.0, and alpha level was set at 0.05.
