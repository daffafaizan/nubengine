      hypotension and randomize into 2 groups as following:

        1. Control group. The patient will receive treatment according to septic shock guideline
           2013, which start with intravenous fluid replacement until achieve target central venous
           pressure (CVP) or pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) or other fluid responsive
           test goal. If the patient's mean arterial blood pressure still lower than 65 mmHg, then
           norepinephrine or dopamine will initiate to rise blood pressure. The patient will
           receive 5% dextrose water as the placebo of norepinephrine.

        2. Early norepinephrine group. The patient will receive fluid therapy together with low
           dose of norepinephrine (0.05 mcg/kg/min). If after titrate intravenous fluid therapy
           until achieve goal CVP or PCWP or other fluid responsive test, but the mean blood
           pressure still lower than 65 mmHg, then additional titrate dose of norepinephrine will
           be given to the patient according to standard septic shock guideline.
