      out using a scalpel, sharp dissection, or using an electric current to divide tissue,
      monopoly electrocautery. Reducing blood loss is important. Blood loss can result in anaemia,
      which has a number of effects including shortness of breath, chest pain and lethargy. Blood
      loss into a newly replaced knee can also result in pain and stiffness in the joint. Total
      knee replacements are routinely carried out with a tourniquet inflated, which reduces the
      blood flow into to leg during the operation. Diathermy is applied to areas of bleeding to
      stop them from doing so during operations. With the tourniquet inflated, some areas that
      would bleed when this was deflated may not be noticed and continue to bleed. Using diathermy
      for the approach would be expected to reduce this bleeding compared to using a scalpel.
