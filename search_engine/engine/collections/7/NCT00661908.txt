      and discrimination at workplace or by insurances. 636 questionnaires were distributed and
      were answered and returned. Anonymity was ensured. Patients were recruited from the diabetes
      outpatient clinic of the University of Basel Hospital, 5 regional hospitals, specialist
      practices and general practitioner practices.

      The aims of this study are to investigate the prevalence of discrimination at workplace and
      by insurances due to diabetes mellitus. Furthermore we want analyse if socio-demographic
      factors (age,gender,origin) show an impact on diabetes-related discrimination at workplace
      and by insurances. We hypothesize furthermore that certain diabetes-related factors like
      having severe hypoglycemias, being type 1 diabetic, having diabetic complications or being
      overweight/obese is associated with more problems at work and with insurances.

      Data will be analysed by a multiple ordinal regression analysis. We will correct data for
      age, gender, employment status and diabetes type.
