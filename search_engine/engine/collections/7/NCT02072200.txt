      Starting dose is 10mg, and depending on the clinical symptoms and the patient's response, the
      initial dose can quickly be reduced to a lower maintenance dose. When changing over from the
      standard regimen (glucocorticoid administration in the morning) to Lodotra® administered at
      bedtime (at about 10 pm), the same dose (in mg prednisone equivalent) should be maintained,
      if the subject has taken stable dose within 30 days. Lodotra® dose cannot exceed more than
      10mg.

      Lodotra® should be taken at bedtime (at about 10 pm), with or after the evening meal and be
      swallowed whole with sufficient liquid. If more than 2 - 3 hours have passed since the
      evening meal, it is recommended to take Lodotra® with a light meal or snack.

      Modified-release tablets are not to be broken, divided or chewed.

      Treatment procedure:At Visit 1(week 0), subjects who qualify for entry into the study will
