    
      The ENTact™ Staple System is a device that inserts a small staple or tack to hold mucosa
      (moist tissues) in place instead of using stitches. The staple gradually dissolves and does
      not need to be removed. This clinical study will evaluate:

        -  surgical performance of the ENTact Septal Staple System

        -  one week post op clinical evaluation of gross tissue appearance at implantation site(s)

        -  ENTact™ Septal Staple functionality based on maintained coaptation
