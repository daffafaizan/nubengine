      fractures. Specifically, this study will be looking at male and female athletes on the track,
      cross-country, soccer, and basketball teams at the University of South Carolina. During the
      pre-season physical of each student athlete, serum vitamin D levels will be taken and
      recorded. There will be a certified nurse to draw the blood samples. This will take place at
      the University of South Carolina Athletic Department and/or the Palmetto Health Lab at 2
      Medical Park. Potentially, every athlete of the given teams will be enrolled in the study
      unless they choose not to. Only subjects showing concentrations below 30 ng/mL, which is
      indicative of insufficient or deficient levels, will be provided supplemental treatment of
      25-(OH) vitamin D. Every enrolled subject will be monitored for injury throughout the season.
      Any and all injuries will be positively identified, and any confirmed stress fractures will
      be recorded. Data from prospective seasons will be compared to an incidence percentage of
      athletes from previous seasons. Previous athletes did not receive any vitamin D treatment.
      These will be used as a control to determine if treatment affected the occurrence of stress
      fractures. All physicals and tests will be performed at the University of South Carolina
      Sports Medicine clinic by the sports medicine staff.
