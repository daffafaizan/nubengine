    
      To close the gap of missing clinical evidence regarding the treatment of periprosthetic
      fractures after arthroplasty of the hip or the knee with osteosynthesis.

      To drive further study hypotheses and to answer unforeseen questions.

      Main questions to be answered by the registry include (but are not exclusive) the following:

        1. Influence of implants on outcome

        2. Influence of surgical techniques on outcome

        3. Influence of bone grafting on outcome

        4. Identification of risk factors for failure

        5. Identification of postoperative rehabilitation programs and its possible influence on
           the outcome

        6. Influence of fracture type on outcome

        7. To serve as a comparative dataset for future studies with improved implants and
           techniques
