    
      This randomized controlled trial will test whether promoting the novel condom CSD500 (Futura
      Medical Developments; Surrey, UK) for improved sexual pleasure results in couples having less
      unprotected vaginal sex - measured with a biological marker of recent semen exposure -
      compared to the promotion of a standard condom for disease and pregnancy prevention. CSD500
      contains an erectogenic drug and was developed to improve sexual pleasure by increasing
      penile firmness, size, and erection duration.

      Investigators will recruit eligible, monogamous, heterosexual couples at Thanh Hoa Provincial
      Centre of Reproductive Health in Vietnam to participate in a randomized controlled trial
      (RCT) of two balanced arms of approximately 250 couples each. At enrollment and at three
      follow-up visits scheduled at 2, 4 and 6 months after enrollment, study staff will provide
      condom counseling, will collect vaginal swabs to test for the semen biomarker,
      prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and will administer a questionnaire to the female
      participants on their demographics, sexual and condom-related attitudes and practices,
      including sexual pleasure and perceptions of partner's sexual pleasure. Although the
      intervention is directed to the women, couples will be enrolled to ensure that the male
      partners consent to CSD500 use. After enrollment, male participants will not participate in
      study visit activities, including data collection, until the time of their female partner's
      final 6-month visit. Because of the differences in counseling messages, participants and
      study staff at the site cannot be blinded to arm assignment.
