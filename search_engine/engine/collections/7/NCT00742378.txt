      coherence tomography. Even though its resolution and speed are much better than the previous
      OCT, its reproducibility and diagnostic power for detecting the glaucomatous defect of
      retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) have not known yet. In the present study, we will review the
      data of RNFL thickness measurement using the Cirrus HD OCT. After assessing the inter-test
      variability, the discriminating ability of the Cirrus HD OCT for glaucoma diagnosis will be
      determined by the ROC curves.
