      treatment with inhaled FP hydrofluoroalkane-propelled metered dose inhaler (HFA-MDI), 880 mcg
      twice daily, on:

      Specific Aim 1: UAW collapsibility, as measured by Pcrit during NREM sleep; Specific Aim 2:
      Severity of obstructive SDB and sleep quality, and quality of life related to sleep apnea
      assessed on validated questionnaires (Sleep Apnea scale of the Sleep Disorders Questionnaire
      [SA-SDQ], Epworth Sleepiness Scale [ESS]) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index [PSQI], and
      Sleep Apnea Quality of Life Index [SAQLI]); Specific Aim 3: Tongue strength and fatigability
      (assessed using the Iowa Oral Performance Instrument)
