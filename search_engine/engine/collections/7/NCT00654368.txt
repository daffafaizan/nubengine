      rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Patients who did not have an adequate response to methotrexate
      (MTX) had etanercept (50 mg/week subcutaneously [SC]) added to existing MTX therapy of at
      least 15 mg/week (or 10 mg/week in case of documented intolerance to higher doses of MTX) at
      baseline and were followed for 6 months. After 6 months of therapy, participants were
      randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of the 2 treatment arms: either discontinue MTX (tapered
      over 6 weeks) and continue etanercept alone or continue both etanercept plus MTX for an
      additional 18 months.
