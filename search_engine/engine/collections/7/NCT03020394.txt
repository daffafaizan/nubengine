      NPPV can avoid tracheal intubation in 40% to 60% patients, and also reduce the incidence of
      VAP. Recently, large-scale comparative effectiveness research (CER) also found that compared
      with invasive ventilation, NPPV can reduce mortality rates. At present, there's no
      high-quality clinical studies which can confirm this, and clinical guidelines do not have a
      recommendation on the use of NPPV in these patients. Therefore, investigators believe that
      NPPV can avoid intubation in patients with severe exacerbation of COPD in ICU with perfect
      monitoring conditions and reasonable human resource allocation, as well as the progress of
      medical technology in NPPV in recent years, in order to reduce IMV-related complications and
      improve patients' outcomes.
