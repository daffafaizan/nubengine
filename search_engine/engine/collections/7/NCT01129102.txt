    
      The main objective of this study is to confirm the effectiveness and safety profile of NPC-01
      in comparison with placebo in the treatment of dysmenorrhea (primary and secondary
      dysmenorrhea).

      Additionally we also investigate the differences of effectiveness of NPC-01 in comparison
      with IKH-01 in the treatment of secondary dysmenorrhea as a reference, because IKH-01 is
      already marketed at them.

      To achieve these, closed testing procedure is used in this study. After confirming
      statistical differences between NPC-01 and Placebo in the total dysmenorrhea, stratified
      analysis is carried out for primary dysmenorrhea (NPC-01, Placebo), and secondary
      dysmenorrhea (NPC-01, IKH-01 and Placebo).
