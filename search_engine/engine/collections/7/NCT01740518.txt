      identify lesions. PEG can provide a rapid orthograde peroral approach to colonic lavage
      without producing significant fluid or electrolyte changes. Thus PEG is now commonly used for
      bowel preparation. However, large amounts and unsatisfactory taste of PEG solution are
      generally poorly tolerated. a new low volume PEG-based bowel cleansing agents became
      available at foreign countries. Although several studies reported the efficacy and improved
      compliance of these low volume PEG plus ascorbic acid solution for colonoscopy, but result in
      Korean patients was not-recognized.
