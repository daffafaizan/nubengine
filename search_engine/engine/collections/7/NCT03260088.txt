      criteria.

      Several methods have been proposed for the identification of pleural effusion etiology
      including pleural fluid cytology, pleural biopsy, thoracoscopy and computerized tomography.
      However, these technologies have their own limitations.

      The diagnosis of malignant pleural effusion is a vexing problem, since pleural fluid cytology
      findings are positive in only 60% of cases on average. Tumor marker carcinoembryonic antigen
      (CEA) can be positive in 80% of cases.

      Thoracoscopy will establish the diagnosis in approximately 95% of cases, but this
      interventional procedure may not be available at all facilities.

      A new approach is needed to detect the cause of undiagnosed pleural effusions. Diagnosis of
      idiopathic pleural effusion was made after a minimum of one year follow up with detailed
      exploration including computed tomographic scanning to exclude other causes of effusion such
      as malignant pleural effusion.

      Because immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4)-related disease is recognized as a fibroinflammatory
      condition of unknown cause that can affect multiple organs including the lungs and pleura,
      IgG4 might be related to certain idiopathic pleural effusions.

      The criteria of Common radiological findings of IgG4-related lung disease include hilar and
      mediastinal lymphadenopathy, thickening of perilymphatic interstitium with or without
      subpleural and/or peribronchovascular consolidation.
