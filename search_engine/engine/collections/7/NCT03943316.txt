      during cytoreductive surgery or paracentesis at the University of New Mexico Hospital or
      Cancer Center. Cancer cells and immune cells from the ascites fluid will be used to test
      novel immunotherapies for ovarian cancer treatment and to establish patient derived xenograft
      models to perform preclinical testing on a cancer cell population that better models the
      heterogeneity in patient disease
