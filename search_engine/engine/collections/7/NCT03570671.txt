      observational individual dataset, suspected VSA patients (n=20) underwent dual-acquisition of
      MDCTA (initial and intravenous nitrate injected CT imaging), the diagnostic accuracy showed
      sensitivity: 73%, specificity: 100%, positive predictive value: 100%, and negative predictive
      value: 56%.

      Further study is necessary because previous analysis presented limited sample size and
      deficiency of healthy control.

      Therefore, investigators hypothesis that dual-acquisition of MDCTA in noninvasive tool for
      coronary assessment provide more information of coronary characteristics, and the diagnostic
      efficacy would be non-inferior as compared with the invasive coronary imaging modality in
      coronary spasm-induced angina attacks.
