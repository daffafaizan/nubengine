      large cohort of survivors focused on health promotion and reducing the risk of recurrence.
      While adjuvant therapy, such as hormone therapy, is often used to prevent cancer recurrence,
      modification of lifestyle is an effective tool to increase quality of life, prevent future
      cancer recurrence and increase long-term health. However, translating these recommendations
      into population-wide, inexpensive, sustainable programs for cancer survivors has to date
      proven largely unrealized. These programs are particularly needed in health disparity-facing
      populations (i.e., low socio-economic status and/or racial/ethnic minority groups) due to the
      high burden of cancer incidence and mortality they face. Limited translation is due to many
      factors including the complexity of lifestyle habits, high patient burden of many behavioral
      interventions, low levels of engagement and adherence to interventions, and the lack of
      integration of behavior change tools into daily lifestyles. In this context, there is great
      promise of tools that are mobile, simple, and embedded into daily life routines. The
      long-term goal of this research program is to develop, evaluate and implement effective
      mHealth technology interventions that improve cancer management outcomes by changing
      lifestyle behaviors among urban health- disparity facing populations.

      The mHealth intervention for cancer survivors devised by the investigators consists of
      several components: 1) a commercially available smart phone app that captures patients'
      behavioral data (steps, sleep, weight) using devices (a FitBit and a FitBit scale), 2) text
      messages to participants to collect additional data (foods eaten, eating habits), and 3)
      phone sessions with a non-professionally trained health counselor about diet and physical
      activity behaviors.

      The investigators propose to test the feasibility and preliminary outcomes on weight,
      behaviors, psychological factors as well as participant engagement in the intervention of our
      mHealth counseling intervention among 20 breast cancer survivors.
