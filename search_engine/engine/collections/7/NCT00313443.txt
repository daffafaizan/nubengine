      toxicity, specially in chronic treatment. Accumulation of the drug in tissues is very
      probably the cause of the majority of amiodarone delayed adverse effects. However, this has
      not been proved because obtaining tissue samples is usually difficult and aggressive.

      The investigators study, in patients following chronic treatment with amiodarone, if needle
      aspiration can provide samples of fat tissue useful to accurately determine amiodarone
      concentrations, how those concentrations in fat tissue correlate with cumulated dose, and how
      concentrations in fat tissue correlate with concentrations in blood, which is easier to
      obtain.

      The investigators expect this knowledge will help to understand how amiodarone develops its
      adverse effects and possibly lead to new ways of monitoring treatment with this drug, or to
      adapt doses in chronic administration.
