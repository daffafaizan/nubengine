    
      A total of 960 subjects are planned to be randomized into this study to receive treatment
      with GA Depot or with matching placebo.

      During the placebo controlled period (PC period, the first 52 weeks of the study immediately
      after randomization) subjects will receive either 40mg of GA Depot or matching placebo, IM,
      once every 4 weeks, for a total of 13 times.

      Subjects who complete the PC period of the study will be offered to continue into the open
      label period (OL period) for an additional 52 weeks, in which all subjects will receive 40mg
      of GA Depot IM once every 4 weeks.
