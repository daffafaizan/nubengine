      This is the first study to look at the response of hormone therapy resistance breast cancer
      to epigenetic immune priming. It is also the first study to look at the combination of an
      Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor (vorinostat), an anti-estrogen (tamoxifen) and a PD-1
      inhibitor, pembrolizumab in pre or postmenopausal patients with ER+ advanced breast cancer
      with progression on multiple prior therapies.

      Recent preclinical studies have further suggested that epigenetic priming may be even more
      effective in ER-negative tumors that do not respond to immune check point inhibitors or have
      low PD-1/PD-L1 expression. The goal of this study is to demonstrate that Vorinostat can
      increase PD-1 and PD-L1 expression.

      In a third arm the study will evaluate the role of epigenetic priming in tumors that are
      ER-negative.
