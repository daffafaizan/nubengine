    
      This is a study comprising of 5 cohorts (cohorts 1 to 5) of 6 healthy subjects in each cohort
      (4 in each ASP5354 cohort and 2 in each placebo cohort). If the data from cohorts 1 to 3 are
      sufficient to characterize safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics and the assessed doses
      reach the expected urine ASP5354 concentration, the study may be ended without running the
      fourth or fifth cohorts.
