      Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders will be applied for the determination of the
      presence or absence of temporomandibular disorder. Each group (with and without
      temporomandibular disorder) will then be randomly allocated into a control group and
      experimental group submitted to pre-fatigue low-level laser therapy. Before and after the
      induction of fatigue, all volunteers will be evaluated with regard to the range of mandibular
      movement, bite force, sensitivity to palpation of the muscles evaluated and muscle fatigue.
      Low-level laser therapy will be administered to the masseter and anterior temporal muscles
      prior to the induction of fatigue, which will be induced with the use of chewing gum. The
      data will be submitted to descriptive statistical analysis. The chi-square test and Fisher's
      exact test will be used to establish the associations of the categorical variables. Pearson
      correlation coefficients will be calculated for the analysis of the correlation of the
      continuous variables.
