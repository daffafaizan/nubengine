      implant. Data will be collected before, during and after surgery and will be electronically
      entered into the Atlas database where it will be stored indefinitely.

      The purpose of the study is to create an Atlas to store physiological information utilizing
      non-rigid MRI normalization algorithms. In addition to collating and analyzing the
      physiological atlas in a statistical manner that allows the surgeon to predict optimal
      targeting locations for DBS implants based on multiple physiological variables, including
      pre-operative severity of disease, intraoperative neurophysiological observations, and
      post-operative response to DBS stimulation therapy.
