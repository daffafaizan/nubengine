      Primary

        -  To verify that long-acting somatostatin analog octreotide (Sandostatin LAR) depot will
           extend median survival from 5 months to 8.75 months in patients with locally advanced or
           metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma with a CLIP score of 3 or more.

      Secondary

        -  To document tolerability of this drug in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to underlying degree of liver disease as defined
      by CLIP score classification.

      Patients receive short-acting octreotide subcutaneously three times daily on days 1-21 OR
      days 1-28. If the patient tolerates short-acting octreotide, the first dose of long-acting
      octreotide (Sandostatin LAR) depot will be given intramuscularly beginning on day 8 OR day
      15. Treatment with long-acting octreotide repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After the completion of study treatment, patients are followed monthly for 6 months.
