      Paravertebral nerve blocks are a proven method of pain relief following thoracotomy. A
      paravertebral block has been shown to provide good pain relief with minimal side effects,
      however, paravertebral blocks for robotic surgery have not been well studied. Currently we
      routinely perform PVB on this patient population (of 50 MV robotic cases done between January
      and October 2012, 36 received paravertebral blocks with no adverse events noted). We believe
      this should be studied further and that paravertebral blocks will reduce the amount of
      additional pain medication patients require in the first 24 hours after surgery, decrease
      intubation time and improve PACU and hospital discharge times.
