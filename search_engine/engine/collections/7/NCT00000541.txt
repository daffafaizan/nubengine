      (500 mg/day), vitamin E (600 IU every other day), and/or beta carotene (50 mg every other
      day) on the risk of major cardiovascular events (a combined outcome of myocardial infarction,
      stroke, coronary revascularization, or cardiovascular death) among 8171 female health
      professionals at increased risk. Participants were 40 years or older with a history of
      cardiovascular disease or 3 or more cardiovascular risk factors and were followed for an
      average duration of 9.4 years, from 1995-1996 to 2005. In 1998, 5442 of these participants
      were further randomized to the B-vitamin intervention (a daily combination pill containing
      folic acid [2.5 mg], vitamin B6 [50 mg], vitamin B12 [1 mg]) and were followed for 7.3 years,
      from April 1998 through July 2005.
