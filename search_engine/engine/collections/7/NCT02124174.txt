      with high-risk Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) after
      allogeneic stem cell transplant. The primary objective of this study will be determining the
      1 year overall survival from combining valproic acid (VPA) with 5-azacytidine (5-aza).

      To assess the effect that adding valproic acid to azacitidine will have in patient with
      high-risk Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) after allogeneic
      stem cell transplant on the following endpoints
