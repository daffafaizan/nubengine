        -  Determine comprehensive gene and protein expression profiles of in vitro sensitivity and
           resistance to obatoclax mesylate in multiple-lineage leukemia (MLL)-rearranged cell
           lines and primary infant acute myeloid leukemia (AML) samples.

        -  Define optimum in vitro combinations of obatoclax mesylate targeting pro-survival BCL-2
           family proteins with cytotoxic drugs in MLL-rearranged leukemia cell lines and primary
           infant AML samples.

        -  Identify synergistic combinations based on a pharmacodynamic modeling and simulation
           construct.

        -  Determine whether combinations of obatoclax mesylate targeting pro-survival BCL-2 family
           proteins with cytotoxic drugs improves survival in a xenograft model of MLL-rearranged
           infant AML.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Obatoclax mesylate activity is assessed via the MTT assay. A priori features of acute myeloid
      leukemia (AML) blasts relating to the apoptosis and ATG cell death pathways and their
      execution are characterized using microarray analysis and quantitative real-time (Q-RT) PCR.
      Gene and protein expression is described and quantified using Q-RT PCR and western blot
      analysis at specific time points after obatoclax mesylate exposure to identify
      pharmacodynamic biomarkers of activity and characterize the cell death mechanism in
      multiple-lineage leukemia (MLL)+ AML. The MTT assay is performed using obatoclax
      mesylate-cytotoxic chemotherapy combinations to determine synergy focusing on common
      cytotoxic drugs employed in AML treatment regimens.

      Obatoclax mesylate efficacy is tested in a therapeutic NOG xenograft model of primary MLL+
      infant AML.
