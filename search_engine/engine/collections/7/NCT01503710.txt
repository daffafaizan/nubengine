      would result in a further morbidity and mortality. Critical ills complicated with acute
      kidney injury are usually accompanied with multi-organ failure. Therefore, National Taiwan
      University Hospital Study group of Acute Renal Failure (NSARF) realizes that the
      characteristics of AKI is resulted from the perfusion less of body fluid and attempt to
      develop therapies to prevent or attenuate AKI, which have had limited success. We attempt to
      use the novel biomarker soluble hemojuvelin (sHJV) to evaluate the iron homeostasis on acute
      kidney injury and develop new strategies and therapies such as protease inhibitors on kidney
      function, as safety markers to monitor toxicity and as measures of treatment effect. Besides,
      we will focus on validation the sensitivity and specificity of sHJV on the clinical specimen
      of post-operative patients from NSARF data-bank. Merge the renal function and other types of
      biomarkers as panel to predict the post-operative outcome. Based on the different expression
      of these markers, using a panel of serum and urine markers may potentially help us to
      distinguish between various types of insults, establish the duration and severity of injury,
      predict the clinical outcome and help to monitor response to treatment in AKI.
