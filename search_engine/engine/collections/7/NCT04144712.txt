      widespread use in preterm infants, there has been little information about the optimal
      efficient dose in those patients Caffeine therapy for treatment of apnea of prematurity (AOP)
      is well established over the past few years, yet the optimal loading and maintenance dose of
      caffeine in preterm infants is not well-studied AOP is a common complication of preterm
      birth, which affects more than 80 % of neonates with a birth weight less than 1,000 g.
      Methylxanthine (MGs), including caffeine and theophylline, are a mainstay in the treatment
      and prevention of AOP The efficiency of caffeine, as a preferred methylxanthine, to stimulate
      respiration has been well proven as it has a significant favorable impact on neonatal
      morbidity as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) ligation.
      Also, the results of previous studies revealed that caffeine enhances respiratory muscle
      strength and lung function followed by easier weaning of mechanical ventilation in premature
      infants. Besides, a rapid and sustained increase in diaphragmatic activity and tidal volume
      was reported in preterm infants followed by caffeine administration Previous studies have
      shown that caffeine citrate was generally well tolerated by premature neonates in clinical
      trials and declined the incidence of apnea in this population compared with placebo. Also,
      caffeine is related to superior outcomes due to its lower toxicity and it is a preferred drug
      for apnea in preterm infants with respiratory problems. It has also a significant function as
      a noninvasive respiratory support. It facilitates the transition from invasive to noninvasive
      support, reduces the duration of positive airway pressure support and decreases the risk of
      BPD in preterm infants The optimum caffeine dose in preterm infants with AOP has not been
      well studied as well as heterogeneous reports on the optimal loading and maintenance dose of
      caffeine in several studies in terms of benefits and risks. Many investigations have been
      conducted about various dosing regimens in the improvement or prevention of respiratory
      disorders of premature infants. These dosage regimens, although, have been associated with
      varying degrees of success The aim of this study is to determine if the use of caffeine in
      doses higher than the currently standard dose can decrease the frequency of apnea in preterm
      infants without causing significant side effects
