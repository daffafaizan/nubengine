    
      Subjects with refractory epilepsy who are admitted to the Epilepsy Monitoring Unit (EMU) for
      clinically-indicated long-term video-EEG assessment will be simultaneously monitored with
      Sensor Dots to record electroencephalographic (EEG), electrocardiographic (ECG),
      electromyographic (EMG), and motion signals.

      A subset of subjects will continue using Sensor Dot devices at home (Home Phase) after
      completing the EMU Phase.

      The data recorded by Sensor Dots will be used to: 1) annotate epileptic seizures, which will
      be compared to the annotations made as part of routine EMU monitoring and seizure diaries
      kept at home, and 2) to develop seizure detection algorithms. The data collected as part of
      this study will not be used to influence clinical decision making.
