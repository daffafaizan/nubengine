      multimodal therapy. Therefore, innovative interventions are needed. Sarcoma is known to
      express increased levels of surface antigens that can be targeted by CAR-T cells. In
      addition, studies have shown that low dose chemotherapy such as doxorubicin may modulate
      surface PD-L1 level and enhance immunotherapy effects. This study will combine multiple CAR T
      cells with low dose chemotherapy to treat sarcoma, and followed by maintenance sarcoma
      vaccines. The purpose of this clinical trial will assess the feasibility, safety, efficacy
      and side effects of this combination therapy in patients who have sarcoma that is relapsed or
      late staged.
