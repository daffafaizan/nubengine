           expiratory pressure (PEEP), Blood gas analysis (PaO 2, PaCO 2), Peak pressure (PPeak)

        -  Noting the presence of pulmonary edema (auscultation, blood gas analysis) If Takotsubo
           cardiomyopathy is diagnosed, the 24-hour urine collection test should be repeated
           (measure the quantity of collected urine, determine urine metanephrine and
           normetanephrine levels)

      The following diagnostic steps should be repeated after 1 month:

        -  Echocardiography

        -  12-lead ECG

        -  New York Heart Association scores (NYHA scores)

        -  Glasgow outcome scale (GOS) - survival index

        -  Bartel Index, Karnofsky score - index of life quality

        -  The amount of urine collected in 24 hours and determination of urine metanephrine,
           normetanephrine levels

      If echocardiography shows cardiac wall motion abnormality, cardiac examination should be
      carried out as the following:

        -  Cardiac stress test if necessary

        -  CT coronary angiogram if necessary

        -  Coronary angiography if necessary

      The following examinations should be carried out after 6 months:

        -  Echocardiography

        -  12-lead ECG

        -  New York Heart Association scores (NYHA scores)

        -  Glasgow outcome scale (GOS) - survival index

        -  Bartel Index

        -  The amount of urine collected in 24 hours and determination of urine metanephrine,
           normetanephrine levels

      Comments:

      The level of metanephrine and normetanephrine from 24-hour collected urine should be measured
      again after 1 and 6 months in case of patients where TS was diagnosed.

      The urine of patients who have no diagnosed TS will be solely collected and serve as a
      control. Only 15 of these urine samples will be randomly measured to metanephrine /
      normetanephrine.

      Patient's age, sex, comorbidities, medications, the exact time point of bleeding, the
      circumstances of bleeding neurological and cardiological status are recorded, laboratory
      tests, Transcranial Color Doppler (TCCD), echocardiography and chest X-ray examinations are
      carried out within 24 hours after the patient is being admitted to the ICU.

      The medication to prevent vasospasm (Nimodipine, Simvastatin, sustained physiological Mg
      level) and ulcers, just like the drugs to relief pain are the same in case of all patients.

      The goal of fluid therapy is to maintain normovolaemia. The location of the bleeding is
      recorded (is there any aneurysm, its size is measured; if ventricular drainage is necessary,
      the method that used to treat aneurysm: endovascular, clipping; time elapsed between bleeding
      and therapy) 12-lead ECG, cardiac enzymes, TCCD measurement, neurological state, medications
      and its doses, blood gas analysis in case of mechanical ventilation and ventilation
      parameters are carried out and recorded on a daily basis.

      Cardiac ultrasound and 12-lead ECG examinations are carried out, NYHA scores, clinical
      outcome (GOS), quality of life (Bartel Index) and Karnofsky scores are recorded after 1
      month.

      If echocardiography shows cardiac wall motion abnormality, cardiac examination should be
      carried out as following: cardiac stress test, coronary CT angiogram and coronary angiography
      if necessary.

      Echocardiography, 12-lead ECG examinations are repeated and NYHA scores, clinical outcome
      (GOS), quality of life (Bartel Index) and Karnofsky scores are recorded after 6 months.
