    
      This open-label, dose-escalation study is expected to enroll 20 participants, 40-80 years of
      age and test two doses (low and high dose) of PTP-001, an allogeneic placental tissue
      particulate, in two unique cohorts of 10 participants each. Each participant will receive a
      single intra-articular (IA) injection of PTP-001. Following the completion of the first
      cohort in which 10 participants (Kellgren-Lawrence Grade 2 or 3 knee OA) will be treated with
      the low dose of PTP-001, safety data will be reviewed by an independent Data and Safety
      Monitoring Board (DSMB).
