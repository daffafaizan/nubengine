      clomiphene citrate for 5 days. If ovulation does not occur within 14 days, a progestin pill
      (such as Provera) is prescribed for 10 days to induce a period (which normally occurs within
      1 week of stopping the pill). Then a higher dose of clomiphene citrate will be prescribed.

      The stair-step administration of clomiphene citrate for ovulation induction also involves
      taking clomiphene citrate for 5 days. In contrast, if ovulation does not occur within 7-9
      days, a progestin pill (such as Provera) would NOT be taken to induce a period. The dose of
      clomiphene will then be increased. Therefore, this would do away with the 10 days of taking
      the progestin pill, and also do away with waiting for a period (usually 3 to 7 days) for a
      total of up to a 20 day difference between clomiphene citrate dosing cycles.
