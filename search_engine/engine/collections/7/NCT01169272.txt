        -  Demonstrating the safety of the atrial SonR lead;

        -  Demonstrating the performances of the right ventricular autothreshold algorithm ;

        -  Reporting the adverse events documented in the study;

        -  Reporting electrical performances of Sorin Group PARADYM ICD, in order to validate that
           the performances of those devices are in conformance with longevity and effectiveness
           objectives;

        -  Reporting the Sorin atrial SonR and Situs 2 MV left ventricular leads performances;

        -  Reporting the SonR atrial lead mechanical handling.

        -  Reporting all information from SonR sensor to validate the SonR data exploitation and
           the AVD/VVD optimization.

        -  Reporting the Situs 2 MV LV lead mechanical handling.

        -  Assessing the user satisfaction (patient and physician) of the remote monitoring
           solution and the overall availability of the system in terms of data.

      Thus, this study intends to show that PARADYM RF ICD operate safely and appropriately in
      intended-use as part of an ICD system.
