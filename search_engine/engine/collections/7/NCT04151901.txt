      While descriptive, outcome data on disuse and recovery are abundant, key knowledge gaps limit
      researcher's ability to implement evidence-based, rehabilitation strategies. Limiters
      include: i) an inability to identify individuals most susceptible to disuse, ii) insufficient
      information to differentiate between, and respond to, disuse atrophy in men and women, iii)
      limited insight into the mechanisms driving adaptation to early rehabilitative exercise, and
      iv) the assumption that disused and healthy skeletal muscle will have a similar, positive
      response to resistance exercise. The investigators will complete a 2-phase, randomized
      clinical trial at the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB). The protocol includes 7-days
      of unilateral leg disuse (ULD; Phase 1), immediately followed by 14-days of bilateral leg
      rehabilitation (Phase 2). Healthy, middle-aged men (n=40) and (post-menopausal) women (n=40),
      (50-65 y) will be recruited; a neglected research demographic who present with a largely
      youthful phenotype, but are at risk of accelerated disuse atrophy.

      This project will provide a highly powered, detailed phenotypic characterization of the
      continuum of adults most and least susceptible to muscular disuse. Clinical outcomes will be
      supported by RNA deep sequencing and pathway analysis to establish a platform that: i)
      improves scientists' ability to identify higher-risk individuals and ii) provides insight
      into time-sensitive, sex-specific and effective rehabilitation strategies. Findings and
      reposed molecular data from this study, may help identify future therapeutic targets and
      serve as an uncomplicated/comorbidity-free baseline for clinical trials in populations
      experiencing disuse atrophy.
