    
      This study is a single-arm unmasked clinical evaluation study of binocular distance-corrected
      near (40 cm) visual acuity, when the non-dominant eye is targeted for slight myopia, after
      successful bilateral cataract surgery. Subjects will be assessed pre-operatively, operatively
      and at 1 day, 1 month and 3 months post-operatively. Clinical evaluations will include
      administration of a visual disturbance questionnaire (QUVID), patient-reported spectacle
      independence questionnaire (PRSIQ), and a satisfaction questionnaire (IOLSAT), as well as
      measurement of bilateral visual acuity and manifest refraction.
