      people who have symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) with a partial response to
      treatment with a high dose of esomeprazole. This study will look at improvement in heartburn
      symptoms in participants who take vonoprazan compared to esomeprazole.

      The study will enroll approximately 213 patients. All participants will receive esomeprazole
      or esomeprazole placebo-matching capsules (this is a capsule that looks like esomeprazole but
      has no active ingredient) during a 7-week run-in period. Participants will then be randomly
      assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the three treatment groups-which will
      remain undisclosed to the patient and study doctor during the study (unless there is an
      urgent medical need):

        -  Esomeprazole 40 mg

        -  Vonoprazan 20 mg

        -  Vonoprazan 40 mg

      All participants will be asked to take one capsule at the same time each day throughout the
      study. All participants will be asked to record heartburn symptoms in a diary every morning
      upon waking and every evening before going to sleep.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in Europe. The overall time to participate in this
      study is 12 weeks. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic, and will be
      contacted by telephone 1 week after the last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.
