      of asthmatic children.

      The study proposes the validation of Q- KAP by means of the recruiting of 390 parents of
      asthmatic children, recruited in the outpatient clinic of Pediatric Allergology & Pulmonology
      (PAP) of Respiratory Disease Research Center (RDRC) within the Institute of Biomedicine and
      Molecular Immunology (IBIM) of the National Research Council (CNR) of Palermo (RDRC-IBIM
      CNR), Italy.

      Q-KAP will be given to one of the parents during their children medical examination. Q-KAP is
      a multiple answer questionnaire investigating on knowledge, attitudes and practices for what
      concerns Asthma.

      At the end of the recruitment time, data will be stored and analyzed in a dataset.

      The expected result is the identification of a tool able to assess knowledge, attitudes and
      practices of asthmatic children parents, but also the identification of a tool able to
      identify two groups of parents (well-experienced and bad-experienced) to assess if there is a
      link between a low degree of knowledge and a bad control of the disease.
