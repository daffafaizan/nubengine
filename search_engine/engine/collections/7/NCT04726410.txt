      antiplatelet medications. Evidence suggests that patients on antiplatelet medications may
      have worse outcomes following TBI. Current literature has not demonstrated major outcome
      improvements in those patients who receive platelet transfusion. This lack of significant
      benefit may be due to insufficient dosing or due to the poor hemostatic function of standard
      care room temperature platelets. Studying the potential benefits of Cold Stored Platelet
      transfusion in the TBI population will provide needed direct comparison of room temperature
      and cold stored platelet transfusion which is unable to occur in patients with hemorrhagic
      shock, who may require large volumes of red blood cells and plasma concomitantly with
      platelet transfusion.

      By providing Cold Stored Platelets in an urgent release fashion following injury, a
      potentially superior hemostatic agent is given early, closer to the time of injury. The
      current pilot trial was designed to determine the feasibility, efficacy and safety of urgent
      release cold stored platelets as compared to standard care in TBI patients requiring platelet
      transfusion. There are no high-level data which appropriately characterize the urgent release
      use of cold stored platelets out to 14 days or their function over that time period as
      compared to standard room temperature platelets. These results will be able to inform future
      large randomized clinical trials allowing the most appropriate injured population, inclusion
      criteria, and primary outcome to be selected and utilized.
