      receive standard dose BCG, low dose BCG or the combination of low dose BCG and interferon
      alpha in a schedule of "6+3" weekly intravesical instillations. Patients would be closely
      monitored with cystoscopy and urine cytology and intravenous urograms when indicated. Pre-and
      post-instillation urine samples would be collected for cytokine analysis.
