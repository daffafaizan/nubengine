      I. To assess the clinical activity (overall response rate) of tazemetostat in patients with
      recurrent or persistent endometrioid or clear cell ovarian carcinoma, and patients with
      recurrent or persistent endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To examine the nature and degree of toxicity in this patient population treated with this
      regimen.

      II. To examine the progression free survival and overall survival for this patient population
      receiving tazemetostat.

      III. To evaluate BAF250a expression in patient samples as an indicator of ARID1A mutation
      status and correlation with the clinical response to study drug.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Translational Research Integrated Objective: Whether or not the patient has an ARID1A
      mutation. (08/13/2019) II. To examine the correlation between ARID1A mutation and BAF250a
      expression and to identify potential mutations predictive of response in patients with
      preserved BAF250a expression.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive tazemetostat orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every
      28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.
