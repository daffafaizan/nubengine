      impairment in elderly subjects with different clinical and biomarker profiles of Alzheimer's
      disease (AD). Subjects will undergo screen that includes neuropsychological testing and brain
      MRI. This study uses a special type of scan called a PET scan to take pictures of the brain.
      During the PET scan, a special radioactive dye called 18F-THK-5351 is injected into the body.
      18F-THK-5351 sticks to abnormal tangles made of the protein tau. Subjects will have the
      option to have lumbar puncture performed to measure CSF concentrations of biomarkers.
