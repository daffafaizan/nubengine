      affect women's quality of life. Considering the risk of hormone therapy, the behavioral
      therapies have been proposed for the alternative treatment of HF. However, the exercise
      prescription for women with HF is controversial. Previous studies show the inconsistent
      effect of aerobic exercise on HF, and a moderate-to-high intensity exercise seems to
      aggravate HF frequency and severity. Recent studies have shown that static stretching
      exercise could improve HF in middle-aged women, but the related research is quite few, and
      the physiological mechanism as well as predictors for responders who can benefit from
      stretching exercise are still not clear. The knowledge of predictors for responders will
      provide clinicians and clients with HF symptoms to choose static stretching exercise as their
      treatment.
