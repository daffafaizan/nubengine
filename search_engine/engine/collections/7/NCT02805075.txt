      I. Conduct a dose escalation trial to determine the tolerability of the
      fructo-oligosaccharides prebiotic in allogeneic hematopoeitic stem cell transplant (HSCT)
      patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study.

      Patients receive fructooligosaccharides (FOS) orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for 21 days
      starting at 7 days before allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant in the absence of
      disease progression or unexpected toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 100 days.
