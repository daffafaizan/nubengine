    
      Congenital idiopathic clubfoot is the most common congenital deformity in children. It can be
      a major cause of disability for children, as well as an emotional stress for parents. The
      Ponseti method of clubfoot correction, consisting of serial manipulations and casting, is now
      the gold standard of treatment. It has traditionally been described using plaster of Paris
      (POP) above-knee casts; however, recently semi-rigid fiberglass softcast (SRF, 3M Scotchcast)
      has grown in popularity. There are currently no randomized controlled trials to prove its
      efficacy with respect to POP.
