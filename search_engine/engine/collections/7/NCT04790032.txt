      PCI, particularly in acute myocardial infarction and Cangrelor is an intravenous antagonist
      of the P2Y12 receptor characterized by rapid, potent, predictable, and reversible platelet
      inhibition. However, there are limited pharmacodynamic data exploring the effects of this
      drug in the various clinical settings at the approved dosages and with current gold standard
      methods for testing platelet reactivity. More importantly, there are no data on rates and
      predictors of high residual platelet reactivity (HRPR) in patients treated with cangrelor.
      Therefore the present study aims at building up a large prospective registry of
      pharmacodynamic data obtained by light transmittance aggregometry (LTA), multiplate analysis
      and verifynow system in patients undergoing PCI and receiving cangrelor.

      This study is designed as a single-center prospective registry. Investigators at University
      Hospital of Naples Federico II will enroll patients, collect blood samples, perform platelet
      function tests and collect clinical and demographic information.
