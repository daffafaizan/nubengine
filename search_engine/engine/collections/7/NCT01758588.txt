      with PEGINTRON and the other in which subjects are closely followed and get best supportive
      care until disease progression (the presently accepted standard approach for early disease).
      Subjects on the observation arm will be carefully monitored for clinical or laboratory
      progression of disease during scheduled study visits. However, they will not be treated with
      an active drug like Interferon alfa or others such as Hydroxyurea, Revlimid, Thalidomide,
      Pomalidomide, and the newly approved JAK2 (Janus Kinase 2) inhibitor Ruxolitinib (Jakafi). If
      their disease progresses, they will be eligible for cross-over into the treatment arm with
      PEGINTRON. Subjects randomized to the treatment arm will receive PEGINTRON once weekly.
