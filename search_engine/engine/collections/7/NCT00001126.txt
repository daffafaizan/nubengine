      placebo (an inactive substance). Neither you nor your doctor will know which your child is
      receiving. Your child will undergo a total of 6 bronchoscopic procedures, which involves
      placing a tube down your child's throat so that the warts can be seen and treated. The warts
      will be removed by laser or other procedures and the study drug injected. Study drug will be
      injected at the sites of all newly removed warts and warts which were removed during earlier
      study visits. This procedure will be performed every other week. Blood and urine tests will
      also be performed at this time. Your child will be under general anesthesia during each
      procedure and will be in the surgery unit for about 6 to 8 hours. Your child will also have
      to be seen by the doctor 2 days after the procedure. Your child will be followed for a total
      of 5 years to make sure he/she develops normally and to monitor any side effects of
      cidofovir. Follow-up visits will take place at Months 3, 6, and then once every 6 months
      through Year 5. If necessary, laser or other procedures will be performed at these visits to
      remove any warts.
