      detected at advanced stages. The standard treatment is cytoreductive surgery with removal of
      macroscopic tumor, and intravenous chemotherapy. Three randomized trials observed survival
      gain for ovarian cancer patients that received intraperitoneal chemotherapy after the optimal
      cytoreduction, however catheter-related complications made the procedure not feasible. A
      "one-time" hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy, HIPEC, is an established for peritoneal
      carcinosis in colorectal cancer, and recently two phase III randomised clinical studies
      observe survival gain also for ovarian cancer patients after surgery with HIPEC.

      Here the investigators, plan to investigate the HIPEC procedure following cytoreductive
      surgery for recurrent ovarian cancer, a progressed disease without any standard treatment
      established.
