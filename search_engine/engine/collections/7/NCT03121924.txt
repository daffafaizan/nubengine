      between the oocyte and the granulosa cells is needed for a normal follicular development and
      oocyte competence.

      There are conflicting results on the effect of pre-incubation time in ICSI.

      It is not clear the proper time to denudate the oocyte from the somatic cells prior to ICSI,
      and some authors describe a negative impact of the premature cummulus removal on the ICSI
      results.

      The aim of this study is to investigate wheter a preincubation time between oocyte retireval
      and injection has any effect on the ICSI ( intracytoplasmatic sperm injection) results .
