      ovarian cancer cancer. All patient participants will complete two quality of life (QOL)
      questionnaires and a cost-diary documenting their health care experience at time of consent
      and every 12 weeks thereafter. Consenting care givers will also be asked to complete two
      questionnaires to asses the impact of structured palliative care on them every 12 weeks.

      Patients will be assigned to two arms randomly: 1) usual care or 2) structured palliative
      care. The primary endpoint is quality of life. A two-sided Chi-square test will be used to
      compare the proportion of patients who have improved quality of life after treatment between
      control arm and intervention arm. The average value of multiple scores after treatment will
      be used to compare with the baseline score before treatment for each question in the standard
      questionnaire.
