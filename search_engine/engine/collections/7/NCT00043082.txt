        -  Compare overall survival of patients with platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian
           epithelial or primary peritoneal cancer treated with carboplatin with or without
           pegylated doxorubicin HCl liposome.

        -  Compare progression-free survival, confirmed complete response rates, and time to
           treatment failure in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the toxicity of these regimens in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      disease measurability (elevated CA 125 only vs nonmeasurable disease only with or without
      elevated CA 125 vs measurable disease), number of disease sites (2 or fewer vs 3 or more),
      and serous tumor histology (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive carboplatin IV over 15 minutes and pegylated doxorubicin HCl
           liposome IV over 1 hour on day 1.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive carboplatin IV as in arm I. Treatment in both arms repeats
           every 4 weeks for a total of 15 courses in the absence of disease progression or
           unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 4 weeks, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually for 7 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 900 patients will be accrued for this study within 4 years.
