      infected children. Secondary influenza infection will then be examined among members of the
      child's household and effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions to decrease secondary
      infection will be assessed. The pediatric influenza-infected index case will be identified by
      rapid influenza testing and their household will then be enrolled and randomized to one of
      three study arms: control, hand washing (Intervention 1), and hand washing and mask use
      (Intervention 2). Following enrollment, at days 0, 3 and 7, all household participants will
      be tested: the index case will be assessed for influenza viral shedding and household members
      will be assessed for secondary influenza infection. This study is being conducted at Queen
      Sirikit Institute for Child Health in Bangkok.
