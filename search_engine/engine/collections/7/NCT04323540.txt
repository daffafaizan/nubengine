      peri-implantitis defects.

      More specifically, the control group will be a "pure" reconstructive approach (xenograft bone
      graft granules and reservable collagen membrane, BioOss and BioGide, Geistlich, Wolhusen).
      This is in accordance with gold standard practices of reconstructive therapy of peri-implant
      defects.

      The test group will be treated with the same approach and materials, with the exception of an
      autologous sub-epithelial connective tissue palatal graft, sutured beneath the flap, which
      will be used in addition to the grafting materials. The graft will be harvested from the
      homolateral palate (molar region).

      Outcomes will include CAL, clinical attachment level (primary outcome), PD or probing depth,
      MR or mucosal recession, defect resolution (composite outcome made up of simultaneous absence
      of PD>5 mm, BOP/SUP and bone level changes >0.5 mm, PI, BoP or bleeding upon probing,
      suppuration SUP on probing, SUP on palpation, patient-reported outcome measures including an
      aesthetic self-evaluation.

      The measures will be recorded at baseline, 6-, 12-, 18- and 24 months. Radiographic bone
      levels will be compared with 2 week image at 12 and 24 months
