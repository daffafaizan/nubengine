      with the risk to have serious psychological consequences.

      During a per-operative awakening, one of the first reflex of the patient is to move, but this
      is often not possible due to the use of neuromuscular blocking agents during the surgical
      procedure.

      It is possible to detect a movement intention by analyzing the motor cortex EEG signal in
      awake volunteers. The same signal is present during light, non-painful median nerve
      stimulation.

      The aim of this study is to determine wether this EEG signal can still be detected during
      light sedation by propofol, a drug commonly used during anesthesia. The investigators will
      include healthy male volunteers, who will make real movements, imagine a movement and have
      median nerve stimulations before and during a propofol infusion. The propofol will be infused
      according to a target controlled infusion with a effect-site concentration of 0.5 µg/mL and
      1.0 µg/mL. Primary outcome is the detectability of event related desynchronization and event
      related synchronization in the EEG signal in the presence of propofol compared to the
      recordings without propofol
