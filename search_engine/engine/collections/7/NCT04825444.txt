      the results showed that there is only a single tumor on either side of the breast. The
      computer tomography photoacoustic breast imaging system was used to perform breast
      examination again. By comparing ultrasound and photoacoustic vascular imaging, the vascular
      imaging of the computer tomography photoacoustic breast imaging system developed by Union
      Photoacoustic technologies Co., Ltd was evaluated.

      This test does not evaluate the diagnosis or treatment performance of two imaging modalities.
      It only compares the vascular imaging of two different imaging systems. Therefore, the
      evaluation index of this experiment is the percentage of blood vessel pixel number in the
      same region of interest (ROI) to the total pixel number in ROI. By comparing the percentages
      of blood vessel pixel number to the total pixel number in the same ROI in ultrasound and
      computerized tomography photoacoustic breast imaging system, the vascular imaging of the
      computerized tomography photoacoustic breast imaging system is evaluated.
