      monoclonal antibody antagonist to CD40LG. Approximately 54 adults with ALS will be enrolled
      into the study in the United States at up to 12 ALS treatment sites.

      Four ascending doses of AT-1501 will be administered as an IV infusion to sequentially
      enrolling cohorts. Each participant will receive 6 bi-weekly (every other week) infusions of
      AT-1501 over an 11-week period.

      The study is estimated to take 19 weeks for participants.
