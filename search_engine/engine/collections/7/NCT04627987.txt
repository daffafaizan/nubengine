      UK and is set to nearly double by 2050. Aortic Stenosis (AS) is the most common VHD in the
      UK, affecting 3% of those over 75 with more than 11,000 people requiring aortic valve
      replacement (AVR) in the UK each year (>100,000 world-wide). Current guidelines recommend AVR
      to improve survival and symptom status when AS symptoms emerge or there is a reduction in
      left ventricle (LV) function (1), but years of excessive haemodynamic load result in an "AS
      cardiomyopathy" with LV hypertrophy, remodelling, diffuse and focal scar. The investigators,
      and others, have shown that these changes lead to an excess in morbidity and mortality, but
      the mechanisms of increased risk is unclear.

      Patients undergoing aortic valve replacement for severe aortic stenosis have a shorter life
      expectancy compared with the general population (2). Years of excessive haemodynamic load
      result in an "AS cardiomyopathy" with LV hypertrophy, remodelling, diffuse and focal scar.
      The investigators and others have shown that these changes to the heart muscle are associated
      with poor outcome. But the mechanism of how heart muscle damage leads to excess mortality is
      poorly understood.

      The proposed study will enhance our understanding of the residual risk after AVR and reveal
      the modes and substrate of mortality. Heart failure and heart rhythm disturbances
      (arrhythmias) are likely downstream effects of heart muscle damage, but without understanding
      the mode of death (heart failure, arrhythmia or other), the investigators are unable to
      target therapeutic strategies to improve outcomes.
