      (antiepileptic drugs) on fetal malformations and intellectual development in children after
      birth, it has been reported that VPA causes neonatal malformations and decreases intelligence
      of children in a dose dependent manner, whereas such a risk is low in LTG (Hernandez-Díaz et
      al., 2012; Meador et al., 2013). It has also been reported that LTG as adjunctive therapy
      with VPA is effective in inhibiting seizures in patients with poorly controlled seizures, and
      adverse events under VPA monotherapy can be relieved by subsequently reducing VPA dose after
      LTG is combined (Sale et al., 2005; Jozwiak et al., 2000; Morris et al, 2004; Buchanan,
      1996). Thus, by considering the benefits of replacing VPA by LTG in childbearing women, we
      will examine whether VPA dose can be reduced by introducing LTG in Japanese female epilepsy
      patients under VPA monotherapy (aged ≥ 15 years, pre-menopausal).

      STUDY DESIGN Single arm, multicenter, and open-label study TIME FRAME

        -  Screening(Retrospective review of medical records for 12 weeks)

        -  LTG escalation phase (8-18 weeks)

        -  VPA reduction phase (3-16 weeks)

        -  LTG & VPA maintenance phase (12 weeks)

        -  Follow up (1-4 weeks) PRIMARY OBJECTIVE To examine whether the VPA dose can be reduced
           by additional administration of LTG (up to 200 mg/d if there are no safety concerns) in
           Japanese pre-menopausal female epilepsy patients aged 15 years or older, whose seizures
           are well controlled by VPA monotherapy (fixed maintenance dose of 400-1200 mg/d).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES

        -  To investigate the steady state concentration of LTG immediately before VPA dose
           reduction, at the time of VPA dose reduction, and during the LTG&VPA maintenance phase.

        -  To investigate the safety and tolerability associated with additional administration of
           LTG followed by dose reduction of VPA.
