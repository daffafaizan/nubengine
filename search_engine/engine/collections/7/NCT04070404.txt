    
      Factors, that are associated with compromised preoxygenation will be determined during our
      study. Pulse oximetry data and end-tidal oxygen concentration values will be evaluated in
      association with risk factors for insufficient anaesthesia face mask seal, difficult
      intubation, preoxygenation techniques used, comorbidities, physical status, hemodynamic and
      laboratory measures.

      Parameters analysed:

        -  Preoperative: medical history, physical examination, laboratory findings, anthropometric
           data

        -  Intraoperative: preoxygenation equipment and method used (defined by anaesthesiologist
           in charge of the case), oxygenation and haemodynamic values recorded during
           preoxygenation and induction of anaesthesia, intraoperative laboratory values (if
           obtained)
