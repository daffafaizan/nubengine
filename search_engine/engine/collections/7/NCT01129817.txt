      proposed by several authors that NSCLBP represents a vicious cycle associated with different
      combinations of maladaptive; cognitive (negative beliefs, fear avoidance behaviours,
      catastrophising, depression, stress, lack of pacing and coping), physical (pain provocative
      postures, movement patterns and pain behaviours) and lifestyle (inactivity, rest) behaviours
      that act to promote pain and disability. However a recent systematic review suggests that
      this change in paradigm and our new understanding of NSCLBP has not resulted in clinical
      trials utilizing multidimensional classification systems or targeted interventions based on
      the underlying mechanisms. line with this shift in paradigm a novel multidimensional
      classification system has been developed incorporating the biopsychosocial model, which
      subgroups patients based on their presentation of. with matched interventions directed at the
      maladaptive cognitive, physical and lifestyle behaviours associated with the disorder.
