      intravenous anticoagulant and has been recommended for treatment of acute coronary syndromes
      with percutaneous coronary intervention according to American and European guidelines.On
      concerns of risk of bleeding and thrombosis,bivalirudin shows significant advantages over
      traditional glycoprotein inhibitors(GPI).However,the research about the application of
      bivalirudin for patients at high-risk of stroke and bleeding with non-valvular atrial
      fibrillation is still at blank stage.Percutaneous left atrial appendage occlusion is nowadays
      an effective alternative for stroke prevention and its targeted population is featured as
      CHA2DS2 score≥2 and/or HAS-BLED score≥3.The purpose of this multi-center trial is to evaluate
      the safety and peri-procedual efficacy of bivalirudin for patients at high-risk atrial
      fibrillation patients undergoing percutaneous left atrial appendage occlusion.
