    
      This is a pilot study that proposes to assess the feasibility of using regadenoson (Lexiscan,
      Astellas), a recently FDA approved A2A receptor agonist, as the stress perfusion agent in
      cardiac MRI perfusion examinations. While regadenoson has been approved by the FDA, it has
      not been approved for the specific indications of use 1) during the simultaneous intravenous
      administration of a gadolinium-based contrast agent, or 2) during magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI).

      Because this agent can be given intravenously in a single 400 microgram bolus, rather than in
      an infusion, this agent may be easier to administer than adenosine during an MRI examination.

      The objectives for this pilot study are: 1) To demonstrate the feasibility of using
      regadenoson during cardiac perfusion MRI to visualize known regions of myocardial ischemia as
      demonstrated on SPECT-MPI and 2) To describe a cardiac perfusion MRI protocol using
      regadenoson that would have the potential to be used clinically.
