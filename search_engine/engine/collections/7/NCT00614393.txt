    
      Dalotuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) that targets the insulin-like growth
      factor type 1 receptor-1 (IGF-1R). Dalotuzumab may act through inhibition of insulin-like
      growth factor-1 (IGF-1)-mediated cell signaling to cause reductions in tumor growth and
      spread antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity.

      In preclinical studies, dalotuzumab improved the activity of an anti-epidermal growth factor
      receptor (EGFR) mAb and the activity of erlotinib, a small molecule inhibitor of EGFR.

      All eligible participants will receive cetuximab 400 mg/m^2 infusion over 120 minutes
      followed by weekly infusions of cetuximab 250 mg/m^2 over 60-120 minutes along with
      irinotecan infusion over 30-90 minutes. Dosage of irinotecan will be the same as most recent
      pre-study therapy. Participants will then be assigned to one of three treatment double-blind
      arms.
