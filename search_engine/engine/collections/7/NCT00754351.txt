      breast cancer. Administered every two weeks, this combination has a favorable toxicity
      profile, and promising activity in > 1st line treatment for metastatic breast cancer.
      Recently, initial therapy of metastatic breast cancer with paclitaxel plus bevacizumab
      demonstrated prolonged progression-free survival, as compared with paclitaxel alone. This
      study will evaluate the addition of bevacizumab to a biweekly regimen of docetaxel and
      gemcitabine in the salvage therapy for metastatic breast cancer.
