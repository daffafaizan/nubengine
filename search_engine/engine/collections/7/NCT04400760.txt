      treatment for diabetes, especially in the cardiovascular arena. The standard prescribed
      dosages of dapagliflozin will be employed in the research study (5 or 10 mg once daily). The
      reason the study team is interested in performing this study in our local setting is that if
      dapagliflozin does show a beneficial effect with either diabetic control or an antiplatelet
      effect, the team can then inform the Ministry of Health to acquire these relatively expensive
      medications in place of the older, less effective anti-diabetic drugs. The team has to
      demonstrate that they work effectively and safely in our population before approaching
      regulatory bodies with a robust recommendation that they are made available in the public
      healthcare sector. The patients that are to be selected will be relatively controlled on
      their current regimen, and thus not "miss out" on these medications after the study has been
      concluded as they are all available on the chronic disease assistance program (CDAP) such as
      metformin, gliclazide and insulin therapies. The study will aim to determine if dapagliflozin
      does demonstrate other latent antiplatelet effects that can potentially affect the
      cardiovascular/hematologic systems that have not investigated before.
