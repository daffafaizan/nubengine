      will include 75 patients who receive intraoperative Exparel® injections at the incision
      locations in addition to our standard multimodality post-operative analgesia. The control arm
      will include 75 patients who meet inclusion criteria but receive standard 0.25% bupivacaine
      and our standard multimodality post-operative analgesia. Patients will be randomized by
      REDCap™ database system in collaboration with Cleveland Clinic Pharmacy to receive either
      Exparel® or the control medication (0.25% Bupivacaine). Consent from patients will be
      obtained and documented by a dedicated research personnel prior to any enrollment.
