      They will also be asked to nominate their primary caregiver, who will also be invited to take
      part in the study. We will give patients and caregivers 24 hours to decide whether they want
      to take part or not. If they do decide to take part, all research participants will be
      involved in the study on four consecutive occasions before, during and after their treatment.
      These four time points will be the following:

        -  before first fraction of RT

        -  1st week of RT (1st-5th faction)

        -  2nd week of RT (6th-10th fraction)

        -  1 month after the last fraction of RT The principal researcher, i.e. Saengrawee
           Thanthong, will endeavour to collect questionnaires in the hospital. If participants
           cannot come to the hospital to receive radiotherapy or for their follow up appointment
           and complete the questionnaire, then the principal researcher will call them and offer
           to complete the questionnaires over the phone so as to minimise missing data due to
           attrition.
