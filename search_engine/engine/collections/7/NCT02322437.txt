    
      This study aims to evaluate whether psychiatric home treatment is an effective and efficient
      alternative to acute inpatient care in mental hospitals. A one-year prevalence cohort of
      psychiatric patients in need of hospitalization are randomly assigned to either treatment at
      inpatient wards (treatment as usual) or a new care model with the additional option of
      treating patients at their homes by mobile care teams. The primary focus is on checking
      whether optional home treatment for crisis intervention leads to a reduction of inpatient
      days during a two-year follow-up period. In addition, the two service models will be compared
      regarding treatment cost and outcomes as well as satisfaction of patients and their relatives
      with psychiatric care.

      Furthermore, a sub-cohort of randomly chosen patients from the prevalence-cohort will be
      examined by a highly trained clinical assessor to test and verify the diagnoses (SCID-I and
      SCID-II) and the clinical ratings (HoNOS) made by the staff members of the mental hospital
      under routine everyday conditions.
