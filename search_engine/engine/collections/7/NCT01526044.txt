      locally developed glucose treatment protocol. The use of a continuous glucose monitoring in
      critically ill patients could have the following advantages:

        -  Better insight in the alterations of the blood glucose levels

        -  Early detection of hypoglycemia's or hyperglycaemia's, and subsequently more stable
           glycemic levels.

        -  Fewer blood samples

        -  Decreased workload for the nursing staff

      In this study, patients will be randomized in: 1. The Freestyle group or 2. The AccuChek
      Group.

      Patients in both groups will receive a Freestyle Navigator device, which will stay on the
      patient up to 5 days, or until discharge from the ICU.

      The medical treatment of both study groups will be equal, except for the frequency of the
      glucose level measurements and the resulting adjustments according to the treatment protocol.
      In the Freestyle group extra glucose level measurements will be made in response to alarms
      from the device.

      In both groups, every 4 hours blood glucose values will be obtained using a blood gas
      analyzer (BGA). When a control measurement by BGA results in a glucose level of <2.2 or >25
      mmol/l, the value will be transmitted to the Patient Data Management System (PDMS) and gives
      an alarm. Otherwise, the value will be blinded in the PDMS.

      Freestyle Navigator data will be downloaded from the device. Blood glucose values obtained in
      the course of usual care will be compared with time-matched Freestyle Navigator values to
      assess device accuracy.
