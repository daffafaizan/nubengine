    
      This is a prospective study comparing VISIONAIRE™ to standard TKA instrumentation. The
      objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of TKA using VISIONAIRE™ when
      compared with standard instrumentation, including device survival, improvement in function
      and implant alignment after TKA. This study will also document any device-related, surgical
      complications and/or adverse radiographic observations.

      In contrast with the control group clinical outcomes following TKA completed with VISIONAIRE™
      have yet to be assessed. The current investigation will determine if there is any difference
      in TKA outcomes when VISIONAIRE™ patient matched technology is utilized versus standard
      instrumentation. All patients meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria specified in this
      protocol will be asked to participate in the study. If the patient consents to participate,
      they will be enrolled in the study and randomized to one of the two study arms. Patients
      requiring TKA will be implanted with Legion, Genesis II or Journey BCS (Smith & Nephew) total
      knee implant systems. Standard instrumentation will be used to assist the surgeon in placing
      the implant in the control group. In the VISIONAIRE™ group, standard instrumentation will not
      be used in the surgery. Patients randomized to the VISIONAIRE™ arm will have an MRI
      preoperatively that will be used to create the customized cutting blocks. All patients will
      have an x-ray at each postoperative interval.
