      days prior to Study Entry (ie, prior to Check-in [Day -1]). Subjects will be confined at the
      Clinical Research Unit (CRU) from Check in (Day -1) until Discharge Criteria have been met
      (as early as Day 6 and as late as Day 11). In this study design, physical examinations,
      electrocardiograms (ECGs), vital signs, How do you feel? (HDYF?) Inquiries, and clinical
      laboratory evaluations will be performed at Screening, at specified times during the study,
      and/or at Clinic Discharge. All AEs, whether volunteered, elicited, or noted on physical
      examination, will be recorded throughout the study (ie, from dosing on Day 1 until Clinic
      Discharge [Day 11]).
