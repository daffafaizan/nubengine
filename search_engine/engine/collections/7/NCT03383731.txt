      membrane insertion and intraocular sterilized air tamponade) to assess its effectiveness and
      safety on the prognosis of macular hole retinal detachment secondary to high myopia, and also
      compares this new type of surgery with the current commonly used surgery (vitrectomy combined
      with internal limiting membrane peeling + silicone oil infusion).
