      gastric cancer is lower than 10%. An effective screening method to improve the detection rate
      is urgently needed. Optical Enhancement (OE) mode is an endoscopic mode that uses the
      principle of grating for electronic staining, which provides a clear picture of the
      submucosal and superficial mucosal vascular structures. The OE1 mode provides enhanced images
      of the gastric Gland tube and blood vessels, as well as magnification. The OE2 mode is used
      to identify small chromatic aberrations and to visualize superficial structures in the
      gastric mucosa. So we designed this randomized controlled trial to discuss effectiveness of
      OE in the diagnosis of early gastric cancer and we hope to find an effective method to
      improve the detection rate of early gastric cancer in China.
