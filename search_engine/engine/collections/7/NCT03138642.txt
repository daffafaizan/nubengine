      patients receive extended resection to primary tumor and post-surgery RT. The patients are
      prescribed a EQD2 of 65-70Gy to CTV1 (high-risk regions including tumor bed), 50-55Gy to
      CTV2(low-risk regions) using Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). The Prophylactic
      irradiation to upper neck is is decided by radiation physicians and given a EQD2 of 70-77Gy
      to CTVnd (clinically negative lymph nodes), 50-55Gy to CTVn2ï¼ˆneck nodal regions). If there is
      residual tumor, a EQD2 of 70-77Gy is prescribed to GTV. Adjuvant chemotherapy (for example,
      Temozolomide) is prescribed or not according the consideration of radiation physicians during
