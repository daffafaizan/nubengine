    
      This is a randomised, double blind, cross over clinical study in healthy human volunteers,
      including pharmacokinetic (PK) sampling and laser Doppler assessment of local blood flow in a
      subset of up to 6 subjects per cohort, to assess the efficacy and safety of three different
      topical analgesics (DCF100, TIB200 and SPR300) versus placebo and active control(s) in a
      model of UV-induced inflammatory pain. The study will consist of 3 cohorts of subjects (n=20
      subjects per cohort). Subjects of each cohort will receive test and reference products (no
      reference product for Cohort 3) of one investigational medicinal product (IMP) and a placebo.

      Test Products:

      Cohort 1: Ibuprofen, TIB200 gel (10%, w/w) Cohort 2: Diclofenac, DCF100 gel (2% or 4%, w/w)
      Cohort 3: Methyl-salicylate and Menthol, SPR300 gel (15%:7%, w/w; ratio of Methylsalicylate
      to Menthol)

      Reference Products:

      Cohort 1: Ibuprofen, Nurofen Max Strength gel (10%, w/w), Ibuprofen, Nurofen, oral tablet
      (400 mg) Cohort 2: Voltaren Emulgel (2%), Voltarol oral tablet (50 mg)

      Placebo:

      All Cohorts:Test product matching vehicle gel.

      Pharmacodynamic tests and PK blood draws will be performed at: pre-dose, 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours
      post dose for all treatment cohorts and treatment days (PK blood sampling in up to 6 subjects
      per cohort only).

      Safety will be evaluated by the incidence of local and systemic treatment-emergent adverse
      events (TEAEs) reported after each treatment. Safety assessments will also include vital
      signs, 12-Lead Electrocardiograms (ECGs), laboratory tests and a physical examination at
      Screening and the Follow-up visit.
