    
      Before randomization phase, one lead-in subject (N = 300 patients) will be enrolled to
      perform safety surveillance of standard-dose tegoprazan (50 mg for 6 months) and to ensure
      the safety of tegoprazan (safety surveillance phase). Data on lead-in subjects will not be
      included in the data set used for primary analyses.

      The safety of tegoprazan will be estimated SIAEs(Special Interest Adverse Events) as follows;
      Composite Event

        1. liver function abnormalities

        2. hypergastrinemia, or

        3. enteric infection

      Definitions

        -  liver function abnormality: defined as AST or ALT>3Ã— upper limit of normal or two
           consecutive measurements of total bilirubin >2 x upper limit of normal

        -  hypergastrinemia

        -  enteric infection including C.difficile infection

      If there are any new tegoprazan-related findings, it will be considered in the estimation.

      If there is no safety concern during safety surveillance phase, investigator-driven,
      randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled, clinical trial (N = 3,000
      patients) will be subsequently performed (randomization phase).
