    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the progression free survival (PFS) of subjects with recurrent
      platinum-resistant ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer receiving gemcitabine
      (gemcitabine hydrochloride) in combination with AZD 1775 (MK-1775 [WEE1 inhibitor MK-1775])
      compared to subjects receiving gemcitabine in combination with placebo.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the objective response by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
      (RECIST) 1.1 of patients receiving gemcitabine combined with AZD 1775 (MK-1775) compared to
      patients receiving gemcitabine in combination with placebo.

      II. To evaluate the Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup (GCIG) cancer antigen (CA)125 response rate
      of patients receiving gemcitabine combined with AZD 1775 (MK-1775) compared to patients
      receiving gemcitabine in combination with placebo.

      III. To evaluate the overall survival of patients (max 1-year [yr] follow-up) receiving
      gemcitabine combined with AZD 1775 (MK-1775) compared to patients receiving gemcitabine in
      combination with placebo.

      IV. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the combination of gemcitabine combined with
      AZD 1775 (MK-1775) in patients with recurrent, platinum-resistant ovarian, fallopian tube or
      primary peritoneal cancer.

      V. To evaluate tumor protein p53 (TP53) mutations (presence of mutation and type of mutation)
      as potential predictive factors of benefit (defined as response or progression-free survival
      [PFS] prolongation) to AZD 1775 (MK-1775) and gemcitabine treatment.

      VI. To evaluate p53 protein expression by immunohistochemistry as potential predictive
      factors of benefit (defined as response or PFS prolongation) to AZD 1775 (MK-1775) and
      gemcitabine treatment.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate patient reported outcomes using Patient-Reported Outcomes (PRO)-Common
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE).

      II. To evaluate the concordance of TP53 mutations in the tumor specimen and TP53 mutations
      determined by tagged-amplicon deep sequencing (Tam-Seq) in circulating tumor DNA.

      III. To correlate the levels circulating DNA TP53 mutations by Tam-Seq with response.

      IV. Validation of phosphorylated-cyclin-dependent cycle 2 (pCDC2) and gamma-H2A histone
      family, member X (H2AX) in skin and tumor tissue as a pharmacodynamic marker of therapy.

      V. To correlate changes in pCDC2 and gamma-H2AX with survival outcomes and response rate.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive WEE1 inhibitor MK-1775 orally (PO) on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16 and
      gemcitabine hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16 and gemcitabine
      hydrochloride as patients in Arm I. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6-8 weeks (after the
      30-37 day safety visit) for up to 1 year.
