      levels improves health outcomes in non-diabetic participants. All participants will receive a
      continuous flash glucose monitor (consisting of an adhesive patch sensor and a handheld
      reader device) to wear for 14 days. Participants will be randomized into one of 2 groups:
      those receiving biofeedback (the ability to visualize their glucose levels via the handheld
      device), and the control group (receiving no biofeedback because the handheld device monitor
      will be occluded with black tape). Participants' objective and self-report health metrics
      will be measured before and after the 14-day intervention. The goal is to examine whether the
      biofeedback condition influences any daily activities or physiological measurements compared
      to the control condition, as a direct result of self-monitoring glucose levels.
