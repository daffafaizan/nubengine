    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the efficacy of monoclonal antibody SGN-30 in combination with cyclophosphamide,
      doxorubicin hydrochloride, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) in patients with newly
      diagnosed anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL).

      II. Determine the safety of combining monoclonal antibody SGN-30 with CHOP chemotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine whether monoclonal antibody SGN-30 can induce apoptosis of ALCL cells in vivo.

      II. Determine the response duration in patients treated with this regimen.

      III. Correlate response with pretreatment serum CD30 levels.

      IV. Determine response to single-agent monoclonal antibody SGN-30.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to anaplastic large
      cell kinase (ALK) status (positive vs negative).

      Monoclonal antibody SGN-30 monotherapy: Patients receive monoclonal antibody SGN-30 IV over 2
      hours once weekly for 3 weeks.

      Monoclonal antibody SGN-30 and CHOP chemotherapy: Beginning 1 week after completion of
      monoclonal antibody SGN-30 monotherapy, patients receive monoclonal antibody SGN-30 IV over 2
      hours on day 1 and CHOP chemotherapy comprising cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour, doxorubicin
      hydrochloride IV over 15 minutes, and vincristine IV over 15 minutes on day 1 and oral
      prednisone once daily on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6-8 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for at least 5 years.
