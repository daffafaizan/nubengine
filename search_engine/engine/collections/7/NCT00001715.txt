      and participates in the training of hematology fellows. Patients with a broad range of
      hematologic disorders must be available in order for the senior staff of the Service to
      maintain clinical expertise and to provide the breadth of experience necessary for the
      fellowship program. The purpose of this protocol is to meet these needs by allowing the
      Hematology Service to see patients with a spectrum of hematologic diseases not studied on
      existing research protocols at the NIH. These patients will be evaluated over the course of
      several outpatient visits and returned to the care of their referring physicians.
