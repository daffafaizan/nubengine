      examination would be enrolled, consecutively. FFR measurement would be required at the
      baseline and at the end of index PCI procedure. PCI procedure would be performed upon local
      routine. Any available 2nd generation DES could be used. Informed consent should be obtained
      and protocol should be approved by each collaborator's institutional review board (IRB).
      Web-based electronic-case record form (CRF) system will be used for collecting data. All data
      will be handled and analyzed by blind fashion at independent core lab. Patient will be
      followed-up at each collaborator's hospital at least 2 year after index procedure. Any
      adverse event will be reported and addressed immediately by appropriate medical treatment to
      protect patient.
