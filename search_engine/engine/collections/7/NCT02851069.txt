      with hepatitis C virus (HCV), receiving the interferon-free ABBVIE REGIMEN with or without
      RBV are offered the opportunity to participate in this study during a routine clinical visit
      at the participating sites at the discretion of the physician and is made independently from
      this observational study and preceded the decision to offer the participant the opportunity
      to participate in this study.

      After written informed consent is obtained, demographics, HCV disease characteristics,
      co-morbidities, co-medication, treatment details, and laboratory assessments as recorded in
      the participant's medical records (source documentation) are documented in the electronic
      case report form (eCRF). Participants are observed for the duration of the ABBVIE REGIMEN
      therapy and for up to 24 weeks after treatment completion. No patient identifiable
      information was captured; a unique participant number was automatically allocated by the web
      based system once the investigator or designee created a new participant file.

      This study focuses on collecting real world data. Follow-up visits, treatment, procedures and
      diagnostic methods follow physicians' routine clinical practice. The observational study
      period entailed the following data collection schemes:

        -  12-week treatment regimen: four visits plus two interim data collection windows

        -  24-week treatment regimen: four visits plus three interim data collection windows This
           schedule was based on the anticipated regular follow-up for patients undergoing
           treatment for CHC.
