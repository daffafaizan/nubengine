      with tourniquet use for total knee arthroplasty. This activation was compared in a group of
      patient scheduled for spinal anesthesia and for sevoflurane anesthesia This activation was
      assessed by plasma myeloperoxidase and elastase measurements in four consecutive blood
      samples during and after surgery (before surgical incision and 1, 3, 24 hours following
      tourniquet release.
