      formula lipids provide about 55% of energy for the infant and represent as such a major
      nutrient for the baby. The vast majority of the lipids in human milk is composed of
      triacylglycerols (98% of total lipids) and the remainder percent are phospholipids.
      Triglycerides are composed of the glycerol backbone to which three fatty acids are bound. In
      human milk, palmitate (16:0) is the major long chain saturated fatty acid representing 22% to
      26% of total fatty acids, esterified to approximately 70% in sn-2 position on the glycerol
      backbone. Unsaturated fatty acids such as oleic acid (18:1) and linoleic acid (18:2n-6) are
      preferentially esterified at the 1 and 3 position. In infant formulas the major source of
      palmitic acid is palm oil or palm olein where palmitate is, however, preferentially in the
      external 1,3 positions, and mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids are usually esterified at
      the 2-position of the triacylgycerol.

      The aim of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of infant formula containing 40%
      and 50%, respectively, of palmitic acid in sn-2 position.
