      in some participants with ESRD. These proteins are called alloantibodies and are made by the
      body to react with other proteins on cells of transplanted organs called human leukocyte
      antigen (HLA) proteins. When a participant has these antibodies, they are referred to as
      HLA-presensitized. Often the presence of these antibodies, categorized by a method called the
      panel reactive antibody (PRA), can make a person ineligible to receive a transplant or
      experience very long wait times on the kidney transplant waiting list. Therefore the need to
      reduce the antibodies is significant for the successful treatment of ESRD. This study will
      treat ESRD participants for 6 months with LY2127399 and measure PRA levels for a total of 18
      months.
