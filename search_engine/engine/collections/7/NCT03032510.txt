    
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of
      eravacycline compared to ertapenem in treating participants with complicated urinary tract
      infections (cUTI).

      This is a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, multicenter, prospective study to
      assess the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of eravacycline compared with ertapenem in
      the treatment of cUTI.

      Randomization will be stratified based on two criteria: (1) by primary site of infection
      (pyelonephritis and normal urinary tract anatomy vs all other diagnoses) and (2) by the
      receipt of a single dose of effective non-study antibiotics for the acute cUTI within 72
      hours prior to randomization. An enrollment cap of approximately 50% is planned for subjects
      with pyelonephritis with normal urinary tract anatomy. Also, an enrollment cap of
      approximately 20% is planned for subjects who have received a single dose of non-study
      antibiotics for the acute cUTI within 72 hours prior to randomization.

      In this study subjects will be enrolled and randomized to one of two treatment arms in a 1:1
      ratio: (i) eravacycline intravenously (IV) / levofloxacin (PO), or (ii) ertapenem (IV) /
      levofloxacin (PO).
