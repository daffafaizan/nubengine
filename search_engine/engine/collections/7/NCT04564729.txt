    
      This study will be a randomized controlled trial for primary, unilateral total knee
      arthroplasty (TKA) patients at Brigham and Women's Faulkner Hospital to determine the impact
      of using a SDA on the number of leftover opioid pills on postoperative day 30 and average NRS
      pain score on postoperative day 7.

      The SDA includes factual information about the World Health Organization pain ladder, the
      0-10 NRS pain scale, pharmacologic pain management options, opioid medication benefits and
      risks and predicted post-discharge opioid requirements based on previous modeling in TKA
      patients. The SDA has been developed by the principal investigator solely for the purpose of
      this study.

      Patients will be enrolled on postoperative day 0 or 1 and randomized to intervention or
      control groups. The intervention group will view the SDA slides on the study iPad. SDA
      viewing will be guided by the research assistant, who will read a pre-written script as each
      slide is viewed. Following the guided viewing of the SDA, subjects in the intervention group
      will have the opportunity to ask questions to the research assistant to confirm their
      comprehension of the presented facts. The control group will receive no intervention and will
      receive standard of care and standard discharge prescriptions. The intervention group
      subjects will choose the number of opioid pills they wish to include in their discharge
      opioid prescription (anywhere from 0 to the maximum allowable by law in Massachusetts i.e. no
      more than 7 days of pills).

      Daily analgesic intake, adverse effects and numeric rating scale (NRS) pain scores will be
      collected and analyzed.
