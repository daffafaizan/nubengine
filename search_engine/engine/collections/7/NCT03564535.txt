      non-absorbable tacks. Monofilament polyester mesh of size 15*11cm will be used. The tacks
      would be used such that they avoid bony prominences and vascular and neural structures. One
      tack will put at the Cooper's ligament and another applied laterally superior to the
      iliopubic tract in the anterior abdominal wall. In any patient, the maximum number of tacks
      applied will not exceed four. Preperitoneal space will be deﬂated under direct visualization
      after the mesh is placed. Hernia sac and any cord lipoma will be placed behind the mesh.
      During the deﬂation process, repositioning of the peritoneal sac on the mesh, in particular
      the dorsal edge of the latter would be carefully performed to avoid displacement or folding
      of the mesh.

      Self-fixating mesh group In this group,Monofilament polyester mesh with polylactic acid (PLA)
      microgrips of size 15*11 will be used. It is an isoelastic large-pore knitted fabric with a
      density of 73g/m2 at implantation and 38g/m2 after microgrips absorption which will be at 18
      months. The resorbable micro grips provide immediate adherence to surrounding muscle and
      adipose tissue during the initial days post hernia surgery, serving as an alternate method of
      fixation to traditional sutures, tacks, staples, or fibrin sealants. No additional tacks,
      staples, sutures, or fibrin sealant is used
