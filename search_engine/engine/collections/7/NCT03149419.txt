    
      Paroxetine and placebo effects at baseline and after 12 weeks in endothelial, autonomic and
      pressure components of vascular function are evaluated.

      Non invasive venous occlusion plethysmography is used to study endothelial function;
      ambulatory blood pressure monitoring is used to study blood pressure variations during
      daytime and nocturnal descent; autonomic function is studied following sympathetic and
      parasympathetic parameters through heart rate variability.

      The effects of paroxetine and placebo are also evaluated on:

        -  daytime sleepiness (through Epworth Sleepiness Scale ),

        -  sleep quality (through Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index),

        -  perceived stress (through Perceived Scale Stress).

      Biochemical and hormonal profiles including complete lipid profile, fasting glucose, insulin,
      estradiol, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH); inflammatory and
      oxidative stress markers are also studied.
