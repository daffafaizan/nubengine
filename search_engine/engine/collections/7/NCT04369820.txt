      of alveolo-capillary membrane, mediated by neutrophils and mononuclear cells. The complement
      system and anaphylatoxin C5a have shown central role in the recruitment of these
      pro-inflammatory cells and more broadly in the genesis of cytokinic storm syndrome. C5a acts
      via receptors C5aR and C5L2.

      This is a preliminary study aimed at studying the expression of the C5a receptor on myeloid
      cells in peripheral blood of patients with ARDS secondary to COVID-19.

      This study has of primary objective to show there is an overexpression of the C5a receptor in
      patients with ARDS secondary to COVID-19 compared to control patients (patients with COVID-19
      without respiratory distress and healthy volunteers).

      The medium-term objective is to develop a clinical trial to test the effectiveness of
      anti-C5aR antibody in this condition.
