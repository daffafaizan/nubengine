      biomarkers and identifying biomarkers.

        1. The FIRST STEP is a Case-control study to find target biomarkers. 20 COPD patients and
           20 controls are to be enrolled in the study and their EBC and blood are collected.
           Proteomics techniques and protein chip techniques are to be used to screen COPD specific
           biomarkers in EBC.

        2. The SECOND STEP is a community-based nested case-control study to make sure whether the
           significant biomarkers in first part can predict rapid decline of lung function. The
           study will be a community based, multicenter prospective cohort designed, which
           including a total of 2,400 study subjects. EBC and blood are collected at the baseline
           and followed up for two years. Case group is defined as subjects with rapid decline of
           lung function and new COPD patients. Control group is selected according to 1:1 matching
           with age and gender.
