      highly prevalent among persons with spinal cord injuries (SCI). Accumulation of body fat
      disposes persons with SCI to accelerated endocrine and cardiovascular diseases, as well as
      pain, functional decline, and diminished health-related quality of life (HRQoL). While use of
      combined resistance and endurance exercise by persons without disability can remedy many of
      the problems associated with these disorders, their widespread use for persons with spinal
      cord injuries (SCI) must first satisfy scientific burdens of effectiveness.

      The investigators have adopted the term "obesity-related secondary complications" to describe
      accumulation of body fat clustering with other secondary CVD risks, while recognizing that a
      threshold criterion for diagnosis of obesity in persons with SCI remains ill-defined. For
      purposes of this proposal, the "-related" part of the term confers physical deconditioning,
      hypertension, fasting dyslipidemia, post-prandial lipemia (PPL), and impaired insulin
      sensitivity, all of which have been reported in persons with SCI. Contextualized, any of
      these risks occurring independently or in clusters would be cause for immediate therapeutic
      lifestyle intervention (TLI), if not frank medical treatment. Given our early understanding
      of effective treatments for these risks, any improvement in their severity would be CVD
      risk-reducing and thus life-benefiting and function-preserving.

      The investigators expect that the research findings will improve the understanding of risks
      for obesity and obesity-related secondary complications so that future interventions can be
      better targeted, identify an exercise intervention that can attend to current health risks,
      clarify whether nutrient supplementation improves risk-lessening benefits of exercise,
      identify exercise timing and intensities that best enhance fat utilization, and expand the
      understanding of the interrelated nature of risk factors after SCI.
