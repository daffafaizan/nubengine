      combination care intervention to improve HIV care continuum outcomes including the
      development of community-informed strategies for subsequent RCTs. We will conduct a one-arm
      pilot of the adapted multicomponent trauma-informed intervention named "Kickin it with the
      Gurlz." This project will collect feasibility and acceptability data related to identifying,
      recruiting, enrolling, intervening with, and retaining participants (i.e. recruitment length,
      screening procedures, feasibility of conducting sessions, intervention acceptability,
      retention rates, feasibility of verifying self-reported and medical chart review data on
      viral load and exit interviews with participants and staff at program conclusion). The study
      will recruit 30 participants into the pilot study. Participants will complete baseline, end
      of program, and 3-month post-intervention follow-up surveys. Exit interviews and interviews
      with key stakeholders will identify strategies for implementing trauma-informed HIV treatment
      efficacy trials with transgender women of color within close-knit communities, such as
      acceptable and feasible control conditions, acceptable and feasible violence and gender
      affirmation screening, biomedical confirmation methods, contamination concerns, and potential
      changes needed within existing health care systems.
