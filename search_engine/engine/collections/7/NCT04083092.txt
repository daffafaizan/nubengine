      be caused by a germ not treatable with common medications. This germ is a bacterium called
      methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). MRSA is a bacterium that has become
      resistant to certain antibiotics. Scientists and doctors are not sure what causes individuals
      to develop these infections, but it is believed to be related to the bacteria that might be
      on a patient's skin or in their nose. Patients will be interviewed by someone from the
      research team to gather more details about possible risk factors related to MRSA infections.
      Th interview is expected to last between 10-20 minutes. Nasal (nose), axillary (armpit),
      throat, and around rectum swabs will be obtained by the research team as follows: Culture
      swabs (similar to a large Q-tip) will be inserted gently into the front half of each nostril
      (nare), under each arm, in the throat area, and around the perirectal area (surface skin
      around rectal opening) either before or after being seen by the emergency room physician.
      Another culture swab of the patient's skin and soft tissue infection might be taken as part
      of their usual care for the child's condition or a swab culture will be taken from the
      infection site by research personnel. A 'culture' swab is a sterile Q-tip like swab which is
      used to collect potential bacteria from the skin and nose, and then can be used in the
      laboratory to grow the bacteria collected.
