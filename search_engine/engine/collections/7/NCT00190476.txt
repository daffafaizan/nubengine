      utility of chemotherapy in elderly patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
      In a large randomized trial, gemcitabine and vinorelbine failed to show any advantage over
      either agent alone. With the current evidence, single agent chemotherapy with a
      third-generation drug can be considered a recommended option for elderly patients with
      advanced NSCLC. A Japanese phase I/II study showed the activity (overall response rate 52%,
      median survival 12.4 months) and tolerability of weekly docetaxel/ cisplatin combination in
      patients older than age 75 years. There have been no randomized prospective trials dedicated
      to elderly NSCLC patients to evaluate tolerability and efficacy of platinum-based
      combination.

      Comparison: Single-agent weekly docetaxel versus weekly regimen of docetaxel-cisplatin
      combination for elderly advanced NSCLC.
