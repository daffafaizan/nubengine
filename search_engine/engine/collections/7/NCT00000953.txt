      virus ( VZV ) infections, also called shingles. Acyclovir, an approved drug, is widely used
      to treat VZV infections in the HIV population. Since no data from controlled studies are
      available to define the role of antiviral therapy for VZV infections in HIV-infected
      patients, a study is needed to test the relative efficacy of brovavir, an experimental
      antiviral drug, versus that of acyclovir.

      One hundred-eighty patients are randomized to receive either brovavir or acyclovir as
      follows: brovavir or its matching placebo once daily and acyclovir or its matching placebo
      five times daily. Treatment continues for 10 days. Entry into the study must occur within 72
      hours of lesion development. Patients are followed in person daily or at regular intervals
      during study drug administration and on days 14, 21, and 28, and then monthly by telephone
      for 11 months thereafter.
