    
      Preoperative records will be taken (photos, conventional periapical radiographs, and
      impression to construct acrylic stent to help standardization on follow up apical
      radiographs). Administration of inferior alveolar nerve block then using rubber dam isolation
      one of the investigators will remove the caries using large round but under copious amount of
      coolant and if carious exposure occur, part of the pulp chamber will be removed using sharp
      spoon excavator. Then the pulp status will be assessed if bleeding is controlled with direct
      irrigation with distilled water for 2 minutes then next step will be taken but if not
      continue excavation of the pulp till bleeding is controlled. if bleeding is not controlled
      after performing complete pulpotomy, tooth will be excluded from the study Then direct
      application of capping materials (TheraCal or MTA) according to manufacturer instructions,
      then Riva self-cure glass-ionomer base and composite resin final restoration. One of the
      investigators will take immediate standardized postoperative periapical radiographs.
      Follow-up will be for 12 months. Pre-calibrated blinded dentists will assess out comes
      separately.
