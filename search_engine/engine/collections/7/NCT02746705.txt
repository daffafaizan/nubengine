        1. successfully treat fatigue in adults with MS, and

        2. improve learning ability and other aspects of cognitive functioning in healthy controls
           and in participants with a range of medical disorders.

      Cognitive impairment in MS remains a major treatment challenge and a trial of tDCS combined
      with a cognitive training program to treat MS-related cognitive impairment is warranted.
      However, one barrier for the study of tDCS has been the need for the participant to travel to
      the study site for each tDCS administration. To address this issue, the biomedical company
      Soterix, has recently designed a remote-delivery tDCS device designed for use in clinical
      trials. Therefore, the primary goal of this study is to establish a protocol for
      remotely-supervised in-home tDCS delivery for studies with MS participants. Established
      safety and feasibility of remotely-supervised tDCS delivery will facilitate the next steps of
      larger controlled trials, in both MS as well as other conditions, to determine efficacy and
      appropriate real-world use.
