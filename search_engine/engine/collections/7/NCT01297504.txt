      though existing data clearly indicate that RSV accounts for a high proportion of acute
      respiratory illnesses (ARIs) in children.

      This is a multi-center study in a cohort of infants at risk for RSV infection in Latin
      America who have received palivizumab in the usual manner in accordance with the terms of
      marketing authorization with regard to dose, population and indication. Enrolled participants
      were followed for one year after their first dose of palivizumab. Epidemiological and
      clinical data as well as information about compliance, hospitalizations and safety was
      collected.
