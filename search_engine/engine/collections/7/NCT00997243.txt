      Primary

        -  To determine the complete response rate of the combination of lintuzumab and azacitidine
           in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes.

      Secondary

        -  To define the specific toxicities of this regimen.

        -  To determine the overall response rate.

        -  To determine the relationship between pretreatment expression of Syk and clinical
           response.

        -  To determine whether the investigational agents modulate Syk expression and to correlate
           drug-induced changes in Syk with response to treatment.

        -  To provide preliminary data on the biological activity of azacitidine as a demethylating
           agent (changes in target gene methylation and gene expression, DNMT1 protein expression,
           global methylation).

        -  To perform exploratory studies of azacitidine-triphosphate with global DNA methylation.

        -  To explore the biologic role of microRNA in determining clinical response to this
           regimen and achievement of the other pharmacodynamic endpoints.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive azacitidine IV or subcutaneously once daily on days 1-7 and
      lintuzumab IV on days 2, 7, 15, and 22 (days 2 and 15 of course 1 only). Treatment repeats
      every 28 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Treatment modifications may apply according to response.

      Blood and bone marrow samples are collected periodically for pharmacodynamic studies.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 5 years.
