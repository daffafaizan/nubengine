      existing psychological intervention (MBSR) to help people affected by stroke self-manage
      symptoms of anxiety and depression.

      Objectives: 1) Assess feasibility and acceptability of delivering the HEADS: UP intervention
      online and identify any additional adaptations to the HEADS: UP manual and supporting
      materials. 2) Assess feasibility and acceptability of online research processes, including
      recruitment, screening, and obtaining informed consent, and data collection processes.
