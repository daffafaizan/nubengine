      Approaching the heart can be done by different access sites: via the femoral artery
      (transfemoral) or the radial artery (transradial). Transfemoral access (TFA) is the primary
      mode of arterial access. Several clinical trials have demonstrated the benefit of transradial
      over transfemoral approach. The primary advantage of transradial approach is a significant
      reduction of access-site complications. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a serious condition
      associated with premature mortality, decreased quality of life, and increased health-care
      expenditures. ). It is commonly found in patients with diabetes, hypertension,
      hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, or combinations of these risk factors. Coronary
      artery disease and CKD are often comorbid conditions seen in the cath lab. Cardiac
      catheterization is a mainstay of diagnosis and treatment for coronary artery disease and 58%
      of deaths in CKD are related to cardiovascular deaths. Patients with CKD and who undergo a
      cardiac catheterization are at risk for contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) due to the dye
      used during the procedure.

      The investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial that aims to compare the
      incidence of CIN between transradial and transfemoral cardiac catheterization.
