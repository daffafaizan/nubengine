      therapy. Before robotic-assisted training, a mirror therapy is performed to double the
      healing effect of robotic-assisted training.

      This study hypothesized that combining robotic-assisted training and mirror therapy can
      improve the performance of hand function in stroke patients and promote daily life function,
      quality of life, and self-efficacy compared to single machine-assisted therapy.
