      outcomes. Study drug initiation will occur in the local pediatric intensive care unit in
      patients with a clinical diagnosis of bronchiolitis and whose parent/LAR consents for their
      participation. Our goal is to enroll and evaluate a total of 40 patients.

      Upon obtaining informed consent, the participant will receive an enrollment history and
      physical to include: baseline Modified Pulmonary Index Score (MPIS), blood pressure, vital
      signs, and epidemiologic data. The participant will then receive either a bolus of 50mg/kg
      Magnesium Sulfate (MgSO4) or normal saline as placebo medication over twenty minutes. Vital
      signs and MPIS will be monitored according to the study schedule, for a total of six hours.
      During the period of monitoring subjects will not receive additional bronchodilators unless
      otherwise deemed clinically necessary by the subject's attending physician. If administered,
      these will be recorded by investigative team.
