2627. chicken lens development  epithelial cell production andmigrationin the earliest stages of chicken lensdevelopment, cell division occurred over theentire lens.  cell division first stoppedin the posterior side of the lens vesicle, asthe cells differentiated into primary lensfibers.  after the annular pad developed,cell division occurred, for the most part,in the anterior surface epithelial cells.shortly after hatching and thereafter, agerminative zone, consisting of a narrowband of epithelial cells adjacent to theannular pad developed.  the cells from thegerminative zone migrated slowly anddifferentiated first into annular pad cells andthen into lens cortex fibers over anestimated 2-year period.  this slow migrationof cells in the lens is discussed inrelation to the failure of the adult chicken to de-velop radiation cataracts.
