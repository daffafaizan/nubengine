      the New Mexico Tumor Registry (NMTR). The NMTR is a valuable database that provides
      information on breast cancer, including trends in incidence and survival. However, relevant
      information on breast cancer prognosis and treatment is either not routinely collected or not
      readily available to the NMTR. We propose to establish an Expanded Breast Cancer Registry and
      Tissue Repository (EBCR) at this institution that could serve as an infrastructure for
      collection of this information. Furthermore, a tissue bank will be established for collection
      of paired tissue (tumor, buccal cells and blood sample) from patients diagnosed with breast
      cancer who consent to providing excess/extra tissue and additional blood for the Tissue
      Repository. This tissue bank will serve as a repository from which researchers can access
      tissue samples to conduct laboratory-based studies of genetic determinants of breast cancer
      risks, prognosis and survival in women with breast cancer seen in this institution.
