      schedules, in two sequential stages. In the first stage, participants received 1, 2 or 3
      injections of CYD dengue vaccine over a 12-month period. In the second stage, participants
      were randomized to receive a booster dose of CYD dengue vaccine at either 12 months (Subgroup
      a) or 24 months (Subgroup b) after the third injection of study vaccine. During the
      conduction of this trial, the World Health Organization (WHO) indication about vaccinating
      only baseline seropositive participants was arisen; at this moment, STAGE I of the trial was
      completed. For STAGE II, only participants who were previously dengue exposed at baseline
      (dengue seropositive) were eligible to receive the booster dose.
