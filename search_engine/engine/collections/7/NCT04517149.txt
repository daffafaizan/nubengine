    
      This Phase 1/2 study will gather data in an observational phase Natural History Cohort to
      further characterize and evaluate natural disease progression in male patients with
      genetically-confirmed X-linked retinitis pigmentosa (XLRP) caused by mutations in the gene
      encoding retinitis pigmentosa GTPase regulator (RPGR). The study will also evaluate the
      safety and tolerability, as assessed by frequency and severity of ocular and systemic adverse
      events, as well as preliminary clinical efficacy of a single intravitreal (IVT) injection of
      4D-125 at two dose levels in this patient population.

      4D-125 has been developed as a gene replacement therapy for XLRP. After receiving 4D-125,
      patients will be followed for 24 months with continued safety follow-up. Secondary endpoints
      will assess preliminary efficacy measures at 12 months after 4D-125 administration.
