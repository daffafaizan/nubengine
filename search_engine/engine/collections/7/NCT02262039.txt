      insufflation pressure and operative mean ETCO2, resulting in improved post-operative pain
      control and improved operative safety.

      The Airseal System has demonstrated decreased variability in intra-abdominal pressure, less
      post-operative shoulder pain, lower mean ETCO2 and reduced narcotic pain administration.
      These metrics have been demonstrated in human subjects undergoing gynecologic, urologic and
      bariatric procedures. The established benefits in a human model provide a foundation for
      translating this technology to living kidney donors. The advantage lies in the ability to
      improve pain-related outcomes in this population, which translates into increased living
      donation; the single solution to reduce mortality for patients suffering from end-stage
      kidney disease.
