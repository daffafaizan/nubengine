      study designed to assess the efficacy, pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of IV
      elamipretide for reduction of reperfusion injury in subjects with ARAS, who are undergoing
      percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of the renal artery (PTRA).

      The randomization (1:1 active:placebo) was stratified by a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus.
      Participants received either 0.05 mg/kg/h elamipretide or matching placebo, administered as
      an IV infusion at 60 mL/h infused 30 minutes before and continued 3 hours after PTRA of the
      renal artery. After completion of the PTRA and stenting, subjects were to receive standard
      treatment.
