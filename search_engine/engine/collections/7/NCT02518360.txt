      of osteopathy and 25 control group). For a first objective of this study, all the patients
      determine if the osteopathic approach to the body adjustment approach will improve low back
      pain (Oswestry Questionnaire). For the second aim, the investigators want to know if there
      are changes in the distribution of body weight in lower limbs in group experimental and
      control group, analyzed with a stabilometric platform (FootscanÂ®).

      The experimental group is treated with osteopathy, three sessions (20 minutes/session) and a
      frequency one session/week. The treatment osteopathic is the body adjustment protocol. In the
      other hand, the control group made 2 stretching global postures once a week (10 minutes for
      each posture) for three weeks: the first was for the anterior muscular chain and the second
      posture to stretch the posterior muscle chain. Before treatment, immediately after the last
      session and a month later, are measured stabilometric parameters, height and Oswestry.

      The analysis will be made with Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS Statistics)
      22.0
