    
      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the superiority of treatment with the
      Nuvaira Lung Denervation System (Active Treatment arm) compared to a sham procedure (Sham
      Control arm) to decrease moderate or severe exacerbations in subjects with COPD on optimal
      medical care.

      The secondary objective is to compare long-term safety, and other efficacy assessments
      between the Active Treatment arm and the Sham Control arm.
