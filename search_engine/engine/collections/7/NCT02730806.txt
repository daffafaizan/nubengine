      the Western world with 8% prevalence. When including partial/Sub-clinic PTSD, prevalence
      rises dramatically. Studies examining the common intervention methods indicate certain
      clinical effectiveness although none presents sweeping efficiency. Therefore, this syndrome
      is still a significant clinical problem in Public Health.

      This study focuses on women population who have experienced trauma in childbirth. Such women
      experience full post traumatic symptoms (Full PTSD) or Partial/Subclinical PTSD. This
      syndrome is defined in professional literature as PPPTSD (Post-Partum Post Traumatic Stress
      Disorder). While childbirth is a healthy part of the cycle of life, birth itself is an event
      that may involve a risk to the mother and child life. PPPTSD prevalence ranges between 1%-6%
      and is expressed in at least two of the criteria listed in the DSM. 8.3%-28% of women suffer
      from partial PPPTSD.

      Neuro Linguistic Programming (NLP) is a "one-on-one" intervention method, connecting
      Neurological processes (N), Linguistic (L) and learned behaviors (P), in order to allow
      conceptual/perceptual, mental and behavioral changes. Even though NLP is used since the
      1970's and field testimonies report its effectiveness, there are only few studies regarding
      its effectiveness in the field of PTSD.

      This study's main objective is to examine the effectiveness of the NLP PTSD protocol.

      The study population will include approx 30 women, up to 2 years after birth, with PPPTSD.
      The women will be treated in 5 individual sessions implementing the NLP PTSD protocol.
