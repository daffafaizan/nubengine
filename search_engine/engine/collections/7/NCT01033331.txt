      of the spinal anterior corn, resulting in hypotonia and muscle weakness. The knowledge about
      its molecular mechanism has led to clinical tests with drugs that increase survival motor
      neuron (SMN) protein level. The valproic acid (VA) that acts as a histone deacetylase
      inhibitor activates the SMN2 gene increasing the protein level. Methods: Twenty-two patients
      with type II and III SMA, aged between 2 and 18 years old, were treated with VA and were
      evaluated five times along a period of one year using the Manual Muscle Test (Medical
      Research Council scale-MRC), the Hammersmith Motor Ability Score, and the Barthel Index. The
      first evaluation was coincident with the introduction of VA. Results: After 12 months of
      therapy, the patients did not gain muscle strength but their motor ability has improved.
      Children younger than 6 years of age had a higher pronounced gain in motor ability.
      Conclusion: treatment of SMA patients with VA is one alternative to alleviate the progression
      of the disease.
