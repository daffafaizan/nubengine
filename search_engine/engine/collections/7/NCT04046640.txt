      40 healthy volunteers. Infrared thermal imaging will be adopted to assess the heat transport
      characteristics of meridian phenomenon for Heart and Lung meridians in the
      physiology/pathological state. In addition, by comparing the heat transport characteristics
      in the acupoints along the Heart and Lung meridians, the relative specificity of the two
      meridians will also be investigated.

      Primary outcomes will be infrared thermal images and acupoint temperature. Furthermore, this
      study will build standardized techniques and schemes for detecting the heat transport
      characteristics of meridian phenomenon for Heart and Lung. The results of this study could
      also provide scientific foundation for traditional meridian theories.
