      particularly common in women. The prevailing theory for the etiology of patellofemoral pain
      is an imbalance in force or timing of the pull of the knee extensor muscles on the patella
      resulting in improper tracking of the patella in the femoral grove. Specifically, the vastus
      medialis is thought to be ineffective in overcoming the lateral pull of the vastus lateralis.
      When exercises designed to focus on improving strength and timing of activation of the vastus
      medialis fail, surgical release of part of the attachment of the vastus lateralis to the
      patella is considered.

      Botulinum toxin temporarily blocks acetylcholine release from motor neurons and is used
      clinically to produce muscle relaxation.

      Subjects with patellofemoral syndrome will be recruited into the study. Half of the subjects
      will be given a placebo injection while the other half will be given an injection of Botox
      (Botulinum Toxin A, Allergen) into the vastus lateralis muscle. Group assignment will be
      randomized and a double blind protocol used. Prior to injection, the subject will record
      their level of knee pain, fill out several knee function questionnaires, and have the
      strength and endurance of their knee extensor muscles tested. All subjects will be given an
      exercise program designed to target strengthening of the medial thigh muscles as well as
      stretching of lateral structures.

      At 4, 6 and 12 weeks knee pain and knee function will again be assessed.
