    
      This study will assess the safety and tolerability of escalating, multiple ascending doses of
      Cavosonstat (N91115) in healthy subjects.

      Approximately 5 ascending cohorts are planned with approximately 8 subjects per cohort (6
      active, 2 placebo). Each subject will undergo screening (Day -28 to Day -2) and, if eligible,
      return to the unit on Day -1 when eligibility will be reconfirmed.

      Eligible subjects will be randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive investigational medicinal
      product (IMP) N91115 (daily [QD] or every 12 hours [Q12H]) or matching placebo (QD or Q12H)
      for 7 days and will be followed for safety while housed in the clinical research unit (CRU)
      until discharge on Day 8. Pharmacokinetics will be followed from Study Day 1 through the
      morning of Study Day 8. The subjects will be discharged from the CRU and complete the post
      treatment withdrawal phase, including a follow-up phone call on Day 15.
