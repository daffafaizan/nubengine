      per week for twelve weeks to HIV+GBV+ women meeting CIDI diagnostic criteria for depression
      (MDD, dysthymia, minor depression) and PTSD secondary to GBV. Blocked randomization will be
      used to evenly distribute 120 participants to (1) IPT + TAU or (2) TAU for 12 weeks. The TAU
      group will be offered IPT treatment following the initial 12 week trial. Thus, all study
      subjects will receive TAU throughout the study and they will all receive IPT in either the
      first or second half of the study. My research team at FACES will be recruited for IPT
      training as potential therapists in the IPT pilot. A run-in study design will be used,
      assigning one training case apiece to each of the 8 therapists to practice IPT skills. Both
      IPT + TAU and TAU groups will be measured at baseline and weeks 12, 24 and 36 by blinded
      assessment. At FACES, TAU resources for HIV+GBV+ women include medical professionals,
      counseling, community elders, church leaders, police, and a pro-bono legal aid, all of who
      have all been involved with past FACES GBV interventions.
