      incidence, duration, and severity of postoperative delirium and other important hospital
      outcomes. Additionally, this trial will evaluate the effects of IV acetaminophen on
      longer-term postoperative cognitive dysfunction and functional status and develop a
      biorepository of perioperative samples as a future resource to probe the mechanisms of
      postoperative delirium.

      The investigators propose three specific aims by conducting a randomized, triple-blind
      clinical trial that enrolls 900 patients 60 years of age or older undergoing cardiac surgery.
      Through this trial, the investigators will determine the effect of IV acetaminophen on;

        1. the incidence, duration, and severity of postoperative delirium,

        2. the use of opioids and other rescue analgesics in the first 48 postoperative hours,
           daily pain scores at rest and exertion, and length of stay in the Intensive Care Unit
           and overall hospital length of stay

        3. longer-term (one, six, 12 months) cognitive, physical, and self-care functional recovery
           after surgery.
