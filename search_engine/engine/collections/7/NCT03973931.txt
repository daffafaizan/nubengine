      prescribed resulting in increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. Mobile and
      digital technologies for health promotion and disease self-management offer an intriguing and
      as of yet untested opportunity to adapt behavioral 'nudges' using ubiquitous cell phone
      technology to facilitate medication adherence.

      Objectives: Aim 1: Conduct a pragmatic patient-level randomized intervention across three
      health care systems (HCS) to improve adherence to chronic CV medications. The primary outcome
      will be medication adherence defined by the proportion of days covered (PDC) using pharmacy
      refill data. Secondary outcomes will include intermediate clinical measures (e.g., BP
      control), CV clinical events (e.g., hospitalizations), healthcare utilization, and costs. Aim
      2: Evaluate the intervention using a mixed methods approach and applying the RE-AIM (reach,
      effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance) framework. In addition, assess the
      context and implementation processes to inform local tailoring, adaptations and
      modifications, and eventual expansion of the intervention within the 3 HCS more broadly and
      nationally.

      Setting: The study will be conducted within three HCS in metro Denver: VA Eastern Colorado
      Health Care System (VA), Denver Health and Hospital Authority, and UCHealth.
