    
      To demonstrate the efficacy of new product IVIG prepared by minipool technology as assessed
      by Bleeding Score and platelet count at 3 days, 1 week, 2 weeks and 4 weeks.

      The platelet response rate is defined as the percentage of subjects responding to treatment
      with an increase of platelet count from ≤ 20 x 10^9/L to ≥ 100 x 10^9/L and absence of
      bleeding (complete response) or platelet count ≥ 50 x 10^9/L and at least 2-fold increase the
      base line count with absence of bleeding (partial response), within the specified time frame.

      Secondary:

        1. To assess safety of mini-pool IVIG in patients with newly diagnosed ITP by assessing
           frequency of adverse events related to mini-pool IgG administration

        2. To compare data on efficacy and safety of mini-pool IVIG with data obtained from
           literature on standard IVIG.

      Study population:

      Patients with newly diagnosed ITP attending Hematology clinic Ain Shams Children hospital

      Sample size:

      Seventy- two patients will be enrolled. They will be divided into 3 groups:

      Group A; platelet non enhancing group Group B; group receiving standard IVIG Group C; group
      receiving IVIG New product 24 patients in each group in a ratio 1:1:1.
