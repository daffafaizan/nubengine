      a highly-prevalent condition in the health services. The objective of the present study is to
      investigate the function of the immuno-pineal axis in chronic tension headache, focussed on
      the neuro-immune regulatory dysfunction. In addition, the effect of neuro-stimulation
      (electroacupuncture) on the function of this axis will also be studied.

      This is a clinical Trial study, randomised, in parallel, cross-over with a blinded assessor,
      and with a sham placebo control.

      The study will be carried out in the Clinical Research Outpatient Clinic of the Hospital de
      Cl√≠nicas de Porto Alegre (HCPA), with women aged between 18 and 60 years old. The
      participants will respond to questionnaires at the beginning and end of each therapeutic
      intervention, with 24-hour urine, blood and saliva collection. The therapeutic intervention
      will include: 10 electroacupuncture sessions and 10 sham placebo sessions. The measurements
      taken will be: quality of life, depression, impact of headache on daily life, sleep quality,
      chronotropic types, immuno-inflammatory mediators, levels of 6-sulfatoxymelatonin, and
      salivary cortisol.

      Through these interventions it is hoped that patients will present an improvement in their
      pain presentation, quality of life and sleep, as well as central autonomic regulation.
      Evidence for these hypotheses will support a minimally-invasive treatment, with few
      side-effects and a low cost.
