      up to but not exceeding doses used to treat malaria, over a 5-month period. We will follow
      the effect of the treatment on the levels of Hex A enzyme activity in white blood cells,
      which are considered to be a reflection of the likely enzyme activity in the brain. We will
      also follow some other lysosomal enzyme activities to determine if the effect is specific for
      Hex A. Furthermore, we will examine the effect of the treatment on the levels of
      GM2-ganglioside in the white blood cells. On the basis of the studies done on cultured skin
      cells, we expect that treatment with Pyr will increase the levels of Hex A and decrease the
      accumulation of GM2-ganglioside in the white blood cells.
