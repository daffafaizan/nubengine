      mouse and rat mammary tumors co-migrate accompanied by macrophages towards intravasation
      sites . The intravasation occurs at sites where a TIE2-expressing macrophage, a
      mena-expressing tumor cell, and an endothelial cell are in direct contact, forming a
      micro-anatomic structure called tumor micro-environment of metastasis (TMEM). Ablation of the
      presence or activity of the TMEM associated macrophages blocks intravasation at TMEM
      demonstrating an essential role of perivascular macrophages in TMEM function. Rebastinib, a
      TIE2 inhibitor , blocks TMEM assembly and function in-vivo and in-vitro assays. We
      hypothesize that rebastinib combined with antitubulin therapy (eribulin or paclitaxel) could
      improve clinical outcomes in breast cancer by preventing intravasation at TMEM sites and
      preventing further metastasis.
