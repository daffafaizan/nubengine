      with about 17,700 new cases annually. Recovery of walking is a primary rehabilitation goal
      for patients and encouraged by therapists due to its relationship to quality of life, impact
      on health, psychological profile, and social participation after SCI. Recent technological
      advances with exoskeleton devices specifically for gait training may yield better walking
      recovery outcomes compared with usual care intervention approaches, such as body-weight
      support treadmill training (BWSTT) and overground gait training with braces, yet limited
      evidence exists for those with SCI.

      Aim 1: Use a Community-Based Participatory Research approach to develop an robotic gait
      training (RGT) program that meets the unique needs of people after incomplete SCI during
      inpatient rehabilitation. This will be achieved by establishing and engaging an Advisory
      Board of key stakeholders to review evidence-based literature, advise the research team on
      the unique aspects and goals of inpatient rehabilitation for people with SCI, review the RGT,
      and make recommendations for amendments to the RGT program based on our interim and final
      outcomes of the study over the funding period.

      Aim 2: Prospectively examine the efficacy of RGT compared to usual care gait training during
      inpatient rehabilitation in people with incomplete SCI.

      Aim 3: Compare the intensity of RGT and usual care gait training during inpatient
      rehabilitation.
