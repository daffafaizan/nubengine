      trans-tibial amputees. The investigators aim to demonstrate that providing three months of
      FES intervention will increase knee extension strength, increase volume of the residual limb
      and decrease chronic and phantom pain.

      EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Randomized control trial METHODS: Twenty participants will be recruited
      and randomly divided into two groups, one group will receive the FES intervention while the
      other group will continue with activities of daily living. Both groups will keep a daily log
      of number of hours the prosthesis is worn, number of hours the FES is worn (if used) and any
      changes in skin conditions or medications. Both groups will return for assessment visits at
      4, 8, and 12 weeks and a follow up visit 3 months post-intervention for investigators to
      inspect the residual limb and check the fit of the prosthetic socket, record residual limb
      knee extension strength on the Biodex machine, take measurements (circumferences and lengths)
      of the residual limb with a tape measure and ruler, scan the limb with the hand held
      three-dimensional motion-tracking laser scanner system and the participant will be asked to
      complete a pain questionnaire. The Prosthetic Evaluation Questionnaire (PEQ) will be
      completed at the 12 week and the 3 month follow-up visits. Although outcomes data were
      captured during each assessment visit (0, 4, 8 and 12 weeks and 3 months), changes in the
      primary outcomes (strength, volume and pain) at timepoints 0 weeks (pre-intervention) and 12
      weeks (post- intervention) were of primary interest.
