      Name and description of experimental and control intervention. The experimental intervention
      is the implementation of a dynamic LED-light system in two patient rooms. The system includes
      three elements: a window jamb built-in light panel, two ceiling mounted lamps, and a wall
      mounted lamp. All lamps will have a dynamic, time dependent frequency distribution and
      intensity of light. The control intervention is constant standard LED-light with two
      elements: two ceiling mounted lamps and a wall mounted lamp.
