      DIPG mainly occurs in the ventral pontine of childhood. The overall median survival time is 9
      to 11 months. The 2-year survival rate is less than 10%. Thus DIPG has become one of the most
      fatal diseases in children. These tumors invade and infiltrate the surrounding brain, making
      complete surgical excision impossible. Several studies focused on the identification of GBM
      or DIPG-specific antigens and evaluated their potential for vaccine application.
      Immunomodulatory DC vaccines based on ex vivo genetic modifications in combination with known
      tumor-specific antigens may substantially enhance the activation potential of tumor-specific
      T cells with improved benefit to patients.

      Although certain antigens are highly specific in DIPG or GBM, existing immune tolerance
      suppresses anti-tumor immunity in cancer patients. To induce anti-cancer immune response in
      patients, ex vivo modification of immune modulatory antigens or immune cells will be
      necessary. Advanced whole exome sequencing has been developed to identify specific mutations
      in tumors and predict best-fit MHC-specific neoepitopes for T cell activation. In this study
      we will investigate novel DC vaccines based on autologous DCs pulsed with genetically
      modified tumor cells or related antigens such as neoantigens to induce a strong anti-tumor
      immunity. Early studies of DC-based vaccines targeting gliomas have shown acceptable safety
      and low toxicity profile. This is a multi-center randomized Phase I study to evaluate safety
      of novel DC vaccines.
