      development of anxiety disorders in humans, emphasising its potential to possibly enhance
      exposure therapy in humans. This study explores the basic effects of losartan on emotional
      processing, to identify neural mechanisms by which the drug might have synergistic effects on
      psychological treatment in humans.

      In a double-blind between-groups design, 30 healthy volunteers will be randomised to a group
      receiving a single dose of losartan (50mg) versus placebo, and this study will measure the
      effects of probing renin-angiotensin function on emotional information processing, using
      functional magnet resonance imaging (fMRI). Such knowledge will ultimately be essential for
      the development of more effective pharmaco-psychological treatment approaches for anxiety
      disorders.
