      (www.childrenandwarfoundation.org ) as a tool to support children in coping with their mental
      reactions to being exposed to war and catastrophes. TRT has proven to be effective in
      reducing trauma-related mental health symptoms in such contexts. However, it has never been
      used with children experiencing all the uncertainties and stress of an asylum-seeking
      context, or with refugee children in high-income countries. The main aim of the present study
      is therefore to implement and evaluate the TRT among asylum-seeking and refugee children in
      the context of four different care conditions: 1)asylum-seeking children who arrived
      accompanied by a legal care-taker 2) asylum-seeking children less than 15 years in care
      centers administered by the Child Welfare Services 3) asylum-seeking children 15 years and
      older living in asylum centers regulated by the Directorate of Immigration 4) Former
      unaccompanied asylum-seeking children who have been granted residence (refugees) and are
      resettled in a municipality in Norway.

      Based on Power analyses, the target group is 40 children in each care condition (total n =
      160) > 9 years speaking Arabic, Tigrinya, Somali, Dari, or Pashto.

      The study employs a randomized clustered experimental design that includes a waiting list
      control group, which will receive the TRT when the intervention group has completed the
      program.
