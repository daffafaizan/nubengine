    
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, safety
      and efficacy study of the effects of ciclesonide HFA nasal aerosol and ciclesonide AQ nasal
      spray on the HPA axis, when administered once daily to male and female subjects 12 years or
      older diagnosed with Perennial Allergic Rhinitis (PAR). The study consists of a screening
      period, a single blind run in period, a 6 week double blind treatment period including an
      active control segment, and a follow up period.

      Placebo was used as the control during the double-blind treatment period for both delivery
      methods (HFA nasal aerosol and aqueous nasal spray)and for the study outcome analyses. There
      was also a positive control administered to a subset of these placebo subjects during the
      last 4 days of Week 6 (dexamethasone placebo or dexamethasone 6 mg). The active control was
      utilized to validate the assay sensitivity (ie, distinguish an effective from an ineffective
      drug) of this study, as dexamethasone is a known HPA axis suppressant, therefore this subset
      of placebo subjects was not included in the study outcome analyses.

      by Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma., and in October 2010, Sepracor Inc's name was changed to
