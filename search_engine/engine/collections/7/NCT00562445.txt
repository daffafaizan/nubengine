    
      Observational, prospective, open-label, in-patient study, that includes patients with upper
      gastrointestinal bleeding of variceal or peptic origin, and in patients with severe acute
      pancreatitis.

      The adrenal function of every patient included will be evaluated in the first 24 hours of
      admission This assessment shall be performed using the corticotropin-stimulation short test
      (synacthen test), that includes serum and saliva determination of cortisol, in basal
      conditions and 30 and 60 minutes after the administration of 250 ug of corticotropin
      synthetic (Synacthen, Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland).

      The cortisol levels will be determined by competitive immunoassay using direct
      chemoluminescence technology (Bayer Corporation, Pittsburgh, PA, USA).

      In patients with severe acute pancreatitis all of these determinations will be repeated at
      the third day of admission.
