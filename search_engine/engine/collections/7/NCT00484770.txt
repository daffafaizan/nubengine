      specific symptoms and physiological targets, will improve morbidity and mortality in the
      advanced heart failure population. Individual targets for each patient will be based on the
      outcome of the index hospitalization, during which therapy is adjusted to optimize clinical
      status, blood pressure, and renal function. Identifying a standard fluid management strategy
      may be an important way to limit the complications of diuretic therapy and the duration of
      hospitalization for these patients. In addition, a standard approach may provide objective
      criteria that can be used to systematically deliver care in many types of clinical settings.

      In this study, patients will be randomized to two strategies of outpatient fluid management:
      1) the Congestion Score Strategy and, 2) the BNP Strategy.
