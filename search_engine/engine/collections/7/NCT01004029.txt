      Women who have had a prior preterm birth have a 2.5-fold greater risk than women with no
      prior history of preterm birth. Prophylactic methods for prevention of preterm birth,
      including tocolytic drugs, bed rest, and other interventions such as cerclage, have been
      shown in most studies to be ineffective. One of the preventive measures that has shown
      effectiveness in randomized trials is the use of progesterone agents.9,10 Progesterone has
      been shown to support gestation and to inhibit uterine activity.
