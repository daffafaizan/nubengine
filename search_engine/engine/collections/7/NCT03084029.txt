      behavioural studies. The present study aims at replicating previous findings on OXT on
      empathy as well as to determine the neural basis of these effects.

      In a between-subject, randomized double-blind design, subjects will be either administered
      intranasal OXT or placebo nasal spray (40 IU). 45 minutes after administration subjects will
      undergo (fMRI) tasks of empathic processing.

      During the tasks subjects will be shown empathy inducing stimuli, and the behavioral and
      neural response in terms of cognitive, emotional and indirect emotional empathy will be
      assessed.

      Before the administration of treatment, validated questionnaires assessing potential
      confounding variables, such as depression (Becks Depression Inventory (BDI)) or mood
      (Positive And Negative Affect Scale (PANAS)) will be administered to the subjects.
