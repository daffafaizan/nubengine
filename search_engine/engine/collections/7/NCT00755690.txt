      are threefold: 1) prevention of vascular damage early in the progression of CKD thus reducing
      risk of cardiovascular death 2) Improved management of renal bone disease and resultant
      co-morbidities and 3) slowing the progression of renal failure lengthening the time required
      till dialysis is required. Although dietary counseling is currently a normal part of CKD
      care, the utility and effectiveness of lowering phosphate has not previously been quantified.
      In part this is due to the difficulty of measurement of serum phosphate as it is so tightly
      controlled before GFR falls below 30mls/min. No studies have investigated whether is it
      possible to modulate circulating FGF-23 and phosphate excretion in early stages of renal
      failure using diet in individuals with normal serum phosphate levels.

      Study Objectives ;

        1. To measure FGF-23 levels before and after a high phosphate diet, low phosphate diet and
           a low phosphate diet with phosphate binders.

        2. To measure levels of calcium, phosphate, PTH, 25 and 1,25 vitamin D and fractional
           phosphate excretion before and after a high phosphate diet, low phosphate diet and a low
           phosphate diet with phosphate binders.
