      lipoprotein metabolism in subjects with PBC; in particular, OCA's effects on high density
      lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was utilized to
      quantify the changes in lipoprotein particle sizes and concentrations. Components of reverse
      cholesterol transport were also assessed.
