      words when they are compared to normal subjects (Mercado et al., 2013). This dysfunctional
      emotion regulation could show attentional bias and it could be a way to increase FM
      symptomatology as pain, and fatigue (Duscheck et al., 2014).

      The emotion generation and its regulation through an experimental task as reading words is a
      well stablished procedure (Lang, Bradley y Cuthbert, 1997). This paradigm has been shown
      efficacy in clinical context, to reduce anxiety in social phobia (Masia et al., 1999; Ba√±os,
      Quero y Botella, 2008), generalized anxiety disorders (Fracalanza, Kroner y Antony, 2014),
      personality disorders (Arntz et al., 2012), and depression (Chuang et al., 2016). To address
      the gap between the experimental results of this form of emotional regulation in FM patients,
      and its clinical application, the aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a Brief
      Procedure of Emotional Regulation for Fibromyalgia (PbRE)

      PbRE is a word reading task implementing through an App developed for smartphones. The
      patient will choose emotional positive and negative words related to personal and clinical
      characteristics. This exercise has been shown useful in analogous tasks in relational frame
      theory (Hussey y Barnes-Holmes (2012) or in bias computer training (Salemink et al., 2014).
