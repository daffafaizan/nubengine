      This study aims to provide novel phenotypes for genomic studies into Attention- Deficit
      Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), one of the most common and heritable of all neuropsychiatric
      disorders. It proposes to split the disorder into neurobiologically more meaningful entities
      by delineating subgroups based on neurobehavioral profiles. It will also explore factors that
      impact clinical course, focusing on the neural effects of treatment and the role of the child
      s social environment.

      POPULATION AND DESIGN:

      Using a prospective longitudinal design, a group of children and adolescents with ADHD will
      be followed. Additionally, families that have several members affected by ADHD will be
      recruited.

      OUTCOMES:

      The study will link the onset and clinical course of ADHD with genotype, brain structure and
      function, behavior and the child s social environment.
