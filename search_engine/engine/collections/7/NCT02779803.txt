      prospectively followed for 24 months. Enrollment into the registry will take place over 3
      years.

      The primary objective is to collect prospective data on cerebral revascularization via
      superficial temporal artery (STA) to middle cerebral artery (MCA) for symptomatic carotid
      occlusion patients to determine if the procedure can be performed with less than 8% major
      peri-operative benchmark.

      The secondary objective is to determine if cerebral revascularization via STA to MCA bypass
      will improve cerebral hemodynamics, cognitive function, and quality of life in a defined
      subgroup of symptomatic carotid occlusion patients over a 2 year period.

      Clinical outcome in terms of resolved symptomatology, improved cerebrovascular hemodynamics,
      and cognitive status will be assessed. Short term and long term follow-up for a period of 24
      months will include assessment of ipsilateral stroke or TIA rate, mortality, graft patency,
      assessment of MCA and bypass flow rates (if available), cognitive evaluation and quality of
      life evaluation.

      Following enrollment baseline demographics and operative data will be collected. Follow-up
      will be performed at 1 month (m), 3m, 6m, 12m and 24m. Occurrence of new TIA or stroke will
      be determined. The patient's bypass patency, Qualitative Magnetic Resonance Angiogram (QMRA)
      flow data (site discretion) and NIHSS Score (NIHSS), Barthel Index (mBARTHEL), modified
      Rankin Scales (mRANKIN), EuroQOL, and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) with digital
      Clock Drawing (dCDT) will be recorded. An additional battery of neurocognitive tests will
      also be administered (Symbol Digit Modalities Test SDMT, Delis-Kaplan Executive Function
      System D-KEFS and TRAILS A/B).
