      intervention addressing tobacco use, tailored to SGM young adults; or (2) a 6-month Facebook
      intervention targeting tobacco use. Both interventions will include 180 days of
      Facebook-based messages and activities tailored to participants' readiness to quit smoking.

      Assessments will occur at baseline, 3, and 6 months follow-up. Assessments will include
      measures on smoking, thoughts about abstinence, and SGM identity experiences. All
      participants who report no past 7-day smoking will be asked to give biochemical verification
      of smoking status with saliva nicotine test kits that will be mailed to participants.
