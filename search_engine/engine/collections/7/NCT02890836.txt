      evaluated in the total cohort. From February 2018, the routine care includes treatment with
      prophylactic aspirin in all women with pre-existing diabetes and screening for vitamin D
      insufficiency, treated with vitamin D depending on the severity of the insufficiency. The
      prevalence of preeclampsia after initiation of the new treatment strategy will be evaluated.
      The women included from 2016-2018, where aspirin was only initiated if other risk factors to
      preeclampsia apart from diabetes were present, will be used for comparison.
