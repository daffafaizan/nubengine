      how much radiation attenuation is provided by XPF thyroid collars in absolute and relative
      terms. The secondary objective of the study is to measure and compare the amount of radiation
      that interventional radiologists are exposed to per case in an interventional suite setting
      using FDA approved XPF thyroid collars or standard 0.5 mm Pb equivalent thyroid collars.

      The third objective is to assess the operator comfort wearing the XPF protection devices. In
      order to achieve these objectives, measurements will be performed in 150 consecutive
      interventional procedures requiring C-arm fluoroscopy performed at BCVI. A prospective
      randomization will be performed, assigning participants to wear their own standard 0.5 mm Pb
      equivalent thyroid collar or to wear the FDA approved XPF thyroid collar. Radiation exposure
      will be monitored with 2 radiation detectors (TLDs, one inside and one outside the thyroid
      collar) which the participant is required to wear. After each procedure the participant will
      be asked to rate the comfort of wearing the devices on a scale from 1 to 100.
