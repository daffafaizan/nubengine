      patients undergoing cardiac surgery. POCD will not only increase the incidence of
      complications and mortality, but also influence the quality of life after discharging from
      the hospital. Many factors are associated with POCD, such as neuroinflammation, age,
      anesthetics, surgery stress response and genetic factors. But the underlying mechanisms are
      still unclear. Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) fMRI, which could monitor the peripheral
      neuron spontaneous activity according to the ratio of oxyhemoglobin and deaeration hemoglobin
      in blood, will be used to investigate whether POCD is induced by the variance in neurons
      metabolism and spontaneous activity in brain regions. Meanwhile, biochemical indicators will
      be detected to explore the prompting indicators of POCD. The present study is aimed to
      represent a promising precursory target for diagnosis and treatment of POCD, and provide
      novel evidence and insights on the brain changes induced by POCD.
