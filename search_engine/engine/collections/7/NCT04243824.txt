      Y-90 radioembolization performed using the Sniper balloon occlusion microcatheter to treat
      localized prostate cancer. This will be performed by evaluating Ga-68 MAA distribution on
      PET/MRI after injection into the prostatic arteries in patients without prostate cancer who
      are being treated with prostate artery embolization for benign prostatic hyperplasia. The
      distribution of the radiotracer activity within the prostate and any activity in adjacent
      organs will be determined for when the tracer is injected into the central prostatic
      arteries.
