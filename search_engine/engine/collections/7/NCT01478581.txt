    
      Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) is an enzyme that is present in hematopoietic cells other than
      T cells and is necessary for downstream signal transduction from various hematopoietic
      receptors including the B cell receptor as well as some Fc, chemokine, and adhesion
      receptors, and is crucial for both B cell development and osteoclastogenesis. Although
      down-regulated in normal plasma cells, Btk is highly expressed in the malignant cells from
      many myeloma patients and some cell lines. PCI 32765 is a potent and specific inhibitor of
      Btk currently in Phase 2 clinical trials. The current study is designed and intended to
      determine the effects of PCI-32765 in subjects with MM.
