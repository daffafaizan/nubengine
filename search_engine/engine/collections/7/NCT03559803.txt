      with cervical cancer are treated with radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy or
      chemoradiation. To improve the prognosis of cervical cancer patients, novel immunotherapeutic
      strategies need to be developed. Now there are some clinical phase I/II trials ongoing to
      assess the effects of ipilimumab, pembrolizumab and nivolumab in advanced cervical cancer,but
      information on the clinical significance of PD-L1 expression in cervical cancer is largely
      lacking.In this study, the investigator's primary objective:

      To analyse if the change of specific immune response will correlate with clinical effect of
      advanced cervix cancer after radio-chemotherapy.

      To evaluate the specific immune response throughout monitor the change of PD-1 in CD8 T cell
      and CD4 T cell and Treg cell in blood at baseline, before first brachytherapy and before the
      last brachytherapy in the advanced Cervix Cancer patients.

      To use IHC technique to monitor the change of PD-L1, CD68,CD8,CD4,PD1 and Treg expression in
      biopsy at baseline, before first brachytherapy and before the last brachytherapy in the
      advanced Cervix Cancer patients.

      To detect the change of TCR repertoire and TMB at baseline, before first brachytherapy and
      before the last brachytherapy in the advanced Cervix Cancer patients.
