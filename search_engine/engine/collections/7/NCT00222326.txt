      control, pelvic organ support, as well as other areas of pelvic health. It is also known that
      problems in some of these areas can develop after pelvic surgery. By addressing the
      requirements for good bladder and bowel function/control, and organ support in the early
      post-surgical phase when tissue repair and scar formation are critical, it is proposed that
      there will be a reduction in the long-term prevalence of bladder and bowel dysfunction, and
      weak pelvic floor and abdominal muscles in post-surgical patients. There have been no
      previous studies investigating whether a physiotherapy intervention can assist pelvic
      function in this group of surgical patients.

      This study aims to investigate the effect of a physiotherapy treatment program on pelvic
      function following gynaecological surgery.

      Comparisons: Pre- and post-operative physiotherapy treatment vs no treatment following
      gynaecological surgery.

      Outcome measures: Pelvic floor muscle strength, urine leakage, quality of life, sexual
      functioning, general fitness, measured at 3, 6 and 12 months post-operatively
