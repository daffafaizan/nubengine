      Based on the preliminary results from FP I (being published fall 2020) and a review of
      literature, the investigators would like to improve our telerehabilitation program and
      technologies in order to prepare for implementation of the FTP and technologies.

        -  The HF patients in FP I expressed that the KCCQ was too long when having to complete the
           questionnaire every other week. Therefore, the investigators would like to test a
           shorter questionnaire HeartQoL (ESC) as a patient-reported outcome tool every month.

        -  Video consultations instead of physical meetings with doctors and nurses at the
           hospital. Currently, there is a lack of evidence regarding the use of video to decrease
           physical visits at the hospitals instead of video consultations.

        -  Test of algorithms for detecting an increase in weight on two days following clinical
           cardiac guidelines (Ponikowski et al 2016).
