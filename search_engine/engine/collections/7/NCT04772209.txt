      renal failure needing urgent hemodialysis treatment is the lack of appropriate vascular
      access. In acute situations, vascular access is usually provided by non-tunneled catheters.
      Main problems with this temporaray vascular access is failure due to lumen thrombosis. anther
      major problem is catheter related infection. In some patients, there is a handicap of using
      heparin. In some situations, heparin is not preferred for use. In terms of the probable
      shortage of resources and cost-effectiveness, Investigators aimed to compare head to head the
      superiority and non-inferiority of each solution. Sodium bicarbonate was compared to the
      isotonic solution and found to be effective for a short time. The main aim of this study is
      to compare both classic Heparin and sodium bicarbonate in Femoral and Jugular catheters aimed
      for dialysis. In both arms, the maximum patency and the observed side effects will be
      recorded. The maximal time used will be recorded. statistical analysis will be planned to
      compare the two groups.
