      resuscitation (CPR) because of cardiac arrest. In the present study patients will be cooled
      to 33 degree Celsius after CPR for 24h. To avoid shivering patients will be analgosedated and
      medically paralysed. Analgosedation and relaxation have already shown to reduce oxygen
      consumption up to 20 % in critically ill patients.

      In patients with brain injury, who were cooled to 33 degree Celsius using a cooling meadow
      REE could be significantly reduced. In critically ill patients with pyrexia cooling using a
      cooling meadow REE could be reduced. Oxygen consumption was reduced about 14,7% per degree
      Celsius.

      So far no studies evaluating influence of therapeutic hypothermia on REE in patients after
      CPR have been published. Therefore we plan to measure REE in 25 cooled patients after CPR
      using indirect Calorimetry (Deltatrac II Metabolic Monitor, Datex Instrumentarium, Helsinki,
      Finland).
