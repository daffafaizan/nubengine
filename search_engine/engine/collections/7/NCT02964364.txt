      main branches and is characterized by adventitial thickening and cellular infiltration of the
      tunica media, with local destruction of vascular smooth muscle cells and elastin. The disease
      is very rare but most commonly occurs in China. In the last decade, the results of our study
      indicated that HLA-DPB1, HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQB1 and HLA-DRB1 gene alleles were associated with TA
      in Chinese Han population. And the clinical features of patients with TA were analyzed. The
      cytokines such as hs-CRP, NT-proBNP and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-Î±) can be used to
      monitor TA activity. But there are still many unknown fields in TA, such as the epidemiology
      and pathophysiology. This study is to build a Chinese national registry system for TA to
      obtain real-world information, such as current status of characteristics, diagnosis, disease
      activity, the severity of disease, treatment and outcomes of Chinese TA patients. To analysis
      and development of effective treatment strategies.
