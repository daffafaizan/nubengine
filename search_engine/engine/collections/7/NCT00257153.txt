      primary PCI are randomly assigned to two treatment strategies: standard PCI including
      stenting and abciximab (group1) or thrombus aspiration with Prontoâ„¢ extraction catheter
      (Vasc.solutions, Minneapolis) before standard PCI (group2). Patients with cardiogenic shock,
      previous infarction or thrombolytic therapy are excluded.
