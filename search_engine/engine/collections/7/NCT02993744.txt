      Cortisone influences the maternal number of leukocytes and CRP of a pregnant woman. Because
      of that, it is difficult to know if the medical treatment of an infection was successful and
      accordingly if the diagnosis was justified.

      METHODS

      In this study, the blood results of 75 pregnant women under threat of preterm delivery (week
      of gestation 23+0 to 34+6), treated with Betamethasone will be analysed. 65 pregnant women
      without complications serve as control group.
