      patients.

      Video laryngoscope is useful because of identification of anatomic structure around the oral
      cavity and vocal cord.

      Rigid video stylet resemble lightwand, but it has a video at the end of stylet. So rigid
      video stylet is useful at confirmation of vocal cord.
