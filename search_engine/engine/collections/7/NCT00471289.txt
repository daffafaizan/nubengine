      the western world due to the growing percentage of elderly in the population and the rising
      incidence of diabetes. In about 40% of patients a stenosis or occlusion in the arteries below
      the level of the knee will be present. Restoration of blood flow is imperative to allow pain
      relief and tissue healing. Without revascularization patients with CLI are at risk for limb
      loss and potentially fatal complications such as sepsis.

      In patients treated with percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty (PTA)significant
      restenosis is found in approximately 50% after 6 months.

      In interventional cardiology a significant reduction in restenosis rates in coronary arteries
      has been found using drug eluting stents (DES), including the paclitaxel eluting stent
      (TAXUS, Boston Scientific). DES locally deliver drugs (e.g. paclitaxel) that interfere with
      the restenosis process.

      Using DES in treating below the knee (infrapopliteal) arterial lesions in patients with CLI
      may improve patency and clinical outcome.

      Comparison:

      Treatment of below the knee arterial lesions in patients with CLI with PTA and DES compared
      to only PTA.
