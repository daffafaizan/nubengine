      re-hospitalization following discharge. This increased risk justifies intervention with novel
      therapy during the vulnerable post-discharge period to enhance clinical stability and prevent
      early HF mortality and readmissions.

      As heart failure (HF) progresses, impairments in metabolism render the heart substrate
      constrained, limiting cardiac metabolism. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is a naturally
      occurring incretin peptide that enhances cellular glucose uptake by stimulating insulin
      secretion and insulin sensitivity in target tissues. Preclinical and early-phase clinical
      data support GLP-1 as an effective therapy for advanced HF while use of GLP-1 receptor
      agonists in large numbers of patients with diabetes reveal a good safety profile and
      reductions in adverse cardiac outcomes.
