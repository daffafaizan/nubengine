      consumption timing on the absorption of zinc supplement.

      The main objective is to measure plasma zinc in generally healthy male subjects, who will
      consume zinc supplement with food or 30-min before food for 2-weeks.

      In addition to the primary objectives, correlations in enzyme activity with changes in fat
      metabolism, namely circulating triglyceride and cholesterol, will be determined. This will
      enable the determination of the effect of a low Zn intake on various aspects of dyslipidemia.
