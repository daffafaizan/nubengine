    
      This study will establish the acute phenotypical and biological effects of repeated dose
      application of SEN0014196 in patients with Huntington's disease, providing biomaterials for
      biomarker studies (levels of circulating huntingtin, acetylation status of mutant huntingtin,
      innate immune markers, transcriptional profiles). Evaluation of phenotypic effects will
      include UHDRS scores, total functional capacity. Safety assessments will include ECG, vital
      signs, laboratory safety tests and physical examination.
