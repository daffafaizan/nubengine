      making in cocaine-addicted and healthy control subjects using functional magnetic resonance
      imaging (fMRI), single photon emission tomography (SPECT), and neurocognitive tasks. We
      predict that cocaine-addicted subjects will demonstrate neurocognitive and neural alterations
      in measures of impulsivity and decision-making when compared to healthy controls. That is,
      cocaine-addicted subjects will show both decreased activation and decreased resting measures
      of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) of the brain structures associated with impulsivity
      and decision-making. Furthermore, neurocognitive and neural deficits associated with
      impulsivity and decision-making will be associated with each other and with measures
      indicative of an impulsive relapse and altered decision making.
