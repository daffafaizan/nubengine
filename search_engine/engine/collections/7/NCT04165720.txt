      disorders. Despite the potential mental health benefits, large proportions of patients with
      mental disorders do not meet the physical activity recommendations.

      Psychiatrists play a key role in the recommendation of physical activity to their patients.
      There are no previous studies that examine physical activity recommendation behaviour in
      German psychiatrists.

      The purpose of this study is to examine the physical activity recommendation behaviour,
      beliefs, barriers and exercise participation in German psychiatrists working with patients
      with mental disorders.
