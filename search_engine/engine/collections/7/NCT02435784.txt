      on treatment, treatment satisfaction and treatment adherence. However, different
      characteristics of psychosis barricade the communication between clinicians and patients.
      Consequently, the divergent views of needs of care between patients and clinicians may be
      established due to miscommunication. Such divergence may barricade the planning and the
      outcome of treatment.

      In Hong Kong, the core psychiatric services as well as early intervention for first episode
      psychosis patients are provided by psychiatric outpatient clinics. Mental health services in
      Hong Kong are overwhelmed by large demands of the services and inadequate mental health care
      workforce such as low psychiatrists-to-population ratio and psychiatric nurse-to-population
      ratio. The large demands of services and inadequate mental health care workforce restrained
      the services' quality. In some busy psychiatric outpatient clinic, a clinician needs to
      consult 30 patients in a 3-hour session. Hui et al. (2008) study showed that the mean
      consultation time in one of the general psychiatric outpatient clinic in Hong Kong is 5.8
      minutes.

      To sum up, a cost-effectiveness instrument is in need for the early intervention psychiatric
      outpatient clinic in Hong Kong. The instrument has to reduce the needs' divergence,
      communication between clinicians and patients, and enhance the patients' involvement of
      clinical decision-making in the rushed psychiatric consultation. The Two-Way Communication
      Checklist (2-COM) may satisfy the demand.
