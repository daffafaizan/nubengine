      patients with SFN. All enrolled patients will receive a trial neurostimulation (TNS) lasting
      from 3 to 30 days and only patients with a positive result in terms of pain intensity
      reduction will be eligible for the implanted neurostimulation (INS) phase. The target number
      of patients eligible for INS is 10 and this population will be assessed for impact of DRGS on
      the neuropathic pain caused by SFN. The expected duration of patients participation will be
      14 months. The rationale for this open label approach is that this is a novel technique for
      which pilot data with regard to applicability and efficacy have yet to be established. Data
      gathered in the study will provide preliminary data required to assess the feasibility of
      this intervention, to be used for possible future studies with a more rigorous methodological
      approach (i.e. controlled trial, randomized controlled trial).
