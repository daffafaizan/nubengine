      a number of surgical procedures in children. Rectus sheath block and local anesthetic
      infiltration of the surgical site are two common modes for providing post-operative analgesia
      following umbilical hernia repair. Studies comparing the two modes have shown
      ultrasound-guided rectus sheath block to improve immediate pain scores and reduce use of
      post-operative analgesia in pediatric patients undergoing umbilical hernia repair. However,
      these studies have compared pre-incisional ultrasound-guided rectus sheath block to
      post-operative local anesthetic infiltration as a subcutaneous and/or intradermal injection.

      The purpose of the investigators' study is to compare the efficacy of pre-incisional
      percutaneous rectus sheath block to intra-operative rectus sheath block under direct
      visualization prior to closure of the skin for providing post-operative analgesia following
      umbilical hernia repair in children.

      The investigators propose a prospective study where pediatric patients who are undergoing
      elective umbilical hernia repair will be randomized pre-operatively to receive either
      pre-incisional, ultrasound guided percutaneous rectus sheath block or intra-operative rectus
      sheath block under direct visualization prior to closure of the skin. The primary outcome is
      the post-operative pain rating based on the Wong-Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale (WBFPRS)
      following umbilical hernia repair. Additional outcomes measured will include: operative
      times, the use of intravenous/oral opioid and/or non-opioid medication in the post-operative
      period, duration of analgesia following surgery based on time to first rescue analgesic,
      intra-operative hemodynamic changes, post-operative hemodynamic changes, incidence of
      side-effects, and complications. Patients/patient guardians will receive a sheet to document
      post-operative WBFPRS scores, oral opioid and non-opioid medication administration once
      discharged to home for a total of 5 days.
