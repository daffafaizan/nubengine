      fasting(BSF) > 5.5 mmol/l & 2 hours postprandial >7.8 mmol/l was labelled as GDM. They were
      randomised to metformin or insulin group. Those assigned to metformin group were started
      metformin 500mg twice daily & increased until 2500mg depending on the blood sugar levels. Aim
      was to achieve blood sugar levels of BSF <5.3 mmol/l and 1 hour post meal<7.8mmol/l. If blood
      sugar levels were not controlled, insulin was added. The insulin group was given 3 injections
      of regular insulin & one intermediate acting insulin injection at night subcutaneously. Both
      groups were followed till delivery and outcome studied
