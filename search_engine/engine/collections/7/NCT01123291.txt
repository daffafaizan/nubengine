      performed to detect restenosis in a lot of PCI centers in Japan. On the other hand, previous
      studies reported that routine follow-up coronary angiography might lead to unnecessary
      reinterventions in asymptomatic patients. In this situation, the effect of routine follow-up
      coronary angiography on long-term clinical outcomes remains unknown. The purpose of this
      study is to evaluate the long-term clinical impact of routine follow-up coronary angiography
      after PCI compared with clinical follow-up alone. The primary endpoint of this study is a
      composite of death/myocardial infarction/stroke/emergency hospitalization for acute coronary
      syndrome/hospitalization for congestive heart failure at three-year after percutaneous
      coronary intervention. The design of this study is almost all-comer design enrolling patients
      received PCI without any exclusion criteria.
