      cardiovascular health are also associated with improvements in, or preservation of, cognitive
      function. Many believe "What's good for the heart is good for the brain." However, stronge
      scientific evidence is needed to prove this hypothesis. The rrAD study is a 4-arm,
      multicenter, randomized trial to assess the effects of aerobic exercise training and
      intensive pharmacological reduction of vascular risk factors on cognitive performance in
      older adults who have high risk for AD, that is, those who have high blood pressure, family
      history of dementia or subjective memory complaints. Furthermore, rrAD will examine effects
      of exercise and vascular risk reduction on brain volume, perfusion, and neural network
      connectivity using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
