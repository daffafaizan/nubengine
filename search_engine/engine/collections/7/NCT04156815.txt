      vulgaris (AV) but its side effect is a major concern for Asian patients.

      OBJECTIVE Investigators aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the 1,565 nm
      non-ablative fractional laser (NAFL) in combination with isotretinoin and pricking blood
      therapy (PBT) for treatment of AV.

      METHODS A retrospective analysis of 60 patients with moderate-to-severe AV was performed.
      Four groups (n=15) were evaluated: 1,565nm NAFL alone, oral isotretinoin alone, double
      therapy (1,565 nm non-ablative fractional laser + isotretinoin) and triple therapy (1,565 nm
      non-ablative fractional laser+ isotretinoin + PBT).
