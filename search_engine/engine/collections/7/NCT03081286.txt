      syndrome. These studies however have either been in the form of case series or unblinded
      studies with great risk of bias.

      It is believed that fat grafting with its content of adipose-derived stem cells can modulate
      the scar tissue upon grafting and hereby decrease pain.

      In this study patients will be randomized to either fat grafting or a sham procedure where
      they undergo the same liposuction but no fat grafting, only injection of saline instead of
      fat.
