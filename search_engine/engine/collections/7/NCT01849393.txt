      predictors of treatment success or failure for HIV infection. Ways to improve compliance,
      specifically rewards-based programs and electronic medication monitoring, have shown some
      success in limited clinical research studies focused on adult subjects. Because the social
      and developmental factors in adolescents are different from adults, adolescents may not
      respond to these interventions in the same way as adults. This study will investigate
      adolescent acceptance and the effectiveness of these programs.
