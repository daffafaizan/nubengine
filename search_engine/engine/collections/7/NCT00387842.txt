      either of the two procedures at a randomization ratio of 1:1. The trial will be stratified
      according to participating centre, resection type and gender.

      Disease free survival for all TNM stages after 3 years is currently about 70%. To detect a
      difference of 7% in disease free survival rate after 3 years between open and laparoscopic
      resection of colon cancer, 1200 patients will have to be included (60 vs 67%, two-sided
      analysis; alfa=0.05, beta=0.20, power=80% and p=0.05). All analyses will be performed on an
      intention to treat basis.
