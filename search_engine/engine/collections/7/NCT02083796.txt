      asymptomatic for shoulder symptoms. Both subjects will be randomly assigned to one of two
      intervention groups: thoracic spinal manipulation (TSM) or sham intervention. We want to know
      if possible changes in scapular motion and muscle activity following a TSM depend on the
      symptoms or if it is generic to everyone. Also, we want to know if TSM reduces shoulder pain
      immediately and in a short-therm period.
