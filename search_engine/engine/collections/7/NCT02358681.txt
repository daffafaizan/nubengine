      ketorolac for reducing pain in children with acute migraine headaches. We hypothesize that IN
      ketorolac is non-inferior to IV ketorolac in reducing acute migraine headache pain by a
      minimum clinically significant difference within 60 minutes of administration.

      Secondary Aim: Determine whether the time to achieve a clinically significant reduction in
      pain after receiving IN ketorolac is non-inferior to IV ketorolac. We hypothesize that IN
      ketorolac is non-inferior to IV ketorolac in the time it takes to achieve a clinically
      significant reduction in pain.

      We will conduct a prospective, double-blinded, randomized, non-inferiority, parallel 1:1
      clinical trial of eligible children in a single urban pediatric ED. We will block randomize
      patients to receive either 1 mg/kg IN ketorolac and an IV placebo (study group A), or 0.5
      mg/kg IV ketorolac and an IN placebo (study group B).

      We will assess the patient's pain at baseline, and then at 10 minutes, 30 minutes and 60
      minutes after administration of the study drug. The patient will then be assessed at 2 hours
      and 24 hours after study drug administration for outcomes related to efficacy, function, and
      safety.
