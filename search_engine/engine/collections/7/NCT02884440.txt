      lumbar spine or spondylolisthesis. This technique has many advantages attributed to the
      absence of posterior spinal muscular pain, a more direct visualization of the disk space,
      lower incidence of neurological injuriesâ€¦ However, patients experienced moderate to high post
      operative parietal abdominal pain due to this specific anterior approach. The systematic need
      for opioids administration may cause many complications and delay the post operative recovery
      time. The TAP block has been described as an effective pain control technique after various
      lower abdominal surgeries, reducing both pain scores and 24 hours opioids consumption.
      However the analgesic efficacy of this technique on specific parietal abdominal pain
      experienced after spine surgery by anterior approach is not clear
