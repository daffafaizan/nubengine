    
      This is an open-label (all people know which treatment the participants receive) Phase 2
      study to investigate the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of simeprevir, daclatasvir and
      sofosbuvir in treatment-naive (participants have never received HCV treatment with any
      approved or investigational agent) and treatment - experienced (participants have failed at
      least one previous course of [Pegylated] interferon [(Peg)IFN], with or without Ribavirin)
      participants. Participants will be assigned to 1 of 2 panels: Panel 1 (n=20): Child-Pugh
      score less than (<) 7 with evidence of portal hypertension (confirmed by presence of
      esophageal varices or HVPG greater than or equal to [>=] 10 mm Hg); Panel 2 (n=20):
      Child-Pugh score 7 to 9 (extremes included). The total study duration for each participant
      will be approximately 276 weeks. The study will consist of 3 parts: Screening Phase
      (approximately 4 weeks) and open-label treatment Phase (from Week 4 to 16) and follow-up
      Phase (until 5 years after the actual end of study drug treatment). Participants will receive
      simeprevir (150 milligram [mg] capsule), daclatasvir (60 mg tablet) and sofosbuvir (400 mg
      tablet) orally once daily for 12 weeks. Efficacy will be primarily evaluated by percentage of
      participants with SVR12. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
