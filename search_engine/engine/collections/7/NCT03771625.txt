      histological types and different degrees of malignancy. Intracranial GCTs make up 11.2% -
      15.3% of primary intracranial tumors in Asian children compared with 3.6% in the US. And
      tumors located at the basal ganglia is much rarer.

      The investigators realize that most of patients with tumors at this location are involved
      with motor disfunction. And after treatments, some patients get relieved dramatically, but
      some others failed to get similar outcomes. To better understand the mechanism causing this
      difference of treatment outcomes, the investigators perform BOLD-fMRI and DTI scans to
      patients with germ cell tumors in the basal ganglia before and after treatments. The changes
      of the fMRI and muscle strength of patients during treatments are evaluated, and the
      association between these two are investigated.
