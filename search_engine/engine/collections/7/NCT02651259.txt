      postpartum women with latent TB are at higher risk of developing active TB. This study
      evaluated the pharmacokinetics, tolerability, and safety of 12 once-weekly doses of RPT and
      INH in HIV-1-infected and HIV-1-uninfected pregnant and postpartum women with latent TB.

      This study enrolled HIV-1-infected and HIV-1-uninfected pregnant women with latent TB and
      their infants into two cohorts based on gestation. Cohort 1 participants were enrolled in
      their second trimester (greater than or equal to 14 to less than 28 weeks), and Cohort 2
      participants were enrolled in their third trimester (greater than or equal to 28 to less than
      or equal to 34 weeks). All participants received 12 directly observed once-weekly doses of
      RPT, INH, and pyridoxine (vitamin B6) at study entry and at 11 weekly follow-up visits. Study
      researchers would perform an interim analysis to assess the PK of RPT during the study, and a
      dose adjustment could have been recommended based on this analysis.

      Study visits occurred at days 0-3, once a week through week 11, and once a month until 24
      weeks after delivery. Visits would include physical examinations, obstetrical exams, and
      blood collection. Infants were followed monthly until 24 weeks after birth.
