      I. To assess feasibility of the Am mindfulness app in metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC)
      patients, with respect to accrual, adherence and engagement in program.

      II. To assess preliminary effects of app-based mindfulness intervention in patients with
      metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) (the Am Mindfulness-Based Cancer Survivorship [MBCS]
      Journey), on psychosocial outcomes (e.g., anxiety, distress, fear of cancer recurrence), as
      well as overall quality of life (QOL) and fatigue, among patients with mRCC.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients participate in a mindfulness-based program by using the Am app for 20-30 minutes
      every day, a minimum of 4 days each week over 4 weeks.
