      procedures while receiving antiplatelet therapy. Patients were identified from an
      administrative database by crossreferencing clopidogrel with abdominal operative procedures.
      The records of only patients who were actively receiving antiplatelet therapy, with the last
      clopidogrel dose within 45 days of their operation, were considered in the study.
