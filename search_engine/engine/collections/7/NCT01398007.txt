      camouflage syringe as compared to the conventional syringe in reducing dental anxiety and
      fear in children. The study was carried out in 100 children who consecutively reported to the
      study center and were allocated to the camouflage syringe arm or conventional syringe arm
      using block randomization to ensure equal distribution across trial arms. The study assessed
      the degree of dental anxiety and fear using Venham's clinical rating scale in conjunction
      with rating scale for movement, crying and overall behavior and Venham's Picture Test. The
      study also assessed parental emotional stress status when the child underwent the injection
      procedure and the reaction of the child after going home by Parental Emotional Stress
      Questionnaire and Recall Questionnaire, respectively. The study used appropriate statistical
      methods to determine the efficacy of the camouflage syringe in reducing the anxiety and fear.
