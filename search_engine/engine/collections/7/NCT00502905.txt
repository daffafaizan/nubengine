      therapeutic test dose of busulfan to test the blood levels over time; this information will
      be used to determine the subsequent high-dose busulfan doses. Patients who do not agree to
      the optional pharmacology procedure will receive a fixed dose of busulfan as has previously
      been done for 3 years.

      Patients in this study will then receive fludarabine through a central venous catheter over
      one hour, once a day, for four days. High-dose Busulfan will be injected through the catheter
      over three hours, once a day, for four days, starting immediately after fludarabine.

      After two days of rest, the allogeneic bone marrow, peripheral blood stem cells or cord blood
      will then be given intravenously. Patients will receive the drug Granulocyte
      colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF - Neupogen) as an injection under the skin until their blood
      counts recover.

      Patients will remain in the hospital for about 4-6 weeks. After discharge, patients will
      continue as outpatients in the hospital area until they are able to safely leave the
      immediate hospital area or for a minimum of 100 days after the transplant. Some patients may
      need to receive spinal taps with instillation of cytosine arabinoside and hydrocortisone
      several times over the year after transplantation. This is only for patients with a previous
      clinical history of leukemic involvement of the brain.

      This is an investigational study. The FDA has approved the study drugs. Up to 200 patients
      will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.
