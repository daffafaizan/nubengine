      The CVRx BAROSTIM THERAPY in Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction (HFrEF) Registry
      will be performed with subjects who have been recently implanted with the BAROSTIM NEO System
      in accordance with CE-Mark approved criteria for heart failure. Subjects must be enrolled
      within 30 days from implant. Up to 500 subjects will be enrolled at up to 50 sites. Data
      should be obtained from standard of care measurements taken prior to implant, at
      enrollment/baseline, and at 3, 6, and 12 months after the device was implanted, at which time
      each subject will be exited from the registry.

      Eligibility:

      Subjects can be included in the Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction Registry if they
      were implanted in the past 30 days and meet the CE-Mark approved indications, and are not
      contraindicated, for the BAROSTIM NEO System in the treatment of heart failure. The BAROSTIM
      NEO System is indicated for subjects with heart failure, defined as New York Heart
      Association (NYHA) functional Class III and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) â‰¤ 35%
      despite being treated with the appropriate heart failure guideline directed therapy.

      The contraindications are:

        -  Bilateral carotid bifurcations located above the level of the mandible

        -  Baroreflex failure or autonomic neuropathy

        -  Uncontrolled, symptomatic cardiac bradyarrhythmias

        -  Carotid atherosclerosis that is determined by ultrasound or angiographic evaluation to
           be greater than 50%

        -  Ulcerative plaques in the carotid artery as determined by ultrasound or angiographic
           evaluation

      Objectives:

      To describe change in the following measures at 3, 6 and 12 months compared to pre-implant
      baseline:

        -  New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class

        -  Six Minute Hall Walk

        -  Echocardiogram measures

        -  Biomarkers (e.g. NT-pro BNP, eGFR, Troponin HsT, Cystatin C).

      Evaluate health care utilization over follow-up, such as heart failure hospitalizations.

      Describe device programming and utilization
