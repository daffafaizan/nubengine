    
      This was a multi-center, prospective, randomized, single-blind, controlled, comparative
      efficacy and safety trial in 90 subjects undergoing spinal surgery, hepatic resection,
      specific soft tissue dissection, or peripheral vascular surgery, ((including peripheral
      artery bypass and arteriovenous graft formation for hemodialysis using either
      Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) or native grafts)). Subjects were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to
      Fibrocaps + Gelfoam or Gelfoam on the day of surgery.

      Use of the Fibrospray device was optional for spinal and vascular surgeries, but required for
      the general surgery procedures. All investigators using the Fibrospray device were trained on
      the correct and safe set-up and use of Fibrocaps and the Fibrospray device prior to
      participating in this clinical trial.
