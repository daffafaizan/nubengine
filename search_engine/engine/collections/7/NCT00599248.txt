      intra-articularly applied TissueGene-C in patients with chronic degenerative joint disease
      (DJD) who will be undergoing total knee replacement. In addition, data on joint pain, range
      of motion, and functionality will be obtained in this patient population prior to total knee
      replacement.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and biological activity of
      intra-articularly administered TissueGene-C as evidenced by observation of the injection site
      for irritation or other abnormalities affecting the incidence and severity of adverse events,
      and the changes in physical examination findings and laboratory tests as compared to the
      placebo control.

      The secondary objectives of this study are to:

        1. Evaluate the dose response of the hChonJb#7 cells in grafting at the defect as compared
           to the placebo control.

        2. Evaluate distribution of hChonJb#7 cells out of the injection site.

        3. Evaluate the regeneration of hyaline cartilage as determined by the histological
           analysis of the resected knee tissue.

        4. Evaluate the joint for evidence of tissue overgrowth or transformation.

        5. Evaluate the biological activity of TissueGene-C on joint pain, range of motion and
           functionality as compared to the placebo control
