    
      Parental Smartphone Use Management Scale (PSUMS) was originally developed in English language
      to parents to educate adolescents and communicate with them about online behavior and safety,
      as well as to conduct plans to manage adolescents' internet and smartphone use. The purpose
      of this study was to translate and cross-culturally adapt the PSUMS. The study will include
      adults who have been using smartphones for at least the past month and have children aged
      11-18. For cross-cultural adaptation, two bi-lingual translators used the back-translation
      procedure. Within a 5-to-7 day period after first assessment, the participants completed the
      Turkish version of the Parental Smartphone Use Management Scale (PSUMS) to evaluate
      test-retest reliability. Cronbach's alpha (Î±) was used to assess internal consistency. The
      correlations with the Turkish version of The Smart Phone Addiction Scale-Short Form for
      Adolescent and the Turkish version of PedsQL in Adolescents 13-18 years old will determine to
      check the validity.
