    
      Patients with reduced systolic ejection fraction (40≤ ejection fraction ≤55%) and pacemaker
      indication due to high degree AV block are included. The study has a randomized double
      blinded crossover design. Patients are implanted with a standard right ventricle lead and
      right atrial lead (if indicated), and in addition a His-bundle lead. Randomization is
      performed as to which pacing modality is used during the first 6 months. After 6 months the
      pacing modality is changed. Patients are blinded and endpoint adjudicators, including
      echocardiography staff, are blinded. Device nurse and physician are not blinded.

      Primary endpoint is difference in left ventricular ejection fraction after 6 months, paired
      comparisons are used and each patient is their own control. Secondary endpoints include
      complications and safety of the device/electrode, and quality of life.
