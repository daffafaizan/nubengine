      single patient visit. The lesion will be photographed with high resolution photography and a
      high resolution dermoscopic device.

      The lesion will then be prepared for RCM imaging. A skin contact device consisting of a metal
      ring and window will be applied to the skin surrounding the lesion of interest with a
      disposable medical grade adhesive. A wetting solution will be placed onto the skin. The
      wetting solutions include a high index oil such as a clear cosmetic oil or mineral oil. A
      wetting solution such as ultrasound gel will also be placed on the lens of the microscope.
      Application of these agents diminishes artifacts caused by light scattering at the skin
      surface. RCM images of the lesion will be captured through the window/contact device using
      the Vivascope 1500 reflectance confocal microscope provided by Lucid, Inc. Two types of
      images will be collected, mosaics and stacks. Mosaics are 12x12 confocal images that are
      optically combined or "stitched" together to create a seamless representation of a 6mm x 6mm
      total area at specific depths within the skin. Stacks are 0.5mm x 0.5mm confocal images taken
      at 5 micron intervals from the keratin layer to the superficial dermis. Mosaics and stacks
      will be acquired for the skin lesion. The total estimated imaging time for a patient in this
      study is about 10 minutes for each lesion. More than one lesion may be imaged per patient.

      After the imaging is complete, the lesion will be biopsied. All lesion images will be saved
      on a network server for later review and analysis. All imaging will be completed by trained
      research staff familiar with confocal imaging.
