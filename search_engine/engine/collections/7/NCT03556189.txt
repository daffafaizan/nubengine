      dysfunction. The most important risk factor is the ratio of ventricular pacing so the effort
      to reduce pacing ratio is needed. However, almost 100% ventricular pacing is inevitable in
      complete atrio-ventricular block patients with implanted pacemaker. Traditionally the
      ventricular lead of the pacemaker is positioned in right ventricular apex and previous
      literatures reported that such right ventricular apical pacing impedes physiological
      ventricular contraction and induces left ventricular contractile dysfunction in long-term.
      The alternative positions of ventricular lead are right ventricular outflow tract and
      ventricular septum but the benefits are not yet clearly prooved. Additionally, adjusting
      atrio-ventricular delay is reportedto affect cardiac output by altering diastolic filling.
      The investigators aimed to analyze the effect of AV dealy in long-term left ventricular
      contractile function.

      Patients over 19 years old who received or anticipated to receive permanent pacemaker due to
      AV block are randomized to 1:1 ratio into two groups. Patients in intervention group undergo
      reprogramming AV delay of pacemaker to the best value to increase cardiac output measured by
      transthoracic echocardiogram and the patients in control group undergo routinely scheduled
      pacemaker programming. Patients with underlying LV systolic dysfunction or significant
      valvular heart disease are excluded. Six-minute walk test, BNP, transthoracic echocardiogram,
      NYHA class are examined at baseline and after one year.
