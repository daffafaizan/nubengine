      The study was supported by the Small Grants Program established by the National Heart, Lung,
      and Blood Institute in January 1990 to provide limited support to extend analyses of research
      data generated by clinical trials, population research, and demonstration and education
      research studies.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      The first study used HHANES I data and analysis of variance to determine the possible body
      composition differences between subgroups of gender and smoking categories. Caloric
      differences in dietary intake were analyzed in a second ANOVA design.

      The second study used data from HHANES I and NHANES II to evaluate the independent and
      additive or synergistic contribution of smoking rate and fasting glucose on body weight.
