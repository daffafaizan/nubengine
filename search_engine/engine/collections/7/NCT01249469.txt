    
      Method: 40 subjects, who are non-gravid women between 45 to 65 years old and need to have â‰¥10
      solar lentigines on the forearms/hands, will be recruited. One to three flat lesions which
      are larger than 4 mm and with the same pigmentation intensity on the left or right
      forearm/hand, respectively, are designated the target lesions. However, all lesions on the
      randomly selected side will be treated with BEX-2011 twice a day. The opposite site will be
      treated with vehicle and is served as the control. Evaluation will be performed at week 0, 4
      and 8. At each visit, treated and control spots as well as their surrounding spotless skin
      will be evaluated using Pigmentation Index Scores, VISIA-CR, SIAscope, Dermascore, and
      harmonic generation microscopy. Evaluation of the efficacy of whitening will be compared to
      the baseline and to the control area between week 0 and week 8. Safety will be assessed using
      clinical monitoring and adverse event reporting.
