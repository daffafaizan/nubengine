      will be randomly selected who will be operated for shoulder surgery. Age, weight, ASA score,
      body mass index, additional dissease status will be recorded. The patients will be divided in
      two groups. One group will have cervical ESPB before the operation and the second group will
      be treated with multimodal analgesia techniques and both groups will receive patient
      controlled analgesia.

      Both groups will receive identical anaethesia protocols. Perioperative analgesia protocols
      will provide acetaminophen 1 gr and the same dose will be repeated in every 6 hours
      regardless of the pain scores. In postoperative period, the pain scores of the patients will
      be recorded according to the numeric rating scale (NRS) in every three hours. If pain score
      raises over 3/10 on NRS the patient will receive tramadol 100mg as rescue analgesia. In case
      of persisting pain first, meperidine 50 mg will be applied and other multimodal analgesic
      drugs will be added to protocol. At the end of the study 24 hours total opioid usage of
      patients, pain scores and side effects will statistically be analyzed.
