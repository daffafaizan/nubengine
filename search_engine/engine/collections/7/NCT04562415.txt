      stroke were randomized into active rTMS group (n=7), active cTBS group (n=7) and sham cTBS
      group (n=6). In the active rTMS group, 10 sessions of intact hemispheric upper extremity
      motor area (M1) were targeted and inhibitor rTMS was applied with a frequency of 1 Hz
      consisting of 1200 pulses for 20 minutes. In the active cTBS group, 10 sessions of intact
      hemispheric upper extremity motor area (M1) were targeted and cTBS was administered for a
      total of 600 pulses consisting of 3 burst stimulations of 50 Hz repeated every 200
      milliseconds for 40 seconds. Sham cTBS was applied in the same protocol but using sham coil.
      Within 30 minutes after TMS sessions, all patients underwent 10 sessions of joint range of
      motion, stretching, strengthening, balance and coordination exercises, hand rehabilitation
      and daily living activities under the guidance of a physiotherapist, regardless of which
      group they were in. Upper Extremity Fugl-Meyer Motor Function Scale, Modified Ashworth Scale
      (MAS), Functional Independence Measure (FIM), Motor Activity Log-28 (MAL-28) and Brunnstrom
      upper extremity and hand motor recovery stage were assessed at pre-treatment, post-treatment
      and follow up at 4 weeks.
