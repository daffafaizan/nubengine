    
      A Phase I safety study of intravitreal ketorolac in patients with chronic inflammation and
      complications due to inflammation who have either failed medical therapy or who cannot
      tolerate corticosteroids due to side effects.

      Specific Aims

        1. Test the safety of intraocular injection of 4mg of ketorolac in patients who have
           intractable uveitis or complications of uveitis such as chronic macular edema who are
           unable to tolerate corticosteroids due to their side effects.

        2. Test the efficacy of intraocular 4m ketorolac of treating inflammation or structural
           complications of inflammation in patients with uveitis who are unable to tolerate
           corticosteroids due to their side effects.
