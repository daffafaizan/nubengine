    
      Each participant will undergo a screening period, a treatment period, and a follow-up period.
      Participants will be followed until death, withdrawal of consent, or end of study, whichever
      occurs first.

      During the treatment period, participants will receive SNB-101 (dose range: 5 mg/m2 to 50
      mg/m2) intravenously on day 1 and day 15 of each 28 day cycle.

      Dose reductions are permitted after the DLT observation period, which occurs during the first
      28 days of treatment (cycle 1). Participants may permanently or temporarily (at the
      investigator's discretion) discontinue SNB-101. If a participant experiences a DLT or
      unacceptable toxicity, SNB-101 treatment should be interrupted until the observed toxicity
      returns to baseline or â‰¤ grade 1 toxicity. The start of the next cycle can be delayed up to 2
      weeks at the investigator's discretion.
