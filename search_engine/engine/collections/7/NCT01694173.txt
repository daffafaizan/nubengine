      medicine. In particular the past decade has garnered a great interest in cellular therapy for
      treating Type2 diabetes mellitus. The pertinent questions in regenerative medicine today are
      to know about the homing, survival, differentiation and functionality of the cells and based
      on these to find out the adequate administration methods and choose the optimal dose and cell
      types. Various modalities have been used in the preclinical and clinical trials. These
      include MRI,optical imaging in the form of bioluminescence and fluorescence, quantum dots,
      SPECT and PET/CT imaging. However the methods which are suitable for stem cell tracking in
      small animals are not easily translated for human trials. In humans PET/CT imaging with its
      reasonable resolution and unique ability to combine anatomical and functional imaging is
      considered to be the best bet yet. Hence we intend to label the autologous bone marrow
      derived stem cells with PET tracer F18-FDG and carry out biodistribution studies, our
      ultimate aim being to study how in vivo distribution of the cells affect therapeutic
      efficacy.
