      or control thinking groups. Participants will generate episodic future events or control
      information, as well as related text-based cues, and will be prompted via smartphone or web
      application to engage in episodic future or control thinking frequently in their natural
      environment (e.g., at home or work, before meal times, and in high-risk situations) for a
      4-month period. Participants in both groups will be provided with one-on-one, phone-based
      case management and provided with instructional materials and behavioral tools for weight
      loss and diabetes management. Instructional materials will include: 1) a modified version of
      the Traffic Light Diet, which utilizes red, yellow, and green labels for food to guide
      participants toward the goal of consuming low energy dense, low glycemic, high nutrient dense
      foods; 2) the Traffic Light Activity Program, which also utilizes red, yellow, and green
      labels for different levels of caloric expenditure, and 3) tools for self-monitoring of
      weight, diet, and/or physical activity.

      Participants will complete four laboratory-based assessment sessions in which the
      investigators assess body weight, height, waist and hip circumference, glycemic control
      (HbA1C), adherence to oral glucose-lowering medication, delay discounting, reinforcing
      efficacy of food, and blood pressure. These assessments will be completed before the
      intervention (Week 0), during the intervention (8 weeks), and immediately after the
      intervention (Week 16), as well after a 2-month post-intervention follow-up (Week 24). The
      latter three assessments sessions will also include questions to measure participants'
      perceived effectiveness and ease of use of the intervention. Participants will also complete
      several remote assessments, including dietary intake and physical activity (during Weeks 0,
      8, and 16; via accelerometer), as well as delay discounting and reinforcing efficacy of food
      (during Weeks 3, 8, and 16).
