      cancer women treated surgically and with indication for adjuvant chemotherapy, aged between
      18 and 75 years will be included. Patients will be randomized to receive 20mg of melatonin or
      placebo at bedtime. Treatment will initiate seven days before the start of chemotherapy to
      three days after the first cycle, totaling ten days. The sleep-wake rhythm will be assessed
      by actigraphy, which use will precede three days to start treatment. We will also evaluate
      the sleep-wake cycle by sleep diary. Other parameters will be measured as depressive
      symptoms, pain threshold pressure, effect on platelets and white series, the pain response to
      conditioned stimuli and quality of life. Serum markers of neuroplasticity will be measured as
      the Derivate Nerve Factor Brain BDNF and S100 Î². The icronucleus effect will quantified by
      cell material from the oral mucosa. We expect that the use of melatonin, as a competitor to
      chemotherapy and synchronizer, improves tolerance to adjuvant treatment of breast cancer
      chemotherapy adverse effects.
