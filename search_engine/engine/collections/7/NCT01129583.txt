    
      This is a randomized double blind placebo controlled prospective study in which botulinum
      toxin A (Botox®) or normal saline will be intraoperatively injected into the muscles
      surrounding the elbow following the surgical treatment of an elbow fracture or elbow fracture
      dislocation.

      Eligible patients will be identified by the Principal Investigator in his practice or by
      fellows and residents from the clinic population and emergency department admissions. After
      providing informed consent, all subjects will undergo a baseline examination that will
      include a medical and orthopaedic history, physical examination, and radiographs. The
      surgical procedure itself will not differ from the standard care for elbow fractures. The
      only difference is injection of Botox® or normal saline into the muscles of the injured arm.
      Subjects will undergo post-operative evaluation at various intervals for up to two years. The
      study and control group will be compared to each other and to contralateral arms in regards
      to elbow range of motion, patient questionnaire scores (DASH) and an observer-based elbow
      scoring system (Broberg and Morrey).

      Traumatic injury to the elbow resulting in a fracture or fracture/dislocation of the elbow
      often leads to a stiff elbow with limited function. Posttraumatic elbow stiffness is a common
      problem that is difficult to manage. The best way to decrease the morbidity is through
      prevention. An intraoperative injection of Botox® has been effective in treating upper limb
      spasticity disorders and may prevent the development of elbow stiffness, and decrease the
      need for future surgery to regain motion.
