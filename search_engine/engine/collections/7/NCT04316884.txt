      daily blood, urine and sputum sampling during their stay in intensive care. Data on organ
      dysfunction will be collected through the electronic patient journal and electronic patient
      data management system. The collected samples will be analysed for a panel of potential
      biomarkers that will be correlated to organ dysfunction and clinical outcome.
