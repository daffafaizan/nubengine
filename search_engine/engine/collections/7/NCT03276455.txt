      caused by mutations in the beta-globin gene which encodes the beta-globin protein, leading to
      the ineffective erythropoiesis, hemolysis and anemia. Transplantation of allogeneic
      hematopoietic stem cells (HSCT) is the only available cure which is, however, has the
      significant risk of transplant related mortality, graft versus host disease and limited
      source. Therefore, transplantation of autologous hematopoietic stem cells will be an
      attractive therapeutic treatment for beta-thalassemia major patients. 10 patients will be
      treated with genetically modified autologous hematopoietic stem cells which transduced with
      lentiviral vector encoding for beta-globin gene.

      Patients will participate for this study for 3 years.
