      I. Establish a biologic specimen repository (of tumor tissue, tissue arrays, lymphoblastoid
      cell lines, host DNA, tumor and host RNA, serum, and plasma) and database linked to clinical
      features and outcomes from well-characterized cohorts of children and young adults with
      Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      II. Provide specimens from diagnosis, early response evaluation, completion of chemotherapy
      and radiotherapy, long-term follow up, and relapse to study prognostic factors for early
      response, relapse, long-term outcomes, and identification of new biological targets for
      therapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients enrolled on Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) therapeutic clinical trials undergo collection
      of tumor tissue samples at baseline and at relapse or disease progression. Serum and
      anticoagulated peripheral blood samples are collected at baseline, at week 1, on day 1 of
      course 2, after completion of chemotherapy, after completion of radiotherapy, at 1 year after
      diagnosis, and at relapse or disease progression.

      Patients with relapsed or progressive disease who plan to enroll on HL relapse/retrieval
      clinical trials undergo collection of tumor tissue, serum, and anticoagulated peripheral
      blood samples at relapse or disease progression.

      Patients enrolled more than 1 year after completion of treatment undergo collection of tumor
      specimens, serum, and anticoagulated peripheral blood samples at time of clinical evaluation.
