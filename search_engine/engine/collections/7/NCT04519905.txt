      However, whether elective elderly patients can obtain survival benefits through
      chemoradiotherapy is not clear. Thus we design the clinical trail to answer the question.

      Three hundred and twenty elderly patients with ESCC would be recruited. There are two
      stratification factors including 80 years old and lymph node metastasis. The patients in the
      chemoradiotherapy group were treated with paclitaxel (45mg/m2) and carboplatin (AUC=2) one
      cycle per week for five cycles.The primary end point was 3-year overall survival (OS). The
      second end points included life quality, radiation side effects and 3-yr cancer specific
      survival. The life quality questionnaire included QlQ-C30 and OES-18.
