      disorders of known and unknown etiologies that are mostly chronic and associated with high
      morbidity and mortality. Genetic factors are important contributors to chILD. Genetic
      variations have been mainly described in genes encoding (or interacting with) the surfactant
      proteins (SP): SP-C (SFTPC) and the ATP-binding cassette-family A-member 3 (ABCA3) (ABCA3),
      and less frequently in the genes encoding NKX homeobox 2 (NKX2)-1 (NKX2-1), SP-B (SFTPB),
      SP-A (SFTPA) and other genes.

      Hydroxychloroquine has been reported to be useful in cases or case series of chILD including
      those with genetic causes alone or in combination with systemic steroids. However, the
      efficacy is highly variable and no randomized controlled study has been reported. The study
      is a randomized controlled investigation aiming to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      hydroxychloroquine in chILD with genetic causes.
