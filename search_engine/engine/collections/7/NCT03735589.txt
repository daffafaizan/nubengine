    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES I. To evaluate the safety, tolerability, and feasibility of
      intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of autologous tumor loaded DC vaccines (alpha-type-1
      polarized dendritic cell [alphaDC1]) combined with intradermally administered aDC1 .(Safety
      [Phase I aspect]) II. To measure the intraperitoneal induction and persistence of aDCI
      induced sensitized cytotoxic T Cells (CTLs), which express natural killer (NK) cell-like
      features (nCTLs) and total CTLs following intraperitoneal administration of aDC1. (Local
      Immunologic Efficacy [Phase II aspect])

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES I. To study the T cell populations generated that correlates with higher
      anti-tumor responses.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES I. To evaluate the progression-free survival and overall survival of
      patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of nCTLs, followed by a phase IIa study.

      Patients receive the alpha-type-1 polarized dendritic cell vaccine intradermally (ID) 2 weeks
      before day 0, on day 0, and on day 28. Patients also receive nCTLs intraperitoneally (IP)
      over 15-30 minutes on day 0. In the absence of unacceptable side effects, patients may
      receive the alpha-type-1 polarized dendritic cell vaccine every 1-3 months at the discretion
      of the physician.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 14 days, then at 6 and 12
      months.
