      (M-ROCC), a 24-week motivationally-responsive, trauma-sensitive, Group-Based Opioid Treatment
      (GBOT) program to a live-online control group, on the number of biochemically confirmed
      opioid negative abstinent periods (defined by a negative oral fluid test [negative for
      opiate, oxycodone, fentanyl, methadone] AND no self-reported illicit opioid use) during the
      final six two-week periods of the study (study weeks 13-24).

      Clinical secondary outcomes include level of anxiety measured by the Patient Reported
      Outcomes Measurement Information System - Anxiety Short Form 8a (PROMIS-ASF) among those with
      at least mild anxiety disorder at baseline (PROMIS-ASF T-score >55), level of pain
      interference measured by the PROMIS Pain Interference Scale (PROMIS-PISF), and the number of
      BZD or cocaine positive oral fluid tests (during weeks 13-24 of the study). Other exploratory
      outcomes will be level of anxiety measured by the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), 24-week
      treatment retention, as well as mechanisms of self-regulation assessed by self-report and
      behavioral measures (emotion regulation, decentering/metacognitive monitoring, interoception,
      experiential avoidance, self-critical rumination, and self-compassion) and their mediating
      effects on anxiety and opioid abstinence. Qualitative interviews will be conducted with at
      least 12 M-ROCC completers until thematic saturation is met to examine themes regarding
      live-online mindfulness delivery and to compare responses with our R21 qualitative outcomes
      from our in-person M-ROCC group model. Computerized Adaptive Testing for Mental Health
      (CAT-MH) will also be used to assess changes in psychiatric co-morbidity. Finally,
      exploratory outcomes of stigma, mindfulness, perceived stress, pain catastrophizing,
      interpersonal conflict, and shared identity within group will be measured.
