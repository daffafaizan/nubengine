      dysfunction. It produces great distress to sexual harmony and even fertility. Previous
      neurophysiology studies revealed an ejaculation-related control mechanism in the brain: left
      inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) activation during successful inhibition. If we use the left IFG
      as a seed, participants showed weaker resting-state functional connectivity (FC) activity,
      between the seed and two areas (left dentate nucleus (DN) and right frontal pole) compared
      with controls.

      The main goal is to compare whether the brain biomarker only exists in participants with LPD
      and how it responds to treatment with Dapoxetine and with tDCS against the IFG networks and
      lDN, measuring the connectivity changes in these brain networks and FC.
