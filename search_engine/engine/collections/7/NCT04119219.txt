      choroidal neovascularization secondary to angioid streaks.

      receive antiangiogenic therapy in accordance with the approved indications for use indicated
      in the instructions for the use of drugs in Ukraine.

      developments of the Filatov Institute of Eye Diseases and Tissue Therapy of the NAMS of

      these diseases leads to an irreparable loss of central vision.
