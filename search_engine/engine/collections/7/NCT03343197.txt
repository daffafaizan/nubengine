    
      A phase-1, multi-center study in recurrent non-enhancing gliomas with IDH1 R132H mutation for
      patients who require surgery. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the suppression of
      2-HG by comparing the concentration of 2-HG in resected tumors from IDH1 mutant glioma
      subjects following AG-120 or AG-881 treatment with the 2-HG concentration in untreated,
      control tumors. The safety, tolerability, PK/PD, and anti tumor activity data from the study
      in subjects with recurrent non-enhancing Grade 2/3 LGG with an IDH1 R132H mutation for whom
      surgical resection is indicated will identify the recommended dose of AG-120 and AG-881 for
      future studies in glioma.
