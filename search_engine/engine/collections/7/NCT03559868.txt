      responses in the peripheral blood of healthy subjects. We hypothesize the reduction in innate
      immune inflammatory responses will be expected in the peripheral blood with the effect of
      oral digoxin.

      To investigation of how human peripheral blood immune cells change their inflammatory
      responses after exposure to digoxin in vitro.
