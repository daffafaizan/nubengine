    
      This is an open-label, single-arm study of neoadjuvant ADT and chemotherapy in subjects with
      non-metastatic, locally-advanced prostate cancer who are eligible for radical prostatectomy.

      Patients will be treated with 4 monthly injections of degarelix along with two 8-week cycles
      of chemotherapy. Each cycle of chemotherapy will consist of 6 weeks of chemotherapy and 2
      weeks of rest. In the absence of toxicity or disease progression, patients will receive 2
      cycles of treatment prior to radical prostatectomy.

      The primary endpoint will be complete or near-complete pathologic response.

      Safety will be assessed on any patient receiving at least one dose of study drug by the
      reporting of adverse events, vital signs and by the assessment of findings on physical exam
      and routine safety laboratory determinations. The severity of adverse events and certain
      abnormal laboratory findings will be assessed according to the NCI CTCAE V4.03.

      Laboratory-based studies will evaluate the following:

        -  Complete metabolic profile

           o BUN, creatinine, alkaline phosphatase, ALT/AST, total bilirubin, LDH, calcium,
           albumin, glucose, magnesium, uric acid, phosphorous

        -  Electrolytes

           o Sodium, potassium, chloride, CO2 content

        -  Hematology

             -  CBC with differential, platelet count

             -  PT, INR, PTT

        -  Testosterone

        -  Biomarkers

             -  PSA

             -  CTCs
