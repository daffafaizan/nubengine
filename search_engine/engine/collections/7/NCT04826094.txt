      however the possible protective HIV antibody levels, which were induced by the modestly
      protective RV144 vaccine regimen with alum, rapidly decayed. Potentially, a novel, highly
      selective adjuvant combined with the correctly sequenced HIV antigen could slow antibody
      decay, increase antibody magnitude and induce antibodies of appropriate functional response.

      RV460 is an exploratory study that will assess the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity
      of a vaccine regimen consisting of priming with an Env-C Plasmid DNA vaccine (with or without
      novel adjuvants) when given with or without adjuvanted HIV Env gp145 C.6980 protein vaccine
      and boosting with adjuvanted gp145 C.6980 protein with or without the gp120 DNA vaccine. The
      study will be carried out in Kericho, Kenya. 126 healthy adults will ben enrolled.
      Participants will be randomized into one of seven groups which have 15/3 vaccine/placebo
      recipients per group. Each participant will receive six injections (prim at week 0, 4, 12;
      boost at week 20, 32 and 56) and will be followed-up for a total of 108 weeks.
