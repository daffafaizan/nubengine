    
      Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS) is a frequent respiratory problem of preterm infants and
      an important cause of morbidity and mortality.

      The management of this disease usually includes intubation, surfactant administration and
      mechanical ventilation in infants less than 1500 grams. However, in patients over this
      weight, the treatment has not been standardized and depends on the clinical progression of
      oxygen requirements.

      Hypothesis:

      - Early CPAP and selective surfactant administration is an effective treatment for RDS in
      infants >1500 g. This could decrease or avoid intubation and surfactant administration.

      Comparison(s):

      Early surfactant administration, when the FiO2 ≥ 0.4. compared to selective surfactant
      administration when the arterial to alveolar oxygen tension ratio (a/APO2) is ≤ 0.21.
