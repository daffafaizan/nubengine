    
      Research Objective/Significance:

      Specific Aim 1a: To quantify the Pes and BP during periods with and without UAO during sleep
      in persons with MFS.

      Specific Aim 1b: To examine the effect of CPAP treatment of UAO on Pes and BP in MFS persons.

      Specific Aim 2: To examine the effect of CPAP treatment of UAO on daytime markers of
      hemodynamic stress (augmentation index, reactive hyperemia index) in MFS persons.

      Primary Outcomes:

        -  Overnight measure of hemodynamic stress (blood pressure, pleural pressure swings)

      Secondary Outcomes:

        -  Changes in diurnal markers of hemodynamic stress (augmentation index, reactive hyperemia
           index)
