      To demonstrate if delayed timing of surgery after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy actually
      affects pathological complete response (pCR) and reflects on disease-free survival (DFS) and
      overall survival (OS) rather than standard timing. Eight weeks are the current standard
      interval to surgery after neoadjuvant treatment, while 12 weeks represent the "minimum"
      longer time interval to determine further tumor modifications and the "a priori" choice to
      avoid hypothetical surgical detrimental effect (postoperative complications related to
      radiation therapy).

      Primary Endpoint

        -  pCR

      Secondary Endpoints

        -  DFS

        -  OS

        -  QoL (quality of Life)

      Site Eligibility

      The trial is a multicenter collaboration, involving all those centers able to provide the
      standard of cure for locally advanced rectal cancer. All the involved centers have to respect
      the following criteria:

        -  Site able to perform robotic-assisted and standard laparoscopic rectal cancer surgery
           and TaTME (transanal total mesorectal excision)

        -  Site able to provide a preoperative work up according to the work up criteria specified
           in this trial

        -  Site able to provide standard neoadjuvant treatment, both chemo and radiation therapy,
           according to the criteria specified in this trial

        -  Predicted capability to recruit a minimum of 15 patients per year to the trial.

      Randomization will take place after consent is obtained and after patients have completed
      their baseline patient reported questionnaires. Patient consent and randomization will take
      place as close to the date of start of the neoadjuvant treatment as possible and must be no
      more than 30 days prior to planned treatment.
