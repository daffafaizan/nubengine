      standardized clinical vignette presentation, clinicians made an initial imaging decision for
      the patient. This was followed by additional information on decision support rules,
      malpractice outcome review, and patient cost; each with opportunity to modify their initial
      order. The malpractice and cost information differed by assigned group to test the any
      temporal relationship. The simulation closed with a second vignette and an imaging decision.
