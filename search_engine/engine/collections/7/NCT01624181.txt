      samples from ventilated critically ill patients could be a fast and secure alternative to
      conventional microbiological diagnostic methods in the identification of human pathogenic
      microbes in the setting of hospital-acquired pneumonia. Therefore aspiration samples from
      intubated and ventilated critically ill patients, which are suspected to develop such an
      infection, will be collected and cultivated for a short period of time. The headspace over
      these cultures will be analyzed using MCC-IMS - a technology that allows on time detection
      and identification of very small amounts of substances in complex and humid gas samples.
      Conventional microbiological investigations, including MALDI-TOF, will be carried out
      parallel to the MCC-IMS analyses.
