      severe and life threatening. To find the cause of insect sting allergy is important in
      prevention and specific treatment such as immunotherapy. The skin prick test and sIgE of
      these insects may have cross reactions so it is difficult to be interpreted.

      The usage of sIgE recombinant venom allergen can benefit in separate cross reaction and dual
      allergy reaction.
