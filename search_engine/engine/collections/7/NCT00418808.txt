      birth. There are many etiologies to the syndrome such as: brain malformations, infections
      during pregnancy, pre and perinatal, anoxic brain damage etc. A high risk group for these
      causes is preterm infants and infants of multiple pregnancies.

      Major motor deficits or brain insults are recognizable at early weeks but most of them are
      more subtle and are recognized at the age of one to two years. The General Movements
      methodology was developed by Prechtl HF is aimed to identify motor development deficits as
      early as 3 month. The methodology is using video recording to describe a trajectory of the
      development of spontaneous movements between birth and 3 month. Deviation from the trajectory
      was highly correlated with future motor mal-development.

      In our work we will study the motor development of infants of multiple pregnancies. These
      infants are one of the risk groups to develop CP. We will use the General movements
      methodology to identify CP as early as possible. It will generalize its predicative power to
      this risk group. Moreover, we will enlarge our knowledge of motor development by comparing
      the development of infants of the same pregnancy.
