      sequellar) brain disorders which can be degenerative, developmental or vascular. The patients
      who will be recruited will be known patients of our Service (University Clinic of
      Neuroradiology and MRI) that we follow during checks. The type of examination that will be
      applied to them, between MRI, EEG and NIRS, will be specified in the consent form. These
      examinations will not be invoiced either to the patient or to the social security, and the
      related costs will be borne by our Federative Research Structure or sometimes, when these
      explorations are upstream of a defined research protocol and funded, They will be financed
      under this protocol.
