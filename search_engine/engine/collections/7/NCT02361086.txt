      treatment-naive or who have failed prior therapy with abiraterone and/or enzalutamide. The
      study will examine several parallel QD dosing regimens of VT-464 using a traditional modified
      "3+3" Fibonacci study design. Approximately 3 dose-levels of VT-464 will be examined in each
      dosing regimen that is fully enrolled.
