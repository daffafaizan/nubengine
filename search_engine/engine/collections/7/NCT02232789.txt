    
      Mephedrone is a new psychoactive substance (NPS). At present, there are no randomized
      controlled trials evaluating the effects of mephedrone in humans. The current body of
      knowledge regarding the acute effects of mephedrone is based on anecdotal, self-reported
      effects (e.g. internet forums), case reports, and emergency room series and fatalities.

      The aims of this study are 1) to evaluate the abuse liability and human pharmacology of
      mephedrone after oral administration and 2) to compare the pharmacological effects of
      mephedrone with those obtained after administration of oral 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine
      (MDMA, ecstasy).
