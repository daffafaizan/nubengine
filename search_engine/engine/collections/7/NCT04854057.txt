      of low oxygen for brief periods (termed acute intermittent hypoxia (AIH)) combined with
      non-invasive transcutaneous electrical spinal cord stimulation (TESS) on restoring hand
      function in persons with chronic incomplete SCI.

      The fundamental hypothesis guiding this proposal is that daily AIH+TESS engage excitatory and
      inhibitory pathways, which converge on a common plasticity-promoting cascade that induces
      greater recovery of hand function than either one alone.

      Both treatments appear to enhance motor function in persons with cervical SCI. Despite their
      independent effects on promoting functional benefits, it is not yet know if they may promote
      greater functional benefits when combined. To be effective as a long-term rehabilitation
      strategy, it is essential to determine the efficacy of combined protocols of recurring
      AIH+TESS.
