    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Estimate the time to discontinuation of systemic immunosuppression in pediatric recipients
      of cluster of differentiation 45RA positive (CD45RA+) T cell-depleted peripheral blood stem
      cell transplant (PBSCT).

      II. Estimate the probability of graft failure in pediatric recipients of CD45RA+
      T-cell-depleted PBSCT.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Estimate and compare to an appropriate historical cohort the probability of chronic
      graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (National Institutes of Health [NIH] criteria) requiring
      treatment with systemic pharmacological immunosuppression in pediatric patients who receive
      CD45RA+ T cell depleted PBSC.

      II. Estimate the probability of acute GVHD grade II-IV.

      III. Estimate the probability of steroid refractory acute GVHD.

      IV. Evaluate immune reconstitution.

      V. Estimate the probability of transplant-related mortality by day 100.

      VI. Estimate the probability of relapse.

      OUTLINE:

      CONDITIONING REGIMEN: Patients undergo total body irradiation (TBI) twice daily (BID) on days
      -10 to -7, receive thiotepa intravenously (IV) over 4 hours on days -6 and -5 and fludarabine
      phosphate IV over 30 minutes on days -6 to -2.

      TRANSPLANT: Patients undergo CD34+ enriched, CD45RA+ T cell-depleted allogeneic PBSCT on day
      0.

      POST-TRANSPLANT IMMUNOSUPPRESSION: Patients receive tacrolimus IV continuously or orally (PO)
      every 12 hours beginning on day -1 and continuing through day 50 with taper. Patients also
      receive methotrexate IV on days 1, 3, 6, and 11.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for up to 5 years.
