    
      Pioglitazone hydrochloride, a thiazolidinedione compound, is a new therapeutic agent for the
      treatment of type 2 diabetes that reduces insulin resistance by enhancing insulin action in
      skeletal muscle, liver, and adipose tissue. In the study of diabetes, pioglitazone reduced
      the hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and hypertriglyceridemia characteristic of
      insulin-resistant states. The metabolic changes induced by pioglitazone result in increased
      responsiveness of insulin-dependent tissues and are observed in numerous models of insulin
      resistance.

      In the present randomized, double-blind, parallel study, we aim to compare the efficacy and
      safety of pioglitazone added to combination therapy of sulfonylurea plus metformin with those
      of sulfonylurea plus metformin for the treatment of type 2 diabetic patients.
