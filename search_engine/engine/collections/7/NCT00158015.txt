      outcomes in patients with heart failure(HF). Recent studies have shown significant
      symptomatic improvement and a decrease in hospitalization and mortality with CRT. However, up
      to 30 % of patients do not experience improvement with this invasive and costly therapy.
      Tissue Doppler Imaging (TDI) is emerging as an effective tool for non-invasively assessing
      mechanical dyssynchrony of the left ventricle (LV) and may aid in the identification of LV
      mechanical dyssynchrony to predict clinical response to CRT. PROMISE-CRT is designed to
      address the following hypothesis: Changes in tissue doppler imaging measures of left
      ventricular mechanical dyssynchrony from baseline to one week following cardiac
      resynchronization therapy will correlate with the clinical response at three months. Seventy
      HF patients clinically indicated to receive CRT will be enrolled in this six-month
      multi-center study conducted in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area. TDI analyses,
      measures of clinical improvement and LV remodeling will be conducted one week, three months,
      six months after CRT implementation.
