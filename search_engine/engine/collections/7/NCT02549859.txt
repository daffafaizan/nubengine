      to 130Hz stimulation and dopaminergic medications for two visits of at least 6-month apart.
      The 6 patients remaining on 60Hz stimulation after our previous study consisting of 7
      patients will be assessed once again as visit-2 after previous visit-1 of their last study.
      We anticipate to have 20 patents complete for visit-1 and at least 18 patients complete for
      visit-2 in this randomized double-blind prospective crossover study with their usual
      medication "on" state, with 6-7 patients on each starting condition (60Hz vs 130Hz vs DBS
      off). Swallowing function on modified barium swallowing test and swallowing questionnaire,
      FOG in stand-walk-sit test and questionnaire, and other axial and motor function on UPDRS-III
      will be assessed under each DBS condition. Changes in measurements between 60Hz and 130Hz at
      each visit and under 60Hz between two visits will be analyzed, with swallowing function and
      FOG as primary, and the rest as secondary outcomes, correcting for potential carryover
      effect. Changes between other DBS conditions might also be explored in this 2-year study.

      This would be the first study on the long-term effect of 60Hz stimulation on dysphagia, FOG
      and other axial and motor symptoms in Parkinson patients with bilateral STN DBS and FOG
      refractory to 130Hz stimulation and dopaminergic medications, which will have significant
      impact on the treatment of difficult axial symptoms of high morbidity and mortality.
