      but does not cure the disease. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is a curative treatment
      option but is associated with a high risk treatment-related morbidity and mortality.
      Dose-reduced conditioning prior transplantation allows also treatment of elderly patients
      with MDS. In the current trial allogeneic stem cell transplantation will be compared to
      5-azacytidine only treatment according to donor availability in elderly patients with MDS
      (55-70 years).
