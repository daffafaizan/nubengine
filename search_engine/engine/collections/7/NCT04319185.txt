    
      A patient identified by his/her nephrologist or the WellBound dialysis staff as a candidate
      for Peritoneal Dialysis (PD) who meets the inclusion criteria will be referred to the
      research staff for a discussion of the study and consent. A referral to this program can come
      from any physician referring to participating centers.

        -  Each subject consented into the study receives the standard of care education and
           training for home PD, in addition to the usual insertion of a PD catheter.

        -  The subject is then transferred to home PD with an individualized assistance plan and
           research follow-up.

        -  The subject receives the assistance of up to one visit per day depending on the
           subject's needs, as assessed by the interdisciplinary team, the nephrologist, and the
           primary investigator or delegate.

        -  The assistance will be provided by a research associate who has undergone full training
           in the PD techniques required to assist the PD subject at home.

        -  Every 4 weeks the PI or delegate reviews the subject's progress with the nephrologist
           and nephrology nurse to assess further assistance needs.

        -  Total assistance of up to 3 months is provided after which the subject is either
           independent, has a care provider, or has developed a plan with his/her nephrologist for
           future dialysis care.
