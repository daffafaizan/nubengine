    
      This is a multi-center, Phase 1b, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel-group
      trial in adults with mild to moderate AD. The primary endpoint is the change from the
      baseline CSF Amyloid beta oligomer concentration after dosing with CT1812 versus placebo. The
      change from baseline will be measured through a number of exploratory endpoints as indicated
      below. For each subject, the baseline CSF oligomer concentration will be computed as the
      average of the measurements from hours -4, -3, -2 and -1 and 0.
