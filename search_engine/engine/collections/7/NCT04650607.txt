      as potentially related to surgery, to antibiotics, or to phages, with the help of the HCL
      pharmacovigilance center. In addition, biobanking of pre- and post-treatment blood specimens
      (serum and cells) will determine whether phage immunization is implicated in particular
      adverse events. This observational cohort study will be initiated during year 1, in
      compliance with all French health authority rules
