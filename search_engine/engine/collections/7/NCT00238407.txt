      Primary

        -  Determine the local tumor-control rate in patients with locally advanced, unresectable
           esophageal cancer treated with docetaxel, cisplatin, and radiotherapy.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the feasibility of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the adverse reactions of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine local- and distant-failure and time to local- and distant-failure in patients
           treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the long-term survival rate in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine whether early improvement of dysphagia is a predictive marker in patients
           treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine quality of life and clinical benefit in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive docetaxel IV over 30-60 minutes and cisplatin IV over 1 hour on days 1, 22,
      43, 50, 57, 64, and 71. Beginning on day 43 (week 7) of chemotherapy, patients undergo
      radiotherapy once daily, 5 days a week, for 7 weeks.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, at day 22 and 43 during treatment, and then every 3
      months for 1 year after completion of study treatment.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 46 patients will be accrued for this study.
