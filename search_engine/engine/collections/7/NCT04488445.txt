      control group of 25 subjects each. After estimating one maximum repetition for all the
      participants in a previous session, the intervention group performed a resistance training
      based on a resistance exercise of 3 sets of 3 to 5 repetitions (90% of an estimated 1 RM)
      whereas the control group performed both stretching and balance exercises. Measures of
      executive functions ( i.e. a cognitive function associated with academic performance) were
      taken for all the participants before and after the training. Both independent and paired
      t-test will serve to check differences between and within groups respectively. The selected
      resistance exercise is based on a global muscle involvement.
