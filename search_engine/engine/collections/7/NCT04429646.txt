    
      This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, active controlled, clinical trial to evaluate
      the safety and effectiveness of the LAMax Left Atrial Appendage Closure (LAAC) System.
      Subjects with non-valvular Atrial Fibrillation will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the
      Experimental Treatment Arm (LAMax LAAC system) or the Control Arm (Watchman LAAC system,
      Boston Scientific Inc., USA). The trial is designed to demonstrate that safety and
      effectiveness of the LAMax device are non-inferior to the Watchman device.
