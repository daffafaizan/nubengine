    
      This is a single-center study which consists of 2 parts, sequentially conducted in 2 separate
      panels of 24 healthy adult Japanese participants each. Part 1 is a double-blinded (neither
      physician nor participant knows the treatment that the participant receives),
      placebo-controlled (placebo is compared with the study medication to test whether the study
      medication has a real effect in clinical study), randomized (the study medication is assigned
      by chance) single ascending dose (SAD) part which will consist of a screening phase, a
      treatment phase, and a follow-up visit. Part 1 will have 3 cohorts (Cohort A, B, and C) with
      8 participants each and they will be randomly assigned to receive either a single oral dose
      of TMC647055 (6 participants) or placebo (2 participants) in combination with RTV. The study
      duration for each participant will be approximately 5 weeks from screening to follow-up visit
      as maximum in Part 1. Part 2 is an open-label, randomized, 3-way crossover part which will
      consist of a screening phase, 3 treatment phases, and a follow-up phase. Each of the 24
      participants will receive Treatment A, B, and C in 6 sequences (Treatment ABC, BCA, CAB, ACB,
      BAC, and CBA) with a washout period of at least 7 days between consecutive treatments. Safety
      evaluation will include assessment of adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs,
      electrocardiogram, and physical examination. The study duration for each participant will be
      approximately 10 weeks from screening to follow-up visit as maximum.
