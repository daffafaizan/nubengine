      curative potential for several hematological disorders. Improvements in survival following
      allo-HSCT have led to its increasing use, but the leading cause of non-relapse mortality
      (NRM) remains graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD. Despite recent advances in the understanding
      of transplantation immune tolerance, aGVHD is a frequent and major complication of allo-HSCT
      involving activation of donor T-lymphocytes, which ultimately causes host tissue damage.
      T-Guard has a rapid onset, preferential killing of activated T cells, and short half-life,
      leading to depletion of allo-reactive T cells and quick post-treatment reconstitution of the
      immune system.
