      the onset of AF increases in post-operative cardiac surgery population. The rate of AF after
      coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) procedure range from 10-65% and from 37-50% after valve
      surgery. Rates of new onset AF are lower for CABG compared to valve procedures. The
      pathophysiology of post-operative AF is not well elucidated. It has been postulated that
      pre-operative factors such as age, past medical history, operative and post-operative
      remodeling of the coronary system and hemodynamic pressure changes may contribute to
      post-operative AF.

      Ranolazine is currently approved as an antianginal drug. The antianginal properties of the
      drug are due to inhibition of the late inward sodium current. Through the same mechanism it
      has been demonstrated in animal experiments and human studies that it can prevent atrial and
      ventricular arrhythmias.

      Therefore it is important to prevent or minimize the incidence of new onset post-operative AF
      in post-surgical population.
