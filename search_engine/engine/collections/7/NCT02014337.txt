      RP2D will be determined in up to 20 patients with metastatic breast or other specified solid
      tumors, regardless of receptor status; and Part 2, a dose expansion phase in which a
      preliminary estimate of efficacy will be made in an expansion group of up to 20 patients with
      glucocorticoid receptor-positive metastatic TNBC at the RP2D.

      Treatment will be administered in 21-day cycles, with the exception of the first cycle, which
      will be of 28 days duration with a lead-in of 7 days dosing of mifepristone.

      Cycle 1 (28-day cycle): Mifepristone administered orally (PO) with food once daily for 28
      days. Eribulin will be administered intravenously (IV) over 2 to 5 minutes on days 8 and 15.

      Cycle 2 and beyond (21-day cycle): Mifepristone administered orally (PO) with food once daily
      for 21 days. Eribulin will be administered intravenously (IV) over 2 to 5 minutes on days 1
      and 8.

      Enrollment in Part 2 of the study (dose expansion) will occur once the RP2D has been
      determined. Patients in the dose expansion study must have TNBC disease that is
      glucocorticoid receptor-positive (by immunohistochemistry [IHC]). Patients will be treated in
      repeated 21-day cycles until progression or another withdrawal criterion is met.

      Part 1 of the study is complete. Part 2 of the study is ongoing.
