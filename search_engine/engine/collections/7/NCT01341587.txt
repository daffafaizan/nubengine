      study, 100 patients with diabetes (Type 1 and Type 2) who are known to be non-compliant with
      SMBG will be enrolled and randomized to treatment groups (one group will receive a standard
      glucose meter and the second group will receive the cellular-embedded device) in order to
      achieve the following specific study aims;

      Primary Aim 1: Determine if connecting diabetic patients to care managers via a
      cellular-enabled glucose meter with feedback will improve SMBG testing compliance.

      Secondary Aim 2: Determine if increased testing compliance leads to improvement in overall
      blood glucose control. This will be measured by a reduction of HbA1c levels.

      Secondary Aim 3: Determine whether this intervention leads to significant improvements in
      patient satisfaction with self-care and patient self-assessment of compliance.
