      periodontal problems at the Department of Periodontology of the Faculty of Dental Medicine,
      Al Azhar University, Cairo, Egypt, between March 2012 to December 2012. The criteria
      implemented for patient inclusion were: 1) no systemic diseases which could influence the
      outcome of the therapy; 2) good compliance with the plaque control instructions following
      initial therapy; 3) teeth involved were all vital with score 0 mobility ; 4) each subject
      contributed matched pairs of two or three walled intrabony interproximal defects in premolar
      or molar teeth 5) the selected 2- or 3-wall intrabony defect depth ranged from 3-5 mm as
      detected in diagnostic periapical radiographs; 6) selected pocket depth (PD) ≥ 6 mm and
      clinical attachment level (CAL) ≥ 5 mm at the site of endosseous defect four weeks following
      initial cause-related therapy 7) endosseous radiographic defect angle ≤55 and ≥15 8)
      availability for the follow-up and maintenance program; 9) absence of periodontal treatment
      for the previous year; 10) absence of systemic medication or antibiotic treatment for the
      previous 6 months; 11) absence of a smoking habit and 12) absence of occlusal interferences.
      Pregnant females were excluded from participating in the study. Patients were also excluded
      from the study if they presented with opened interproximal contact, or inadequate compliance
      with the oral hygiene maintenance schedule. The experimental protocol was approved by the
      Ethical Committee of El Azhar University (OMD - 45 - 2012, clinical trial registration
