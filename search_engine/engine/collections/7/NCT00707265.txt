    
      This clinical trial was conducted to evaluate the rhBMP-2/CRM/CD HORIZON速 Spinal System for
      posterolateral fusion treatment of patients with symptomatic degenerative disc disease versus
      the control group of autogenous bone with the CD HORIZON速 Spinal System.

      The investigational treatment was the open bilateral posterolateral implantation of the
      rhBMP-2/CRM/CD HORIZON速 Spinal System. One investigational implant was placed across two
      adjacent transverse processes on each side of the spine during the spinal fusion procedure.

      The control treatment was the bilateral posterolateral implantation of the autogenous bone
      harvested from the iliac crest with the CD HORIZON速 Spinal System.
