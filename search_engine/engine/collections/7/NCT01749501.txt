      to eliminate the pain and discomfort associated with the elective intubation procedure. The
      study will be blinded and patients will be randomized in two different arms according to
      gestational age and identified by study number for pre-medication protocols. Demographic as
      well as study information prior, during and post intubation attempt will be recorded and
      closely monitored. Each patient will be monitored for study purposes for at least 24 hours
      after intubation attempt to record any potential side effects of the medication. The
      investigators plan to have a data safety monitoring board established composed of three
      pediatric doctors / specialists not associated with this study.

      The response of paralysis, onset and duration will be assessed clinically. Onset of muscle
      relaxation will be described as the absence of spontaneous movements and flaccidity, measured
      in seconds from the end of the medication administration. Duration of paralysis will be
      determined by the difference in time from the onset of paralysis to the return of spontaneous
      movements and pre-intubation tone
