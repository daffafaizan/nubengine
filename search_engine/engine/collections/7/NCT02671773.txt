      disease severity (as determined by BTS step). Although initial studies suggest that
      asthmatics of different severities may have similar microbiota composition, there is no
      direct evidence to support this assertion. Also, the three main studies in this area so far
      have all used different sequencing methods, making comparisons difficult.

      The relationship between the microbiota composition of different subjects and clinical
      measures including bronchial hyperreactivity (as measured by methacholine challenge) and
      pattern of airway inflammation (as measured by sputum differential cell count and exhaled
      nitric oxide levels) will be investigated further. Comparisons will also be made between
      samples from asthmatic patients using the inhaled steroid fluticasone and those using
      budesonide, as there is evidence suggesting that fluticasone leads to an increased risk of
      pneumonia and non tuberculous mycobacterial disease in certain patient groups. Unpublished
      data (Astra Zeneca) suggests the excess risk of pneumonia with fluticasone compared to
      budesonide may be more pronounced after at least 12 months of treatment with inhaled
      corticosteroid. Microbiota composition of the sputum samples will be evaluated in conjunction
      with standard microbiological culture of these samples to allow a comparison between these
      two methods.

      In order to assess the reproducibility of the induced sputum method for assessing the lung
      microbiota, a repeat sputum sample will be taken from a subgroup of 20 patients within 24
      hours of the collection of the first sample and compared. A further sample will be taken from
      this subgroup of patients 2 weeks later to assess the longitudinal stability of the bacterial
      population.
