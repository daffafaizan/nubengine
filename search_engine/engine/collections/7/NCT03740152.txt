      participant's forehead for about 30 minutes. The study involves, 1 screening visit which may
      last up to 3 hours, 3 transcranial light therapy treatment visits, and 1 posttreatment visit
      (5 total visits to the Massachusetts General Hospital).

      All eligible participants will have 1 visit with continuous light, 1 visit with pulsed light,
      and 1 visit with sham light. Cerebral blood flow will be measured before and after each light
      session using DCS-spectroscopy. During sham transcranial light therapy visits, the
      transcranial light therapy device will not produce near infrared waves (e.g., light energy
      that cannot penetrate the skin and cranium). The participant will not know which treatment is
      received at each visit.
