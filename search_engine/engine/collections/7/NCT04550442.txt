    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the safety and tolerability (phase 1) and overall response rate (ORR) (phase
      2) of venetoclax in combination with azacitidine in patients with high risk myelodysplastic
      syndrome (MDS) or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) with bone marrow excess blasts > 5%
      that are relapsed/refractory to prior hypomethylating agent (HMA) therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Rate of complete remission (CR). II. Rate of marrow/morphologic complete remission (mCR).
      III. Rate of hematologic improvement (HI; erythroid/platelet/neutrophil responses).

      IV. Rate of red blood cell (RBC) transfusion independence. V. Rate of platelet (PLT)
      transfusion independence. VI. Rate of cytogenetic response. VII. Rate of bone marrow blast
      response. VIII. Time to transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). IX. Duration of
      response (DOR). X. Overall survival (OS). XI. Progression-free survival (PFS). XII. Time to
      next MDS treatment (TTNT). XIII. Event-free survival (EFS).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To investigate the effects of therapy on MDS and to identify biological markers of
      response to venetoclax and/or its combination with azacitidine.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of venetoclax followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive venetoclax orally (PO) daily on days 1-14 and azacitidine intravenously (IV)
      over 15 minutes or subcutaneously (SC) on days 1-5. Cycles repeat every 4-8 weeks in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up within 30 days and then every
      3-6 months for up to 5 years.
