    
      Malignant biliary obstruction is a common condition caused by various carcinomas.The clinical
      process is usually silent and insidious,only 10-20% patients can be surgically removed once
      obstructive jaundice occurred.The long-term survival rate after resection remain
      dismal.Relief of obstructive jaundice plays major role on prognosis in patients without
      surgical indications.For unresectable patients,stenting the biliary obstruction is considered
      to be the preferred palliation modality to relieve pruritus,cholangitis,pain and
      jaundice.Although a number of new techniques for treatment of malignant biliary obstruction
      have been developed,there have been no significant differences in survival or quality of life
      comparing surgery bypass versus plastic stent insertion,metal stent insertion versus plastic
      stents insertion,or covered stent versus uncovered stents insertion in such patients.Our
      previous unicentric clinical trial has demonstrated the safety and technical feasibility of a
      biliary intraluminal irradiation stent insertion in patients with biliary obstruction caused
      by adenocarcinomas, such a treatment seems have benefits in relieving jaundice and extending
      survival when compared to a conventional biliary stent.However,the small sample size,the
      population distribution of two groups will influence the final results in obtaining a
      powerful statistical conclusion in the overall survival and stent patency between two
      groups.Therefore,a multicentric study was designed to prospectively compared the responses to
      the treatment with this irradiation biliary stent versus the conventional biliary
      self-expandable stent in patients with inoperable malignant biliary obstruction.
