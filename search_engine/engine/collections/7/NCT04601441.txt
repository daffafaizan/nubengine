    
      This clinical study is an open-label, multicenter, interventional, Phase 4 study to evaluate
      changes in genomic alterations for 73 PC driver genes during apalutamide treatment in
      patients with mCSPC. A total of 100 participants to be treated by apalutamide will be
      registered in this study. All participants will undergo blood collection for ctDNA,
      single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and human-leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing at pre- and
      posttreatment of apalutamide.
