      E. coli. The protein comprises Salmonella typhimurium flagellin type 2 (STF2; TLR5 ligand)
      fused to Human M2e. The active component of the VAX102 vaccine is manufactured by a standard
      fermentation process. Unlike the HA and NA viral proteins, the amino acid sequence of M2e has
      remained remarkably stable in all human influenza A virus isolates. Thus an influenza vaccine
      based on the M2e antigen could elicit cross-protective immunity against most human influenza
      A virus strains. VAX102 vaccine relies on a single cross-reactive influenza A virus antigen
      manufactured by a recombinant protein fermentation-production process.
