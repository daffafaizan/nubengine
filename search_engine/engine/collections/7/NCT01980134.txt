    
      To demonstrate the performance of the WavSTAT4 Optical Biopsy System when used at multiple
      centers.

      Endpoint targets are based on the ASGE PIVI recommendations on real-time endoscopic
      assessment of the histology of diminutive colorectal polyps.

        -  Primary endpoint: To demonstrate potential of the WavSTAT4 Optical Biopsy System to
           predict adenomatous histology with a NPV > = 90% for diminutive colorectal lesions.

        -  Secondary Endpoint: To show that use of the WavSTAT4 system used to determine histology
           of colorectal polyps ≤5 mm in size, when combined with the histo- pathologic assessment
           of polyps >5 mm in size, provides a ≥ 90% agreement in assignment of post-polypectomy
           surveillance intervals when compared to decisions based on pathology assessment of all
           identified polyps.
