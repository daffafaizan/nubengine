      the likelihood of pregnancy and childbirth in women with early ovarian insufficiency. The
      method may also "work" in women with poor ovarian reserve and poor response to routine
      fertility treatments.

      OBJECTIVE: To examine whether mechanical stimulation of ovaries by cutting the ovarian cortex
      treatment can increase eggs number aspirated during In Vitro Fertilization (IVF).

      METHODS: Patients eligible for the study with poor ovarian response will receive treatment
      including laparoscopic surgery, resection, and transplantation of ovarian tissue in the same
      operation to improve the chances of IVF success and pregnancy. Participants will be assessed
      for surgical incisions and fertility assessment up to two weeks after treatment, including
      general physical examination, US pelvic examination, and blood tests for a hormonal profile
      to determine the initiation of ovarian stimulation and IVF. Patients will be monitored from 2
      weeks to 1 year after treatment (once a week in the first two months and one month for one
      year after surgery), which will include a general physical examination, a pelvic ultrasound
      (US) and blood tests for the hormonal profile at the IVF clinic.
