    
      LEAP-BLOCK is a prospective, multi-center, randomized controlled trial that is designed to
      determine whether left bundle branch area pacing (LBBAP) may reduce the risk of RV
      ventricular pacing induced cardiac dysfunction as compared with traditional RV pacing (RVP)
      in patients with atrioventricular (AV) block and normal LV function (LVEFâ‰¥50%) who require
      high percent of ventricular pacing. The primary aim of this trial is to compare the time to
      first event (composite of all-cause mortality and newly heart failure hospitalization and
      device upgrade due to heart failure) between LBBAP and RVP group in patients with AV block.
      Patients with AV block and normal LV function who require high burden of ventricular pacing
      (expected >40%) will be randomized to LBBAP or RVP group for therapy. Patients will be
      followed at least every 3 months for clinical status and every 6 months for echocardiographic
      evaluation until the study closure.
