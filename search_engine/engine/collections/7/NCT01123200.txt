      wheelchair was also designed to determine the conditions and support structures necessary for
      use of a BCI in the home. In this study, people with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) will
      have a BCI in their home. They will receive training in order to operate and maintain the
      BCI. The BCI will allow them to access at least one task of primary interest to them. Task
      may include communication, computer access, control of assistive technology, or control of
      wheelchair seat position. Data concerning the use of the BCI will be collected throughout the
      study. Custom installations will be made for each participant to connect to their wheelchair
      and provide communication options if needed. Each installation is expected to be a unique
      prototype because of the differing control requirements for the individual wheelchairs in use
      by the participants.

      We intended to enroll six participants, but were only able to enroll one.
