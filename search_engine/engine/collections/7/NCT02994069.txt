    
      Patients will first be designated as either: a) Cohort 1 (locally advanced non-nasopharyngeal
      SCCHN that is unresectable) OR b) Cohort 2 (resected and at high risk of recurrence with at
      least one of the following criteria: extracapsular nodal extension, or invasive cancer at the
      primary tumor resection margin (positive margin), lymphovascular invasion or perineural
      invasion, pT3 or pT4 primary, or the presence of multilevel nodal disease. Subjects will then
      be randomized to receive either Arm 1 or Arm 2 cisplatin.

      Radiation and Cisplatin will be given concurrently and should start on the same day, Â±1 day.
      Radiation will continue without interruption whenever possible.

      Treatment will consist of standard of care radiation therapy to the primary tumor of the head
      and neck and involved nodal metastasis and draining nodal basin, as determined by treating
      radiation oncologist. Patients will be randomized to receive cisplatin at 100 mg/m2 every 3
      weeks (3 doses) during radiation versus cisplatin at 40 mg/m2 once weekly (7 doses) during
      radiation. This will provide similar cumulative doses of cisplatin in all arms of the
      study.IMRT will be delivered in 30-35 fractions over 6-7 weeks, 5 fractions weekly.

      In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse event(s), treatment will continue for 7
      weeks or until one of the following criteria applies:

      Disease progression,Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment,
      Unacceptable adverse event(s), Patient decides to withdraw from the study, or General or
      specific changes in the patient's condition render the patient unacceptable for further
      treatment in the judgment of the investigator.

      Patients will be followed for 2 years after completion of chemoradiation or until death,
      whichever occurs first, for toxicity and PFS.
