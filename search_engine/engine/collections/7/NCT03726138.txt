    
      This is a prospective cohort study of 299 participants from a GP-setting. Investigators will
      evaluate the occurrence of MSK pain at one-year follow-up and how the predictors (anxiety,
      depressive, and sleep problems and multi-site MSK pain) are associated with prognosis of MSK
      pain.

      A secondary aim will be to identify those factors associated with new onset MSK pain.
      Participants will complete a sleep questionnaire (the ATHENS insomnia questionnaire)
      containing 8 questions about sleep quality and quantity and a questionnaire (The Hospital
      Anxiety and Depression Score)) containing 14 questions focusing on anxiety and depression.
