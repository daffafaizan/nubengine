      are randomized to receive one of the two final combination tablet formulations of tamsulosin
      HCl and solifenacin succinate. In Period 1, 13 subjects receive one combination and 14
      subjects receive the other combination. In Period 2, the alternate treatment is provided.

      Screening takes place from Days -21 to -2 before the first admission day (Day -1). EC905 is
      administered from Day 1 to Day 12 (treatment period 1), and from Day 13 to Day 24 (treatment
      period 2). All treatments are administered with subjects in the fasted state.

      Blood samples for pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis of tamsulosin HCl and solifenacin free base
      are collected, and assessments of vital signs, safety electrocardiogram (ECG), safety
      laboratory, adverse events and concomitant medications are performed.

      Subjects are discharged on day 25 and an End of Study Visit takes place at least 10 days
      after the second treatment period, or after withdrawal.
