      following laparoscopic ventral hernia repair. We hypothesize that local analgesic injection
      between the abdominal wall and mesh intraoperatively during laparoscopic ventral hernia
      repair will result in a 20% decrease in the use of post-surgery pain medication in the first
      four hours after surgery.
