      offering school-based influenza vaccination clinics during school hours on influenza
      vaccination rates. A cluster-randomized trial (clustering by school) was conducted in Monroe
      County, NY. Twenty middle and high schools were paired based on several characteristics
      including urban/suburban,school grade-span (6-8th, 9-12th), school size, percent of students
      eligible for free or reduced school lunch, and influenza vaccination rates in the previous
      season among students in the school. School were randomized within pairs, with one school
      offering a school-based influenza vaccination clinic or and one school not offering the
      clinic (control).
