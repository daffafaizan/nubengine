      intractable pain due to malignancies involving the upper and mid abdomen. Recently,
      acupuncture is used as one of alternative interventions to treat cancer-related pains. This
      pilot study aims to investigate the effectiveness of pain-relief of acupuncture via comparing
      acupuncture plus NCPB with NCPB alone. Total 14 cancer patients with NCPB will be randomized
      into two groups of acupuncture and control.
