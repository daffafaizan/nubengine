    
      This is a prospective cohort study designed to investigate the range of metabolic
      abnormalities observed in patients living with HIV (PLWH) on antiretroviral therapy (ART).
      This study will also explore the concurrent role of poor oral health in supporting and
      driving chronic immune activation and inflammation in HIV infection.

      Following enrollment in study, patients will be followed up every 6 months for approximately
      2.5 years (30 months). During this period, comprehensive medical records will be obtained,
      and study data will be updated every 6 months; questionnaires will be handed to patients
      periodically to assess quality of life and effects of xerostomia on QoL; social history will
      be assessed using TAPS; oral health will be evaluated every 6 months and blood, saliva, and
      oral swabs collected every 6 months. DXA scan and panoramic radiographs will also be taken at
      baseline and 24 months.

      At the end of the study, caries rate, periodontal health, bone loss, QoL, salivary quantity
      and composition, presence or absence of white/red lesions, as well as inflammatory cytokines
      and immune activation markers will be assessed.
