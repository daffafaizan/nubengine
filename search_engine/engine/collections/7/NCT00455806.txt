      a PPI - based triple therapy containing clarithromycin, amoxicillin or nitroimidazole given
      for 7 days is the recommended first line treatment approach with an expected eradication
      success rate of approximately 80%. As second-line treatment option in case of failure, a
      RBC-based quadruple therapy is currently recommended curing another 80% of patients, leaving
      a subset of patients with persistent H. pylori infection. Resistance to fluoroquinolones is
      low in most countries,hence these compounds are potential candidates for second-line and
      rescue treatment. The new fluoroquinolone moxifloxacin launched by Bayer in 1999 for the
      treatment of respiratory tract infections, has a broad antibacterial spectrum comparable to
      levofloxacin but fewer phototoxic and central nervous system excitatory effects. The possible
      role of moxifloxacin in H. pylori eradication is since under clinical investigation
