      setting on the use of the Carpediem™ system and will evaluate the safety and performance in
      children requiring CRRT in the US. Data on survival and the effectiveness of the Carpediem™
      system on renal function recovery will be evaluated. A comprehensive evaluation of subjects
      being treated with Carpediem™ will include, but is not limited to, acuity at hospital/ICU
      admission and prior to CRRT initiation, Carpediem™ treatment parameters, laboratory data, and
      requirement for mechanical ventilation and/or inotropic support. Subject status and
      requirement for renal replacement therapy post hospital discharge will be evaluated at 30-
      and 90-days.
