      lost physical function. The current protocol evaluates the therapeutic potential of a EEG
      based driven BCI that is connected to a non-invasive pneumatic glove for rehabilitation of
      hand flexion/extension post-stroke. The system non-invasive, portable and low-cost. The
      utility and usability of the system will be investigated at two levels. First by means of
      questionnaires for patients and therapist and second by means of in depth analysis of the EEG
      signals during intended, imagined and passive driven hand movements in relation to no
      movement at all and the capacity of the BCI to distinguish between these conditions.
