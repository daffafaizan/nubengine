alterations of visual evoked response in the presence of homonymousvisual defects .the visual evoked response (ver) was studied by means of computeraveraging in 32 normal subjects, nineteen patients without visualdisorder but with unilateral cerebral lesions, and 30 patients withhomonymous visual field defects . an early negative-positive-negativecomplex was recorded between laterally placed occipital electrodes and avertex reference . latencies were prolonged in the hemianopic patients .some amplitude asymmetries were noted in the brain-damaged controls butwere more pronounced in patients with visual defects . the recordings inthe hemianopic patients were differentiated from those in both controlgroups by the presence of aberrant wave forms (2 cases),. prolongedlatencies (3 cases),. and amplitude depression of greater then 50 percent of the positive wave on the abnormal side (16 cases) . pathologicverification was obtained in three patients and demonstrated acorrespondence between alterations in the ver and the presence oflesions of the geniculocalcarine system .
