      intervention, called ArtontheBrain; a web-based application (app) aimed at promoting
      cognitive health in older adults, aging at home, through mentally and socially engaging
      recreation. The app was created in response to research showing: a) older adults with chronic
      health conditions experience reduced access to enjoyable recreation due to various barriers
      (e.g., sensory loss, cognitive decline, mobility limitations, geography and low mood); and b)
      participatory arts-based recreation is associated with health benefits in seniors (e.g.,
      enhanced well-being, improved physical health, decreased risk of dementia, and reduced use of
      healthcare resources). There are limited evidence-based solutions for consumers and this
      clinical validation will provide information about the efficacy of ArtontheBrain in achieving
      positive health outcomes to guide health practitioners and older adult consumers toward
      proven products.

      Based on quality of life (QOL) benefits for older adults, reported from participatory arts
      interventions, we hypothesize that engagement with ArtontheBrain will produce similar
      improvements in QOL in our study participants, driven by specific features of this type of
      intervention e.g., self-directed, flexible level of complexity, driven by the user. Secondary
      outcomes hypothesized for engagement with the intervention, include benefits to: active
      living, aspects of cognition (e.g., attention control, reasoning) and health seeking
      behaviours. These hypotheses are encouraged by findings from our initial pilot testing which
      showed improvement in self-perceived health-related QOL and reduced doctor visits in our
      pilot participants and established proof of principle for the ArtontheBrain with respect to
      positive user feedback on their experience with this recreation app.
