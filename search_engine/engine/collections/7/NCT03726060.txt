    
      Randomized controlled clinical trial with randomization according to a multi-phase design.

      Phase 1 involves the enrollment of patients with DTMs based on diagnostic criteria.

      Phase 2 includes the algogenic, kinetic and gnathological evaluation of the enrolled
      patients.

      Phase 3 provides for the adoption of the criterion to one of the 2 treatment groups on the
      basis of the randomization list.

      The 2 therapeutic protocols are:

        -  gnathological therapy (splint) associated with education and physiotherapy (test group);

        -  gnathological therapy (splint) associated with education (control group). During the
           first visit the patient will be enlisted by evaluating the inclusion and exclusion
           criteria and signed the informed consent, he / she will be assigned a unique
           identification code.

      The code consists of a progressive number followed by the patient's initials (eg 01-F.R.).

      Subsequently, the patients will be randomized blinded and assigned to one of the two study
      groups.

      Randomization will be performed using random, computer-generated, centralized numbers placed
      in sealed opaque envelopes provided by the study coordinator.

      Both types of treatment will be performed by a single operator respectively.
