    
      The primary objective of this randomized controlled trial is to investigate the effects of
      motivational nondirective resonance breathing (MNRB) and transcutaneous vagus nerve
      stimulation (tVNS) on autonomic health and pain intensity in participants diagnosed with
      chronic widespread pain (CWP). Two versions of MNRB and two versions of tVNS will be
      delivered and practiced by participants at home for two weeks. Primary outcomes are
      photoplethysmography (PPG) measured heart rate variability (HRV) and self report numeric
      rating scale (NRS) pain intensity. Secondary outcomes are pain detection threshold (PDT) and
      pain tolerance threshold (PTT) determined by pressure cuff algometry, blood pressure, as well
      as health related quality of life.
