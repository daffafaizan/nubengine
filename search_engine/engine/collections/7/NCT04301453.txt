      make up sleep wake cycles including quiet sleep, active sleep, and transitional sleep. The
      amount of time that infants spend in quiet sleep increases as they mature. There are
      different tools that can be used to measure sleep state including EEG, behavior, and vital
      signs. Recent research has looked at ways to improve sleep in infants admitted to the NICU
      including music and maternal voice. The investigators are interested in studying maternal
      scent. Maternal scent has been shown to improve infant feeding and to reduce infant crying
      during painful procedures. Therefore, the investigators are interested in studying how
      maternal scent might affect sleep wake state in infants admitted to the NICU. The
      investigators will observe infant behavior and use EEG and vital signs to assess sleep state
      in infant after they are exposed to maternal scent.
