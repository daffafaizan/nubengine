    
      The Xenium+ is a new high flux dialyzer made from Polynephron membrane designed and
      manufactured by the Nipro Company in Japan. This dialyzer has been subjected to in-vitro
      testing, and all legally required biological safety tests have been conducted and CE-mark was
      granted in June 2010. Xenium+ has the same Polynephron membrane as the Xenium family of
      dialyzers which has been available commercially globally for approximately three years.
      Clinical evaluations have been completed with the Polynephron membrane within the last three
      years. The improvement in the Xenium+ line is that the casing is now made from polypropylene.

      The aim of the dialyzer evaluation is to compare performance characteristics and
      hemocompatibility of the Xenium+ (Polynephron), Fresenius FX and Gambro Polyflux dialyzers.
