      I. To describe radiographic progression free survival (rPFS) associated with selinexor in
      patients with abiraterone (abiraterone acetate) refractory metastatic castration-resistant
      prostate cancer (mCRPC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To measure prostate-specific antigen (PSA) changes at 12 weeks post-selinexor initiation.

      II. To assess time to PSA progression. III. To measure time to development of >= 2 new bone
      lesions. IV. To compare the relationship of abiraterone-resistance status (primary vs
      acquired) and treatment outcome.

      V. To determine the effect of selinexor on persistent pain associated with bone metastasis
      using the brief pain inventory (BPI) short form.

      VI. To describe the safety profile of selinexor in patients with metastatic
      castration-resistant prostate cancer.

      VII. To determine the effect of selinexor on circulating leukocyte exportin 1 (XPO-1)
      expression, leukocyte gene expression profile and macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1 (MIC-1)
      messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression.

      VIII. To assess serum selinexor trough levels as a function of dose and time since last dose.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the relationship of XPO-1 expression to PSA decline. II. To describe the
      expression profile of metastatic tumor and outcome. III. To describe the type of progression
      (e.g. pain, bone etc). IV. To define XPO-1 expression in patients for whom pre- and
      post-treatment biopsy is obtained.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive selinexor orally (PO) on days 1 and 3 of weeks 1-3. Courses repeat every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days and then every 6
      months thereafter.
