      risk of dengue virus infection. Dengue viruses cause dengue fever, as well as the more severe
      dengue hemorrhagic fever/shock syndrome, and dengue virus infection is the leading cause of
      hospitalization and death in children in several tropical Asian countries. This study will
      evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a live, attenuated dengue virus called
      rDEN1delta30, which is derived from the Western Pacific DEN1 serotype.

      This study will last 180 days. Participants in Cohort 1 will be randomly assigned to receive
      rDEN1delta30 or placebo at study entry. Cohort 2 will begin only after safety review of all
      participants in Cohort 1. Participants in Cohort 2 will receive a higher dose of rDEN1delta30
      or placebo.

      After vaccination, participants will be asked to monitor their temperature every day for 16
      days. Study visits will occur every other day after vaccination until Day 16, followed by 4
      additional visits at selected days through Day 180. Blood collection and a targeted physical
      exam will occur at each study visit. Some participants will be asked to undergo a skin biopsy
      or additional blood collection at selected visits.
