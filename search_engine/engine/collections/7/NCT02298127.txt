      addictive behaviors such as smoking cessation. However, some methodological limitations can
      be identified among clinical trials in this area, and it is not clear whether it is more
      efficacious to use the commonly-used acupoints or other points that are specifically for
      reducing the withdrawal symptoms of nicotine. The study addresses the identified
      methodological shortcomings of the previous similar studies. It consists of a total of three
      intervention groups, which allows comparisons between the commonly-used acupoints of
      acupressure, acupoints specific to smoking cessation, and a sham-controlled intervention. The
      study does not only focus on the efficacy of smoking cessation but also assesses the mediate
      effect of auricular acupressure on nicotine withdrawal by questionnaire and biomarkers.

      This is the first study of its kind to yield information on the acceptability and
      effectiveness of a safe, available auricular acupressure technique on smoking cessation in
      Hong Kong. The findings could provide further information for the development of future
      tobacco-control activities targeting smokers in a wider population who would like to use
      acupressure as a treatment option.
