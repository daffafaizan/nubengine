        1. PURPOSE: Older adults with diabetes faint frequently, due to an impairment in the
           cardiovascular control mechanisms (arterial baroreceptor function, autonomic nervous
           system function and cerebral autoregulation) that prevent syncope. The purpose of this
           study is to examine the ability of a home based walking program to reverse these
           impairments.

        2. HYPOTHESES: a) A home-based walking program will improve the compensatory cardiovascular
           responses that prevent syncope in older adults with Type 2 diabetes. A moderate, regular
           exercise program will:

             -  increase arterial baroreflex sensitivity

             -  increase heart rate variability (marker of autonomic nervous system function)

             -  decrease cerebrovascular resistance

             -  improve cerebral autoregulation during upright tilt. b) There will be relationship
                between the improvement in compensatory cardiovascular responses and regular
                exercise.

                c) Design of more practicable training prescriptions than that used in a research
                setting.
