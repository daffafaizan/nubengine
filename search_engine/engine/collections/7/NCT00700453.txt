      usual media habits, subjects will have a baseline functional magnetic resonance imaging
      (fMRI) scan (Visit 2). They will then be assigned in a 3:1 ratio to either one-week of
      violent video game play for 1-2 hours per day or no video game play for one week. Subjects
      will receive a second fMRI scan at the end of that week (Visit 3). Subjects who had played
      violent video games will then be assigned to one of three conditions (continued regular
      violent video game play, no video game play, or an intervention involving cognitive training
      of working memory) for one week, in order to investigate the persistence of any changes that
      are found after the first week of exposure. Subjects who had not played video games during
      the first week will continue to not play video games for the second week. Following that
      week, subjects will receive a third fMRI scan (Visit 4). One week after the third fMRI scan,
      subjects will have a final visit or phone call to check on the possibility of any issues with
      aggressive thoughts/feelings/behavior following the video game exposure in the study (Visit
      5). Brain functioning will be measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) as
      the primary measurement methodology, with neuropsychological testing used as a secondary
      measurement methodology.
