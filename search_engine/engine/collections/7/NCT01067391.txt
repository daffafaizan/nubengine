      common issue for males with spinal cord injury (SCI).Patients with SCI are at risk of
      developing orthostatic hypotension, especially those with an injury at or above the T-6
      level.An earlier study of the shorter-acting PDE-5 inhibitor sildenafil (Viagra) revealed
      that it can cause orthostatic hypotension, tachycardia and dizziness after administration in
      the SCI population, and suggested that caution should be used in prescribing sildenafil in
      this population, as blood pressure can drop significantly. There is potential for the
      significant hypotension seen with the short-acting medications to be much more problematic
      with the longer-acting tadalafil.

      The study will be a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over
      design. This will be done by comparing the effects of administering tadalafil 20 mg and
      placebo on blood pressure (lying and sitting), and heart rate (lying and sitting). These
      measurements will be taken in the clinic setting prior to dosing, then repeated hourly for
      the first two hours post-dose, and again at four hours post-dose. The patient will repeat the
      measurements at home using an automated blood pressure apparatus at 12, 22,29 and 36 hours
      post-dose.In addition, the patient will record perceived dizziness on a visual analog scale
      ecah time the BP and HR are recorded.
