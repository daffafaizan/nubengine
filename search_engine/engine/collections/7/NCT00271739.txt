      receiving a telemedicine intervention and approximately 750 receiving usual care. Eligibility
      requires having diabetes, being a Medicare beneficiary, and living in a medically underserved
      area. The project is conducted in New York City, in northern Manhattan (urban component), and
      in rural upstate New York through a consortion of participating institutions based at the
      State University of New York (SUNY) Upstate Medical University at Syracuse (rural component).
      Subjects are randomized to receive telemedicine case management or usual care for diabetes.
      The intervention utilizes a home telemedicine unit (HTU). The HTU is a specially designed,
      web-enabled device with a data port connected to a home glucometer and home blood pressure
      cuff whereby measurements obtained with these devices can be directly uploaded to a computer
      database. A diabetes nurse case manager interacts regularly with intervention participants
      through videoconference via the HTU.
