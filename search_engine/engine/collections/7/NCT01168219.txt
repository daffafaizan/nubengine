    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine if this treatment can improve 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) in
      patients with high risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and in patients with acute myeloid
      leukemia (AML) >= 60 yrs age

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and feasibility of using post-transplantation azacitidine.

      II. To determine the ability to use pharmacokinetic-directed busulfan to achieve area under
      the curve (AUC) within 20% of target AUC in > 80% of patients.

      III. To determine the rate of grade II-IV and III-IV acute graft-vs-host disease (GVHD).

      IV. To determine the incidence of extensive chronic GVHD. V. To determine treatment-related
      mortality at 100 days and at 1 year. VI. To determine 5-year overall survival.

      OUTLINE:

      REDUCED-INTENSITY CONDITIONING: Patients receive fludarabine phosphate intravenously (IV)
      over 30 minutes on days -7 to -3, busulfan IV over 45 minutes on days -6 to -3, and
      anti-thymocyte globulin IV over 4-10 hours on days -6 to -5 (matched sibling donor [MSD]) or
      -6 to -4 (matched unrelated donor [MUD]).

      TRANSPLANTATION: Patients undergo allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation on day 0
      or on days 0-1.

      GRAFT-VS-HOST DISEASE PROPHYLAXIS: Patients receive tacrolimus orally (PO) or IV on days -2
      to 90 with taper on days 150-180. Patients also receive methotrexate IV on days 1, 3, 6
      (MSD), and 11 (MUD).

      CONSOLIDATION: Beginning on day 42, patients receive azacitidine subcutaneously (SC) or IV on
      days 1-5.

      Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for 6 courses. Blood and bone marrow samples may be collected
      periodically for correlative and pharmacokinetic studies.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 5 years.
