    
      This is a single center, sham-controlled, dose escalation study where cathodal tDCS is
      delivered to threatened but not yet irreversibly damaged (penumbral) tissue in patients with
      large vessel occlusion who are not eligible for blood flow restoring recanalization
      procedures. Patients will be randomized in a 3:1 design, to cathodal versus sham (control)
      stimulation, at each six designed dose tiers. The dose tiers will be increasing in both
      intensity and duration of the stimulation.

      The occurrence of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage will determine the pace of the
      escalation through the dose tiers.
