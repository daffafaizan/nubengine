      nutritional chemopreventive agent able to modulate key steps in melanoma progression and the
      expression of STAT proteins in melanocytic and stromal elements of atypical nevi, which are
      precursor lesions and risk markers of melanoma. Eighteen individuals in total will receive
      oral broccoli sprout extract rich in sulforaphane (BSE-SFN) standardized for 3 different
      concentrations of actual sulforaphane content which will be utilized in our study. Three
      groups of six patients will be randomly assigned to receive oral BSE-SFN at SFN dosages of 50
      µmol, 100 µmol, or 200 µmol daily. Due to the established safety of SFN at all of the
      proposed dosage levels, there is no plan to complete a lower dosage level prior to escalating
      to the next higher dosage level; i.e., subjects will be randomized across all of the proposed
      SFN dosage levels. However, the safety of BSE-SFN administration will continue to be
      evaluated through laboratory studies (CBC, chemistry) performed before and following 28 days
      of administration.
