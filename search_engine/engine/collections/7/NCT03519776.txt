      IVF/ICSI cycles and its effect on the pregnancy rate and oocyte quality is controversial,
      which arises from conflicting results in retrospective studies and meta-analyses. This study
      is assumed to examine if a natural daytime variation in progesterone levels may explain parts
      of the inconsistent findings from studies reporting divergent results concerning this matter
      and will be carried out by several blood samples from the same patient during the day of
      ovulation triggering. If variation is present, the impact of variation on the developing
      oocyte and embryo quality will be estimated by embryo quality indicators.
