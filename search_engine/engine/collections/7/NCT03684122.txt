      (MSCs) differentiated into neural stem cells (NSCs) in one of the most common neurological
      diseases. It will also aid in the better understanding of the role of stem cell therapy in
      relation to motor and non-motor symptoms in people with Parkinson disease. The safety
      outcomes would encourage launching similar larger studies. And also to facilitate the
      treatment and outcome results by giving differentiated mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into
      neural stem cells (NSCs) rather than allow the cells to differentiate inside the body. While
      the efficacy results if encouraging, would mean an improvement in the disability associated
      with PD and reduction in the life-time care and treatment provided to this category of
      patients in Jordan and the Arab region.
