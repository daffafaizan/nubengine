      mattress used at night. A recent study in patients with back pain showed that waterbeds and
      foam mattresses did influence back symptoms, function and sleep more positively than did a
      hard mattress. Pain improves with airbeds compared to regular innerspring mattresses. This
      study will analyze the effect of optically active particles mattress covers on sleep. The
      researcher is interested in learning if regular mattress or the study mattress cover
      (containing optically modified polyethylene terephthalate fiber mattress cover) is more
      useful in helping back pain and sleep quality.
