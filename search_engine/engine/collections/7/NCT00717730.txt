      children of developing countries.

      Many of these children have inadequate intakes of several vitamins and minerals. Folate and
      vitamin B12 are important for normal function of the immune system. Deficiencies of these
      vitamins are often part of general malnutrition and might be responsible for the excess
      morbidity and mortality seen in malnourished children. In a recent cohort study in almost
      2,500 Indian children we demonstrated that those with poor folate status had higher rates of
      diarrhea and pneumonia. This study also showed that children that were not breastfed had poor
      folate status and our analyses suggested that the effect of breastfeeding in preventing
      respiratory and gastrointestinal infections could be explained by the folate content of
      breast milk. The finding that poor folate status is related to increased susceptibility to
      childhood infections needs to be confirmed in well conducted clinical trials in populations
      where folate deficiency is prevalent.

      This trial aims to examine whether daily supplementation of 2 recommended doses of folate or
      vitamin B12 or both will lessen the incidence of acute lower respiratory tract infections and
      diarrhea. We will also measure if the supplementation improves the weight and length of
      supplemented children.
