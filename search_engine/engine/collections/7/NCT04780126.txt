      reason for staying is COVID-19 pneumonia will be included. The prevalence of sarcopenia in
      hospitalized patients is 15-20%. Assuming an alpha risk of 0.05 and a beta risk of 0.2 in a
      unilateral contrast, 64 subjects are required to detect a difference equal to or greater than
      20% loss of muscle mass. A loss to follow-up rate of 0% has been estimated.
