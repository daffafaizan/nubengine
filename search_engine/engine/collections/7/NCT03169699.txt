      disease such as upper respiratory tract infection, cough variant asthma, allergic rhinitis,
      bronchitis and pneumonia. These conditions are common ailments in childhood. The history of
      cough and description of cough given by caretakers and patients are often vague and
      assessment of cough quality is often subjective. The quality of cough is often assigned a
      dichotomous category of dry cough and wet cough.

      Computer assisted cough analysis has been developed in recent years to aid subjective
      classification of cough. The sound spectrum and frequencies of cough is being researched to
      better define the quality of cough. The quality of cough gives meaningful information about
      the state of the respiratory status. Cough sound analysis has been shown to rapidly diagnose
      pneumonia in humans using cough sound analysis and in differentiating wet and dry cough.

      The investigators hypothesize that each respiratory pathology will have its spectral cough
      characteristics. Analysis of cough spectrum and comparing to a library of cough spectra data
      will be able to aid differentiation of the underlying conditions for the various cough
      spectrum and hence facilitating management.

      The study aim is to develop a computer processing technique of cough sounds and determine
      their spectral characteristics for the common causes of cough to derive an assisted assay of
      cough spectrum for an objective assessment of cough.
