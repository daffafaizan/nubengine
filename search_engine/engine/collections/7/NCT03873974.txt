      and specificity of the experimental DualDur In Vitro Diagnostic System.

        -  The sensitivity of the DualDur in Vitro Diagnostic System will be examined in subjects
           whose physician indicates drug therapy for Lyme borreliosis (positive arm).

        -  The specificity of the DualDur in Vitro Diagnostic System will be examined in healthy
           volunteers declared Lyme borreliosis negative by their physician and all the standard
           laboratory tests prove that they are free of Lyme borreliosis (negative arm).

      The diagnostic system developed by Lyme Diagnostics Ltd. is planned for application in the
      diagnosis during the entire life cycle of Lyme borreliosis.
