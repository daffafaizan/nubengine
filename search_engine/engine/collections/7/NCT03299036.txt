      for chemoembolization for the treatment of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.

      The investigators will study the overall response rates of lesions with Taiwan ACE Beads.

      The procedure is similar with the other commercializing drug-eluting beads. At the target
      vessels, radiologists will inject doxorubicin with Taiwan ACE Beads instead of Gelfoam or PVA
      (polyvinyl alcohol). The end point of injection is also similar with conventional TACE.

      Determine the complication rates, progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS)
      following Taiwan ACE Beads embolization.
