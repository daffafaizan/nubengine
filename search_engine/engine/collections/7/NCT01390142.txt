      effective way to limit infarct size, which is a major determinant of morbidity and mortality.
      However, restoration of blood flow may paradoxically have deleterious consequences and lead
      to lethal myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury. Local ischemic postconditioning (IPost) and
      remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPer) are promising methods to decrease
      ischemia-reperfusion injury.

      The hypothesis tested in this research proposal is that RIPer initiated at the time of the
      admission in the cathlab reduces infarct size in STEMI patients treated with PCI.
      Furthermore, the investigators will determine whether a combined approach RIPer + IPost can
      further reduce infarct size.
