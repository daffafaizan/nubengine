      getting), randomized (like the flip of a coin), single-center, single-dose, 2-way crossover
      (method used to switch participants from one treatment arm to another in a clinical study)
      study in approximately 16 healthy adult participants. Participants will receive study
      medication under fed state first and later under fasted state or vice versa. The study
      consists of 3 phases: screening phase of approximately 3 weeks, an open-label treatment phase
      consisting of two 6-day treatment periods (Treatment period 1 and 2) with a 7- to 10 day
      washout between Day 1 of each treatment period, and a safety follow-up phase occurring 7 to
      10 days after the last study-related procedure on Day 5 of Treatment Period 2. The study
      physician will check participant's general health during the study. Total duration of study
      for each participant will be approximately 48 days.
