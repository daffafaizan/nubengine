      79.7% of the Obstetrics and Gynecology residents were female. Given the striking decline in
      male providers selecting OB/GYN in more recent years, it is critical to characterize patient
      preferences in the current environment.

      Nevertheless, it is not clear that females have strong preferences regarding gender. We hope
      to better understand the influence of bias on physician gender in present day.

      The purpose of this study is to describe female population preference based on physician
      gender and specialty.

      The study will be conducted on an online platform distributed across the United States by the
      aid of SurveyMonkeyÂ® .
