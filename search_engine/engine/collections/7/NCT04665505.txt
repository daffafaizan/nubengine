    
      This intervention pilot study has been developed for Intensive Care Unit (ICU) physicians and
      nurses by the Resource Optimization Network (RON) for implementation in The Ottawa Hospital
      (TOH) Civic Campus and the Montfort Hospital. The intervention targets ICU staff and is
      designed to reduce overall costs associated with ICU health care service delivery and improve
      staff satisfaction through reducing stress and associated burnout without sacrificing quality
      of care and patient outcomes. The intervention involves two components that (a) build ICU
      staffs' (i.e. physicians and nurses) knowledge to facilitate cost-effective and
      evidence-based decision making about patient care (including tests, treatments, and
      procedures); and (b) optimize nurse scheduling to ensure the presence of the appropriate
      number of nurses per shift, thereby reducing stress, burnout and limiting the need for
      overtime. To evaluate the impact of the intervention, a pre/post-intervention design will be
      employed, with a 3-month pre-intervention period, followed by a 6-month intervention period
      and a 3-month post-intervention period.
