    
      A5297 was a Phase I/II, open-label, proof of concept, two-step, two-arm, randomized
      controlled clinical trial (RCT) to test the superiority of lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r)-based
      antiretroviral therapy (ART) to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase (nNRTI)-based ART for
      clearance of Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) subclinical parasitemia (SCP).

      The study consisted of two steps. At study Step 1 entry, participants were randomized 1:1 to
      either LPV/r-based ART or nNRTI-based ART for 15 days. In study Step 2, all participants
      received nNRTI-based ART and TMP/SMX prophylaxis for 15 days. The total study duration was 30
      days.

      Study visits occurred every 3 days in Step 1, and every 5 days in Step 2. At each study
      visit, 2 samples were taken for measurement of parasite density, except day 15 and day 30 at
      which 3 samples were taken.

      Adverse events which occurred after randomization were also recorded. Signs/symptoms and
      diagnoses were evaluated at each visit, while safety labs (including Hemoglobin, hematocrit,
      white blood cell count (WBC), differential WBC, platelet count, and absolute neutrophil count
      (ANC), glucose, electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate), total bilirubin, AST
      (SGOT), ALT (SGPT), albumin, alkaline phosphatase, and creatinine) were taken at day 15 and
      day 30, or if indicated at other study visits.
