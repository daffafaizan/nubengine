      to physically uncomfortable. Patients' lives are affected in physical, psychological, social,
      sexual and occupational aspects. These burdens may cause patients to assume maladaptive
      habits and coping mechanisms, leading to a downward spiral in functioning within society,
      prohibiting patients from achieving their highest potential quality of life.

      The investigators' study goal is to create and validate Chronic Quality of Life (CQOL) index
      that explores habits, career paths and other life choices psoriasis patients make as a result
      of coping with their disease that may not be impacted by therapy implemented at a given point
      in time. In creating this questionnaire and validating it the investigators will collect
      preliminary data. The investigators think this data will show that patients who were
      diagnosed at a young age will have worse chronic quality of life. In the long run, the
      investigators will use the CQOL index in studies in which patients are treated for psoriasis
      to determine which treatments can change a psoriasis patient's chronic quality of life. This
      information will be used to create guidelines for treatment focused on achieving a patient's
      optimal quality of life.

      Another aspect that the investigators would like to look at is the skin carotenoid levels in
      the psoriasis population. Previous studies showed that psoriasis patients had lower levels of
      skin carotenoids when compared to healthy volunteers. This observation was not statistically
      significant perhaps due to a small sample size (21 subjects in the psoriasis group and 35
      subjects in the control group). Skin carotenoid levels measurement is optional for study
      subjects.
