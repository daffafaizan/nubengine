      pericardial lining and is often associated with asbestos exposition. There is no cure for
      most malignant mesotheliomas and the scope of all three major oncological therapeutic
      procedures (surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy) is to reduce/eliminate symptoms as well
      as to prolong progression free survival (PFS) and/or overall survival (OS). While progressive
      patients are still in good health able to undertake a second-line treatment, there is no
      standard treatment for progressive disease.

      Lurbinectedin is a novel compound structurally related to trabectedin and with similar mode
      of action. Pre-clinical data showed a better safety profile than trabectedin. Lurbinectedin
      has been already tested in different Phase I-II trials showing promising activity in ovarian,
      pancreatic, breast, small and non-small cell lung cancer as well as in other tumor types,
      with objective responses averaging 30%, disease stabilization up to 75% and having manageable
      toxicity. Although lurbinectedin has not been widely tested in mesotheliomas, some
      mesothelioma patients have been already treated with lurbinectedin where again promising
      activity has been observed.
