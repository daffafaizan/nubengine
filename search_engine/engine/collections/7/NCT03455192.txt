      achieved. Therefore efforts to develop effective treatment approaches remain an important
      objective in the treatment of gingivitis to prevent periodontitis especially in patients at
      high risk for developing periodontitis as smokers.

      Smoking is a major risk factor for the incidence and the progression of periodontal diseases.
      The increased periodontal disease susceptibility in smokers is predominantly caused by
      changes in inflammatory and immune responses. Cigarette smoking also influences the amount
      and the composition of subgingival plaque. Smokers have higher numbers of pathogens in their
      resident biofilm and display an ongoing host response even after biofilm removal. Different
      approaches were explored to reduce the negative effects of smoking on the outcomes of
      periodontal therapy Synbiotic were defined as a mixture of probiotics and prebiotics that
      beneficially affects the host by improving the survival and implantation of live microbial
      dietary supplements in the gastrointestinal tract, by selectively stimulating the growth
      and/or by activating the metabolism of one or a limited number of health-promoting bacteria,
      and thus improving host welfare. Also in some cases, this may lead to a competitive advantage
      for the probiotics among with other bacteria.
