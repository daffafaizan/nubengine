      study will be submitted to endoscopic procedures under conscious or deep sedation. The
      patients will receive an intravenous injection of 2.5-5 mL of 10% sodium fluorescein at the
      beginning of the endoscopic procedure. The endoscope will target the area of interest and the
      confocal probe will be passed through the endoscope biopsy channel. The probe will gently and
      perpendicularly touch the mucosal surface of the area of the interest. The images will be
      recorded and a presumptive diagnosis will be made. The area of interest will be biopsied and
      the histology results will be considered the diagnostic gold standard method. We will
      calculate the diagnostic accuracy of the presumptive diagnosis provided by the confocal
      endomicroscopy examination.
