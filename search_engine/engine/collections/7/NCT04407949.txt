      initiation of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy is important to verify the
      therapeutic success. In clinical practice, the internal records of CPAP devices are utilized
      to determine the therapeutic success, during either medical consultations or telemetric
      observation.

      This study was designed to evaluate the quality of SDB Event Indices (EI), which are recorded
      by the CPAP device (Prisma, LÃ¶wenstein Medical Technology).

      The detected events of a manual scored polysomnography (PSG) in the sleep laboratory will be
      compared with the simultaneously recorded events of the CPAP device.

      This shall lead to recommendations regarding the situations, and in which degree the event
      detection of the CPAP devices may be meaningful to determine the therapeutic success of home
      sleep apnea therapy.
