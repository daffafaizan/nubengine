      trigger when a provider orders platelet transfusion above a threshold supported by current
      guidelines. The alert will provide information on current evidence and give the provider the
      option to cancel the order or proceed. The alert will not be triggered in procedural areas
      such as the operating room or as part of any emergency orders to prevent any delays to urgent
      patient care.

      The proposed project will evaluate this alert by randomizing its implementation by patient
      chart. The investigators will observe the prevalence of this alert and its impact on ordering
      practices for the next 3 months. For patient charts randomized not to receive the
      intervention, the providers will not receive any alerts, but the analytics tool will record
      if the alert would have been triggered and the pertinent clinical information. After a period
      of three months, the investigators will review patient and provider information through
      analytics tools, assessing differences in platelet usage between the patients whose charts
      showed the alerts vs. those (control) patient charts not showing alerts.
