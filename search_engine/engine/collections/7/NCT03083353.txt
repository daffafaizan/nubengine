      research in animal models of addiction. Our goal is to evaluate the enhancing effect of
      isradipine, an FDA-approved calcium channel blocker, on the extinction of craving-a key
      mechanism of drug relapse after periods of abstinence. To activate craving robustly in human
      participants, we will use multimodal smoking cues including novel 360Â° video environments
      developed for this project and delivered through consumer virtual reality headsets. Adult
      smokers will take either isradipine or placebo and complete the cue exposure protocol in a
      double-blind randomized control trial. In order to test the hypothesis that isradipine will
      enhance retention of craving extinction, participants will repeat cue exposure in a
      medication-free state 24 h later. The study will be implemented in a primary care setting
      where adult smokers receive healthcare, and smoking behavior will be tracked throughout the
      trial with ecological momentary assessment.
