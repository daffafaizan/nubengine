      number of different names making literature searching difficult. The term Osteolymphoma has
      been proposed to make searching easier in the future. Patients in this study undergoing
      staging which includes isotope bone scanning and PET scanning where available. Eligible
      patients then undergo treatment with three cycles of CHOP chemotherapy at conventional doses
      and shrinking field radiotherapy to a total of 45 Gy. Monoclonal antibodies are not included
      as good results have been obtained without using them. After treatment the patients are
      regularly monitored. The trial is presented twice per year at the meetings of TROG, ALLG and
      AROLG.
