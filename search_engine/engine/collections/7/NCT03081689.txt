    
      Phase II, single-arm, open-label multicenter study that assesses feasibility, safety and
      efficacy of combined neoadjuvant chemotherapy and immunotherapy with Nivolumab 360 mg IV Q3W
      + Paclitaxel 200mg/m2 + Carboplatin AUC 6 IV Q3W in resectable stage IIIA N2-NSCLC adult
      patients followed by adjuvant treatment for 1 year with Nivolumab 240 mg IV Q2W for 4 months
      and Nivolumab 480mg Q4W for 8 months.

      Three cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in combination with nivolumab will be administered.

      After completion of neoadjuvant therapy (3 cycles) and before surgery, a tumor assessment
      will be done. Patients have to leave the study if there is evidence of progression. Patients
      with in-stable disease or partial response may be considered for surgery.

      The report imaging response vs pathological response rate will be evaluated.

      Patients eligible for the trial are those with a histological diagnosis or cytologically
      proven operable and resectable non-small-cell lung cancer. The total number of patients to be
      included will be 46 from 23 participating sites in Spain.

      Accrual period of 1.5 years or until the inclusion of the last patient necessary to achieve
      the sample set in the protocol of 46 patients. After that all patients will be treated for 1
      year with adjuvant immunotherapy and they will be followed during 3 years after adjuvant
      treatment.
