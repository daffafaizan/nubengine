      Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine awareness and understanding in an effort to improve HPV vaccine
      intent and uptake among female university students. HPV is the most common sexually
      transmitted infection and causes genital warts and cancer. The HPV vaccine has been
      recommended for girls ages 11-26 since 2006, yet vaccination rates remain low. Tailored
      online interventions may be more effective tools to promote behavior change among college
      students than traditional static interventions. The proposed study is a randomized controlled
      trial testing the efficacy of the MeFirst tool vs. standard static educational material on
      increasing HPV vaccination intent and uptake among female university students aged 18-26.
