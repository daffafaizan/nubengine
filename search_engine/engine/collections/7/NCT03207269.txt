      30-80 years, and not on exogenous insulin therapy, will complete three, 3-day intervention
      periods (proof-of-concept randomized trial). Participants will consume a standardized diet
      for three days with either i) two hard-boiled eggs, ii) fruit yogurt; or iii) control
      no-bedtime snack, thirty minutes prior to bedtime. Fasting blood samples will be obtained on
      Day 4 in the morning after following each 3-day dietary intervention. Blood glucose will be
      monitored continuously across the intervention period using continuous glucose monitoring
      (CGM). CGM allows for the moment-to-moment changes in blood glucose to be examined for
      several days, allowing the unique opportunity to examine the glucose responses at different
      points of the day, including fasting hyperglycemia in the morning, nocturnal glucose, and
      postprandial glucose in response to meals. To our knowledge, CGM technology has never been
      used in a bedtime snacking study in type 2 diabetes.
