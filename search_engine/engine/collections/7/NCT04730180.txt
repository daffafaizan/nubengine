      the targeting method used to guide TMS coil placement. We will compare the treatment outcome
      for three patient groups. TMS coil placement is guided for group 1) with simple scalp
      measurement targeting, for group 2) with a conventional neuronavigation system, and for group
      3) with a mixed reality neuronavigation system.

      The treatment schedule for the medically prescribed TMS treatment for each patient are 30
      daily weekday repetitive TMS treatments for 6 weeks with an additional 6 treatments tapered
      over 3 weeks.
