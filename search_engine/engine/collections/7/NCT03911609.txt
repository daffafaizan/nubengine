      People with FM report widespread pain that impacts their quality of life. Patients may also
      experience other symptoms besides pain such as depression, anxiety, fatigue, sleep
      difficulties and others. Exercise is one of the interventions that have been shown to reduce
      pain in chronic pain populations. The phenomenon by which exercise reduces pain sensitivity
      is known as exercise-induced hypoalgesia (EIH). Although exercise is strongly recommended by
      American Pain Society guideline for the treatment of FM, some patients with FM report an
      increase in pain and worsening symptoms following acute exercise. The worsening of symptoms
      may impact adherence to exercise training. Why some people with FM report pain exacerbation
      while others report pain relief following exercise is not known.

      This study aims at assessing the influence of the cardiovascular autonomic nervous system on
      pain sensitivity at rest and following exercise in patients with fibromyalgia and pain-free
      individuals.
