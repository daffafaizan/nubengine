      with mechanism of T-cell blockade complementary to calcineurin inhibitors. The investigators
      presume that combination of sirolimus with tacrolimus will result in better survival of
      pancreatic and kidney grafts in simultaneous pancreas and kidney transplantations.

      The study is proposed as a single-center extension of EUROSPK 002 trial originally started in
      2004 by the EUROSPK Study Group. Recruitment of recipients started in 2004 with approval of
      EUROSPK 002. The patient recruitment has continued in a single center (Institute for Clinical
      and Experimental Medicine in Prague, Czech Republic) using the same inclusion and exclusion
      criteria. The recipients of primary kidney and pancreas transplantation have been randomized
      into 2 arms.

        -  In the intervention arm sirolimus is added to protocol at a dose of 5 mg immediately
           before transplantation, the dose is adjusted to maintained trough sirolimus trough
           levels between 5-10ng/ml.

        -  In the control arm mycophenolate mofetil was added to tacrolimus. Starting with 1g
           before transplantation, the dose has been increased to 1g bid afterwards.

      Induction protocol at day 0. consists of ATG (antithymocyte globulin)induction 8mg/kg ,
      Tacrolimus 0.05mg/kg, Methylprednisolone 125mg. Dosing of tacrolimus has been adjusted to
      maintain trough levels between 5-10ng/ml. ATG was administered at 3mg/kg on days 1.-3.
      Steroids have been gradually tapered from a dose of 20 mg prednison orally and withdrawn by
      6w after transplantation.
