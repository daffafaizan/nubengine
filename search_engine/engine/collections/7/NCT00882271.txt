      improving lower body strength and overall functionality more than the sham acupuncture
      treatment in people with Fibromyalgia (FM). The purpose of this study is to compare the
      efficacy of acupuncture with simulated acupuncture in patients with FM using a randomized
      controlled design. More specifically, the objectives of this study are to determine if
      acupuncture can (1) reduce pain, (2) improve lower body strength, and (3) improve overall
      functionality.
