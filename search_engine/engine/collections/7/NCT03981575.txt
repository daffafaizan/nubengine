      enrolled at 15 centers (up to 70 patients will be recruited at each site). No treatment will
      be administered as part of this study. Participants will receive standard of care as
      determined by the investigators. Study visits occur at baseline/0 months, 12 months, and 24
      months. Few restrictions are placed on participation in the study because the investigators
      aim to capture the full spectrum of disease severity. Studies of splicing biomarkers in
      muscle biopsy samples will be conducted on a subset of 95 participants. These participants
      will have an additional study visit at 3 months.
