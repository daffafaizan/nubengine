      the standard care provided by the rehabilitation facility. The TAP begins before discharge
      and extends across six weeks. It includes three components to improve caregiver mental health
      and informal care: (1) skill development, (2) education, and (3) supportive problem solving.
      TAP caregivers will receive an SCI caregiving guidebook, a 1-hour intervention session by an
      SCI clinician before hospital discharge, and four 1-hour telehealth clinic-to-home visits at
      1, 2, 4, and 6 weeks after discharge by the same clinician. Data will be collected from
      caregivers and individuals with SCI at baseline immediately before discharge and at 2 and 4
      months after discharge.
