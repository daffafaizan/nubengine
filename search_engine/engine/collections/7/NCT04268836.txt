      order to change the modulus of small volumes of anterior stromal corneal tissue. The change
      of modulus produces a change of corneal stiffness and shape that modifies the distribution of
      light onto the retina. Light rays are redirected from dysfunctional areas of the retina that
      have been damaged by age-related macular degeneration (AMD) to functional areas of the
      retina, thereby improving patient vision.

      200 AMD patients meeting eligibility requirements will be treated. The study will record and
      analyze pre-treatment (Tx) and post-Tx examinations with follow-up extending to 24 months
      post-Tx. Analysis will include descriptive statistics and measures of correlation between
      outcomes and patient baseline characteristics.

      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Clear-K®
      treatment in providing vision improvement to AMD patients.
