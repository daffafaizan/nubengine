      Acute ischemic Stroke) is to elucidate the underlying pathomechanism of cTnT elevation in
      acute ischemic stroke in order to give guidance for clinical practise. All consecutive
      patients with acute MRI- or CT-confirmed ischemic stroke admitting within 72 hours after
      symptom onset to the Department of Neurology Campus Benjamin Franklin of the university
      hospital of the Charité will be screened for cTnT elevations suggestive of myocardial
      infarction (>0,05 µg/l) on admission and day 2. Patients with increased troponin will undergo
      diagnostic coronary angiography within 72 hours. Diagnostic findings of coronary
      angiographies taken out in age- and gender-matched patients presenting with NSTE-ACS
      (Non-ST-Elevation Acute Coronary Syndrome) to the Division of Cardiology will serve as a
      control. The primary endpoint of the study will be the occurrence of angiographic culprit
      lesions indicating focal cardiac damage on the basis of an acute CAD. Secondary endpoints
      will be the localisation of stroke in the cerebral imaging and ventriculographic findings of
      wall motion abnormalities suggestive of neurally mediated global cardiac dysfunction.
