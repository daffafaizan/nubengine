      both aspirin (100mg) and clopidogrel (75mg). We performed PCI 12-24 hours after 300mg loading
      dose of clopidogrel, or at least 7 days of 75mg clopidogrel treatment after 300mg initial
      loading dose. We examined platelet adhesiveness, plasma biomarkers for platelet activation
      such as plasma VWF and ADAMTS13, CD40L, P-Selectin levels, and ADP-induced platelet
      aggregation using Light transmittance aggregometry (LTA) and VerifyNow P2Y12 assay system in
      those patients. We also analyzed the CYP2C19 genetic polymorphism to examine the influence of
      this genetic variation on the several biomarkers for platelet activation.
