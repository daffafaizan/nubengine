      specific motor action is internally simulated without producing an overt body movement. Motor
      imagery is now widely used as a technique to enhance motor learning and to enhance recovery
      during rehabilitation of various conditions such as sports injuries, stroke, etc. Several
      studies have also shown improvement in strength, function, and use of both upper and lower
      extremities in chronic stroke. Present study aimed to identify its effectiveness in improving
      dynamic balance of individuals without any clinical problem. Such improvement, if any, may be
      useful in early balance and proprioceptive training during the maximum protection phase of
      joint injuries, fractures, or even rehabilitation of other clinical conditions affecting
      balance. It may have benefits in maintaining / improving movements in athletes after injuries
      as well as the general less active population, including the elderly population.
