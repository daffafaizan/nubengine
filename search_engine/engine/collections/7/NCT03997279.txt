      primarily due to antibiotics resistance.Therefore, the latest Maastricht consensus suggests
      using bismuth-quadruple or non-bismuth-quadruple therapy, in regions with high clarithromycin
      resistance. The addition of probiotics with eradication therapy has never become a standard
      treatment. However, the Maastricht consensus suggest that the addition of probiotics could
      increase the effectiveness of quadruple therapy.

      The study was designed as a prospective, double-blind, randomized, case-control intervention
      study.
