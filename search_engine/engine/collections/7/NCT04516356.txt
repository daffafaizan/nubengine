      September 1, 2020 and September 1, 2021 in the general surgery clinic where the study will be
      conducted will comprise the patients who meet the inclusion criteria and agree to participate
      in the study. The research was planned as a randomized controlled experimental study. Block
      randomization method will be used to determine the experimental and control groups. In order
      for the groups to be distributed homogeneously, the order produced by a computer program
      (https://www.randomizer.org/) will be used. Randomization will be done by a biostatistician
      outside the researcher. Patients who meet the inclusion criteria and agree to participate in
      the study will be assigned to the experimental and control groups according to the
      randomization list. Research data will be collected in a hospital's general surgery ward
      between 1 September 2020 - 1 September 2021. The independent variable of the study is Korean
      hand acupressure. The dependent variables of the study are postoperative nausea-vomiting and
      retching status (number and severity), pain severity (Visual Analog Scale-VAS), Rhodes
      nausea-vomiting and retching index score average. In the research, "Individual
      Characteristics Form" and "Patient Follow-up Form" prepared by the researcher in line with
      the literature will be used as data collection tools.
