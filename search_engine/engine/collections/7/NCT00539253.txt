      material for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans of the central nervous system. It is
      believed that using MultiHance may be able to help doctors tell normal liver cells apart from
      active tumor and from tumor affected by the chemotherapy. In this way, MultiHance may improve
      the way patients with hepatocellular carcinoma are managed clinically.

      We hypothesize that the Multi-Hance contrast material will provide better image definition of
      treated liver tumor(s) on MRI imaging in comparison to other commercially available contrast
      agents.
