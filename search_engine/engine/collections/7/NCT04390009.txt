    
      To collect exploratory data using the most recent PET-CT scanners with their increased
      detection sensitivity and spatial resolution for the evaluation of F18-florbetapir
      radiopharmaceutical uptake in the nervous system of the entire body with special attention to
      correlation of radiotracer activity levels in the myelinated, demyelinated, or remyelinated
      white matter of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients compared to normal healthy subjects. The
      pilot study will be conducted on 20 participants as a clinical research trial of PET amyloid
      and myelin imaging with the primary objective of identifying possible differences in
      F18-florbetapir radiotracer activity for MS patients compared to normal healthy subjects, and
      the secondary objective of monitoring psychological health of those participants who elect to
      be informed of imaging results and who complete a panel of psychometric scales before and
      after imaging results disclosure.
