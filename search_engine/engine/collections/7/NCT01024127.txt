      l. Perform a genome-wide scan to test for loci associated with acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
      relapse and infection risk.

      II. Validate positive associations seen in the genome-wide scan with a fine mapping approach.

      III. Perform simulated clinical trials using germline genetic variation data to test the
      feasibility of using genetic data to inform the clinical care of pediatric patients with AML.

      OUTLINE:

      Germline DNA is obtained from previously collected peripheral blood or bone marrow samples
      for array-based genotyping studies, including genome-wide association studies (single
      nucleotide polymorphisms) and fine mapping genotyping. Clinical trial simulations are
      performed to test the clinical applicability of using genetic variation data in the
      management of infectious complications.
