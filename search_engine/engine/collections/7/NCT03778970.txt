    
      Participants: One hundred and four volunteers (104) aged 18-50 years with chronic
      non-specific low back pain.

      Interventions: The volunteers will be randomized into two treatment groups: self-management
      education and movement control exercises or pain neuroscience education and exercises based
      on movement control exercises. Two workshops of 40 minutes each will be administered as
      education approach and the exercise program along 2 months ( and 12 sessions distributed over
      2 months.

      Main outcome measures: Primary outcomes will include pain intensity and low back disability,
      and secondary outcomes will be pain catastrophizing, pain self-efficacy, kinesiophobia,
      exercise adherence and global perceived effect. These will be measured pre- and
      post-intervention and at the 1-month follow-up. Statistical analysis will be conducted
      following treatment intent principles, and treatment effects will be calculated using a mixed
      linear model, considering intervention groups as a factor and assessments over time as
      repeated measures.
