      dissemination and early changes in the immune system. During primary HIV-1 infection, damages
      to MALT and GALT promotes a chronic cell activation, which participates in a progressive
      decay of immune functions.

      After HAART initiation, the magnitude and rapidity of cell-associated HIV-DNA decrease are
      significantly higher in patients with primary HIV-1 infection than in patients with chronic
      infection (Ngo Giang Huong, AIDS 2004).

      We hypothesize that an early intervention at different levels of viral replication with
      potent and well-tolerated new drugs may have a greater impact on cell-associated HIV-DNA
      levels than conventional triple-drug HAART.
