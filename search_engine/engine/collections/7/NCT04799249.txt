    
      This study will have two separate cohorts (Cohort 1 and Cohort 2). Both cohorts will follow
      the same general study conduct/design with similar primary and key secondary endpoints and
      identical treatment arms.

        -  Cohort 1 will evaluate patients receiving first-line therapy, regardless of programmed
           death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) status, who are programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)/PD-L1
           inhibitor therapy na√Øve.

        -  Cohort 2 will evaluate PD-L1 positive patients receiving second-line therapy following
           prior PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor therapy in the locally advanced unresectable/metastatic
           setting.
