      increase the level of breastfeeding self-efficacy. Breast milk and breastfeeding educations
      have given in the ante-natal period are another way of increasing the success of

      In this experimental investigation, 80 pregnant women who attended a baby-friendly hospital
      were randomly assigned to the education (n = 40) or control (n = 40) groups. The pregnant
      women in the intervention group received 4 hours of human milk and breastfeeding educational
      sessions along with routine care and furthermore, a brochure prepared by the researcher was
      given. All women whose estimated delivery date had approximated were questioned about whether
      they had given birth or not, and the sociodemographic data form, the LATCH Breastfeeding
      Assessment Tool and the Breastfeeding Self-efficacy Scale-short form were applied to the
      subjects in the education and the control group by visiting them at home when the post-partum
      first week had been completed.
