      falls cause serious injuries such as head injuries and fractures. In fact, falls are the most
      frequent cause of injuries among older adults and often lead to disability,
      institutionalization, and premature death.

      Multiple fall prevention interventions have been examined to reduce the fall rate, and
      physical exercise has continuously been proven as an effective and cost-effective approach.
      However, traditional exercise approaches, such as balance and muscle-strengthening training,
      have only shown a moderate 20-25% decrease in falls and encounters issues such as poor
      compliance. Recently, task-specific perturbation training using an overground walkway has
      been shown to produce quick motor adaptations resulting in improved pro- and reactive
      stability. Additionally, perturbation training delivered on such walkways has decreased both
      laboratory-induced and real-life falls. However, overground walkways with moveable platforms
      and trip-board are expensive and immobile; thus, limiting the clinical feasibility.

      Contrarily, perturbation training delivered on computer-controlled treadmills may serve as a
      more implementable substitute. Preliminary studies have shown that treadmill perturbation
      training produces similar dynamic stability adaptations to overground perturbation training.
      Furthermore, a single session of treadmill perturbation decreases the rate of
      laboratory-induced falls, and the ergogenic effects were retained for up to six months.
      However, the effects of a brief treadmill perturbation training intervention on real-life
      falls in community-dwelling older adults still vastly unknown.
