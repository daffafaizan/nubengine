    
      This is a pilot intervention study with two groups: an intervention group (targeted exercise
      program for women with obesity and YMCA membership) and a control group (YMCA membership
      only). The targeted exercise program will be delivered by a YMCA and will be evaluated by our
      team. The majority of women who are recruited to this study will be randomized to receive the
      intervention or the control condition. However, we also have a small group of women who has
      been serving as our community advisory committee (CAC) that will also participate in the
      intervention classes and receive the membership. They will serve as pilot testers for our
      data collection methods and provide ongoing qualitative feedback on the intervention as part
      of their role in the CAC.

      The study will take place in two phases at two different YMCAs (Ken-Ton and Independent
      Health) with approximately half of participants recruited for the first and the other half
      for the second.
