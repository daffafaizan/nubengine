      role in the function of several body systems including the vasodilatation of smooth muscle,
      neurotransmission, regulation of wound healing and inhibition of pathogens. In-vitro studies
      have shown that NO inhibits the replication cycle of the severe acute respiratory syndrome
      coronavirus (SARS CoV) in vitro. The suggested mechanisms of actions of NO on SARS are an
      effect on the fusion between the S protein and its cognate receptor, ACE2, and reduction in
      viral RNA production in the early steps of viral replication. The primary aim of this
      feasibility study is to investigate the safety of intermittent NO, delivered via inhalation,
      in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The primary endpoint in the study will be time to
      deterioration of respiratory symptoms determined by escalation to either non-invasive
      ventilation (NIV), high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC), or intubation.
