    
      This Phase 3 study involves two phases, an open-label (OL) phase and a randomized-withdrawal
      (RW) phase. Patients will dose-escalate in 100 mg increments to a target dose of 400 mg
      orally once daily during the open-label phase. Patients will remain on open-label treatment
      until week 22 at which time they will be evaluated for the randomized-withdrawal phase based
      on pre-defined hyperglycemia and hypertension response criteria. Eligible patients will then
      be randomized to receive either relacorilant or placebo at a 1:1 ratio for 12 weeks. Patients
      who do not meet the criteria for randomization will end treatment and may be eligible to roll
      over into an extension safety study. Patients who complete the randomized-withdrawal phase of
      the study may also be eligible to roll over into an extension study.
