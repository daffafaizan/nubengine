    
      The purpose of this research study is to understand how a mother's emotional state in
      pregnancy influences her biological response to food intake. Natural variation in emotional
      and mental state is frequently experienced in daily life, including during pregnancy. While
      the investigators understand that a healthy diet is important in pregnancy for maintaining
      blood sugar levels and other metabolic factors within normal ranges for optimal development
      of the baby, less consideration is given to the health effects of a mother's mental state
      during pregnancy. It may even be possible that, regardless of what a woman eats or drinks,
      the way her body responds to food may differ according to her emotional or mental state.

      This research is particularly interested in understanding how the combination of maternal
      emotional state and diet influence metabolism in pregnancy. Thus, the aim of this study is to
      test whether and how an individual's emotional response to a mental challenge of varying
      complexity during pregnancy modifies the body's metabolic response to a standard breakfast.
