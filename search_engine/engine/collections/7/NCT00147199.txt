    
      Patients who have been on a stable dose of 125 mg twice daily (bid) of bosentan or any stable
      dose of sildenafil for at least three months prior to study start were randomized to either
      treprostinil inhalation solution or matching placebo.

      Administration of study medication was performed by inhalation with the OPTINEBâ„¢ ultrasonic
      nebulizer.

      The proposed dosing regimen was four times daily-upon awakening, at midday, evening (dinner
      time) and bedtime.

      After a patient has completed the twelve-week study period, they were given the option of
      enrolling into an open-label extension study.
