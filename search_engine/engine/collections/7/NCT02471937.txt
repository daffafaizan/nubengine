    
      Four specific tasks will be addressed to:

      (i) Understand whether and how the gut microbiota may influence growth and colonization of
      GBS CC-17 within the intestine of neonates.

      (ii) Study the contribution of different diets and immune system constituents enabling the
      persistence of GBS CC-17 in the gut of neonates.

      (iii) Determine whether the adaptive immune response elicited by maternal GBS colonization
      and transmitted to the infant is different for GBS CC-17 versus non-CC-17 GBS.

      (iv) Determine whether or not GBS strains isolated from the mothers and from their babies are
      identical and whether the environment (ie. the vagina or the milk for the mother, the
      intestine or the oral cavity for the baby) influence the expression of specific virulence
      factors of CC-17.
