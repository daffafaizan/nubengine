      between patients with normal weight and patients with obesity.

      A. Secondary Objectives/research questions

        -  To analyze the composition of the digestive microbiota through samples of saliva and
           feces in infertile patients with normal weight and obesity.

        -  To assess whether there is a relationship between the body mass index (normal weight,
           obesity Class I, Class II, Class III) and the main bacterial species detected in
           endometrial fluid samples from infertile patients.

        -  To evaluate the influence of the digestive microbiota on the composition of the
           endometrial microbiota according to the body mass index in infertile patients.

        -  To evaluate if there is an influence of the endometrial microbiota on the results of
           endometrial receptivity analyzed with the non-invasive Endometrial Receptivity Array
           test (niERA)
