    
      A randomized control trial of 130 infants admitted to the paediatric high care admission ward
      will be enrolled. Infants between 1 month and 2 years of age who fulfill criteria for
      enrollment shall be considered eligible. Informed consent from parents or legal guardians
      shall be obtained. Infants shall be randomized to either "standard therapy" or "high flow
      humidified oxygen". Measurements of heart rate, respiratory rate, work of breathing (Tal
      score and WCAS), oxygen saturation and oxygen requirements shall be recorded.
