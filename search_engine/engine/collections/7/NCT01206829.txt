      that hearing impaired individuals have increased vulnerability for development of symptoms of
      distress and fatigue. It is assumed that distressed hearing impaired individuals will have a
      tendency to use maladaptive and passive coping strategies, such as social withdrawal or
      reluctance to make use of hearing aid devices. On the other side, it is well documented that
      hearing impaired employers who are open about their handicap and make others aware of their
      situation, i.e. take an active coping approach, have fewer symptoms of distress and have
      better vocational functioning. The level of knowledge is limited and mainly based on cross
      sectional studies, and the way people cope with hearing impairment has been measured
      indirectly by questionnaires focusing on communication problems. We plan to conduct a
      randomized controlled study with hearing impaired workers, who have voluntarily signed up for
      an 8 session cognitive therapy (CBT) course The CBT intervention will be compared to a
      waiting list control group. Participants who are allocated to the intervention group will be
      offered to start on the CBT-course immediately, while the control group that will be offered
      the same course 12 months later. Main outcome measures are assessments of mental distress and
      vocational coping. We will also assess the distress associated with tinnitus, which is a
      potential moderator variable.
