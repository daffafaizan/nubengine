      eluting electrode through reduction in electrode impedances as compared to a standard
      electrode and the improvement of speech recognition from preoperative baseline. The secondary
      objectives are to assess the benefit-risk balance of a dexamethasone eluting electrode as
      similar to a standard electrode by comparison of adverse events and speech outcomes.
