      Capecitabine 1000mg/m^2 PO twice daily from 1th day to 14th day,21 days for each course of
      treatment.Adverse effects of chemotherapy,such as myelosuppression and gastrointestinal
      reactions,may lead to dose reductions,treatment delays or even discontinuation among cancer
      patients. According to IDEA study,the completion rate of 8-cycle CapeOX chemotherapy in
      colorectal cancer patients is 64%,which means that nearly 4 in 10 patients could not complete
      adjuvant chemotherapy as planned,which may negatively impact patients' survival outcomes.Some
      prior studies have shown that TCM can improve patients' symptom control and QoL during
      adjuvant chemotherapy,which may further improve the completion of adjuvant chemotherapy.
      However,there is a lack of definitive evidence to evaluate the effects of TCM in stage
      II(high-risk)& III colon cancer patients who receive adjuvant chemotherapy after radical
      surgery.The study will be conducted between 2018 and 2021.Four hundred participants will be
      enrolled and randomly assigned to either the experimental group or the control group.
