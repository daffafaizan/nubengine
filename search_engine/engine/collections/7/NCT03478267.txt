    
      Pregnant women between 32-41 weeks' gestation designated for either vaginal birth or cesarean
      section will be recruited for the study. After signing an informed consent, data regarding
      maternal resting heart rate and fetal baseline heart rate as depicted on the monitor will be
      collected.

      Patients will be divided into 2 equal groups according to fetal baseline heart rate:

        1. st group-fetal heart rate between 110-130 beats per minute (bpm).

        2. nd group-fetal heart rate between 140-160 bpm. A blood sample will be acquired from the
           parturient and the umbilical cord as well as a sample from the placenta will be
           obtained. Levels of Acetyl Choline Esterase (AChE) will be determined from all
           aforementioned samples. Statistical correlation between fetal baseline heart rate and
           fetal and maternal AChE levels will be assessed.

      Data regarding demographic, medical and obstetric information of the participants will be
      obtained from the hospital's electronic records.
