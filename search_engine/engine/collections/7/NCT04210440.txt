      necrotic area with bone chips allograft, adjuvanted by concentrated autologous mesenchymal
      stromal cells (MSCs) and fibrin platelet rich-plasma (PRP).

      The patients were followed-up at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 24 months and then
      every year. Each time a clinical evaluation by Harris Hip Score (HHS) was carried out by the
      same orthopedic surgeon. Radiological controls (pelvis and hip affected) were performed at 6
      weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 24 months and then every year.

      The primary outcome evaluated was the avoiding or delaying of total hip replacement (THR),
      while the secondary outcomes were the assessment of any change in clinical performance as
      measured by Harris Hip Score
