      between parents and preterm infants in neonatal intensive care. Continuous skin-to-skin
      contact (SSC) means, in this study, that the late preterm infant is cared for skin-to-skin on
      the parents' chest, instead of in a heating-bed, 24 hours a day. The parents will take turns
      to care for the infant in SSC.
