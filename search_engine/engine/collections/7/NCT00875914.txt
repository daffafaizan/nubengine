      slow pathway of the av node. The success rate is 90 to 95%.

      There are different options to navigate the ablation catheter: manually guided vs
      magnetically guided.

      For magnetic guidance two magnets are positioned beneath the patient. A mangetic field is
      induced and a catheter with a ferromagnetic tip can be navigated from outside with a joystick
      by modifying the vectors of the magnetic field.

      We hypothesized that a magnetic guidance of the RF-ablation catheter results in lower x-ray
      time and dose for the patient and the physician with comparable safety und success rates.
