    
      The Duchenne Registry (previously DuchenneConnect) was created in 2007 by Parent Project
      Muscular Dystrophy (PPMD), with assistance from the NIH, the CDC, and Emory Genetics. In
      early 2011, PPMD alone began financing the registry's operation and maintenance, and is the
      sole guardian of The Duchenne Registry and its material.
