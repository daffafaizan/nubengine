      VAS) in subjects with schizophrenia (Girard et coll., 2011), major depression (ED) (bipolar
      or isolated/recurrent episode) (to be published) in comparison with controls without
      psychiatric pathologies show that exploration of pain in situation like medical examination
      to identify painful points should be done in the same conditions for persons with psychiatric
      troubles and persons without mental disease. But the risk is that the expression of pain,
      either in experimental conditions nor in the daily life, is not in relation with the feeling
      or perception of pain. Numerous factors may interfere in the pain message modulation, like
      the past pain experience, stress and anxiety, which are not or partially explored in
      experimental studies. The individual experience of pain is constructed throughout the whole
      life, from several influences (biological, psychological, and sociocultural). The symptoms
      interfaces of the different psychiatric troubles seem to be widely involved in the pain
      process, and its progressive construction. This study aims to better understand the
      relationships between all those variables.

      Procedures applied :

      Anterior pain experience evaluation (questionnaire); Pain tests : 160 kPa pressure
      application to determine corresponding pain with VAS), and ischemia induction to determine
      the time necessary to obtain a pain equivalent to 3 out of 10; anxiety and emotional
      evaluation (Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale), catastrophizing evaluation (Pain
      Catastrophizing Scale), HR variation and BP variation (vegetative measures linked to anxiety)
      collection of diagnosis, and therapeutic treatment
