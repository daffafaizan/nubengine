      preparation of the prosthesis. This technique is now used in several surgical centers and
      prospective evaluation of the practice is necessary.

      The objective of our research is to demonstrate the reduction of the operating time and
      number of prosthesis used per procedure when prior LAAC simulation testing and sizing is made
      on a 3D printed model.

      It is therefore a longitudinal research to monitor professional practices for the evaluation
      of a new preoperative approach.

      Procedures guided by 3Dprinted models will be compared (intention to treat population) in
      term of procedural parameters (procedure time, success rate, number of prosthesis per
      procedure) and procedural complication with prior Watchman study: post-FDA Approval US
      experience and national registries data. A second analysis (per protocol population) will be
      performed to compare patients with an informative utilization guided by 3D printed to those
      of the post-FDA Approval US experience and national registries.
