      prediction - a full-body biomechanical model based on an established technology and
      physiological reasoning. Specifically, the model ability to predict postoperative global
      sagittal alignment, including compensatory and reciprocal changes, from pre-operative
      radiographic imaging and the information about planned posture correction will be evaluated.
      This will be realized by comparing model-predicted radiographic measures and overall balance
      to follow-up patient radiographs.

      Having demonstrated model validity to predict postoperative posture will allow to use this
      method for simulating various "what-if" scenarios to empower surgical planning by predicting
      expected outcomes. This can be used to optimizing preoperative planning, which has a
      potential to substantially improved surgery predictability and patient outcomes.

      Furthermore, validated model will allow scientific investigation of the principles governing
      human posture and biomechanics of the pathological spine. Generated scientific knowledge of
      biomechanical factors influencing sagittal posture and surgery outcomes (e.g. number of
      levels fused, amount and distribution of posture correction, etc.) can lead to improvements
      in clinical management of spinal disorders.
