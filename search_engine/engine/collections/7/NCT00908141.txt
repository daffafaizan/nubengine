    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine the ability of sargramostim (GM-CSF) to increase the number and activation
           of dendritic cells (DC) in patients with biochemically relapsed prostate cancer.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the effect of administration schedule and hormonal state on
           sargramostim-induced DC number and activation in these patients.

        -  To correlate the effects of sargramostim on DC number and activation with effects on
           prostate-specific antigen (PSA) modulation.

        -  To determine whether sargramostim administration generates antiprostate cancer immune
           responses in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to hormonal status (androgen-dependent vs
      androgen-independent). Patients are then randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive sargramostim (GM-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) on days 1-14.
           Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
           unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive GM-CSF SC three times weekly for 4 weeks. Treatment repeats
           every 28 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
           toxicity.

      Patients undergo blood sample collection periodically for correlative studies. Samples are
      analyzed for dendritic cell (DC) number by flow cytometry, DC activation by quantitative
      real-time polymerase chain reaction (QRT-PCR), and immunity by serological analysis of
      recombinant cDNA expression libraries (SEREX).
