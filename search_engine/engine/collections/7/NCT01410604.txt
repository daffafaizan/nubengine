      particularly because of the difficulties involved with changing lifestyles. Current studies
      of obese children and adolescents show increased insulin resistance (IR) and chronic
      inflammatory states. These conditions increase the risk of disability and/or premature death.

      The current treatment schemes for obese children are conservative and are focused on changing
      their lifestyles (exercise and dietary plans). However, metabolic conditions, such as IR,
      dyslipidemia, and inflammatory processes, are perpetuated.

      Metformin is a biguanide that is used for adolescents with diabetes mellitus and polycystic
      ovarian syndrome. Several clinical trials with metformin for obese pediatric patients have
      observed decreases in IR, decreases in weight, and improvements in lipid metabolism.

      Adipose tissue is not only an energy repository, but also plays an immunological role by the
      secretion of cytokines. Both overweight adults and adolescents show decreases in adiponectin
      levels and increases in tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFÎ±) and interleukin 6 (IL-6). IL-6 can
      stimulate the production of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), which is considered
      to be a risk marker for the development of cardiovascular disease.
