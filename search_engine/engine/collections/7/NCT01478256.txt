      lids called anterior blepharitis. The patients are graded for their signs a symptoms and then
      randomized to receive either topical Besifloxocin or Erythromycin in addition to standard lid
      hygiene measures. All patients have cultures of their eyelids performed prior to initiating
      therapy and are followed for four weeks. The antibiotics are used for two weeks following
      which repeat cultures of the lids are obtained. The patients are followed for one additional
      week to ensure that there is no recurrence of their symptoms once the antibiotics are
      discontinued.
