    
      This investigation is being conducted on a new complete revision knee system, Vanguard 360,
      which incorporates:

        -  Fixed Bearing Knee - Vanguard SSK360 with PS Bearing and PSC Bearing

        -  Fixed Bearing Knee - Vanguard SSK360 TiNbN Femur with PS Bearing and PSC Bearing

        -  Mobile Bearing Knee - Vanguard DA360 (only being collected in Europe)

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate performance of the Vanguard 360 revision knee system
      utilizing offset on either the tibial component, femoral component, or both in terms of the
      restoration of mechanical alignment, clinical outcomes and survivorship.

      The efficacy and performance of the devices will be assessed by improvement of pain,
      function, range of motion and patient satisfaction measured pre-operatively and
      post-operatively. Secondary performance and safety will be determined by radiographic
      investigation, incidence of complications and revision rates.

      Surgical techniques and patient care are to be standard for the surgeon participating in the
      protocol. There will be no experimental or investigational devices used. There will be no
      experimental or investigational surgical techniques used. The devices and products will be
      used in accordance with their instructions for use and/or approved labeling.
