      lenses. Each type of lens was worn for three consecutive days of daily disposable wear.
      Participants had been previously identified as symptomatic lens wearers or asymptomatic lens
      wearers, based upon their responses to a screening questionnaire. Participants wore each lens
      type for as long as they were comfortable during the day, but lenses were removed before
      sleep. After completion of Part 1, participants began Part 2, which included dispensing of
      the investigational study lens for up to one week of bilateral wear, with a single follow-up
      visit at the end of that period.
