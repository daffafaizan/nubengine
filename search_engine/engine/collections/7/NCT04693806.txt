      routine as previously consented to at the clinic. IVF stimulation protocol will be at the
      discretion of the patient's individual provider, per routine. Intracytoplasmic Sperm
      Injection (ICSI) will be performed and embryos will be cultured to the blastocyst stage per
      routine. There are no changes to the embryology care itself, the only difference within the
      study is the CO2 level within the incubator pending the patient's randomization.
