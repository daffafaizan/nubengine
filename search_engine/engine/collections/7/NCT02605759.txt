    
      Multi-center, prospective, single arm, non-randomized study. The study will proceed in two
      phases: a pilot phase, followed by the feasibility, safety and efficacy phase. In the pilot
      phase, up to five (5) patients at one (1) site will be treated with the CryoBalloon Ablation
      System to confirm its safety and feasibility in the treatment of squamous dysplasia. The
      second phase will be conducted at two (2) centers and will enroll up to 50 subjects to
      evaluate the feasibility, safety and efficacy of the CryoBalloon Ablation System for the
      treatment of squamous dysplasia.
