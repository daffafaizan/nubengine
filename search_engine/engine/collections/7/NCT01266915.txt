    
      The purpose of this study is to create a national registry of patients with cutaneous lupus
      patients in order to address many unknown questions about this disease. Specifically, we are
      interested in better understanding the causes of cutaneous lupus and improving our methods of
      diagnosis, prognosis, and management of this disease. We plan to use information from all
      patient sources, including medical histories, clinical information, laboratory data, and
      blood and skin samples in order to answer these questions.

      Each study patient will be asked to complete a series of questionnaires, which, for example,
      will ask about cutaneous and/or systemic lupus history, past medical history, family history,
      quality of life, and sun protective habits. Patients will be also asked to donate blood and
      skin samples and undergo digital photography of affected areas. No treatments will be
      administered as part of this study, but all participants will be notified of clinical trials
      being conducted at UT Southwestern. This study is for the purpose of data collection only.
      Patients will be asked to be followed on an annual basis for five years.
