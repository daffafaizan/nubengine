      in HIV-infected children. PCVs are immunogenic and efficacious in normal children and offer
      hope of reducing pneumococcal infections in HIV-infected children. The degree to which
      children on HAART are protected by prior immunizations and are responsive to new
      immunizations is still largely undefined. This study is designed to answer whether PCV
      immunizations are safe and effective. The immune responses to prior immunizations and
      responsiveness to booster doses of vaccines against measles, pertussis, and hepatitis B virus
      of children on HAART will also be examined. Answers to these questions will determine whether
      these children are likely to be protected against these clinically relevant pathogens and
      whether they should routinely receive booster doses of these vaccines after a period of
      HAART.

      Patients are stratified on the basis of CD4 percentage and age. Patients that previously
      received a primary hepatitis B vaccine (HBV) series receive an HBV immunization at entry.
      Other vaccinations may be given (based on age and/or CD4 cell measurement, and immunization
      status) for PCV at entry and 2 months, and measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine and PPV at 4
      months. Some patients may be administered DTaP at a 6-month visit on the basis of age,
      previous immunization history, and negative tetanus antibody status. Follow-up visits are
      done at 8, 12, and 24 months. Blood samples are collected at all clinic visits for assessment
      of HIV RNA, immune responses against pneumococcus, measles, pertussis, and hepatitis B virus,
      as well as for laboratory evaluations.
