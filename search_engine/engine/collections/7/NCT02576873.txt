      could provide both diffusion and convection in a single therapy compared with the
      conventional hemodialysis. However, the long-term, upto 10 years, outcome still limited. This
      retrospective cohort study was conducted in 66 end-stage renal disease patients who underwent
      high-efficiency hemodiafiltration technique in a single-center, King Chulalongkorn Memorial
      Hospital, between 2001-2013 to determine the survival rate as well as other long-term outcome
