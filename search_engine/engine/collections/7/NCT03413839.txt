      one of our country's most costly conditions to manage and treat. Many of these patients have
      difficulty with activities of daily living (ADL), household and community ambulation, and
      maintaining their professional career. The intervention options for this population remain
      limited, with surgery being the only one that has shown improvements in health related
      quality of life and an overall decrease in the complaints of pain. However, the costs of
      surgery and additional complications are limitations to this treatment option.There has been
      increased attention and interest in the medical community looking at the effects of
      Physiotherapeutic Scoliosis Specific Exercises (PSSE) on curve progression, improvements in
      health related quality of life, and pain. The investigators hypothesize that PSSE can
      directly affect radiological parameters, such as the sagittal vertical axis (SVA), as well as
      showing improvements in health related quality of life using subjective patient specific
      outcome measures.
