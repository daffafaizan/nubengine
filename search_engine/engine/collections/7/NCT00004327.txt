      day. The dose is adjusted based on response.

      If there is no requirement for transfusions or intravenous iron for 4 weeks and the
      hemoglobin is greater than 10 mg/dL, therapy is continued for 1 year. If there is no decrease
      in bleeding after 10 weeks, the patient is removed from study.
