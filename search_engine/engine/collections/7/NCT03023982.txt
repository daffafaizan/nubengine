      prosthesis for pain control management.

      This block is provided by injection into another myofascial plane, this time between
      pectoralis minor and serratus anterior muscle at the level of 3rd and 4th rib.PECs II block
      is simple in performance with a high success rate and minimal incidence of complications,
      especially, if used ultrasound approach that gives a good understanding of anatomy of the
      lateral thoracic wall.

      In present clinical trial we are going to compare PECs block for pain control with
      traditional pain management techniques based on IV opioids and NSAIDs treatment in patient
      undergoing thoracic surgery in early postoperative period.
