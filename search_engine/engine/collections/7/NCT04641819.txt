      about 60%. Drugs commonly used to treat sleep disorders include benzodiazepines, hypnotic
      antidepressants and melatonin receptors agonists. The short-term efficacy of these drugs has
      been proven in many clinical trials, but long-term medications bear the risk of adverse
      reactions and addiction.

      Yangzheng Compound Mixture is an extract of several traditional Chinese medicines, used as a
      basic prescription for cancer therapy, especially for patients who received chemotherapy with
      Qi-Yin deficiency syndrome, which often lead to sleep disturbance, fatigue and anorexia.
      According to some clinical and basic studies, Yangzheng Compound Mixture also has antitumor
      and immunomodulatory effects.

      In this study, about 10 research centers will participate. We planned to enroll 1526 cancer
      patients (1144 cases in the observation group and 382 cases in the control group) with Qi-Yin
      deficiency Syndrome and sleep disorders during the period of receiving chemotherapy or
      combination of chemotherapy. The dynamic random method was adopted in this study,
      participants will be randomly divided into the experimental group (Yangzheng Compound Mixture
      plus conventional treatment) and control group (conventional treatment only), all of them
      will be interviewed once every 3 weeks until the end of the study.
