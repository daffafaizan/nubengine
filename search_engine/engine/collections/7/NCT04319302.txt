      Despite the enormous surgical advancements in the last century, access to the biliary system
      is lost when a Roux-en-Y (RY) biliary drainage procedure is performed. Attempts have been
      made to overcome this inconvenient sequel of RY biliary drainage by the use of variations in
      the RY anastomosis, small bowel grafts and vascular grafts. These have been predominantly
      unsuccessful. The use of an Isolated Vascularized Gastric Tube (IVGT) graft has been reported
      in the literature, and this was successfully used for adult patients with common bile duct
      injuries. The investigators have adopted the technique of using an IVGT graft for bile duct
      reconstruction in the paediatric patients at their institution.

      Method

      The investigators reviewed theirr experience at Greys Hospital, Pietermaritzburg. This was a
      retrospective review of all paediatric patients who had undergone an IVGT graft procedure for
      biliary tract anatomical obstruction in the past five years. The investgators looked at the
      indications for surgery, the demographic profile of the patients, outcomes following surgery
      and outlined the surgical technique used.
