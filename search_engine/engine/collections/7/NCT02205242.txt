      activity is associated with relapse. In addition, physical inactivity is known to be
      associated with cardiovascular and metabolic morbidity and is one of the strongest predictors
      of mortality in COPD. Apart from potential direct effects of the intervention on treatment
      failure and symptoms, positive effects on physical activity may offer considerable benefits
      in the long run.

      Randomized patients that are willing to participate in the sub-study will be monitored for
      activity by validated and easy-to-wear portable devices (DynaportÂ®). This activity monitor
      was recently thoroughly validated for use in COPD by the Pro-Active consortium and will be
      used at the baseline, 3 months and 9 months visit. We hypothesize that with a positive
      medical intervention, differences in recovery of physical activity will be appreciated.

      Patients will follow the standard protocol but will also wear the activity monitor for 7 days
      post discharge from hospital (at investigator discretion), at day 90 (end of treatment) and
      at day 270 (end of follow-up). This device is not only registering physical activity for 7
      days but is also coupled to a standardized and patient-validated questionnaire on physical
      activities which needs to be filled out at day 8 to cover a recall period of 7 (monitored)
      days.

      Patient will have to give informed consent for the additional measures that are related to
      the activity sub-study. However, individual patients can still opt out for these tests
      (sub-study) and only participate in the medical intervention study (main study).
