      our recently developed brain exercises that contains a series of our recently developed brain
      exercises, including orientation, associative memory, word-image association, recall memory,
      etc.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to either Intervention or Control Arm. Participants of
      Intervention Arm must have access to an iPAD at least for the duration of the study.

      Procedure for Intervention Arm The participants in Intervention Arm will have a training
      session (after obtaining their consent form) for the Brain Exercises. The Brain Fitness App
      will be downloaded into their iPAD and they will be instructed on how to use it. As mentioned
      in their consent form, they will commit themselves to play the games on a daily basis for (at
      least 5 days/week), twice/day, each session of minimum 15 minutes for a period of 4
      consecutive weeks.

      Procedure for Control Arm Participants of this arm will do nothing but will be assessed at
      baseline, 4 week and 8 weeks later. Their data will be used as the control data for
      comparison with the Intervention Arm data. All participants of this group, if interested,
      will be offered to practice the Brain Fitness App if they wish after their completion of this
      study (2 months period).
