      restoration of function in patients with rotator cuff tear arthropathy and massive
      irreparable rotator cuff tears . Traditional total shoulder designs failed to address the
      unique mechanics of shoulders with deficient rotator cuffs. Different prosthesis designs
      exist for RSA, all of which increase the deltoid lever arm to provide a stable fulcrum for
      active elevation in a rotator cuff deficient shoulder.

      The Reverse® Shoulder Prosthesis (RSP®) (DJO Surgical) sought to address issues correlated to
      the Grammont design by lateralizing the center of rotation as well as utilizing a central
      compressive screw with a 5.0-mm peripheral locking screws for fixation and a glenosphere .

      Despite the success of the lateralized design, the effect of the repair of the subscapularis
      tendon during RSA on shoulder strength, range of motion, and shoulder function remains
      inconclusive. The rationale for repairing the subscapularis during RSA include anatomic
      preservation of a functioning rotator cuff muscle, an increased potential for internal
      rotation, better joint protection, and more stability. The reasoning for not repairing the
      subscapularis include that it may be biomechanically unfavorable for both the deltoid and the
      posterior rotator cuff, limiting the range of motion.

      As such, this randomized study aims to address if subscapularis repair impacts isometric and
      isokinetic internal rotational strength, with shoulder function and complications as
      secondary objectives, when patients are implanted with the AltiVate Reverse® device.

      The study will take place at multiple sites across the United States and will be managed by
      the DJO Surgical Clinical Affairs Department.
