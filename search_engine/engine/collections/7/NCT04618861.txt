    
      This study aims to provide some insight into the variation of SD-D protein levels in patients
      with Covid-19 (-) pneumonia, Covid-19 (+) pneumonia, and CT negative Covid-19 infection in
      comparison to the normal population through a larger number of cases. Subjects will assessed
      in accordance with the inclusion and exclusion criteria, they were divided into four groups
      as the CT (-), PCR (+) SARS-CoV-2 infection group, SARS-CoV-2 (+) Pneumonia Group, CT (+),
      PCR (-) Suspected Pneumonia Group and Healthy group (Control Group). Demographic data,
      medical history, vital findings (fever, blood pressure, sPO2), laboratory findings (complete
      blood count; C-reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer, Ferritin and hsTnT parameters) and
      radiological findings, time to onset of symptoms, Comorbid diseases, hospitalization location
      of the patients (service or ICU), clinical scores, CT severity scores will determine. SP-D
      level will analyze by the Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) method.
