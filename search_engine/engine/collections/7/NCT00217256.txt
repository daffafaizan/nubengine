      enrolled 436 patients at 29 sites in the US. The purpose of this trial is to demonstrate the
      equivalency of in-segment late lumen loss at 8 months between the Endeavor stent and the
      Cypher stent for the treatment of single de novo lesions in native coronary arteries 2.5-3.5
      mm in diameter. Patients were randomized to receive the Endeavor stent or the Cypher
      Sirolimus-Eluting Coronary Stent System. Enrollment was completed in September 2004.
