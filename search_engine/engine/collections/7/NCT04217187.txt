      electrical stimulation to a sham stimulation in individuals who are scheduled to receive
      botulinum toxin injections to their upper extremity for spasticity management. The electrical
      stimulation will be to the antagonist muscles of the injected muscles of the upper extremity
      and will be administered for 4 weeks post injections.
