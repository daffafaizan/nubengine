      Americans, and about 1 in 400 African American live births, incurring annual health care
      costs of $335 million. SCD can lead to serious complications including unpredictable,
      debilitating pain episodes, cardiopulmonary disease, stroke, and long-term end organ
      damage.These complications lead to significant declines in health-related quality of life
      (HRQOL) and other patient-reported outcomes (PROs), culminating in early mortality,
      particularly among AYA. Hydroxyurea (HU), at present, is the main FDA approved medication for
      SCD that reduces morbidity and mortality, improves HRQoL and lowers healthcare
      utilization.However, adherence to HU remains suboptimal with only 35-50% of patients
      achieving high adherence (â‰¥90%), particularly among AYA with SCD. Low HU adherence has been
      associated with worse health outcomes, poor HRQOL and increased healthcare utilization. Low
      HU adherence is multifactorial, especially in AYA with other competing priorities and
      vulnerability in developmental and psychological factors contributing to adherence behavior.
      AYA have adopted text messaging and smartphone apps at a fast pace, including those who have
      SCD.Existing evidence indicates that mobile health (mHealth) behavioral interventions are
      feasible and acceptable with modest efficacy at improving medication adherence and
      self-management in AYA, including SCD. The specific aim for this study is to test the
      feasibility and acceptability of the MED-Go app as an mHealth behavioral intervention to
      improve HU adherence among AYA with SCD.
