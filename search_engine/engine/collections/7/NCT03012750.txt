      will be included. Macrocirculation is measured by the ankle-brachial index (ABI). In order to
      assess the skin microcirculation intraoperative fluorescence angiography is used (SPY Eliteâ„¢,
      NOVADAQ, Canada). The alteration of microcirculation is compared in direct and indirect
      revascularized angiosomes by calculation of the fluorescence parameters Ingress (IN) and
      Ingress rate (InR). Clinical Follow-up investigations will be performed and the wound healing
      rate is compared between the different revascularization methods.
