      others show benefits for cognitive function and/or attention, studies of increased DHA
      exposure during fetal life are needed, especially in the US. Women in the US consume low
      amounts of DHA compared to other world populations, and this likely means less DHA transfer
      to the fetus than in many other populations. Prenatal DHA exposure may be more important than
      postnatal exposure, because animal studies show critical windows for brain DHA accumulation
      in relation to effects on neurotransmitters such as serotonin, dopamine and GABA.
