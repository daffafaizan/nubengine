      Prediction Rule (CPR) that are purported to identify patients with shoulder pain who respond
      favorably to cervicothoracic spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) and daily home exercises of
      cervical and thoracic active range of motion exercises. These prognostic variables have been
      identified in a single study, and therefore it is not known if these factors will be valid in
      a different group of patients, even ones with similar characteristics as those used in the
      investigators' initial exploratory study. Further study of these identified factors is needed
      for validation in an independent sample of patients, which will improve generalizability for
      clinical practice. In this study, patients with a primary complaint of shoulder pain will be
      randomly assigned to receive cervicothoracic spine manipulation followed by therapeutic
      exercises or therapeutic exercise alone. If the variables are in fact meaningful, patients
      who exhibit 3 or more of the identified prognostic variables and receive cervicothoracic SMT
      should experience improved outcomes compared to patients who have less than 3 of these
      variables and receive the same intervention. Additionally, patients who exhibit 3 or more of
      the identified variables that receive cervicothoracic SMT should also have superior outcomes
      to patients who exhibit 3 or more of the identified variables and receive an alternate
      intervention (exercise only). Finally, the investigators will determine if the addition of
      cervicothoracic SMT to exercise improves outcomes as compared to exercise alone.
