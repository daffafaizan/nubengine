      incidence and a strong association with increased mortality and serious co-morbidities, such
      as diabetes. Surgical interventions, such as laparoscopic gastric banding have been developed
      with the aim of providing a laparoscopic placed device that is safe and effective in
      generating substantial weight loss. By investigation of the incretin effect, the secretion of
      GIP and GLP-1, the insulin response and sensitivity and the beta-cell responsiveness to
      glucose in 10 obese patients without type 2 diabetes before and after laparoscopic gastric
      banding the aim of this project is describe the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in the
      amelioration of glucose homeostasis during long-term weight loss.
