      randomized intervention trial designed to improve early breastfeeding outcomes for mothers
      planning to breastfeed. The purpose of the pilot study is to 1) described the prenatal infant
      feeding attitudes and intentions of population-based sample of expectant mothers from the
      same recruitment base as the future intervention trial, 2) characterize the metabolic health
      profiles of the sample and 3) estimate the prevalence of early lactation difficulties among
      the subset of this sample that initiates breastfeeding.
