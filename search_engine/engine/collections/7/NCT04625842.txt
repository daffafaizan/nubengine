      group interview study with patients and family members. They will perform 6 (3 in the French,
      and 3 in the Dutch language) focus group interviews with patients and 6 (3 in the French, and
      3 in the Dutch language) with family members. Following research questions will be answered:

        -  What elements of care (ie infrastructure, interpersonal contact, information,
           communication) are good to the opinion of patients and family members?

        -  What elements of care can be improved?

        -  What are priorities in improvement of the care for patients and families?

        -  What actions could possibly be taken in order to improve the care for future patients?

      Because the radiotherapy ward exists of 3 clusters, one per type of treatment conducted, the
      investigators will perform 6 focus group interviews with patients (3 in the French, and 3 in
      the Dutch language) and 6 focus group interviews with family members (3 in the French, and 3
      in the Dutch language).

      Investigators will collect sex, main diagnosis (of patients), age and nationality of all
      participants at the beginning of each focus group interview. They will transcribe all
      interviews verbatim and analyze them in Nvivo software as provided by the VUB. Participant
      characteristics will be analyzed by descriptive statistics.
