      is little evidence underpinning exercise prescription and outcomes are poor. Few trials have
      investigated which muscles should be targeted and how they should be strengthened with
      respect to the mode, frequency, duration, intensity and progression. This is a randomized
      controlled trial(RCT) investigating the effectiveness of an evidence based exercise program
      for shoulder impingement. This research may have an impact on how physiotherapists provide
      exercise programs to patients with shoulder impingement.
