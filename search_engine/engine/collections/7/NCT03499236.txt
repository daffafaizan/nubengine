    
      This is a prospective, multi-center, 1:1 randomized, patient and observer blinded clinical
      study, with a Shunt Treatment arm and a non-implant Control arm. A total of approximately 400
      patients will be randomized. Patients will be blinded during follow-up for a minimum of 12
      months to a maximum of 24 months. Control patients will have the opportunity to receive a
      shunt once unblinded, if they provide consent and continue to meet inclusion/exclusion
      criteria. All implanted patients will be followed for a total of 5 years from the time of the
      study device implantation.
