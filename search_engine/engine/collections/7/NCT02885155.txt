      survival lower than 3 years in the absence of a specific treatment.

      The prognostic evaluation is based on clinical and hemodynamic data needing the right cardiac
      catheterization. It has been shown that prognosis depends essentially on the severity of
      right ventricular dysfunction. Recently, various echocardiographic parameters derived from
      new techniques such as tissue Doppler have been validated for the evaluation of right
      ventricular function. Some have been used as prognostic factor in cardiac insufficiency, but
      not in PAH.

      This is an observational retrospective and then prospective study. Usual PAH assessment
      includes a complete clinical and paraclinical evaluation. History and physical examination
      assess dyspnea, search signs of disease severity and quantify functional impact of 6
      min-walking test. An echocardiography and a right cardiac catheterization are realized in all
      patients. Clinical consultations of patients and control echocardiographic and hemodynamic
      examinations are programmed at regular intervals.

      The demonstration of prognostic value of some echocardiographic parameters could diminish
      right cardiac catheterizations.
