      timing, or phase. Young, sedentary subjects were recruited for this study. Baseline measures
      included anthropometric, body composition, cardiorespiratory fitness, chronotype, and
      circadian phase. Subjects were randomized to 5 consecutive days of morning or evening
      exercise. Thirty minutes of exercise was performed at the designated time and intensity was
      maintained at a heart rate corresponding with 70% peak VO2. The measure of circadian phase
      was salivary dim light melatonin onset, indicated by the time when saliva melatonin
      concentration exceeded 4pg/ml. Post-exercise circadian phase was measured the evening
      following the last day of exercise. Changes in circadian phase were compared between morning
      and evening groups.
