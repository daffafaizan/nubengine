      Yet, a few problems remain unsolved, and aseptic loosening is probably the most important of
      them. One of the main reasons for aseptic loosening in THA is the foreign body reaction
      caused by the wear particles. Since the late 1990s, the orthopedic industry has been
      developing highly crosslinked polyethylene (HXLPE) materials to capitalize on the increased
      wear resistance. In 2007, E1Â® Antioxidant Infused Technology was developed to reduce wear
      rate, maintain mechanical properties and prevent oxidative degradation.
