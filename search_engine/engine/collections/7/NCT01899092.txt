      sequences into the hepatocytes of subjects infected with HCV. The anti-HCV sequences will be
      comprised of three different short hairpin RNAs (shRNA) that have the ability to directly
      cleave the RNA genome of HCV by a process known as RNA interference. The transfer of the
      anti-HCV sequences will be accomplished using a "vector" that was made from an
      adenovirus-associated virus (AAV) by removing the viral genes and replacing them with a
      non-replicating genetic sequence that produces three different shRNA that target three
      different regions within the HCV genes. This type of vector has been used in other clinical
      trials in order to transduce the hepatocytes of subjects who suffer from hemophilia.
