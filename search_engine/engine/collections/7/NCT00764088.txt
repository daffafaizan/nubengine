      strategies. When determining the therapeutic course for a patient and his full thickness
      wound, all management agents that are available are considered for use; and the clinician
      uses his judgment to determine the most appropriate tools to use that will give the patient
      the most likely chance of success. Some of the agents that are used are novel, and it is
      appropriate to demonstrate to others the potential usefulness of these agents
