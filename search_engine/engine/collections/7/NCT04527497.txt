    
      The aim of this study is to describe the course of disease and the treatment of patients
      suffering from COVID-19 who are hospitalized and treated as inpatients:

        1. Are there common features (previous illnesses, medication, age, BMI, etc.), which may
           influence the course of disease?

        2. Are there therapeutic procedures that have a positive or negative impact on the course
           of the disease or the length of stay in the intensive care unit/ the duration of
           ventilation (early/late intubation, CPAP, NIV, ECMO)?
