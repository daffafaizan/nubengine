      severe pain due to the surgical trauma and the prosthesis. Opioid agents are commonly used
      for analgesia management. However, opioids have adverse effects such as nausea, vomiting,
      sedation and respiratory depression. Peripheral nerve blocks such as femoral block, adductor
      canal block (ACB) may be performed to reduce opioid consumption and opioid-related side
      effects.

      Selective blockade of the saphenous nerve in the adductor canal for knee surgery provides
      effective analgesia without quadriceps muscle weakness. This is an important advantage of ACB
      since it there is no motor blockade in the postoperative period. Blocking of the motor
      branches leads to delaying of the mobilization and it increases the patient's falling risk.
      ACB, targets the saphenous nerve and the vastus medialis branch which are the two largest
      sensorial nerves of the femoral nerve that innervates the knee. ACB blocks the articular
      branches of the obturator nerve at the same time. Since the ACB is performed at the distal
      site of thigh it does not target majority of the efferent branches of the quadriceps muscle,
      therefore the strength of this muscle may not be affected. ACB is usually performed with a
      volume of 10-30 ml and studies may be needed including different volumes to understand its
      effectiveness.

      The aim of this study is to compare the different volumes (20 ml, 30 ml, and 40 ml) of
      US-guided ACB for postoperative analgesia management after total knee arthroplasty. The
      primary aim is to compare postoperative opioid consumption and the secondary aim is to
      evaluate postoperative pain scores (VAS), motor blockage, the first mobilization time, and
      adverse effects related with opioids (allergic reaction, nausea, vomiting).
