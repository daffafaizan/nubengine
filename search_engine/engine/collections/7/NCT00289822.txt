    
      -  The study is an open-label, controlled, randomized single-center trial.

        -  Patients post myocardial infarction (>= 3 months) with a patent infarct-related artery
           are included.

        -  Bone marrow-derived progenitor cells are aspirated under local anaesthesia, and after
           cell processing, are infused into the patent infarct-related artery during stop flow
           within the same day. Blood-derived progenitor cells are isolated out of 250ml peripheral
           venous blood, and after cell processing and 3 days culture, are infused into the patent
           infarct-related artery during stop flow. In addition, left ventricular angiography is
           performed. In the control group coronary angiography and left ventricular angiography
           without any intracoronary infusion are performed.

        -  After 3 months, left ventricular angiography is repeated, and patients of the control
           group cross-over to active treatment with progenitor cells, whereas patients initially
           treated with progenitor cells cross-over to the alternate cell type.

        -  The primary endpoint is the change in quantitative global left ventricular ejection
           fraction in LV angiography between the groups.
