      PhytostandardÂ® rhodiola/saffron, from 2 tablets per day during 42 days.

      on the one hand, during the two visits (inclusion and follow-up), the investigator completes
      the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D) and the Clinical Global Impression (CGI). During the
      inclusion visit, he completes with his patient CIM-10 for depression diagnostic.

      on the other hand, patients complete HAD 4 times : just after the inclusion visit, at day 14,
      at day 28 and just before the follow-up visit. He completes the Patient Global Impression too
      at each time.
