    
      This is a prospective, multi-center, observational study. Patients will be recruited based on
      the usual care presentation at each investigative site, as regular practice would dictate.
      Consecutive patients deemed eligible for the study by their physician will be invited to
      participate during their usual care visit. Enrolled patients will receive evaluations and
      treatment for Dupuytren's contracture according to the standard of care and clinical practice
      at each study site. No study-specific visits will be required as part of the study. Treatment
      and Follow-up Visits will be determined by the treating physician. Treatments received for
      Dupuytren's contracture will be recorded (ie, XIAFLEX, fasciectomy, or fasciotomy/needle
      aponeurotomy), including initial treatment and any subsequent therapy. The full prescribing
      information and medication guide for XIAFLEX is provided in this protocol as reference
      (Appendix B). Patient data (including treatment outcomes, joint contracture measured by the
      treating physician, and evidence of recurrence) and health care resource utilization data
      will be drawn from the patients' medical records, examination, and patient interviews. These
      data will be recorded via a web-based electronic data collection (EDC) system.

      PROs will be collected by self-completed questionnaires given to each patient via web-based
      data collection or telephone interviews. The site will follow up with the patient according
      to usual practice. Information from the patient's visit may include goniometry and the
      physician's assessment of treatment outcome and healthcare utilization. Patients will be
      considered enrolled in the study for a maximum of 4 years post-enrollment or until death,
      withdrawal of consent, loss to follow-up, or study closure.
