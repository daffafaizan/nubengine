           ureagenesis in adult healthy controls and patients with the following inborn errors of
           metabolism: N-acetylglutamate synthetase deficiency, propionic acidemia, methylmalonic
           acidemia, carbamylphosphate synthase deficiency, ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency
           and the syndrome of hyperammonemia, hypoglycemia and hyperinsulinemia (HHH Syndrome).

        -  To determine if such treatment improves other indicators of abnormal nitrogen metabolism
           such as elevated blood levels of glutamine, glycine and alanine.
