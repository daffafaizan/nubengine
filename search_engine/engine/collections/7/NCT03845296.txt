      I. To evaluate the overall response rate (ORR) (confirmed and unconfirmed, complete and
      partial) associated with rucaparib in patients with genomic LOH high and/or deleterious
      BRCA1/2 mutations within: Cohort 1: Patients with squamous cell histology or mixed histology
      with a squamous component; Cohort 2: Patients with non-squamous histology (adenocarcinoma,
      large cell, or non-small cell lung cancer [NSCLC] not otherwise specified [NOS]).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate investigator assessed progression-free survival (IA-PFS) and overall survival
      (OS) associated with rucaparib within each cohort.

      II. To evaluate duration of response among responders within each cohort. III. To evaluate
      the frequency and severity of toxicities associated with rucaparib among all patients
      enrolled on the study (combining cohorts).

      TRANSLATIOAL MEDICINE OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the association between alterations in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair
      genes and response by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1.

      II. To perform comprehensive next-generation sequencing of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) at
      baseline in all patients to assess its clinical utility in comparison to tumor tissue
      biomarker profiles.

      III. To establish a tissue/blood repository from patients with refractory non-small cell lung
      cancer (NSCLC).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive rucaparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-21. Courses repeat every
      21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year, and
      then every 6 months for up to 3 years.
