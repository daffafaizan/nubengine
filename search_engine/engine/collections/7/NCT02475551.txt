      the transplantation setting. Patients with DSAs will be treated with IdeS prior to
      transplantation. Each patient will receive one dose of IdeS. If the crossmatch test is
      negative after IdeS treatment, the patient will be transplanted with a kidney from a deceased
      or living donor. Two to four dose groups are planned. Each group will contain 2 patients with
      the possibility to extend the group to up to 4 patients per group if required for safety
      and/or efficacy evaluation. The starting dose will be 0.25 mg/kg BW, given as a single
      intravenous infusion prior to surgery with the possibility to increase the dose in higher
      dose groups.
