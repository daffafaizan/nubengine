      the clinical utility and safety of fentanyl transdermal therapeutic system (patch) for
      treatment of pain caused by radiotherapy. The patients increase or even decrease the amount
      of study medication in order to achieve pain relief, 48 to 72 hours or 3 days are required
      after the first patch application. The study medication will be used for 4 weeks. VAS (visual
      analog scale), BPI Q9 (quality of life) and global assessment have been used to assess the
      effectiveness. VAS will be assessed every week. BPI Q9 will be assessed at week 1 and week 4.
      Global assessment will be assessed at week 4. The safety of the study drug will be evaluated
      using adverse event (AE) report.

      The investigator will assess the pain intensity of patients and increase or even decrease
      Fentanyl dosage every week. Fentanyl will be started on 25 or 50 ug per hr depending on
      investigator's judgement. Fentanyl will be administered for 4 weeks.
