      further outcomes in a healthy older active, a healthy older sedentary and a obese sedentary
      group with increased cardiovascular risk. The investigators will analyze large and small
      artery function, physical fitness and activity as well as inflammatory parameters in these
      three groups. Here the investigators will investigate the influence of physical activity and
      inflammatory parameters on the vascular health in different beds.

      In the intervention part the older sedentary group with increasing cardiovascular risk (OSR)
      will be randomized in a control and an intervention group. The intervention group will get a
      high intensity interval training which is walking based and individual adjusted. The control
      group will get general lifestyle recommendations. After 12 weeks of training OSR group will
      be tasted again. The aim of the second part is to assess the effect of high intensity
      interval training on vascular health and inflammatory parameters.
