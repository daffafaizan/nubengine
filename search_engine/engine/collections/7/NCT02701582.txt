    
      We hypothesize that the ability to assess volume status and fluid responsiveness with
      information gained from Edwards FloTrac/EV1000 system coupled with a goal-directed therapy
      fluid management algorithm can make a difference in patient outcomes. Our specific aims are:

        -  Demonstrate goal-directed therapy (GDT) in fluid management improves peri-operative
           fluid balance

        -  Demonstrate GDT improves pulmonary function and organ oxygenation

        -  Demonstrate GDT reduces necessary therapeutic interventions in the peri- operative
           period

        -  Demonstrate GDT reduces hypotensive episodes in the peri-operative period

      Outcomes

      We will study the consequences of goal-directed fluid therapy that employs use of dynamic
      indicators seen on FloTrac/EV1000 system by measuring the following:

        -  Pulmonary status

             -  Time to extubation

             -  Alveolar-arterial (A-a) gradient of oxygen

             -  Requirements for supplemental oxygen

        -  Organ oxygenation

             -  Serum lactate

             -  Arterial blood gas values (pH, HCO3, CO2, O2)

        -  Length of stay (LOS)

             -  In hospital, defined as time from operation start to eligibility for discharge from
                hospital according to surgeon in accordance with pre-define criteria

             -  In ICU/PACU, defined as time from operation end to eligibility for discharge from
                intensive care according to attending intensivist in accordance with pre- define
                criteria

        -  Fluid Balance

             -  Inputs and outputs (I/Os) of all measurable fluids (i.e. blood, crystalloid,
                colloid) in peri-operative period, through and including duration of intensive care
                or the next 24-48 hours after completion of surgery

             -  Drugs administered for fluid management (i.e. mannitol, vasopressors)

             -  Pre-operative and post-operative body weights and twice-daily weights via bed
                weights

        -  Hypotension

             -  Number, duration and severity (i.e. minimum blood pressure) of hypotensive episode,
                defined as MAP <65
