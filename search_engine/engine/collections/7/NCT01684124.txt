    
      1. Identify patients likely to require ventilation until the day after tomorrow (a time
           frame of 36 hours of average)

        2. Deliver a conservative oxygen therapy protocol while in ICU (a time frame on average of
           10 days)

        3. Target an oxygen saturation between 90 and 92%

        4. Adjust FiO2 to achieve target SaO2 at all times

        5. Assess percentage of time patient is within target

        6. Assess for safety of this approach
