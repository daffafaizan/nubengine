    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the safety, maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of
      anti-ICOS monoclonal antibody MEDI-570 (MEDI-570) in patients with refractory/relapsed
      peripheral T-cell lymphoma-not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS), angioimmunoblastic T-cell
      lymphoma (AITL), follicular lymphoma, mycosis fungoides (MF) and cutaneous T-cell lymphomas
      (CTCL).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of MEDI-570. II. To evaluate the overall response
      rate (ORR) and progression free survival (PFS) of MEDI-570 at all dose levels and in a
      10-patient expansion cohort at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).

      III. To determine short and long term effects of MEDI-570 at all dose levels on the immune
      system and on T-cell lymphocyte subsets.

      IV. To determine the relationship between ICOS expression on tumor cells and response to
      MEDI-570.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate biomarkers of response and resistance to MEDI-570 in the study population.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive anti-ICOS monoclonal antibody MEDI-570 intravenously (IV) over 1-4 hours on
      day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 8 cycles in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 6
      weeks for 12 weeks.
