    
      A sample of 60 children aged 9 to 23 months paired in the pre-vaccine period (NV) and 30-45
      post-primary vaccination days will be selected at health facilities in the metropolitan
      region of Belo Horizonte.

      Children whose mothers consent to participate in research, have collected blood and elements
      of past medical history recorded. Analyses of humoral and cellular biomarkers will be used in
      a comparative study with other post-vaccination periods previously analyzed in children
      during the first phase in study funded by the Ministry of Health.

      specific objectives:

        1. Estimate and compare the proportion of positivity and the geometric mean plasma titers
           of neutralizing antibodies against yellow fever;

        2. Assess lymphocyte frequency T and B memory induced in vitro by the vaccine antigen 17DD
           substrains, and...

        3. Quantify the lymphocytes T CD8 + producers of intracytoplasmic cytokines induced in
           vitro by the vaccine antigen 17DD substrains in unvaccinated children and primed aged
           between 9 and 23 months, categorized according to the vaccination time 30-45 days.
