      heart disease, while genetic channelopathies and cardiomyopathies are prominent contributors
      in young adults. Among individuals that suffer aborted cardiac arrests in the absence of
      overt coronary and structural heart disease, diagnostic algorithms that screen for cardiac
      channelopathies and more subtle forms of structural heart disease have been established.
      Despite the extensive investigations currently utilized, a significant proportion of aborted
      cardiac arrests remain unexplained.

      Although invasive electrophysiology studies are a cornerstone for diagnosis and management of
      arrhythmia disorders, they are not invariably included in the workup of cases of unexplained
      aborted cardiac arrest. This is largely driven by initial studies suggesting that the
      diagnostic yield in this context is low, however these investigations often used invasive
      electrophysiology studies indiscriminately in all cases of aborted cardiac arrest. Since
      these earlier studies, our insight and approach to SCD has evolved and it has become clear
      that the majority of patients do not require an invasive electrophysiology study for
      diagnosis. However an invasive electrophysiology study may still have an important role among
      these individuals when the initial workup is negative. Notably, arrhythmias that require
      invasive electrophysiology for diagnosis, including bundle branch reentrant ventricular
      tachycardia and supraventricular tachycardias associated with hemodynamic collapse, have been
      identified as arrhythmic culprits in this patient population.

      The goal of the EPS ARREST study is to evaluate the diagnostic yield of a standardized
      invasive electrophysiology study among survivors of SCD when initial investigations fail to
      identify an underlying etiology.
