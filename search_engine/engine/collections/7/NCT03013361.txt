      treatment of sinonasal disease. Although it is a minimally invasive and less traumatic
      procedure, it is usually associated with pain of mild to moderate intensity which reaches its
      maximum level in the first few postoperative hours. However, even low-level postoperative
      pain may be associated with delayed functional recovery and it frequently contributes to
      dissatisfaction with the procedure delay in return to work and readmission after surgery.
      Postoperative analgesia after FESS can be achieved through opioids, NSAIDs, topical or
      infiltration of local anaesthetic and regional techniques like sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG)
      block, infraorbital nerve block and nasociliary block. As the sensory innervations of the SPG
      supplies the nasal turbinates, nasopharynx and palate, SPG block is expected to provide
      perioperative analgesia after FESS. Integration of regional anaesthesia with general
      anaesthesia technique can provide a better hemodynamic control, less perioperative opioid
      use, less bleeding and higher level of patients' satisfaction. Reduction in surgical bleeding
      in FESS can improve surgical field and also surgeons' satisfaction and a reduced opioid use
      may be translated into a less postoperative nausea & vomiting, rapid recovery and early
      hospital discharge. But, the current evidences regarding the benefit of SPG block after FESS
      is controversial. In this randomized controlled trial, efficacy of sphenopalatine ganglion
      block will be evaluated using bupivacaine or ropivacaine as local anaesthetic in adult
      patients undergoing FESS under general anaesthesia.
