      attentional processing including stimulus-driven bottom-up processing and top-down
      goal-directed inhibitory control. However, it is unclear whether the functional effects are
      mediated by the peptide directly entering the brain or indirectly via raising peripheral
      concentrations. One possible method of producing a similar pattern of increased peripheral
      oxytocin concentrations but without the possibility of direct entry into the brain would be
      to administer the peptide lingually. In the present double-blind, between-subject,
      placebo-controlled study, 80 healthy male subjects will be recruited and receive either
      oxytocin (24IU) or placebo control administered orally (lingual). 45 minutes after treatment
      subjects are required to complete a social-emotional saccade/antisaccade eye-tracking
      paradigm. This paradigm uses social (happy, sad, angry, fear, and neutral faces) as well as
      non-social (oval shapes) stimuli to explore social- and emotion-specific effects of orally
      administered oxytocin.
