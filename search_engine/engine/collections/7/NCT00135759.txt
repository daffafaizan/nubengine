      more effective approaches to reduce the duration and discomfort associated with opioid
      withdrawal. It has been shown that very low doses of naltrexone administered in the presence
      of opiates has analgesic and dependency reducing properties. The purpose of this study is to
      investigate the effects of very low doses of naltrexone administered during a methadone
      tapering schedule for opiate detoxification. In addition, this study will compare the
      effectiveness of two different dose regimens of naltrexone.

      Participants in this double-blind study will be recruited among opioid dependent individuals
      already enrolled in a 6-day inpatient opioid detoxification program. Participants will be
      already receiving standard treatment to control discomfort during a methadone tapering
      schedule. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three groups. Two of the groups
      will be given naltrexone; Group 1 will receive 0.125 mg each day, and Group 2 will receive
      0.250 mg each day. Group 3 will receive a placebo. Participants will be evaluated upon
      enrollment for opiate addiction severity. They will continue to be evaluated daily for signs
      of withdrawal and salivary cortisol. An additional evaluation and urine test will be
      completed 1 day following discharge. Daily evaluations will take 15 minutes to complete.
      Seven days following discharge, participants will be contacted for a 20-minute phone
      interview. During the phone interview, participants will schedule an appointment to provide a
      final urine specimen for the detection of drugs of abuse.
