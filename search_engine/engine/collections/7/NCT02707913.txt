      washout period of two to three weeks. During each session, the subjects will be administered
      a single oral dose of 10mg amlodipine (one BF-Amlodipine Tablet 10mg or one Norvasc Tablet
      10mg) after an overnight fast of approximately 10 hours. Venous blood samples will be
      collected at pre-dose (0 h), and up to 96 h post dose. The plasma concentrations of
      amlodipine will be determined by a validated assay. The non-compartmental method will be used
      to analyze the plasma concentration-time data and calculate the main pharmacokinetic
      parameters such as Peak plasma concentration (Cmax), Time to maximum concentration (Tmax),
      Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC0-last, AUC0-inf) and Elimination
      half-life (T1/2). Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) will be conducted on logarithmically
      transformed Cmax, AUC0-last and AUC0-inf. The two one sided tests will be used to calculate
      the 90% confidence intervals for the mean difference in AUC0-last, AUC0-inf and Cmax, and to
      assess the bioequivalence of the two products
