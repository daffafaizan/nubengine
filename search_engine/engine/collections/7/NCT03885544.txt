      meat on gut microbiota in young healthy adults in a cross-over, randomized controlled feeding
      trial. The hypothesis is that compared to consuming a meat-free lacto-ovo vegetarian (LOV)
      diet, (1) consuming the LOV diet with unprocessed red meat or processed red meat (omnivorous
      diet) will shift the gut microbiota with greater abundance of the bacteria Lactobacillus and
      other SCFA producers such as Clostridium XIVa, and no increase of pathogenic bacteria. The
      concentration of SCFA in stools will also increase in subjects consuming the unprocessed red
      meat diet. Compared to consuming a meat-free lacto-ovo vegetarian (LOV) diet, (2) consuming
      the LOV diet with processed beef and pork (omnivorous diet) will result in a comparable shift
      in gut microbiota as unprocessed red meat, except for greater abundance of taxa
      Erysipelotrichaceae and lower abundance of Lachnospiraceae.
