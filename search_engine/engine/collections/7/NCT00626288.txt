      study the efficacy of mesalazine treatment on symptoms of IBS. In a subgroup of patients the
      efficacy of this treatment will be also assessed on low-grade inflammation. We expect to
      confirm that mesalazine treatment reduces the number and activation of inflammatory cells in
      the colonic mucosa of IBS patients, thus providing the rationale for the assessment of this
      treatment on symptoms of IBS.
