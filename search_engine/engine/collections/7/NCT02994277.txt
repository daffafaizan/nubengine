        1. To test University of Virginia closed-loop algorithm with meal announcement for 36 hours
           at our facilities.

        2. To test the ability of the closed-loopInstituto Tecnologico de Buenos Aires (ITBA)/
           Universidad Nacional de La Plata (UNLP)/ Universidad Nacional de Quilmes (UNQ) algorithm
           without meal announcement to maintain glucose control for 2 periods of 12 hours

      In both cases, the adequate operation of the system will be considered verified if the system
      works properly at least 80% of the total connection time .
