      an effective method of killing numerous types of organisms. This therapy avoids the use of
      antibiotics along with their potential side effects. The initial application of this therapy
      to the oral cavity is particularly appropriate since the therapy can be applied topically
      either in a specific or general fashion, killing is immediate and resistance is unlikely as
      it is free radical-mediated. In addition, the disease states being treated (gingivitis &
      periodontitis) are highly prevalent and associated with significant morbidity. The equipment
      and costs of this therapy are simple, easily applied and relatively inexpensive compared with
      current therapies. Based on the scientific data to date this therapy has the potential of
      significantly improving the oral health of those affected.

      This is a pivotal, prospective, randomized, examiner blinded, multicenter study to evaluate
      the effect of a single treatment of photodynamic disinfection in adults with chronic
      periodontal disease.
