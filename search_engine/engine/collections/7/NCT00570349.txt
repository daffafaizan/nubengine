      encoding the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. A cycle of
      chronic, persistent infections with CF-related pathogens and an excessive inflammatory
      response progressively damages the airways and lung parenchyma, resulting in widespread
      bronchiectasis and ultimately, respiratory failure. Despite tremendous advances in
      understanding the CF gene and the CFTR protein, it is not known exactly how mutations in the
      gene and defects in CFTR lead to persistent airway infection and inflammation.

      Inhaled nitric oxide (NO) has potential to be an effective treatment in CF lung disease.
      Inhaled NO has been studied in other airways diseases characterized by infection and /or
      inflammation such as COPD and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

      NO has been shown to activate CFTR and alternative chloride channels, thereby increasing
      chloride current in epithelial cells. Therefore, NO treatment may be beneficial in
      individuals with CF.
