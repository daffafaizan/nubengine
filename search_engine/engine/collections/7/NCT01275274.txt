      white blood cells that are involved in regulating the immune system. Laboratory research
      studies suggest that all-trans retinoic acid (tretinoin) can affect the neutrophils and the T
      lymphocytes in such a way that could decrease the abnormal immune response directed against
      the body own neutrophils.
