      Premature infants who require multiple blood transfusions have a 15-30 percent incidence of
      cytomegalovirus infections. Many of these infections result in severe disease, with a
      mortality of about 20 percent. In theory, the infection could be avoided by using blood and
      blood products exclusively from CMV antibody negative donors. The use of such blood is
      impractical because it would require the rejection of approximately 40 percent of all blood
      donors. Studies had suggested that passively acquired antibody could reduce the incidence of
      disease in exposed neonates. This provided the rationale for the use of passive immunization
      with hyperimmune globin in premature infants likely to require multiple transfusions. Lots of
      high titer CMV immune globulin suitable for intravenous administration were prepared using a
      technique of screening outdated blood bank plasma for units with high levels of antibody to
      CMV.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      Randomized, double-blind. Subjects received either prophylactic CMVIG-intravenously or a
      placebo. Infants were followed for up to 12 weeks after discharge. Total sample size was
      expected to be 650.
