      myocardial infarction (MI). The risk is believed to be related in part to systemic
      inflammation associated with these diseases. Some studies have suggested that treatment of RA
      patients with anti-TNF alpha can decrease the risks of MI. However, we do not have data on
      the effect of anti-TNF alpha on coronary atherosclerosis. Adalimumab is probably the best
      anti-TNF alpha candidate to study for an effect on coronary atherosclerosis as it has more
      affinity for membrane bound TNF alpha than other anti-TNF alpha products such as etanercept
      and a higher global anti-TNF alpha activity in psoriasis patients.

      This study involves a comparison of adalimumab administered sub-cutaneously with a loading
      dose of 80 mg followed by 40 mg at week 1 and 40 mg every other week thereafter for a total
      of 10 injections (two 40 mg injections at week 0 for a total dose of 80 mg, followed by
      single injections at weeks 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13 and 15) with non systemic treatments for
      psoriasis (topical therapy and/or UVB therapy). Patients will be randomized (2:1) to either
      adalimumab or topical and/or UVB therapy for psoriasis.

      If this pilot study shows that adalimumab reduces vascular inflammation in patients with
      psoriasis, a larger study could be undertaken to study the effect of adalimumab on coronary
      atherosclerotic plaques.
