      I. Observed rate of brain metastases following TTFields therapy at 6 months.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Observed rate of brain metastases following TTFields therapy at 12 months. II. Survival of
      participants with SCLC after using TTFields therapy. III. Usage and overall safety
      characteristics of TTFields therapy. IV. Quality of life among participants using TTFields
      therapy. V. Observed rate of SCLC brain metastases at 6 months from the beginning of the 4th
      cycle of chemotherapy to development of brain metastases.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants will receive TTFields therapy on a continuous basis (i.e., 18-24 hours a day, 7
      days a week) for a period of 12 months or until the development of brain metastases,
      whichever comes first. Participants will be able to carry the device in an over-the-shoulder
      bag or backpack so that they can receive continuous at-home treatment. The investigator or
      other designated healthcare provider will provide detailed instructions regarding the
      placement/replacement and positioning of the transducer arrays on the participants head.
      TTFields are applied to the shaved scalp via two pairs of orthogonally positioned transducer
      arrays. Each pair of transducer arrays will be centered on the participants shaved head such
      that one pair is placed on the left and right side of the head, and the second pair placed
      anteriorly and posteriorly. Transducer arrays should be replaced every 2 to 3 days, with a
      slight relocation of the new arrays ~2 cm from the prior location.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
