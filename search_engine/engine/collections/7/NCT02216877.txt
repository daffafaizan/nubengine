      mortality independent of traditional cardiovascular risk factors due to increased vascular
      calcification. Epidemiological and experimental data suggest that hypermagnesemia and
      magnesium supplementation reduce vascular calcification in chronic kidney disease by
      increasing calcium/phosphate solubility in serum, by inhibiting calcium influx into vascular
      smooth muscle cells (VSMC), by inhibiting intracellular pro-calcification enzymes in VSMC and
      by increasing activity of intracellular anti-calcification enzymes in VSMC. A trial to
      investigate the effect of oral magnesium supplementation on vascular calcification in
      subjects with CKD is currently being planned, but prior to initiating such a trial it is
      necessary to determine the dose of oral magnesium needed to increase intracellular magnesium
      and serum magnesium.
