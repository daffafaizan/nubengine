      with lower risk of T2DM. However, the number of randomized clinical trials which examine the
      impact of yoghurt consumption on glycemic control and body weight management of T2DM patients
      is small and include yoghurts fortified with vitamin D or probiotics. According to our
      knowledge, fortification of yoghurt with other classes of vitamins beyond vitamin D has not
      been examined. Vitamins of B-complex hold key-role in energy metabolism. In the state of
      diabetes mellitus, the requirements for this vitamin class may be higher because of their
      water solubility and increased excretion. Two groups of patients participated in the study.
      One group received yoghurt enriched with vitamins B and one group received isocaloric plain
      yoghurt. In addition, in order to investigate the effect of plain yoghurt on gut hormones,
      responses to a mixed meal tolerance test were evaluated in the beggining and the end of the
      dietary intervention.
