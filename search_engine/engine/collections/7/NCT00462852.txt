      Primary

        -  Compare the incidence of venous thromboembolism in patients with locally advanced or
           metastatic pancreatic cancer treated with gemcitabine hydrochloride and dalteparin
           versus gemcitabine hydrochloride alone.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the survival benefit, in terms of increased (from 70% to 85%) survival at 12
           weeks, of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the toxicity of these regimens.

        -  Compare the overall survival of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the time to disease progression in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Determine the effect of gemcitabine hydrochloride and dalteparin on serological markers
           of thromboangiogenesis.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, randomized study. Patients are stratified according to
      disease progression (locally advanced vs metastatic) and Karnofsky performance status (â‰¥ 80%
      vs < 80%). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes once weekly in
           weeks 1-7 and 9-11.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive low molecular weight dalteparin subcutaneously once daily in
           weeks 1-12. Patients also receive gemcitabine hydrochloride as in arm I.

      Blood samples are acquired at baseline for analysis of circulating tissue factor and vascular
      endothelial growth factor.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 120 patients will be accrued for this study.
