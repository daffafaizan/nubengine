      they had completed an Spontaneous Breathing Trial (SBT) before extubation. To measure
      Semiquantitative Cough Strength Score (SCSS), the investigator will put the patients at 30°
      to 45°, measure SCSS, first. The investigator enhance the patient to cough with as much
      effort as, when the investigator disconnect the ventilator. The cough strength was scored
      from 0 to 5 as follows: 0 = no cough on command, 1 = audible movement of air through the
      endotracheal tube but no audible cough, 2 = weakly (barely) audible cough, 3 = clearly
      audible cough, 4 = stronger cough and 5 = multiple sequential strong coughs.
