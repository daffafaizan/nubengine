    
      This study is a monocentric longitudinal study conducting in obese patients: candidates to
      sleeve gastrectomy and these same patients 6 months after.The primary aim of this study is to
      describe the effects of sleeve gastrectomy on habitual physical activity, physical fitness
      (cardiorespiratory and muscular fitness) and gait parameters in severely obese patients.
      Functional capacity will be assessed during a 6-min walk test, habitual physical activity
      with accelerometers during 7-day recordings in habitual life conditions (Actigraph GT3X® and
      activPAL®), cardiorespiratory fitness during a maximal exercise test on a cycle ergometer
      with a direct measure of peakVO2, muscle strength with an isokinetic dynamometer (Contrex®),
      muscle power and postural stability with force platforms (Kistler® and Satel®) and gait
      parameters with a gait analysis system (GaitRite®). Fatigue, quality of life and joint pain
      will be assessed with questionnaires (MFI-20, SF36 and WOMAC, respectively).
