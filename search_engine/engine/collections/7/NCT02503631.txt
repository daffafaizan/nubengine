    
      This is a multi-site, prospective sample collection study. Subjects will be men and women,
      40-90 years of age, inclusive, each with a colonoscopic biopsy-based diagnosis of CRC and/or
      a pre-malignant colorectal lesion with large enough residual lesion to require subsequent
      surgical excision or complex colonoscopic polypectomy.

      One stool sample from approximately 300 subjects will be collected in this study. A blood
      sample will also be collected from subjects.
