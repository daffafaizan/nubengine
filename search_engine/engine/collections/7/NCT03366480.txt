    
      This is a phase I/II multicenter divided in two phases.

      Phase I: Safety and dose escalation

      This study is not randomized, and all included patients will receive ABTL0812 in addition to
      paclitaxel + carboplatin (SOC). In this phase, patients can be selected from both
      indications, regardless of the number of each indication.

      This phase will be divided in 2 periods:

      Period 1:

      A dose de-escalation phase will be performed with a 3 + 3 design, in which up to four
      different ABTL0812 dose levels will be tested in combination with SOC. Then, 12 patients will
      be included in an expansion phase. All patients will receive one week of ABTL0812 alone
      followed by ABTL0812 + SOC (up to 8 SOC cycles) as combined treatment.

      Period 2:

      After the finalization of the SOC cycles, ABTL0812 will be taken as single therapy, at 1300
      mg tid, up to 12 months from initiation of period 1. This is the Recommended Phase 2 Dose
      (RP2D) as monotherapy for ABTL0812 determined in the previous phase I clinical trial.

      Phase II: Efficacy and safety

      This phase of the study will include up to 33 patients per indication (up to 66 patients
      overall). The final number will depend on the number of patients included in the phase I. The
      number of patients selected per indication will depend on the number already selected in
      phase I, as it is necessary to compensate both indications to have a final number of 40
      patients per indication approximately.
