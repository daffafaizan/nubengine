      solution. Most patients on sirolimus solution will use sirolimus tablet instead.

      The purpose of this study is to understand the pharmacokinetics of sirolimus tablets in
      different regimens in newly renal transplant patients, and the effect of dosage form
      conversion on the concentration of sirolimus in stable renal transplant patients. So that we
      can design a better tacrolimus or cyclosporine/sirolimus/steroid dose regimen for Taiwanese.
