      breath, wheezing, cough, and fatigue. Some people suffer from sudden worsening of asthma
      symptoms despite being treated with medications. When people have asthma attacks the muscle
      tissue in the airway contracts causing the airway to narrow and decreasing the ability for
      the person to breathe.

      Neurological pacemakers are FDA approved devices that stimulate nerves in the body and have
      been used for the treatment of many disorders such as Parkinson's, epilepsy, chronic pain and
      urinary incontinence. Recent animal studies have shown that stimulating (activating a nerve)
      the carotid sheath area (located in the neck) can cause the rapid relaxation of the muscles
      which contract during an asthma attack. This approach has also been successfully used in
      patients at an emergency room when they came in with a severe asthma attack.
