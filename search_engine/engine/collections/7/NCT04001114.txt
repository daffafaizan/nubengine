      schizophrenia is governed by different aspects and effects of cigarette consumption. Smokers
      participating in this study either have no psychiatric diagnosis, or a diagnosis of
      schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Over four study visits, participants will sample
      and compare different research cigarettes, complete questionnaires and concentration tasks,
      and smoke one type of research cigarette for eight hours while wearing a nicotine patch. By
      shaping our understanding of tobacco dependence in schizophrenia, the present project may
      redirect treatment development toward strategies tailored to the specific vulnerabilities of
      this population, which is among the most severely affected by its detrimental impact on
      health and life.
