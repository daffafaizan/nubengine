      surgery, a fractured pelvis or known blood clots in the lower extremities. The filter is
      placed to prevent blood clots from traveling into the lungs. The filters are placed during a
      interventional radiology procedure. During the procedure the diameter of the IVC(inferior
      vena cava)is measured with the patient in a horizontal position (laying down). The blood
      pressure in the IVC when a patient is in this position is relatively low in normal
      circumstances, but may increase substantially when the patient is vertical with secondary
      dilation of the IVC(inferior vena cava).

      Migration of IVC(inferior vena cava)filters is not frequent; however it is a serious
      complication, which may be caused by changes in the diameter of the IVC(inferior vena
      cava)related to changes in the position of the body and/or increased pressure in the abdomen.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate how much postural changes of the body affect the
      diameter of the IVC(inferior vena cava).

      For research purposes patients will have an intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) performed to
      measure the IVC diameter before and after a Valsalva maneuver (having the subject hold their
      breath and bear down as if they were having a bowel movement). The angiographic table will be
      elevated and the measurements will be repeated.
