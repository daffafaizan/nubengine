      percutaneous treatment of CTO. The main advantages of coronary CTA in characterization of CTO
      include the 3-dimensional visualization of occlusion trajectory and morphology as well as the
      exact evaluation of calcifications. Despite this, and although prior single-center studies
      suggested a potential utility of individual coronary CTA-based CTO characteristics for
      predicting PCI, there has been no compiled prediction model for grading CTO suitability for
      PCI in a large cohort of patients.

      The CT-RECTOR registry is a retrospective, multicenter observational study of patients
      undergoing preprocedural coronary CTA before attempted PCI of CTO between 2007 and 2013. The
      study was designed to enroll 250 consecutive patients at 4 high-volume cluster sites in 2
      European countries. CT-RECTOR sites were chosen on the basis of adequate coronary CTA volume
      and PCI proficiency to reflect the state-of-the-art, ''real-life'' management of patients
      with CTO.
