      complications responsible for significant morbidity. This study will evaluate a new treatment
      to prevent bleeding due to this surgery. Indeed, the tranexamic acid (Exacyl) will be used in
      two modes of administration (standard or extended) versus placebo combined with a Rivaroxaban
      treatment at a dose of 10 mg / day for 35 days.

      Patients will be randomized (exacyl standard vs exacyl extended vs. placebo) and will be
      followed for 3 months.
