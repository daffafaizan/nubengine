      rCBF. In line with the symptoms, dorso-lateral prefrontal and premotor regions are expected
      to be chiefly concerned. A normal region regarding its rCBF will be used as placebo. Targets
      will be stimulated using intermittent or continuous theta-burst according to the rCBF anomaly
      as an attempt to "normalize" their activity. The coil will be positioned using a robotic
      device under the control of a neuronavigation system in order to deliver a homogeneous
      stimulation. Using a balanced blinded randomized cross-over design, patients will be
      stimulated on 5 consecutive days (4 sessions per day) and evaluated pre-, post-stimulation
      and 1 month after. In this pilot study the primary outcome measures will be the clinical
      global impression scale whereas MRI will insure that stimulations achieved the correction of
      the rCBF anomalies. Secondary outcome measures will include personalized target symptom
      scales, and scales for catatonic, apathic and obsessive-compulsive symptoms.
