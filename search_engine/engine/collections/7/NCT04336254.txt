    
      This clinical trial is set out to evaluate the followings:

        1. the safety and efficacy of allogeneic human dental pulp mesenchymal stem cells in the
           treatment of severe pneumonia caused by COVID-19;

        2. to explore the effects of human dental pulp mesenchymal stem cells in the treatment of
           severe pneumonia of COVID-19 in terms of reducing mortality and improving clinical
           prognosis; and

        3. to discover a new therapeutic strategy for COVID-19 using allogeneic human dental pulp
           mesenchymal stem cells.
