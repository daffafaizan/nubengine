      (the patient's own)umbilical cord blood stem cells in newborn infants with hypoxic-ischemic
      encephalopathy. For this study, infants who have signs of moderate to severe encephalopathy
      at birth whose mothers have previously consented to providing cord blood stem cells for the
      Gunagdong Cord Blood Bank,or provided verbal consent for cord blood collection for the
      possibility of their baby's participation in this trial, can receive their own cord blood
      stem cells if an adequate number of cells that meet Guangdong Cord Blood Bank Quality
      standards are available in the first 14 postnatal days. Study activities also include serial
      blood draws concurrent with clinically indicated blood draws with a total volume of no more
      than 5 milliliters (1 teaspoon) from all study related tests. Babies will be followed for
      neurodevelopmental outcome at 4 - 6 and 9 - 12 months. MRI's will be obtained per clinical
      routine and results will be analyzed and described in study reports.
