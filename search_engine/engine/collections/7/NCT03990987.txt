      were enrolled. Patients were randomized to receive operation in the D group (8:00-12:00) and
      the N group (18:00-22:00). The Portable Sleep Monitor (PSM) was performed on the following 3
      nights: the night before surgery (Sleep1), the Ô¨Årst night after surgery (Sleep 2), and the
      third night after surgery (Sleep 3). Postoperative pain scores using visual analogue scoring
      scale, subjective sleep quality using the Athens Insomnia Scale, total dose of general
      anesthetics and PCA pump press numbers were also recorded.
