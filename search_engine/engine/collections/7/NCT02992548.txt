      disease than general population. Treatment using statin has been decreased the risk of
      cardiovascular events in pre-dialysis CKD population. Supplementation with omega-3 fatty acid
      (FA) lowers the risk of cardiovascular death in patients with myocardial infarction. This
      cardioprotective effect of omega-3 FA can be explained by anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative,
      or anti-thrombotic effects. Statin such as pravastatin is also known to have
      anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, suggesting that statin may replace the
      cardioprotective effect of omega-3 fatty acids.

      Omega-3 FA such as EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid), DHA (docosahexaenoic acid), and
      EPA/arachidonic acid ratio are well known as key indicators of cardiovascular disease. In
      addition, erythrocyte membrane oleic acid is significantly higher in patients with acute
      coronary syndrome than control subjects. The cardioprotective effect of omega-3 FA may also
      be related to decreased oleic acid content of erythrocyte membrane. There is no report about
      the effect of statin on FA including erythrocyte membrane oleic acid. As omega-3 FAs are
      recognized as therapeutic agents for reducing triglycerides, statin may affect on the
      erythrocyte membrane FA. Therefore, pravastatin supplementation can modify erythrocyte
      membrane FA contents including oleic acid in CKD patients.
