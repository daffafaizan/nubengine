      is well documented. The standard dentrifice has demonstrated a robust anti-plaque and
      anti-inflammatory effect providing multiple benefits. There is a clear value to identify
      additional agents with the same dual action with a comparable or an enhanced level of
      efficacy. This study examined the anti-plaque efficacy following a single use of the
      prototype dentifrice.
