      coordinating centers in this project. Collaborating with community physicians, project
      coordinating-centers randomize diabetic patients, who have signed informed consent, into
      either intervention or control group. While two annual comprehensive lab tests are offered to
      the control group, an additional package of consultations and coordinating services provided
      by health managers is appended to the intervention group. Qualified health managers are
      cultivated in five selected medical institutes to support primary care physicians in managing
      diabetic patients. Responsibilities of health managers include tracking and updating enrolled
      patients' information, providing adequate and scheduled consultations, arranging specialty
      referrals for patients in needs, and transferring stable patients back to their original
      physicians. The feasibility phase of the project implementation will last for three years and
      it will be followed by a phase of full-scale implementation for another two years. Glycemic
      control as well as health status of participants will be the indicators to evaluate outcome
      of the project. At the same time, the periodic measurements on glucose, blood pressures,
      lipids and the incidence of complications will also be analyzed to set up an optimal target
      for diabetic control in Taiwan.
