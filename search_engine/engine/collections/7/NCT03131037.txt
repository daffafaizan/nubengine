    
      The purpose of this open-label, dose escalation clinical trial is to investigate the safety
      of GMCI prior to surgery in patients with NSCLC. GMCI involves the use of aglatimagene
      besadenovec (AdV-tk) injected into the tumor followed by oral valacyclovir prodrug to kill
      tumor cells and stimulate a cancer vaccine effect. Killing tumor cells in an immune
      stimulatory environment induces the body's immune system to detect and destroy cancer cells.
      GMCI has been well tolerated in previous trials in multiple tumor types with clinical,
      pathologic and immune responses.

      AdV-tk will be injected intratumorally on day 0 during a standard of care staging procedure.
      The prodrug, valacyclovir, will be administered orally at a fixed dose for 14 days following
      the AdV-tk injection. Then standard of care surgical resection will be performed about 3
      weeks after the AdV-tk injection. Chemotherapy and/or radiation may begin 6-8 weeks after
      resection surgery. Choice of chemotherapy depends on the treating oncologist.
