      after stroke. The project is driven by the need to have a tool that better meets clinimetric
      properties than the 2 main existing scales, the Scale for Contraversive Pushing (SCP) and the
      Burke Lateropulsion Scale (BLS).

      The initial version (version 0) of the scale has been developped by our team in Grenoble.

      In a first step, an online expert consensus process (Delphi method) will give rise to a
      version 1, considered as generally accepted by the scientific community.

      The SCALA version 1 will be validated in a monocentric clinical study. 60 patients and 40
      patients without stroke and/or healthy controls will be included.
