      and major short and long term morbidity induced by rectal excision justifies new treatments.
      Local excision is a conservative alternative approach associated with low mortality and
      morbidity. The purpose of this prospective randomised multicenter study is to compare local
      vs rectal excision in good responders after radiochemotherapy for low rectal cancer.

      Patients with T2T3 low rectal cancer, less than 8 cm from the anal verge, size =< 4 cm,
      received neoadjuvant treatment, included radiotherapy between 45-55Gy in 5 weeks with
      concomitant chemotherapy consist of at least, one fluoropyrimidine.

      Good clinical responders (residual tumour =< 2 cm) are randomised in local vs rectal
      excision, 6-8 weeks after treatment. In case of not confirmed pathological response following
      local excision, complementary rectal excision is required.

      Bad responders (residual tumour > 2cm) are treated by primary rectal excision. Follow-up
      includes digital rectal examination, CT-scan and endorectal ultrasound (if local excision)
      every 4 months for 2 years, then every 6 months for 3 years.
