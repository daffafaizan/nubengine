      patients with type 2 diabetes, currently on a sulfonylurea, or meglitinide and/or metformin
      and insulin therapy, will be randomized to discontinue insulin and substitute it with
      exenatide or remain on their current diabetes therapy regimen. All patients will continue
      their current diet and exercise regimen during the study.
