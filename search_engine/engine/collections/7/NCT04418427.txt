    
      ADVM-022 (AAV.7m8-aflibercept) is a gene therapy product developed for the treatment of
      serious retinal vascular diseases including Diabetic Macular Edema (DME). DME affects up to
      10% of people with diabetes is caused by fluid accumulation in the macula and is the most
      frequent cause of sight loss in people with diabetic retinopathy. Available therapies for
      treating DME include laser and anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) drugs.
      Anti-VEGFs require frequent and long-term intravitreal (IVT) injections to achieve and
      maintain efficacy. A one-time IVT administration of ADVM-022 has the potential to treat DME
      by providing durable expression of an anti-VEGF protein (aflibercept) to limit abnormal blood
      vessel leakage. ADVM-022 is designed to reduce the current treatment burden which often
      results in undertreatment, progression of disease and subsequent vision loss in patients with
      DME.

      In INFINITY, approximately 33 eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to receive one of
      the two doses of ADVM-022, or, assigned to the control arm to receive a sham ocular injection
      with a preceding aflibercept injection. Subjects who are assigned to receive ADVM-022 will be
      further randomized to receive a preceding aflibercept or sham ocular injection. All subjects
      will be assessed regularly and will receive additional aflibercept injections should DME
      disease activity progress.

      The primary objective is to assess the durability of a single intravitreal (IVT) injection of
      ADVM-022. All subjects will be followed for 48 weeks after randomization.
