      project is to implement and test this promising intervention in three hospice programs. The
      mixed methods evaluation of this RCT will provide evidence-based data for a tested
      intervention manual that hospice staff members can use to integrate the intervention into
      their practices. We will rigorously test the effectiveness of the ACTIVE intervention. We
      will investigate whether the assessment of the informal caregivers perception of pain
      management will identify those who will benefit most and whether changes in the perceptions
      of informal caregivers will result in improvement of patient pain. We will explore barriers
      and challenges in the implementation of this into every day practice within hospice
