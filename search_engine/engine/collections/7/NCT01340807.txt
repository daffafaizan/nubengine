      unilateral transtibial amputees (TTAs) caused by specialized functional prosthetic training
      (training) and the use of four different prosthetic feet. Two self-report measures i.e. the
      Prosthetic Evaluation Questionnaire (PEQ-13) and Locomotor Capability Index (LCI-5), and
      three performance-based measures i.e. the Amputee Mobility Predictor (AMPPRO), Six-minute
      Walk Test (6MWT), and Step Activity Monitor (SAM) were utilized. Healthy unilateral
      Transtibial Amputees between the age of 40-65 will participate in the study. Subjects were
      tested at baseline, after receiving training with their existing prosthesis, and with the
      study socket and four prosthetic feet i.e. SACH, SAFE, Talux and PROPRIO FOOT over an 8-10
      week period. Training was administered between testing sessions.
