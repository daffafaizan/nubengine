      ≥50 years taking physical examination in community health service centers in Nanjing. The
      investigators will propose mpMRI for those with serum PSA ≥4 ng/mL. Transperineal systematic
      biopsy (TPSB) combined with MRI /ultrasound fusion targeted biopsy (TB) will be offered for
      those scored ≥3 on the Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System Version 2 (PI-RADS v2).
      TPSB alone will be offered for those scored <3 and serum PSA ≥10 ng/mL. Subjects with serum
      PSA between 4 ng/mL and 10 ng/mL and PI-RADS score <3 points will be referred to follow-up
      examinations every 6 months.
