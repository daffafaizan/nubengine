2469. the nature of collagen disease, particularly of systemic lupuserythematosus (sle), with special reference to renal lesions (japanese)from the results of examination of 161 autopsy cases of collagen diseases,rheumatic fever and polyarteritis nodosa (pn) are considered as diseases ofhyperergic nature, showing pronounced specific manifestation in particularorgans.  as the reactivity becomes lower, this specific localization becomesless significant and many organs become affected in sle.  it may accordingly besupposed that sle is not a disease of hypersensitivity but one occurring ina state of exhaustion of reactability after prolonged sensitization.  moreover,a sle-like syndrome arises not only in the end stage of parasepsis, nephritis,nephrosis and some cases of prolonged sensitization by myco.tb but also inpn,pss,dm and rheumatism.  it may therefore be conceivable that sle isa syndrome rather than a separate entity.  it is most important to considerwhether sle-like symptomatology may be regarded as a process equal toan auto-immunization and whether the key to morphological elucidation of theauto-immune phenomenon may lie hidden in this problem.
