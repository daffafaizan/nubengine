      35% to 45% of depressed patients have a complete remission of their illness when initially
      treated with these medications. Consequently, the Mayo Clinic psychiatric pharmacogenomic
      team developed a pharmacogenomic algorithm designed to improve the effectiveness and safety
      of antidepressant medications by providing guidance in medication selection and appropriate
      dosing. This algorithm has been incorporated into a new genotyping interpretative report. The
      pharmacogenomic algorithm is based on genotyping both copies of four informative genes. These
      four genes are: 1) the Cytochrome (P450 2D6) gene; 2) the Cytochrome (P450 2C19) gene; 3) the
      Serotonin Transporter gene (SLC6A4); and 4) the Serotonin 2A receptor gene (5HTR2A). The
      trial took place at the Franciscan Skemp Healthcare System in La Crosse, Wisconsin over the
      course of 12 months.
