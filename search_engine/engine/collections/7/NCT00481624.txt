      year and many will develop anemia (iron deficiency) during the course of treatment. Anemia is
      associated with poor quality of life and treatment delays for advanced lung cancer. The
      treatment of iron deficiency anemia is with iron. Iron is an essential mineral used in red
      blood cells to carry oxygen throughout the body. Iron is necessary to make hemoglobin, a key
      element in red blood cells.

      The FDA has approved Procrit® (epoetin alfa) to treat anemia in people with non-myeloid (bone
      marrow) malignancies. Procrit® is a man-made, injectable drug for treating anemia and it
      encourages red cell production. While the administration of intravenous iron therapy,
      injected into veins through an IV, did increase the response rate of Procrit® in a previous
      study, researchers want to find out the best amount of drug to use and the best time to
      administer Procrit®, along with ferric gluconate, (Ferrlecit®), added for lack of iron.
