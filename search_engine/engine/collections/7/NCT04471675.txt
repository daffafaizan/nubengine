      A classic 3+3 design will be used to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the
      recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D). Patients with advanced solid tumors will be assigned to
      receive sequentially higher doses of albumin-bound formulation of docetaxel once every three
      weeks (a Cycle) by intravenous infusion, starting at a dose of 50mg/m2. Patients will receive
      the albumin-bound formulation of docetaxel
