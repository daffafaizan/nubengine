      of the sellar floor after an endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal surgery for a suspected
      hipofisary macroadenoma, the use of chitosan as a scaffold has been described in several
      preclinical studies and tested in tissue bioengineering of bone, neural tissue and soft
      tissue, in the case of bone tissue, several studies demonstrated its potential due to its
      biocompatibility, osteinductive and osteoconductive features, but there is a lack of clinical
      trials demonstrating this characteristics in the clinical setting. One of the most common
      complications for the neurosurgeons after an endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal surgery is
      the CSF leak, depending on the technique and the reconstruction used for the sellar floor
      this complication could be presented from 5% to 75%of the cases, leading to complications
      such infections and pneumoencephalus, representing a great risk for comorbidities, longer
      recovery times and hospital costs, due to this challenges in the repair of the sellar
      floor,the investigators intent to approach the problematic with a chitosan scaffold for its
      characteristics in bone regeneration. The setting of a bioactive membrane in the defect of
      the surgery could be useful for a stronger and more suitable closure of the sellar floor.

      Case description A 65 years old female participant, right handed, came to the neurosurgery
      consultation with progressive bilateral visual loss in her temporal fields, with predominance
      in the left eye over 10 months, two weeks before her admission the participant reported a
      sudden loss of consciousness, prompting her to go to the hospital. In her clinical
      examination, the participant was alert and oriented x3, normal cranial nerves examination
      except for decrease visual acuity by 20/200 in her left eye, 20/80 in her right eye,
      bitemporal hemianopia and mild primary athropy of the optic disc in the left eye, the gait
      and the motor and sensitive examination was normal. The laboratory studies showed a LH: 0.22
      and prolactine: 53.7 .In the contrasted preoperative brain MRI, it was found a sellar lesion,
      hypointense in T1 but hyperintense in T2 signal with enhancing of the periphery after the
      infusion of gadolinium, the lesion presented extension to the sphenoid sinus, paraselar space
      without involvement of the carotids and supraselar with displacement of the optic chiasm. The
      participant underwent endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal surgery for resection of the
      sellar lesion, under the direct visualization, the lesion appeared redish and soft with
      moderately bleeding, a sample was taken for pathology and the remaining is extracted without
      complications, then the scaffold is implanted in the site of the bone defect in the sphenoid
      sinus, due to its moldable nature, it was easily set, covering the entire extension of the
      defect, a fat graft was set in the sphenoid sinus covering the bilaminar chitosan membrane,
      then fibrin sealant was used for hemostatic control and a nasal packing was set in both
      nostrils for finalize the procedure. In the postoperative there was not complication and
      after a few days the participant was discharged with notable clinical improvement, after one
      month of follow up the participant recovered her visual acuity and the participant did not
      refer any symptom, the participant underwent a post operative brain MRI, where it is observed
      a gross total resection and good closure of the sellar floor, without signs of rejection or
      inflammation in the zone with the chitosan scaffold.

      Materials and methods for the bilaminar chitosan scaffold The bilaminar implant is constitute
      by two types of different structures, one of the membranes presents a flat-smooth structure,
      the other membrane has a tridimensional-porous structure, each of the physical-chemical
      characteristics given to the membranes, was in function of the biological effect pretended in
      the effector tissue.

      The two types of membranes, synthetized for the elaboration of the bilaminar implant, were
      elaborated with biomedical grade chitosan of medium molecular weight with 75-85% of
      deacetylation in powder presentation from the brand Sigma Aldrich®, U.S.A.

      In the case of the membrane with flat-smooth structure, it was synthetized from a chitosan
      solution at 2%, the dissolution medium was diluted acetic acid (Sigma Aldrich®, U.S.A); In
      order to acquired a suitable solubilisation, the mix was set on a magnetic stirrer for 1
      hour, posteriorly the solution was brought under the action of a sonicator at 28oc for 2
      hours, until the air bubbles formed by the stirrer were completely eliminated.

      For the membrane with the tridimensional-porous structure, it was synthetized from a chitosan
      solution at 4%, the dissolution medium was diluted acetic acid (Sigma Aldrich®, U.S.A); for a
      suitable solubilisation, the mix was set on a magnetic stirrer for 4 hours, afterward the
      solution was brought under the action of a sonicator at 28oc for 2 hours, until the air
      bubbles formed by the stirrer were completely eliminated.

      Once the solutions were elaborated, for the synthesis of the two membranes (the flat-smooth
      and the tridimensional-porous) both were set in a constant quantity of ml/cm2 in a Petri
      dish, in the case of the flat-smooth membrane, it was brought under a procedure of drying
      with 98% of humidity loss and for the tridimensional-porous, a procedure of phase separating
      was termical induced.

      When both membranes are already elaborated, it is proceed to synthetize the bilaminar
      implant, the membranes are combined using a solution of chitosan acetate at 2%, that was
      distributed uniformly between both membranes to create a sandwich structure, consecutively
      the ensemble was put in a Petri dish and the cover was set inverted in the superior aspect of
      petri dish. It was set for drying for 24 hours at room temperature and then it was
      precipitated in a solution of sodium hydroxide 1N, following the same indications used for
      each membrane separately.
