      (BTX-A) injections are a safe and effective treatment for cervical dystonia in a majority of
      patients, however, a significant minority of patients (between 15 and 25%) have a suboptimal
      response to Botulinum toxin therapy. It is unclear why some patients do not respond maximally
      to neurotoxin therapy.

      Studies using needle electromyographic "mapping" in the evaluation of cervical dystonia have
      revealed that clinical examination alone is insufficient for determining which muscles
      contribute to the dystonic movement. When compared to needle electromyography (EMG) "mapping
      studies", experienced movement disorders specialists correctly identify only 59% of active
      muscles and believe that 25% of muscles which upon EMG evaluation are found to be quiescent,
      are involved in the dystonia. The selection of incorrect muscles for injection of Botulinum
      toxin may explain why some patients have a sub-optimal response.

      This study seeks to measure outcomes when the muscles involved in dystonia are identified
      using "mapping" via an 8-12 channel EMG. In the proposed study, the most involved/active
      dystonic muscles will be correctly identified through simultaneous 8-12 channel mapping
      resulting in a more informed injection strategy, which may improve response to Botulinum
      toxin A treatment as compared to single lead EMG based injections. This study changes routine
      clinical care only by adding the step of studying the muscles of the neck with simultaneous
      EMG mapping to allow a more objective injection strategy.
