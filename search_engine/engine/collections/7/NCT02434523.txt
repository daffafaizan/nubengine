      medication) in treating chronic laryngitis. At the baseline visit, subjects will be assigned
      at random to amitriptyline or placebo which they will take for 8 weeks. Subjects will be seen
      in the clinic at baseline and at 8 weeks. Improvement will be measured using standardized
      symptom scales, and a self-reported subjective improvement percentage.
