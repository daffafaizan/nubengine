    
      BLUE SKY consists of the two main study modules DEEP BLUE (Observational stuDy to Evaluate
      fluid resolution and Effectiveness in Patients receiving Beovu (broLUcizumab) in neovascular
      age-related macular dEgeneration) and BIRL (Brolucizumab In Real Life).

      Patients will be enrolled at approximately 32 centers, which will be representatively
      distributed amongst the 16 German federal states. This will ensure to reflect all
      state-specific health insurance laws and guidelines. Naïve and pre-treated patients will be
      included after decision to start treatment with brolucizumab and consent is given. Out of the
      patients, 1/3 should be pre-treated and 2/3 naïve. All patients will be documented for the
      DEEP BLUE study module (Full Analysis Set).

      For the BIRL module, only naïve patients enrolled in 7 selected centers will be documented.
      All these centers are equipped with the Zeiss PlexElite OCT-A, needed to assess and analyze
      BIRL specific objectives in a comparable setting. Only images from routine medical practice
      will be collected as part of the study.

      The study eye will be defined as the first eye treated during the study, the other eye will
      be considered as fellow eye. If both eyes are treated at baseline, the eye with the worse
      visual acuity will be chosen as the study eye (if the visual acuity is measured equal, the
      treating ophthalmologist defines the study eye upon his discretion).

      The prospective observation period per patient will be up to 24 months.
