      planned neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus dual-targeted anti-HER2 treatment. The study is needed
      to determine whether patients with residual cancer can be identified by histological
      examination of multiple ultrasound-guided tumour bed core biopsies following dual-targeted
      neoadjuvant treatment for HER2-positive, ER-negative early primary breast cancer and whether
      there is concordance between local pathology reporting and central pathology reporting by the
      trials expert pathologists.
