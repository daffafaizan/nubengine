    
      Primary Objective

      Evaluate the efficacy of ruxolitinib in the treatment of COVID-19 severe acute respiratory
      syndrome by means of measuring the proportion of patients with clinical worsening (defined by
      a requirement of FIO2 50% and/or mechanical respiratory assistance) during 14 days after the
      commencement of treatment.

      Secondary Objectives

        1. Evaluate the median duration of hospitalization. Median duration after 45 days of
           commencement of treatment.

        2. Evaluate the evolution of systemic inflammation parameters. Evaluation at the beginning
           (baseline), middle and end of the treatment with ruxolitinib of PCR, LDH, ESD, Ferritin
           and IL-6.

        3. Evaluate COVID-19 mortality rate after 45 days of treatment.

        4. Evaluate the proportion of the requirement of mechanical ventilation.

        5. Evaluate ruxolitinib adverse reactions with a total follow-up of 45 days.

        6. Evaluate the proportion of secondary infections during the treatment with ruxolitinib.
