      commonly presents in the knee joint and is associated with mobility limitations, pain, and an
      increased risk of other chronic health conditions such as heart disease. It is critical to
      implement exercise for people with knee OA as it can be an effective method for improving
      pain, mobility, and cardiovascular health. A biomechanical exercise program using static yoga
      postures has been established in the investigators lab based on minimizing damaging knee
      joint loads, while effectively exercising the musculature around the knee joint. The
      investigators pilot project (REB#13-510) showed that a 12-week yoga program using these
      biomechanical exercises improved pain and mobility while keeping the medial joint loading
      well below that experienced during normal level walking. The next step with this exercise
      program is to compare clinical and tissue outcomes with that of a regularly prescribed
      aerobic and strengthening program, as well as a control group completing meditation classes.
      The investigators aim to identify differences in clinical mobility performance outcomes,
      muscle and fat volumes using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and cartilage integrity using
      MRI between the three groups using a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design.
