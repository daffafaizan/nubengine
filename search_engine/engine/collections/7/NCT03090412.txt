      I. To test the non-inferiority of photodynamic therapy (PDT) to standard of care surgery by
      comparing the rate of tumor response after PDT to those observed after surgery, at 24 months
      post treatment.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine quality of life (QoL) at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months post PDT or surgery.

      II. To assess the toxicity using the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) National Cancer
      Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE Version 4.0).

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Immune markers (T cells). II. To investigate the correlation of the diffuse reflectance
      optical spectroscopy with tumor response to PDT.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients undergo standard of care surgery on day 1.

      ARM II: Patients receive HPPH intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on day 0 and undergo PDT on day
      1.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3-4 months in year 1 and
      every 3-6 months in year 2.
