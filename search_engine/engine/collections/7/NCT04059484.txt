      eligibility (screening period) of up to 4 weeks (28 days), a treatment period of at least 1
      cycle (28 days of study treatment), and an end of treatment (EOT) visit at least 30 days (or
      until the participant receive another anticancer therapy, whichever is earlier) following the
      last administration of study treatment. Study treatment may continue until precluded by
      unacceptable toxicity, disease progression, death or upon participant's request.

      An extension of recruitment for Chinese participants is planned in this study: After
      completion of randomization in the global part of the study, randomization will continue in
      China until approximately 90 Chinese participants are randomized.
