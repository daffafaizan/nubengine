      Northern Mexico, and parts of South America. About 150,000 CM infections are estimated to
      occur in the United States each year, of which 60% are thought to be asymptomatic.
      Symptomatic patients typically present with a respiratory syndrome likened to
      community-acquired pneumonia, while less than 1% of infected individuals are thought to
      develop refractory disease with or without dissemination. Disseminated infection rarely
      resolves spontaneously and, although any organ can be affected, tends to involve the skin,
      lymph nodes, central nervous system and/or the skeletal system. While the risk of
      disseminated infection is increased in immune suppressed patients, many individuals with no
      significant prior history have developed debilitating, widespread infection. Causes of
      refractory and/or disseminated disease in previously healthy individuals have only recently
      begun to be elucidated, including mutations in the IFNy/IL-12 pathway.

      We seek to better characterize the genetic predisposition and treatment of refractory

      and/or disseminated coccidioidomycosis. Specifically, we will examine multiple immune
      factors, characterize the demographics of patients afflicted with this disease, and examine
      the phylogeny of the infecting organisms. This information will reveal endogenous pathways
      that might be targets for therapeutic intervention.
