      study is to examine whether a health-related intervention delivered in an individual session
      with a therapist once per month in the initial 4 months of addiction treatment will reduce
      alcohol use among veterans already enrolled in weekly outpatient treatment group at the VA
      San Diego Healthcare System. In order to answer this question, study participants will be
      randomly assigned to one of three study conditions: 1) The Health Motivational condition that
      receives individual personalized health feedback and motivational activities, 2) the Health
      Education condition that receives individual education about health problems associated with
      the heavy alcohol use, and 3) the treatment as usual group that will receive no additional
      treatment. All participants will be assessed on a monthly basis for 4 months to evaluate
      alcohol use, drug use, and health status.
