    
      The 'PICO' framework (Oxman, Sackett, and Guyatt, 1993; Richardson, Wilson, Nishikawa, and
      Hayward; 1995) was used to specify the parameters of the study aims and objectives:

        1. Population: could appropriate individuals be identified and recruited to a trial of CIT
           for early bipolar disorder?

        2. Intervention: would CIT be an acceptable intervention for individuals following a first
           or second treated episode of mania and or hypomania? Could we identify any modifications
           required to the CIT protocol used with this group?

        3. Control group: could an appropriate group of participants be recruited to facilitate a
           comparison with the CIT intervention? Could we explicitly establish the usual care
           package and its local implementation?

        4. Outcomes: which outcomes are appropriate for measuring relevant dimensions of a
           treatment effect?
