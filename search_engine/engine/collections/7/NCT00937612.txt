      carcinoma with some poor prognostic feature, such as extracapsular spread of metastatic lymph
      node, or positive resection margin. Other patients may receive postoperative radiotherapy
      only, if they have other risk factors. In our previous study, if there are 3 or more "minor"
      risk factors, the 3-year recurrence rate was 55%. This outcome was far inferior to patients
      who had minor risk factors less than 3. Thus, we believe that current postoperative
      radiotherapy is insufficient for patients with multiple minor risks. A clinical trial should
      be raised to help these patients. However, the patient number of this group is not enough for
      large scale, phase 3 trial. So we arranged this phase II trial of postoperative
      chemoradiation to test and prospectively observe the treatment outcome.
