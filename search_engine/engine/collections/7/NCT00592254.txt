      Massachusetts General Hospital annually, we have sought approval for several research studies
      aimed at evaluating critical components of the needs of this population. Potential
      participants for those studies present with a widely varied set of complaints not always
      discernable in a telephone screening interview. This state of affairs often makes it
      difficult to ask subjects to sign a specific protocol's consent form without obtaining
      additional clinical information. Because of this, we have potential subjects consent to
      undergo an in-depth clinical assessment that will allow them to be screened by a clinician
      for eligibility to a diverse clinical research program available to them.
