      response of placebo), and their interaction. Current interpretation of clinical trials (the
      gold standard of evidence-based-medicine) assumes no interaction, and the mechanism(s)
      underlying such interaction have not been fully explored. One possibility is that the placebo
      effect may modulate drug bioavailability. Using caffeine as a model drug, we have recently
      shown that the placebo effect of caffeine ingestion prolongs caffeine half life. Due to the
      novelty of this finding and its important clinical practice and clinical research
      implications, it needs to be confirmed in another set of subjects and extended to additional
      drugs.

      DESIGN: Balanced cross-over, single-dose, two-period, two-group deign comparing caffeine,
      paracetamol, cephalexin, and ibuprofen described as such (overt) to the same medication
      described as placebo (covert).

      METHODS: 32, 50, 50, and 30 healthy adult volunteers will be enrolled in the caffeine (300
      mg), paracetamol (500 mg), cephalexin (500 mg), and ibuprofen (400 mg) cross-over studies,
      respectively. Volunteers will be partially deceived to the intervention assignment (i.e., in
      the covert arm). Serum levels of each drug will be blindly determined by locally validated
      HPLC assays. Plasma half life (primary outcome) as well as Cmax, Tmax, and AUC (secondary
      outcomes) of each drug will be determined and analyzed by ANOVA.
