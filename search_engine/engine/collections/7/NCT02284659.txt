      application of functional electrical stimulation (FES) has been used due to the high
      regenerative capacity of smooth muscle cells. This approach can be beneficial in the
      treatment of which usually has the ultimate causes cavernous smooth muscle degeneration.

      Objective: The aim of this study is to evaluate the FES effect on erectile function in men
      with erectile dysfunction.

      Methods: Randomized Clinical Trial will be selected in which 30 patients with erectile
      dysfunction. The men included will be randomized into two groups. The intervention group will
      conduct therapy with FES (50Hz / 500us) for 15 minutes with intensity below the motor
      threshold and the control group will use FES placebo. Two sessions will be held weekly for
      four weeks. Erectile function will be assessed using the validated questionnaire IIEF-5. The
      instrument will be completed by blinded researcher and the technique is randomized and the
      treatment done randomly.

      Expected Results: The hypothesis is that treatment with FES decrease erectile dysfunction.
