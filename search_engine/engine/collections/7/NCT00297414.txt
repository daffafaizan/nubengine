    
      The objective of this observational study is to ascertain follow-up vital status data for
      patients who were randomized (assignment of study medication by chance) and treated with
      galantamine or placebo in 3 previous studies (CR003145, CR002014 and CR005947). This study is
      designed to evaluate the imbalance of deaths that were initially recorded in the double-blind
      (neither physician nor patient knows the treatment that the patient receives) phases of two
      of these studies. Data will be combined from three sources: the databases of the 3 previous
      studies, forms from investigators, and data acquired during the present study. Investigator
      will obtain consent from the patients or their informant for participating in the study. Data
      on vital status will be obtained either from the patient or informant after obtaining
      informed consent. If a patient does not provide informed consent, documentation of contact
      with the patient will suffice as evidence that the patient is alive. If an informant does not
      provide informed consent or a patient cannot be contacted, medical or death records or death
      registers will be consulted when necessary to determine if a death occurred. If a patient was
      found to have died, the investigator records the cause of death, date of death, and the
      adverse events (unwanted consequence that occurs during the course of the clinical study, but
      not necessarily because of study medication) leading to death, by a review of medical
      records, autopsy records, and/or death certificates.
