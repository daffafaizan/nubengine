      recruited. Participants were excluded if they report being pregnant or being treated for a
      musculoskeletal injury. After explanation of the study and consent were obtained, each
      participant completed background information and the Cumberland Ankle Instability Tool
      (CAIT). Participants began by completing a 1 minute, 3mph walking gait assessment while
      unbraced, followed by a 2-minute, 6mph unbraced running assessment. Following the unbraced
      condition participants were randomly assigned into 1 of 4 conditions: [1] Active Ankle 329
      Ankle Sleeve, [2] AS1Pro, [3] Eclipse 1, or [4] Eclipse 2. Participants placed an assigned
      brace on each ankle and then repeated the walking gait and running assessments. After this
      test the participants filled out a 10-item satisfaction questionnaire, and then were randomly
      assigned a second brace. The protocol was repeated until they have completed the walking,
      running, and satisfaction survey in all 4 brace conditions.
