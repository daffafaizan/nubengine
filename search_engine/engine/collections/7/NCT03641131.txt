      been prescribed Ampholipad in selected sentinel hospitals in Taiwan. Medical charts of
      approximately 100 treated patients will be reviewed by the investigators to collect the
      pre-specified data, including indication, underlying cancer type (only for cancer patients),
      demographics, and concomitant medications as well as all the laboratory examination data
      regarding renal function from 1 month prior to first dose of Ampholipad up to 1 week after
      the last dose of the initial treatment course.
