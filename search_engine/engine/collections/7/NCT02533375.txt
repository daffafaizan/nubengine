      participants with generalized pustular psoriasis (GPP). The study included a 30-day screening
      period, a 52-week treatment period, and a 70-day follow-up period. The dose regimen of
      adalimumab used in this study was 80 mg at Week 0 by subcutaneous (SC) injection, followed by
      40 mg every other week (eow) on and after Week 2 until Week 50. Dose escalation to 80 mg eow
      was allowed for participants who did not have adequate response on or after Week 8.
