      fat, pancreas, liver, brain, intestine and the bone are studied with PET and 14(R,
      S)-[18F]-fluoro-6-thia-heptadecanoic acid ([18F]FTHA). Changes in body fat distribution are
      investigated with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS).
      Brain reward system response to food stimuli is assessed using functional MRI (fMRI) and
      white and grey matter volumes using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI).

      The study consists totally of 60 study subjects. Of these 40 are morbidly obese adults, BMI
