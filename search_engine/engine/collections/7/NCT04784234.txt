      function during a 6 month trial of GlaucoCetin versus placebo in patients with open angle
      glaucoma. The secondary objective is to evaluate change in quality of life,
      electrophysiologic response, and contrast sensitivity.

      Procedures involved during participation include review of medical/ocular history, best
      corrected visual acuity, multiple Humphrey visual field testing 24-2 and 10-2 , Octopus
      G-Top, pattern electroretinogram (PERG), ocular coherence tomography (OCT), ocular coherence
      tomography angiography (OCTA), intraocular pressure (IOP), contrast sensitivity testing
      (CSV-1000), corneal hysteresis, biomicroscopy, fundus exam, disc photos, and serum testing.

      To evaluate quality of life, included in testing is Compressed Assessment of Ability Related
      to Vision (CAARV). Responses to multiple surveys regarding vision related quality of life
      (GQL-15, Glaucoma Symptom Scale (GSS), National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire
      25 (NEI VFQ-25)) and diet (NHANES Dietary Screener) will be captured. Number of daily steps
      will be monitored at 2 intervals during the study using pedometers.
