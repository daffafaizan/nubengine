      muscarinic receptor. The adjuncts to reversal agents such as glycopyrrolate and atropine are
      known to block the muscarinic receptor in different ways.

      We want to evaluate the efficacy of the glycopyrrolate and atropine for the prevention of
      catheter-related bladder discomfort.
