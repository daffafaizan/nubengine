      conditions.

        -  Under Condition A, the total amount of food in a large fast food meal will be delivered
           on a single tray at Time 0 (start of meal).

        -  Under Condition B, the same fast food meal will be equally divided among 4 separate
           portions, with all portions delivered at Time 0.

        -  Under Condition C, the meal again will be equally divided among 4 separate portions, but
           the portions will be delivered at 15-minute time intervals (Time 0, 15 minutes, 30
           minutes, 45 minutes).
