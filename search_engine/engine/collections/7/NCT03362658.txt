      progression in ALS. A biomarker would play an essential role in the evaluation of novel
      therapeutics, leading to the realization of effective treatments faster. Magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) holds promise as a non-invasive source of biomarkers in ALS. In this study data
      is collected from a national imaging platform (the Canadian ALS Neuroimaging Consortium
      [CALSNIC]) using standardized MRI and clinical protocols.

      CALSNIC was founded with the objective to validate MRI biomarkers on a standardized
      multi-centre platform. CALSNIC is a multidisciplinary group of scientists at 7 centres across
      Canada. The first CALSNIC study entitled "MRI Biomarkers in ALS" (CALSNIC-1) is ongoing and
      slated to finish recruitment in 2017.

      This study ("Novel MRI Biomarkers for Monitoring Disease Progression in ALS", CALSNIC-2) is a
      new project that will evaluate novel MRI biomarkers using advanced imaging acquisition and
      processing methods. The specific aims of CALSNIC-2 are 1) to establish a standardized MRI and
      clinical protocol across the 7 centres, and 2) to validate MRI measures with clinical
      measures of disease burden and progression.

      It is anticipated that the project will lead to the discovery of MR-based biomarkers of
      cerebral degeneration that can be applied across different centres and hence, can assist with
      drug development. Secondly, this project will expand CALSNIC to include more centres and
      provide opportunities for collaborative and multidisciplinary translational research on a
      national scale.
