    
      Patients were treated using patient-controlled analgesia with contramal for 24 hours after a
      lumbar disk surgery and randomized to receive IV naproksen sodium+codein, paracetamol+codein
      or isotonic saline (placebo).

      The primary endpoint was pain intensity measured by the visual analogue scale, and secondary
      endpoints were contramal consumption and related side effects.
