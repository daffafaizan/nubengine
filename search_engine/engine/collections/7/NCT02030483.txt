    
      This clinical trial is for men and women with multiple myeloma that has returned after
      treatment (relapsed) or did not respond to prior treatment (refractory).

      This is a phase 1 study of the addition of the PD 0332991 (Palbociclib) CDK4/CDK6 inhibitor
      to lenalidomide / dexamethasone treatment in RRMM. The purpose of the study is to determine
      the effectiveness of the combination of PD 0332991, lenalidomide and dexamethasone (PLD) in
      treating relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. PD 0332991 (Palbociclib) is an experimental
      drug and is a pill taken by mouth. It works by blocking specific growth signals within cancer
      cells. Lenalidomide (also called Revlimid) is approved for use with dexamethasone for people
      with multiple myeloma who have received prior therapy. Study participants will receive
      different doses of Palbociclib and lenalidomide depending on when they enroll in the study.
      The study will help determine the maximum tolerated dose of the combination of the study
      drugs. Treatment schedule (treatment cycles are 28 days):

        -  Palbociclib daily for Days 1-14 of each cycle

        -  Lenalidomide daily for Days 8-21 (or Days 1-21, depending on dose level) of each cycle

        -  Dexamethasone on Days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of each cycle. Participants will continue on study
           treatment as long as they are responding to therapy and not experiencing unacceptable
           side effects.
