    
      SCREENING: Patient eligibility will be determined by HLA (human leukocyte antigen) and the
      main biomarkers screening. If the patient is eligible, white blood cells will be collected
      with a leukapheresis for the manufacture of the IMA101 product.

      MANUFACTURE: IMA101 product will be made from the patient's white blood cells.

      TREATMENT: IMA101 product will be administered to the patient intravenously after
      lymphodepleting pre-conditioning with chemotherapy (fludarabine and cyclophosphamide).

      Low-dose IL-2 will be self-administered twice daily for a total of 28 doses after infusion of
      IMA101 product. In Cohort 2, atezolizumab will be administered every 3 weeks, starting no
      earlier than 3 weeks after the IMA101 product infusion and after hematologic recovery.

      Patients will be monitored closely throughout the study.
