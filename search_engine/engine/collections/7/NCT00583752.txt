      plus vaccine). On Arm A, subjects can begin the three vaccinations immediately. On Arm B,
      subjects will be started on androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) 14 days prior to beginning the
      vaccinations.

      Subjects will be vaccinated three times, each injection administered at 30-day intervals.
      Based upon our earlier clinical trial, the vaccine is considered safe and should not induce
      any major side effects. The investigators hope that vaccination with this PSA virus will
      cause the body to produce immunity to the PSA and that immunity will destroy any cell that
      produces PSA. Since the only cells left in the body that produce PSA will be the cancer
      cells, the investigators propose that the vaccination and ensuing anti-PSA immunity will kill
      the prostate cancer cells. Importantly, this treatment should not cause any major side
      effects as would treatment with anti-cancer drugs.
