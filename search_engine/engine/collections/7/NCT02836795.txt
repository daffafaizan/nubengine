    
      This is a mono-center, open-label, phase 1 study evaluating the humanized anti-PD-1 antibody
      JS001, as a monotherapy in patients with advanced solid tumor (melanoma or urological
      cancers) who have failed in previous routine systemic treatment. The study will be conducted
      in 2 parts: dose escalation and cohort expansion. In the first part, nine patients are
      injected with different dosage of the humanized anti-PD-1 antibody (1mg/kg or 3mg/kg or
      10mg/mg, three patients in one group ) once and observed carefully in the following 4 weeks.
      If no dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) occurs, then they are injected every 2 weeks until disease
      progresses or unacceptable toxicity occurs. This part is to confirm DLT, maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) and recommended dose (RD). In the second part, 6-12 patients are enrolled in each
      dosage group and injected with the humanized anti-PD-1 antibody every 2 weeks until disease
      progresses or unacceptable toxicity occurs. This part is to further analyze safety and
      efficacy of the humanized anti-PD-1 antibody.
