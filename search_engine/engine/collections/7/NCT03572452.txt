      pain below the knee will be involved this study. The patients with non-urgent referrals due
      to sciatica symptoms will be directed to specialized medical care hospitals (the district
      central hospitals of Central Finland and South Ostrobothnia and the University hospital of
      Kuopio, Finland) to the physiatrists and orthopedic outpatient clinics for further
      investigations for possible surgery. The patient will be seen for a doctor's examination
      within a week. If the clinical examination reveals that a patient needs spinal disc
      herniation surgery, and the patient is willing to undergo surgery, they will be referred for
      X-ray imaging if it has not already been done in basic health care, in accordance with the
      regular treatment procedure, and to an MRI scan.

      While patients are waiting for their MRI scan, they will undergo a clinical McKenzie-based
      mechanical assessment and be put into sub-groups of "centralizers"or "non-centralizers".
      These will be randomly assigned into a McKenzie group and into an advice to stay active
      group. Based on their MRI findings and clinical signs and symptoms they will be assigned to
      surgery or continue their non-surgical treatments. If the MRI scan does not reveal a spinal
      disc herniation finding that fulfills the criteria of the study, the patient is removed from
      the study in accordance with the selection criteria, regardless of whether they belong to the
      MDT or advice to stay active group, and their treatment will continue according to the
      hospital's normal procedures.
