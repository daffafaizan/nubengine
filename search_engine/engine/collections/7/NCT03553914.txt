      the PK profile of PLM60 in patients with relapsed or refractory PTCL. Phase 1 will explore
      multiple dose levels and select a single dose level in Phase 2 to more effectively assess
      efficacy in the PTCL population.

      It is anticipated that up to approximately 30 participants will be enrolled during Phase 1.
      The actual number enrolled, however, will depend on the number of dose-limiting toxicity
      (DLT)-evaluable participants that complete the first cycle of therapy. Phase 2 will enroll up
      to 34 participants at the RP2D, some of whom will have been enrolled during Phase 1.

      Consequently, up to approximately 55 participants will be treated in the study as a whole.
