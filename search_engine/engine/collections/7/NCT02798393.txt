    
      This is a double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study in which a total of 120 patients
      will be selected from a broad spectrum group of typical Americans (all demographics including
      various races and both genders as well as ages from 25-90) who have confirmed Type 2 Diabetes
      Mellitus and suffer from mild to moderate lower extremity Peripheral Neuropathy. All patients
      will meet inclusion and/or exclusion criteria.

      Randomization and Application of HL Device The placebo controlled group of 60 patients will
      be randomized from the group of 120 patients by one designee who selects the placebo vs
      treatment groups based on acceptable statistical standards for determining placebo vs
      treatment arms of research studies. There will be two different HL Devices. There will be the
      HL-NIR device that includes NIR diodes and performs Near Infrared therapy and an identical
      appearing second device, the HL-SHAM device, that is used as the placebo device and although
      appearance is identical, this device does not perform Near Infrared treatment. Both placebo
      group and treatment group subjects will have the NIR or sham device applied to both lower
      extremities for a short duration three times a week over the course of several weeks.
