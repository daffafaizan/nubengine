      medically attended acute respiratory illness in elderly populations and to assess the impact
      of these illnesses. Ambulatory elders presenting for health care with an acute respiratory
      illness will be recruited. Nose and throat swab specimens will be collected to test for one
      of the respiratory viruses, and acute and convalescent blood specimens will be collected to
      test for increases in specific antibody. Specimens will be collected within seven days of the
      onset of illness and then 1 month later for comparison specimens. A brief questionnaire will
      accompany the specimens, and more complete data on the illness and consequences will be
      obtained from the medical record. The pattern of illnesses by virus and their severity and
      duration will be determined.
