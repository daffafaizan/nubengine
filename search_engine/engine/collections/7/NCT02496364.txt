      Interbody Fusion (PLIF) with the diagnosis of Lumbar Degenerative Disease. The primary aim is
      to determine if topical application of tranexamic acid is more effective than intravenous
      infusion at decreasing blood loss and blood transfusion perioperatively in middle-aged and
      aged patients presenting for PLIF surgery.
