    
      This is a pilot study of an oral drug Ramipril to prevent cognitive decline in glioblastoma
      patients receiving partial brain radiation and concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide .
      Ramipril will be titrated to the highest tolerable dose during chemoradiation (2.5-5 mg).
      Once this dose is determined, the patient will continue at this dose for 4 months after the
      completion of chemoradiation. Patients will be followed until 5 months post chemoradiation
      for compliance, toxicity, cognitive decline and participant reported outcomes (PRO).
