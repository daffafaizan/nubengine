      Primary: To determine efficacy of aspirin with and without simvastatin in solid tumor
      patients at high- or intermediate-risk for VTE, in reducing markers of platelet activation,
      levels of inflammatory and angiogenic cytokines measured using high-throughput approaches,
      and clinical and investigational measures of hemostatic activation.

      Secondary: To determine safety and feasibility of aspirin with or without simvastatin in
      solid tumor patients at high- or intermediate-risk for VTE
