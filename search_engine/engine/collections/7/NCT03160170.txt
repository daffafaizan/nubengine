      a Cobb elevator but also has a hollow core allowing suction tubing to be connected. Thus, a
      single hand can be used to retract and suction at the same time while the other hand
      separates soft tissue from the bones with electrocautery. This set up which is proposed to be
      more efficient will be evaluated in this study.
