      dosing regimen of Sunitinib on patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. The intent is
      to maximize dose intensity of sunitinib and minimize time off therapy based on individual
      tolerability using protocol directed dose modification criteria. Dose and schedule changes
      are done if toxicity (hematological, fatigue, skin, GI) is > grade 2. There will be no dosing
      or schedule changes for hypertension, hypothyroidism, skin color changes, heartburn, etc.
      unless clinically indicated. Subjects will continue therapy until progression according to
      RECIST 1.1 criteria. All subjects will be followed for progression free survival until
      progression but after 2 years on therapy, only grade 3/4 drug related adverse events will be
      recorded.

      Fact-G and FKSI-DRS will be used to evaluate PRO/QOL at baseline and every 2 months
      timepoints. A more detailed pharmacokinetic blood sampling will be done in a subset of
      patients in an effort to understand if Sunitinib blood concentration has a tendency to go
      down during treatment, as has been shown to be the case for Sorafenib. Biomarker and genomics
      blood sampling for correlation with progression free survival, toxicity and pharmacokinetics
      will be collected at baseline and stored.
