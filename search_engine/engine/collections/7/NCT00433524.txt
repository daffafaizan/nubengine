        -  Determine the inter- and intra-fraction movement of the esophagus using CT scans in
           patients undergoing thoracic radiotherapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.

      Patients undergo CT scans at baseline and then once weekly during their scheduled
      radiotherapy sessions to determine esophageal placement while in the treatment position. CT
      scans are performed before and after the radiotherapy session. Pretreatment and
      post-treatment scans are compared.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-30 patients will be accrued for this study.
