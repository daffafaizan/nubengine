      Interscalene brachial plexus block (ISBPB) is a common nerve block given to patients who are
      undergoing shoulder surgery. This block has a low, but still significant, rate of
      complications. Reducing the volume of local anesthetic given during the block may allow some
      of these complications to be avoided. Participants will undergo ISBPB under ultrasound and
      nerve stimulator guidance. Patients will initially receive 15mL of local anesthetic
      (bupivacaine 0.5% with epinephrine). The volume used for each subsequent patient depends upon
      the success or failure of the previous patient's block - a failure will cause the volume
      given to increase by 1.0 mL, while a success will cause the volume to decrease by the same
      amount.

      The goal of this study is to determine the minimum effective anesthetic volume of bupivacaine
      0.5% providing anesthesia in patients when using ultrasound and nerve stimulator to guide
      placement of the block. The secondary outcome will be the evaluation of diaphragmatic
      function and post-surgery analgesia.
