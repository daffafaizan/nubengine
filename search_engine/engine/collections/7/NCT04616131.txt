      absence of pancreatic cancer ctDNA in the blood stream may help clinicians to better
      understand pancreatic cancer behavior in response to specific treatments, like chemotherapy
      and surgery. Understanding how treatment alters the ctDNA can help future patients diagnosed
      with pancreatic cancer. The presence or absence of ctDNA or the clearance of ctDNA after
      treatment may help to guide further treatment decisions for cancer patients after surgery.
