    
      The main purpose of this study is to determine the effect of MNK-1411 on motor function in
      participants with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD). Information is collected only from
      caretakers who are fluent in English, using the Pediatric Outcomes Data Collection Instrument
      (PODCI).

      The PODCI is a validated 86-question instrument completed by the parent or legal guardian of
      children 2 to 10 years of age to assess a variety of health outcome measures (Uzark et al,
      2012). This study will only collect information for the PODCI domains of sports and physical
      functioning and transfer/basic mobility.
