    
      This is a prospective, randomized, parallel group, single center clinical evaluation of the
      DyeVert System. Subjects undergoing a diagnostic coronary angiogram procedure with a 5 French
      catheter are eligible to participate in this study. The treatment group will use the DyeVert
      System.

      The trial will be conducted at one center, located in Germany. A sample size of 96 evaluable
      subjects will provide a sufficient number of samples to evaluate the primary objectives.

      Randomization will occur following confirmation that the subject meets the
      inclusion/exclusion criteria and has signed an informed consent. Subjects that are
      anticipated to be a diagnostic only procedure, but end up being an ad-hoc PCI, can still
      remain enrolled in the trial. If a subject proceeds to a PCI, data will only be collected
      through the diagnostic portion of the case.
