      care testing HemaCue and arterial blood gas analyzer with an automated hematology analyzer in
      critically ill geriatric patients.Forty geriatric patients requiring intensive care treatment
      were included in the study. Arterial blood sample was analyzed using HemaCue
      (HbHemaCueArterial), blood gas analyzer (Techno Medica, Gastat1800 series) (HbBGA) and an
      automated hematology analyzer (Cell Dyne 3700 System, Abbot Laboratories)(HbLab) as a
      reference method. Capillary blood measurements were performed (HbHemaCueCapillary) by HemaCue
      at bedside. Bland Altman Analysis was applied to the results .
