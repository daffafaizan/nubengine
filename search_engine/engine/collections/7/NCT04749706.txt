    
      After a medical inclusion visit, the participants will realize a maximal aerobic test at the
      university hospital as well as a body composition analysis, a blood sample will be taken,
      their resting metabolic rate will be assessed as well as their energy metabolism during a
      rectangular cycling exercise. Their muscle strength and architecture will be assessed. Their
      energy intake and eating habits will also be assessed as well as their diet-induced
      thermogenesis in response to a fixed and an ad libitum meal. Their sleep metabolism will also
      be assessed using the Dreem technology. Questionnaires will be used to evaluate their daily
      free living energy intake and accelerometers used to assess their daily physical activity
      level.

      The participants will then perform a 12-week physical activity intervention with 15 of the 30
      constitutionally lean one receiving a protein supplementation (randomly assigned). All the
      measures will be replicated at the end of the intervention as well as 6 weeks after
