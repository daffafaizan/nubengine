    
      Metastatic or locally advanced well differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma will be treated
      with a combination of bevacizumab (5 mg/kg) plus octreotide LAR (long- acting release) 20/30
      mg plus capecitabine administered on a metronomic schedule (2000 mg/day).

      Patients with stable disease, complete or partial response will continue treatment until
      progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity.

      Primary endpoint: the response to treatment, evaluated according to the RECIST criteria.

      Secondary endpoint: - toxicity, graded according to the NCI-CTG criteria;

        -  symptomatic response: evaluated according to the changes in both the frequency and
           intensity of symptoms;

        -  biochemical response: evaluated considering the changes in the tumor marker levels
           (circulating Chromogranin A);

        -  relationship between vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) polymorphisms and
           response to treatment;

        -  time to progression and survival: measured from the date of treatment start to the date
           of progression and the date of last follow-up or death, respectively.
