      ratio in Heatocellular carcinoma are unclear.It has been suggested that cross-talk between
      the inflammatory response and tumor progression play a critical role in the initiation and
      progression of Heatocellular carcinoma. In the tumor microenvironment, inflammatory
      infiltrates have a large influence on the biological behavior of Heatocellular carcinoma.

      Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, as representative component of the immune microenvironment
      ,are implicated in several stages of Heatocellular carcinoma progression, and
      Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes phenotypes may be a predictor for favorable prognosis.

      Conversely, low lymphocyte counts might result in an insufficient immunological reaction,
      which lead to inferior survival in multiple cancers.

      Monocytes infiltrating tumor tissue are also involved in Heatocellular carcinoma development
      and progression. Activated monocytes in Heatocellular carcinoma micro environments can
      trigger and polarize T-cell responses and facilitate inflammation-induced tumor development.

      Tumor-associated macrophages are derived from circulating monocytes. Tumor-associated
      macrophages can accelerate Heatocellular carcinoma cell proliferation,tumor-associated
      angiogenesis, and metastasis. Several studies showed that high infiltration of
      Tumor-associated macrophages predicted decreased survival in various cancers.
