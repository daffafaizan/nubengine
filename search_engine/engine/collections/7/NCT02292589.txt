      will be recruited twenty adult patients who will receive three sessions of anodal tDCS: left
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, left temporal cortex(with an intensity of 1.5 mA for 20 min)
      and sham stimulation(intensity of 1.5 mA for 30 seconds only). Sessions will be performed
      with at least 7 days of interval(wash out period) in a randomized order. Patients who meet
      the inclusion criteria will be assessed with a neuropsychological evaluation - battery tests
      include Beck Depression Scale, Hopkins Verbal Learning(HVLT), Stroop test and digit, letters
      and numbers sequence. A new battery of computerized neuropsychological test will be performed
      before and immediately after each stimulation(HVLT, Wechsler memory scale, Inhibitory control
      test(ICT) and block-tapping test.
