      investigators propose the following hypothesis, "patients with defined characteristics of
      severe asthma will have distinct patterns of persistent neurocircuitry activation. The
      investigators further propose that the detection of ongoing neurocircuitry activation occurs
      because of persistent and active airway inflammation in severe asthma. Finally, the
      investigators propose that the intensity of specific neurocircuitry activation will relate to
      the severity of underlying asthma.
