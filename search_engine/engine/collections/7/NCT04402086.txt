      diagnosed with rheumatic diseases are invited to participate in this study. These rheumatic
      diseases include, but are not limited to: adult onset Still's disease, ankylosing
      spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, reactive arthritis, antiphospholipid syndrome, systemic
      lupus erythematosus, Behcet's disease, dermatomyositis, polymyositis, giant cell arteritis
      and other vasculitides, Lyme's disease, mixed connective tissue disease, polymyalgia
      rheumatica, rheumatoid arthritis, sarcoidosis, systemic sclerosis (scleroderma), Sjogren's
      syndrome, and undifferentiated connective tissue disease. Healthy volunteers are also invited
