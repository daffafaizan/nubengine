    
      This is a study of PEGPH20 in human subjects and is designed to evaluate the safety of
      PEGPH20 and to determine the maximum tolerated dose of PEGPH20. All patients will receive
      PEGPH20. Each group of patients will receive a higher dose than the previous group. This will
      continue until the group with the highest planned dose completes the study or until a group
      has major side effects from their assigned dose.
