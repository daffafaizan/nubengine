      Multiple myeloma (MM) is characterized by the neoplastic proliferation of plasma cells
      producing a monoclonal immunoglobulin. The Durie and Salmon and ISS clinical staging system
      have been well-accepted as a practical way to evaluate MM tumor burden nowadays. But it is
      difficult to assess the accurate tumor involvement because of the significant heterogeneity
      characterizing this disease at multiple levels such as clinical presentation, biologic
      characteristics, treatment response, and clinical outcome. New imaging modalities such as
      18F-FDG PET/CT has been used to improve the efficacy of this system in assessing the extent
      and severity of MM, but the diagnostic accuracy of 18F-FDG PET/CT decreased in lower
      proliferative MM cells and inflammation. Recent studies showed Chemokine receptor CXCR4 was
      expressed in MM cells and CXCR4-targeting molecular imaging- 68Ga-Pentixafor PET/CT could be
      a promising technique to evaluate the extent of MM with higher accuracy. This prospective
      study is going to investigate whether metabolic characterization by 68Ga-Pentixafor PET/CT
      may be superior for diagnosis, risk stratification, and prognostic evaluation of MM.

      Lymphoma:

      Lymphoma is a frequent cancer with high CXCR4 expression. According to the previous studies,
      68Ga-pentixafor-PET seems to be a highly selective and specific method for the in vivo
      quantification of CXCR4 expression. Thus our study is going to investigate the value of
      68Ga-pentixafor-PET/CT for the diagnosisï¼Œdifferentiation and pretherapeutic evaluation of
      CXCR4 expression in lymphoma.
