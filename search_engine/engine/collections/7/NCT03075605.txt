      severity and outcome in patients with acute pancreatitis. Therefore, the investigators aim to
      determine whether etiology of acute pancreatitis, segregates with candidate genetic
      polymorphisms and their m-RNA expression, as well as whether functional polymorphisms in
      inflammation regulating genes predict a more severe outcome in acute pancreatits. The
      investigators anticipate that based on our results that we will provide a more accurate
      predictor of the clinical course of acute pancreatits and help direct more aggressive or
      cytokine specific treatment of patients at greater risk of a more severe form of the disease.
