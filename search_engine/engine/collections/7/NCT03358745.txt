      postprandial metabolic responses to carbohydrates, fat and proteins. Some of these responses
      are associated with the risk for developing cardiometabolic complications.

      The study will be carried out in a cohort of healthy subjects with a wide BMI range and
      normal fasting glycemia. Postprandial metabolic responses to a reference meal starting with
      bread and butter (BB) will be compared with those registered after 3 other meals of identical
      composition, in which the starter will be permutated. Each meal is tested on an independent
      experimental session, with a 1 week washout interval.

      The intervention will be carried out at the Food for Health Science Centre - Lund University.
      Additionally, the plan contemplates an initial information visit including screening of
      fasting blood glucose. In total, each volunteer completing the study will pay five visits to
      the clinical unit.

      Based on the results from the above-described phase, a second step of the study will compare
      various quality attributes of the most effective starter on the impact on cardiometabolic
      risk markers, as a way to optimize putative protective actions and to gain further
      mechanistic insight.
