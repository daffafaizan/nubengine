      receive glyburide or metformin. Dose increases will be determined by the patient's physician.
      Patients will be determined to have failed either medication if glucose control can not be
      achieved with the maximum dose of the medication, if insulin is stared to achieve glucose
      control or if another oral agent is started along for glucose control.
