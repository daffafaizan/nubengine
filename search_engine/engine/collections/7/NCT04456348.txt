      guidance of a physician. The timed up-and-go test was used to evaluate the subjects' gait
      function, requiring them to stand up from their seat and walk straight forward for 3 meters,
      turn around, walk straight back to the chair, and then sit down again. Using simple cognitive
      evaluation (Mini-Cognitive Assessment) screening of the subjects' memory and executive
      function, the participants will first be asked to remember three unrelated words and
      immediately repeat the three words; they will then be asked to draw a clock marked with the
      numbers and pointers, and eventually recall the three words. The verbal function of the
      subjects will be assessed using the verbal retelling items in the MMSE and Montreal Cognitive
      Assessment, asking the subjects to clearly repeat "44 stone lions," "I only know Zhang Liang
      came to help today," and "the cat always hid under the sofa when the dog was in the room."
      Through the camera image data record, the intelligent system uses the built-in intelligent
      algorithm for intelligent video gait recognition and neural networks based on depth
      interpretation automation and automatic access to the subjects' gait characteristics
      (stand-up time, turnaround time, stride length, step velocity, stride length, step width,
      etc.), language features (pronunciation, intonation, word order, language accuracy, language
      fluency, etc.), and clock features.
