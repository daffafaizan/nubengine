      that these tubes frequently become obstructed and are difficult to replace, resulting in lost
      caloric intake for the patient. The population where this is most relevant is children
      receiving Noninvasive Positive Pressure Ventilation (NPPV). NPPV has become increasingly
      popular in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) population, due to its perception as a
      safe and effective alternative to mechanical ventilation via an endotracheal tube.
      Historically, NPPV has been used in children with chronic respiratory insufficiency, but its
      application for acute respiratory compromise is increasing. It has been shown to be effective
      in disease states associated with hypoventilation, and is now also being applied to
      respiratory problems leading to decreased oxygenation. Infants and children receiving
      noninvasive ventilation for respiratory failure, which is often infectious in origin, have
      significant caloric needs. However, it is our practice not to allow gastric feeding in these
      patients due to the fear of gastric distension and vomiting, which carries a risk of
      aspiration.

      There is no data available on the question of efficacy and safety of gastric feeding in
      critically-ill children supported by noninvasive ventilation. Given the ease of
      (re)placement, and the potential nutritional benefit of earlier feeding provided by gastric
      feeding, it seems clinically important to question the bias against this route of enteral
      nutrition in noninvasively ventilated patients. The investigators therefore propose a pilot
      randomized trial of gastric versus post-pyloric feeds in patients on NPPV.
