    
      This study is a prospective, open-label, post-market, non-randomized, multi-center, clinical
      evaluation of the Restoration® ADM X3® Acetabular System for primary total hip arthroplasty
      (THA) with a cementless application in a consecutive series of patients who meet the
      eligibility criteria. The total enrollment goal for the study is 350 cases, all of which will
      receive the Restoration® ADM X3® Acetabular System. A minimum of 100 cases (within the study
      population) will receive the Accolade® II Hip Stem. The remaining cases will receive any
      other compatible Stryker femoral component.

      Data in the literature from other primary hip systems and similar dual mobility cups will be
      used as historical references.
