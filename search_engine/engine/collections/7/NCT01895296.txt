      days.

      After a 4 weeks screening period, patients who fulfill the entrance criteria will be randomly
      assigned on a 1:1 basis to either the pasireotide treatment arm or to the placebo treatment
      arm. They will be treated with pasireotide sc or placebo sc for 2 weeks. After 2 weeks,
      patients will be switched to the other treatment arm after a 7 days wash out period. This
      phase is double-blind: both the patient and investigator will be blinded to treatment
      assignment.
