      evaluation will be blindly tested using the pathologists' assessment of the biopsies as a
      gold standard to determine the clinical sensitivity and specificity of the WavSTAT Optical
      Biopsy System to identify dysplastic or cancerous tissue in the esophagus. In addition, the
      endoscopist's unaided clinical sensitivity and specificity to identify dysplasia or cancerous
      tissue will also be determined by recording the endoscopist's visual assessment of whether
      the physical biopsy has dysplasia or cancer or does not have dysplasia or cancer prior to
      performing the biopsy The endoscopist's assessment will be correlated and compared with the
      pathologist's interpretation. The clinical utility of the WavSTAT System to improve the
      endoscopist's clinical sensitivity to identify dysplasia or cancer in the esophagus will be
      evaluated by testing the hypothesis that the sensitivity of a WavSTAT-assisted endoscopic
      examination improves that of standard endoscopy alone.
