      insulin lispro it was shown that the onset of metabolic action was significantly shorter with
      insulin glulisine than with insulin lispro (while the total metabolic effect was not
      different). These results were in line with a faster early insulin exposure of insulin
      glulisine compared to insulin lispro. The primary aim of this study was to investigate
      whether or not these favorable characteristics of insulin glulisine were also evident in the
      comparison against insulin aspart. This was the first clinical study realizing a head-to-head
      comparison between these two insulin analogs.
