    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To investigate the clinical activity of sorafenib tosylate and fulvestrant, as
           determined by a 4-month progression-free survival rate, in patients with hormone
           receptor-positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer that progressed after
           prior treatment with an aromatase inhibitor.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the objective response rate in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  To determine the median time to progression in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  To determine the progression-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  To determine the overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  To establish the safety and tolerability profile of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral sorafenib tosylate twice daily on days 1-28. Patients also
      receive fulvestrant intramuscularly on days 1 and 15 of course 1 and on day 1 of all
      subsequent courses. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 28-56 days.
