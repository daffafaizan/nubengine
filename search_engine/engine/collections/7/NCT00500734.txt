      blood may be studied in the future to try to find possible genetic or biochemical markers
      that may be the cause of CHF. Your blood will be drawn either on an outpatient basis or
      during a routine visit to the hospital. If you already have a central line or an IV placed,
      the blood will be drawn at these sites to decrease the pain and discomfort of the blood draw.
      The information obtained in this study will not be put into your medical records.
