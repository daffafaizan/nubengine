      community or the hospitals, to identify the prevalence and incidence of dengue fever,
      including laboratory identification of related infections for differential diagnosis,
      including Japanese Encephalitis virus, Chikungunya virus and intestinal parasitic infections.
      Intestinal parasite survey has been the routine long-term service offered by the Kaohsiung
      Medical University Hospital in Solomon Islands. At the same time, the subjects enrolled in
      this study will also be asked the common medical illness in Solomon Islands (i.e. malaria,
      pulmonary tuberculosis and metabolic syndrome etc.) in order to delineate the association of
      dengue fever and these acute and chronic illness.
