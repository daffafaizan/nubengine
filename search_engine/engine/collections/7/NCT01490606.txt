      Patients (30 patients to each arm), aged 60 and above suffering from OA of the knees and
      admitted to physical therapy .Intervention group patients were treated by the concept of
      "Knee Osteoarthritis Project". This was first applied in middle of 2010 and its effectiveness
      was never tested.

      The main idea was to make patients more active, to encourage them to do exercise at home,
      increase their motivation and self efficacy. In addition, patients received prescription for
      TENS device (Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulator) for home use.

      Individual sessions include: muscle strengthening, proprioception exercise, taping, soft
      tissue stretching, joint and soft tissue mobilization, electrotherapy, aerobic exercise
      (bicycle, treadmill), functional exercise. Group session include: muscle strengthening,
      stairs exercise, balance exercise and education about the disease and treatment (lecture
      about knee OA and recommendations for changes in life style).

      In Intervention group were given 12 session. 6 individual treatments and 6 group treatments
      Control group patients were given 12 individual sessions of conventional physical therapy.

      The Outcome measures that were mention above will be performed in the beginning and the end
      of 12 sessions.
