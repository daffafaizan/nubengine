      by incorporating pedometers (step-counters) as self-monitoring tools within the context of an
      education program. Lessons learned from the feasibility study have been incorporated into the
      design of the current proposed Phase II program. This study will be an appropriately powered,
      randomized controlled effectiveness trial of physical activity and adapted dietary guidelines
      (DG) eating patterns to reduce unhealthy weight gain. The Steps Ahead study will use the
      step-based physical activity recommendations identified in Phase I.

      Participants will be randomized and orientated into one of two groups. One group will be an
      adapted DG group who will receive education on the adapted DG guidelines. The second group
      will be an adapted DG plus physical activity group who will also receive the adapted DG
      guidelines education plus a physical activity intervention. The diet and physical activity
      recommendations have been developed to be used as low-intensity interventions in order to
      ensure maximal sustainability in the population. This intervention will be undertaken in East
      Baton Rouge parish, an area of the Delta region which contains communities and neighborhoods
      representative of the broader Delta region.
