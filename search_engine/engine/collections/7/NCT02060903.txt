      subjects with active head lice infestation. The study was designed to assess the efficacy,
      safety and tolerability of a single application of abametapir lotion 0.74% w/w compared to a
      vehicle control, when applied to scalp and hair for 10 minutes at home.

      Approximately 106 index subjects with their household members were enrolled into the study. A
      total of approximately 318 subjects were enrolled, assuming an average of 3 members per
      household participating in the study.
