    
      This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple-doses, parallel-group
      study to characterize the safety (including the anti-drug antibodies (ADA)), tolerability,
      pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of TG103 injection. The study will consist of
      3 periods: an approximately 4-week screening period, followed by a 12-week treatment period,
      and a 3-week safety follow-up period. Eligible subjects will be enrolled into three
      paralleled dose groups (15 mg, 22.5 mg and 30 mg) with 16 subjects in each group. Within each
      group, subjects will be randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive TG103 injection or placebo
      subcutaneously (SC) once a week (QW) over a period of 12 weeks. Each group will be started at
      a low dose of 7.5 mg and gradually up-titrated at weekly intervals until the target dose.
