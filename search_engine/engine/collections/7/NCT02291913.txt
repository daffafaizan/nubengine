    
      This is a multi-centered, open-labeled, Phase II study on metastastic breast cancer (MBC).
      The patient population includes locally recurrent or MBC patients with cytologically or
      histologically confirmed hormone receptor-positive breast cancer who have demonstrated
      disease progression on prior anti-estrogen therapy or therapies. Investigators propose to
      evaluate the efficacy of Everolimus in patients with ER-positive (estrogen receptor-positive)
      metastatic breast cancer who have progressed on anti-estrogen therapy. Forty-six (46)
      patients are planned for enrollment in the trial.
