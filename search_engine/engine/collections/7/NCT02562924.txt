      to restore physiologic sinus ventilation and drainage, which can facilitate the gradual
      resolution of mucosal disease. However, because FESS does not directly treat the underlying
      inflammatory disorder, a successful sinus surgery must be followed by medical maintenance
      therapy to control inflammatory processes.

      The current mainstay of treatment of CRSwNP includes antibiotics and topical and systemic
      steroids. There is evidence that administration of systemic steroids in the postoperative
      period for patients who have polyps may have a significant impact on their postoperative
      course. However, the chance of significant side effects increases with the dose and duration
      of treatment and therefore the minimum dose necessary to control the disease should be given.
      Antibiotics also have their limited but documented side effects and can induce resistance.

      A semi-natural product like manuka honey (brand name MEDIHONEY®), with antibacterial and
      anti-inflammatory properties, might prove as a useful alternative since it has no major
      adverse events documented in the literature, does not induce resistance and is effective
      against resistant pathogens common in this patient population.

      This study is a prospective, randomized, pilot clinical trial that will determine if the use
      of MEDIHONEY® sinus rinses (alone or in combination with intranasal steroids) in the
      postoperative period enhances recovery and prevents polyp recurrence in patients after
      functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS), compared with the standard regimen of topical
      corticosteroid sinus rinses. The study will collect and compare subjective and objective
      efficacy assessments of both types of rinses.
