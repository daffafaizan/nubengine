      (Lorenzo's Oil (LO)) therapy in adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN), the adult form of X-linked
      adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD). AMN is a slowly progressive distal axonopathy that involves the
      long tracts of the spinal cord and differs from the rapidly progressive inflammatory cerebral
      forms that most commonly affect boys and adolescents. All forms of X-ALD are associated with
      the abnormal accumulation of very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA) in plasma and tissues. The
      oral administration of LO normalizes plasma VLCFA levels within 4 weeks. While previous
      therapeutic trials of LO therapy in patients with the cerebral forms of X-ALD have been
      disappointing, recent studies suggest that it is beneficial in two types of X-ALD: 1) as a
      preventive of neurological involvement in asymptomatic boys; and 2) in AMN, where it appears
      to slow the rate of progression. None of the previous studies have been controlled, and we
      are now conducting the first placebo-controlled trial.

      The 4-year study will include 120 men with AMN who do not have evidence of cerebral
      involvement, and 120 women who are heterozygous for X-ALD and have an AMN-like syndrome. The
      rate of progression will be compared in the LO and placebo groups using the Kurtzke EDSS
      score as the primary outcome and a variety of secondary outcomes.

      Adrenomyeloneuropathy affects about 1 in 40,000 men and 1 in 30,000 women. It is a
      progressive disorder that leads to inability to walk and other severe deficits. This study
      will provide definitive information whether Lorenzo's Oil therapy can slow progression.
