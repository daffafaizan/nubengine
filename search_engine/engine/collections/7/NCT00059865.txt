        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of gemcitabine when administered with pemetrexed
           disodium in patients with unresectable or metastatic biliary tract or gallbladder
           cancer. (Phase I closed to accrual as of Oct. 2005.)

        -  Determine the 6-month survival rate of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the best objective tumor response rate and duration of best objective tumor
           response in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the time to progression and overall survival of patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the individual patient variation in toxicity of and/or response to this
           regimen due to genetic differences in proteins involved in drug response in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter phase I dose-escalation study of gemcitabine followed by a
      phase II study.

        -  Phase I: Patients receive pemetrexed disodium IV over 10 minutes and gemcitabine IV over
           30 minutes on days 1 and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease
           progression or unacceptable toxicity (phase I closed to accrual as of October 2005).

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of gemcitabine until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

        -  Phase II: Patients receive pemetrexed disodium as in phase I and gemcitabine at the
           recommended phase II dose.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 4 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 85 patients will be accrued for this study.
