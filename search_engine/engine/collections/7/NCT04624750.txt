    
      This is an open-label, multi-centre, single arm, interventional study to describe the
      steady-state PK, safety, and efficacy of mexiletine in paediatric patients (6 to <18 years of
      age) with myotonic disorders.

      Patients who meet the eligibility criteria will be enrolled stepwise, sequentially in 2
      cohorts by age groups.

      Cohort 1 - Adolescents aged 12 to <18 years, will be enrolled first. If no safety concerns
      are observed (based on data evaluation by the Data Safety Monitoring Board [DSMB]), and the
      dose for the age group 6 to <12 years is confirmed by PK model, enrolment for Cohort 2 will
      begin.

      Cohort 2 - Children aged 6 to <12 years, will be enrolled. The overall treatment duration for
      each cohort will be approximately 56 days (8 weeks): a dose titration phase of 4 weeks and
      the maintenance phase of 4 weeks. The overall study duration would be approximately 22
      months.

      Dose titration phase: In this phase, patients will receive mexiletine starting at an age
      appropriate dose (as evaluated by the investigator and based on body weight) at a frequency
      of once a day. Dose will be up-titrated every 14 days based on tolerability of mexiletine up
      to a maximum of three-times a day as assessed by investigator.

      Maintenance phase: During the maintenance phase, patients will continue to receive mexiletine
      at the best-tolerated dose from the titration phase for further 4 weeks. Following
      completion, all participants will be offered follow-up in PIP Study 7 (MEX-NM-303) (EudraCT:
      2019-003758-97).
