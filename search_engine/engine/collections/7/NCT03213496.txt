      all eligible patients, once they have decided to participate in the study. It was performed
      on a random computed to an intervention group (Walk prescription); or conventional care group
      (no exercise) in a 2:1 relation respectively. Intervention and Management Processes The pre
      surgical intervention walk routine is defined of at least 150-300 minutes of walk before
      going into surgery.

      Analysis will be following the principle of intention to treat. A description of categorical
      and quantitative demographic data will be performed. Evaluation will also include the mean
      difference in the length of hospital stay for each of the groups and standard deviation,
      given a confidence interval of 95%. An analysis of the time of occurrence of the first walk
      using the Kaplan-Meier estimator will be performed.
