    
      Rationale: Determining the frequency and type of arrhythmia will help determine the need for
      monitoring and the type of monitoring required during procedures under local anesthesia.

      Patients will undergo the prescribed medical procedure using local anesthesia. Patients will
      be randomized into two groups: Group 1 - Local anesthesia of lidocaine and arterial blockage
      on the arm; Group 2 - Local anesthesia with lidocaine and adrenalin.

      The amount and type of anesthetic used shall be recorded. In addition to the routine
      monitoring performed today (use of non-invasive blood pressure gauge and oxygen saturation),
      the patients will be connected to a cardiac holter monitor prior to the start of the surgical
      procedure and until they are released from the recovery room. Upon completion of the
      monitoring, the results of the holter test will be transmitted to the electrophysiology unit
      and analyzed to detect arrhythmias. There will be a registration of side effects reported by
      patients, which can result from arrhythmias (palpitations, dizziness, fainting, CPR). In
      patients in whom arrhythmias are detected, the type of arrhythmia and if it was accompanied
      by clinical symptoms will be recorded.
