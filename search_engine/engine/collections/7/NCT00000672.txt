      first episode of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) and in patients with advanced ARC.
      However, AZT therapy has been associated with significant toxicities. In addition, the
      effectiveness of AZT appears to decrease during the second and third years of therapy. For
      these reasons, the development of alternative therapy that would be at least as effective but
      less toxic is of great importance. The drug ddI is an antiviral agent that inhibits
      replication (reproduction) of HIV with less apparent toxicity than AZT. The major
      dose-limiting toxicities found in the Phase I studies have been pains in the feet and legs of
      2 patients initially receiving 12 mg/kg/day and 12 patients receiving daily doses of 25.8 to
      51.2 mg/kg; symptoms began 8 to 27 weeks after initiating ddI treatment. These
      neuropathy-like symptoms have generally not been associated with significant abnormalities in
      nerve conduction studies and patients have reported marked improvement in symptoms within 1
      to 2 weeks of discontinuing ddI. Some patients have resumed ddI treatment at a reduced dose
      after resolution of their symptoms. Studies indicate that ddI remains active in the body for
      at least 12 hours. This indicates that benefits of ddI might be achieved with a low frequency
      of drug administration.

      Patients are randomized to one of three ddI treatment groups; within each group, doses will
      be adjusted according to patient's weight at study entry. Stratification is by diagnosis of
      AIDS or AIDS related complex (ARC) and Medical Center. Data will be tabulated for the Data
      and Safety Monitoring Board at 3 month intervals.
