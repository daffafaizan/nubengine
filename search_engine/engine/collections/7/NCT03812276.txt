    
      The study protocol was reviewed and approved by an Ethics Committee (CE) in Brazil.

      The sample will be prospectively and consecutively selected and will consist of patients who
      are 18 years of age or older, who are in need of one or more dental implants and who qualify
      for placement of Neodent GM Helix implants. Informed consent in writing will be obtained from
      each patient participating in the study prior to any study related procedure.

      Neodent Acqua GM Helix implants will be placed under local anesthesia and with adequate bone
      bed preparation, as recommended by the manufacturer. Multiple implants may be placed in a
      single subject. Implants will be placed 2mm below the alveolar ridge.

      The selection of the prosthetic component and loading protocol (late or immediate) will be
      conducted according to the need of each subject and to the manufacturer's instructions (IFU).
      Thus, implant immediate loading may be performed (at the discretion of the surgeon) when
      primary stability reach at least 32 N.cm and the patient present physiological occlusion.

      Data concerning the studied variables will be collected by fulfilling the Case Report Form
      (CRF), in the following stages: First visit (Screening); T0 - Implant(s) placement; TL -
      Implant loading; T6, T12, T24 and T36 - 6, 12, 24 and 36 months, respectively, after implant
      placement. A visit window of more or less one month is eligible for each of the planned
      intervals.

      Standardized digital periapical radiographs, computed tomography scans and photographs will
      be obtained in an usual daily practice frequency, as determined by the investigator.
