      nephroureterectomy (RNU) has been considered the gold standard treatment for UTUC. However
      due to the high recurrence rates reported, patients are often offered perioperative
      chemotherapy provided that they have a good renal function and performance status. With
      regard to the choice of chemotherapy treatment, there are also no clear recommendations since
      there are no data from randomized studies. If perioperative chemotherapy is considered in
      daily practice, gemcitabine/cisplatin regimen is often chosen and occasionally dd-MVAC.

      The aim of this study is to explore feasibility of UTUC treatments based in real world data
      in various European countries. Patients who fulfil good prognostic factors (inclusion
      criteria for treatment randomization) will be allocated to neo-adjuvant (Arm B) or adjuvant
      (Arm C) chemotherapy (receiving 3 cycles of gemcitabine/cisplatin or dose dense Methotrexate,
      Vinblastine, Adriamycin, and Cisplatin (MVAC). Patients who don't fulfil criteria for
      treatment randomization will undergo Radical nephroureterectomy (RNU) only (Arm A). Patients
      will be followed up for 5 years.
