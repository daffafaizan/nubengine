      fusion group utilizes 3D preoperative planning and image fusion system. Control group
      utilizes only 3D preoperative planning. The age, sex, and fracture types will be matched
      between groups. In both groups, 3D preoperative planning will be performed in order to
      determine reduction, placement and choices of implants. In the image fusion group, the
      outline of planned image will be displayed on the monitor overlapping with fluoroscopy image
      during surgery. Reductions, implant choices/positions, and clinical outcomes will be
      evaluated.
