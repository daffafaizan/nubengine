      0.05 or the central visual field (CFOV) is less than 5Â°. The ocular surgery of the better eye
      in monophthalmic patients is of high risk. On the one hand the surgical failure will result
      in the patient falling into permanent darkness. On the other hand the monophthalmic patient
      may have the same disease in both two eyes such as high axial myopia, uveitis and glaucoma,
      which will increase the surgical risk. There is still no consensus on whether it is necessary
      to take risks to perform this kind of operation. In this study we will evaluate the change of
      psychological status before and after surgery in monophthalmic patients who receive the
      ocular surgery in eye with better vision. The necessity of the ocular surgery in
      monophthalmic patients will be evaluated from the point of social psychology.
