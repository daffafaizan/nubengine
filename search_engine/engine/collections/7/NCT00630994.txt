    
      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the efficacy and safety of low-dose decitabine in patients with symptomatic
           primary myelofibrosis (PMF) or post essential thrombocythemic (ET) or polycythemic vera
           (PV) myelofibrosis.

        -  Analyze the ability of this drug to decrease pathologic angiogenesis and other stromal
           reactive features intrinsic to PMF or post ET/PV myelofibrosis.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive low-dose decitabine IV over 1 hour on days 1-5. Treatment repeats
      every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients achieving partial remission, complete remission, or clinical improvement
      may receive up to 12 courses of decitabine in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically for up to 3 years.
