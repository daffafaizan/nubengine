      diabetic foot ulcer. However, patients need to come to hospital to receive LLLT performed by
      medical professional. The LLLT shoe has been developed for home using. Patients can wear LLLT
      shoe 30 min once daily instead of going hospital for LLT therapy. The aim of this study is to
      see whether LLLT shoe helps with healing compare with placebo (LED shoe).
