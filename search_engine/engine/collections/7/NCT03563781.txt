      initially diagnosed as early stage ovarian cancers, will be upstaged after an appropriate
      surgical staging due to lymphatic metastasis, despite of preoperative radiological data.
      Therefore, complete pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy in these patients represents a
      crucial procedure. On the other hand, nodal dissection may be associated with threatening
      intra- and post-operative complications.

      If feasible and accurate, the sentinel lymph node procedure could be a modality to avoid
      unnecessary radical lymphadenectomy without missing important information on nodal status.

      With the present study we aim at exploring the role of sentinel node dissection in early
      ovarian cancer patients.

      Patients with ovarian cancer macroscopically limited to the ovary (early ovarian cancer) will
      receive injection of a tracer (patent blue or indocyanine green) which have already been
      proven safe and extremely effective in several other gynecologic and non-gynecologic
      malignancies. Then the retroperitoneal spaces will be opened as for a standard
      lymphadenectomy procedure and the lymph node marked with the tracer will be identified. After
      dissection of the sentinel node, lymphadenectomy will be completed according to current
      guidelines.

      Operative data, pathological findings and accuracy of sentinel node in predicting nodal
      status will be registered.
