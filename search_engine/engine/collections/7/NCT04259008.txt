      prepared with standard trace elements containing 5 mcg/kg/day of manganese, or to PN prepared
      with no added manganese. Randomization assignment will be double masked. All participants
      will have whole blood manganese measurements at baseline, at 2 weeks of postnatal age, and at
      8 weeks postnatal age. Because manganese is present as a contaminant in many of the
      ingredients used to prepare neonatal PN, this study hypothesizes that neonates randomized to
      no added manganese in their PN will maintain whole blood manganese concentrations above the
      lower limit of normal.
