    
      This is a parallel randomized clinical trial with two study arms, intervention and control.
      Ninety patients treated in three inpatient rehabilitation settings will be randomly allocated
      to two study groups. Both groups will receive standard care. The intervention group will also
      receive a copy of the SADL-eM from their treating occupational therapist during an individual
      session. Assessment on admission (baseline measure) and after six weeks of admission will use
      the SCIM-SR as the primary outcome measure. Secondary outcomes include the SCIM-III, Private
      Religiousness Practices Scale, Organizational Religiousness Short-Form, additional domains of
      ADL covered by the educational manual, and adherence to the intervention. The effect will be
      determined using repeated-measures ANOVA.
