      advanced, recurrent, or metastatic adenoid cystic carcinoma of the head and neck treated with
      bortezomib.

      Secondary I. Determine the time to progression in patients treated with this drug. II.
      Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this drug. III. Determine the toxic
      effects of this drug in these patients. IV. Determine the objective tumor response, time to
      progression, and overall survival of patients who progress on single-agent bortezomib and are
      then treated with doxorubicin and bortezomib.

      V. Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients. VI. Determine the profile
      and concentration of inflammatory and angiogenic cytokines in serum of patients before and in
      response to this regimen.

      VII. Correlate the expression of biomarkers which may be affected by the ubiquitin-proteasome
      degradation pathway (NF-kB, p53, p27, cyclin D1, cyclin E, vascular endothelial growth factor
      [VEGF], MVD, V-CAM, and N-CAM) on tumor tissue with the clinical activity of bortezomib in
      these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds on days 1, 4, 8, and 11. Courses repeat every
      21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with disease
      progression continue to receive bortezomib as above and doxorubicin IV over 2-5 minutes on
      days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 14 courses in the absence of further
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 8 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 23-37 patients will be accrued for this study within 2.3 years.
