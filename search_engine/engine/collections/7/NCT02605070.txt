    
      Single center, prospective, open clinical study to determine the genomic imprint (epigenetic
      modification) in a series of male infertility patients with alterations in their spermiogram
      (oligozoospermia) compared to a group of fertile patients in order to evaluate the effect of
      FSH ( follicle stimulating hormone) administration on these modifications and on male
      infertility.

      Main objective: To determine the genomic imprint (epigenetic modification) in a series of
      male infertility patients with alterations in their spermiogram (oligozoospermia) compared to
      a group of fertile patients in order to evaluate the effect of FSH administration on these
      modifications and on male infertility.

      Secondary objectives

        -  To assess the main characteristics of the spermiograms of infertility patients before
           and after FSH treatment.

        -  To assess modifications in the hormones involved in sperm formation in infertility
           patients before and after treatment.

        -  To analyze the results of assisted reproduction treatments in patients receiving FSH
           treatment.
