    
      This single-blind, randomised control trial aims to investigate the effect of a brief 70
      minute Pain Neurophysiology Education session on sport therapy students knowledge, attitudes
      and clinical behaviour towards athletes with chronic pain. Participants will be selected from
      first year undergraduate and postgraduate sport therapy cohorts. Random number generator will
      assign participants into two subgroups. Group 1 will receive a control education on clinical
      'red flags'. Red flags are questions that are routinely asked by therapists in clinical
      practice to screen for sinister pathology. Group 2 will receive education called 'Pain
      Neurophysiology Education' (taken from the Explain Pain publication). This mode of education
      uses the neurophysiology of pain to explain the experience, and has been used as an
      educational tool for patient, healthcare practitioners and students alike. Data collection
      (completion of three questionnaires) will take place immediately prior, and immediately after
      each education session.

      The change in these outcomes pre and post intervention will subsequently be compared between
      groups.
