    
      All adult patients qualified for elective coronary artery bypass grafts (CABG), (with CPB),
      under general anesthesia with good ejection fraction - above 40% will be eligible for the
      study. Patients will be sampling by simple 1:1 sampling into 2 groups:

        1. Control group (group C): patients with typical anesthetic regimen.

        2. Dexmedetomidine group (group D): regimen will be the same with additional
           dexmedetomidine infusion.

      In both groups typical monitoring will be applied: heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure
      (MAP), systolic arterial pressure (SAP), diastolic arterial pressure (DAP), pulse oximetry
      (SpO2), central vein pressure (CVP), hemodynamic monitoring with Swan-Ganz thermodilution
      pulmonary artery catheter, end tidal carbon dioxide (ET CO2), typical inhaust and exhaust
      gases analysis, eeg sensor - SedLine with patient state index (PSI), (Masimo technology) and
      regional cerebral oximetry (Masimo technology) with estimation of area under curve defined as
      time of the low brain oximetry value below 80% of initial value.

      Blood for bio-markers analysis will be collected in the following points:

        1. initially, before anesthesia induction

        2. At the end of the procedure

        3. 24 hours after procedure

        4. 72 hours after procedure Biochemical measures will cover: biomarkers of brain injury:
           myelin basic protein (MBP) and matrix metalloproteinase 12 (MMP12).

      Cognitive function will be assessed using Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination - ACE-III, at
      three time points: initially, one day before surgery, at discharge time and 3 months after
      discharge.
