    
      Patients will be enrolled in two stages: a dose-escalation stage and an expansion stage. The
      escalation stage will investigate single agent IGM-8444 in patients with solid tumors and
      IGM-8444 in combination with FOLFIRI for colorectal carcinoma patients. The IGM-8444 single
      agent expansion cohort will enroll the following tumor types: colorectal carcinoma, gastric,
      non-small cell lung cancer, sarcoma, and an all-comers cohort which will include
      relapsed/refractory non-hodgkins lymphoma patients. The IGM-8444 + FOLFIRI with or without
      bevacizumab combination expansion cohorts will enroll colorectal carcinoma patients. IGM-8444
      will be administered intravenously (IV). An alternative dosing schedule may be evaluated.
