      motivation, b) intrapersonal motivation, and c) physical activity. Theoretical concepts from
      the wellness motivation theory are (a) translated into intervention strategies; and (b)
      operationalized as variables to form a basis for evaluating this intervention. The overall
      objective is to advance the development of Ready~Steady by assessing the impact of its
      motivation components.
