        -  Compare local and systemic disease-free survival, ipsilateral axillary relapse,
           occurrence of postmastectomy syndrome, and overall survival of elderly women with
           clinically operable stage I or IIA breast cancer who subsequently receive adjuvant
           tamoxifen after treatment with breast surgery with or without axillary node dissection.

        -  Compare the toxicity of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Compare the quality of life in patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      whether they received prior primary surgery (yes vs no) and participating center.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo mastectomy, lumpectomy, or quadrantectomy with axillary
           clearance. Patients then receive oral tamoxifen for 5 years. Patients may also undergo
           sentinel node biopsy.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo surgery as in arm I without axillary clearance. Patients then
           receive oral tamoxifen for 5 years.

      Patients in both arms who undergo breast-conserving surgery may receive optional radiotherapy
      for 5-6 weeks to the remaining breast tissue, chest, and lung. Upon recurrence in the
      conserved breast, patients undergo total mastectomy; those in arm II who experience
      ipsilateral axillary recurrence undergo surgical excision. Adjuvant tamoxifen and follow up
      are continued.

      Quality of life is assessed.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months while receiving tamoxifen,
      and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1,020 patients will be accrued for this study within
      approximately 5 years.
