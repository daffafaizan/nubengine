      to the health of HIV+ pregnant women and their infants via nutritional, disease, and
      psychosocial pathways.

      In the first phase, the investigators collected descriptive data to describe and assess food
      and nutrition insecurity and the associated modifiable determinants among HIV+ pregnant and
      lactating women in Kenya.

      In the second phase, the investigators collected longitudinal cohort data from women who were
      recruited during pregnancy and have been followed throughout the infant's first year of life.
