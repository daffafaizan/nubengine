      analgesics for control. However constipation is one of the most frequent and debilitating
      side effects of opioids, occurring in 40%-70% of patients being treated for chronic pain.
      Although laxatives are commonly used to manage opioid-induced constipation, these agents are
      not always effective or satisfactory. Methylnaltrexone bromide is a peripherally acting
      antagonist of the mu-opioid receptor. As a quaternary amine, the ability of methylnaltrexone
      to cross the blood-brain barrier is limited. This allows methylnaltrexone to function as a
      peripherally-acting antagonist in the gastrointestinal tract without impacting
      opioid-mediated analgesic effects in the central nervous system. The efficacy and safety of
      methylnaltrexone in treating opioid-induced constipation in patients with advanced disease
      receiving palliative care has been demonstrated. However the efficacy of this agent has not
      been evaluated in more active patients who are earlier in their disease course. The present
      study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of methylnaltrexone for the relief of severe
      opioid-induced constipation in this population and will attempt to identify factors
      predictive of methylnaltrexone response.
