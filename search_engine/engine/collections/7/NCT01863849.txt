    
      Aim of the study:

      To assess immunogenicity and safety of Fluval AB seasonal influenza vaccine with 3 x 15 μgHA
      active ingredient in two age groups (18-59 years and ≥60 years) in accordance with
      CPMP/BWP/214/96: "Note for Guidance on Harmonization of Requirements for Influenza Vaccines",
      12 March 1997

      Primary objective:

      To assess immunogenicity of a single intramuscular injection of Fluval AB suspension for
      injection (trivalent, seasonal influenza vaccine, active ingredient content: 15 μgHA/0.5mL of
      seasonal A/H1N1, A/H3N2 and B influenza antigens each), as measured by haemagglutination
      inhibition test.

      Methods:

      In this open label, uncontrolled, multi-centre immunogenicity and tolerability study subjects
      were enrolled in two groups according to age (18-59 years and ≥60 years) and assigned to the
      following vaccine group:

      Group 1: Single injection of Fluval AB suspension for injection. Subjects were observed for
      30 minutes after the injection on Visit 1 (Day 0) for any immediate reactions.

      All subjects were requested to complete a diary card to record local reactions (injection
      site pain, erythema, swelling, induration and ecchymosis) and systemic reactions (fever,
      shivering, headache, malaise, fatigue, sweating, nausea, myalgia and arthralgia) started on
      the day of vaccination on Visit 1 (Day 0) until 7 (seven) days following that.

      All adverse events were collected during the period of Visit 1 (Day 0) to Visit 2 (between
      Day 21 and Day 28).

      Serum samples for immunogenicity assays were collected immediately before immunization on
      Visit 1 (Day 0) and on Visit 2 (between Day 21 and Day 28) in all subjects. Immunogenicity
      was evaluated by HI test.
