      American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score I-III scheduled for upper limb surgery ,
      divided in 3 groups: group A received anesthesia VIB block with ropivacaine 0,5% 100 mg
      +lidocaine 1%+1 ml saline; group B received VIB block with ropivacaine 0,5% 100 mg +lidocaine
      1% + 2 mg dexamethasone; group C received ropivacaine 0,5% 100 mg +lidocaine 1% + 4 mg
      dexamethasone.The anesthesiologist may use the ultrasound for visual guidance, but should
      also use the nerve stimulator in order to maintain the homogeneity of the procedure.

      Intraoperative sedation was provided with intermittent bolus 10-20 mg IV Propofol.
      Postoperatively all patients received the same analgetic protocol when Visual Analog Pain
      Scale (VAS) over 3 with IV Perfalgan and Lornoxicam 8 mg/12 hours for 24 hours. If after 30
      minutes VAS is still over 3, a loading dose of morphine 0,05 mg/kg should be administered. At
      first analgetic request, the nurse conducts an ice-probe test to both arms and will note the
      answer: same cold, slightly burn, burn, aching with the reason to test the potentially
      hyperalgesia effect related to ropivacaine. The data recorded are: time to first analgetic
      use, VAS at block regression, ice-probe test, motor and sensitive block duration, glycemic
      variations at 4 h, neurological complications immediately after block, total morphine
      consumption.
