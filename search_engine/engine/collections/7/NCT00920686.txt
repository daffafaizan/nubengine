    
      This was a multicenter, double-blind, parallel group, active and placebo-controlled, three
      arm study of a single oral dose of NXN-188 for the treatment of acute migraine headache with
      aura.

      After study eligibility was confirmed, subjects were randomized to NXN-188 600 mg,
      sumatriptan 100 mg, or placebo in a 1:1:1 ratio. Subjects left the clinic to self-administer
      the treatment at home at the onset of moderate to severe headache in a suitable dosing
      environment.

      Treatment was not to exceed 42 days from Randomization. If the subject did not have a
      headache within 42 days of randomization (s)he did not take the study medication and returned
      it to the site. If the subject experienced a qualifying headache (s)he recorded the symptoms
      in a diary, dosed with the study drug, and called the IVRS to record assessments all adverse
      events and to report dosing. If the study drug provided insufficient relief 2 hours post
      dosing (s)he was permitted to use non-triptan rescue medication recommended by the
      investigator.
