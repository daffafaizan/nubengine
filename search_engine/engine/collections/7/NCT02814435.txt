      are particularly difficult in a family situation due to guilt and other complex emotions
      related to inheritance patterns. Poorer mental health has been reported in patients with
      retinitis pigmentosa, manifesting in a range of ways including stress, depression and
      anxiety, particularly as the disease progresses. This is most probably caused by the
      uncertainty of the disease process and the progressive nature of the degeneration.

      Recent work has reported that quality of life significantly deteriorates with a drop in
      visual field diameter of 20 degrees or a drop in visual acuity lower then LogMAR 0.3
      (equivalent to 6/12). Contrast sensitivity is often used in conjunction with VA to assess
      visual capabilities. It is a measure of the ability to see reduced contrast and has a major
      impact on utility of vision. Relating contrast sensitivity function to quality of life will
      provide valuable information about whether this aspect of vision is a critical measure for
      patient health. This is especially important as novel treatments are being developed for the
      treatment of IRDs.
