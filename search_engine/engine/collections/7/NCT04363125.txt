      diseases. Since hypoganglionosis is associated with symptoms such as chronic constipation or
      pseudo-obstruction, it can be confused with Hirschprung's disease and it is important to make
      a differential diagnosis before treatment. Our aim in this study; In addition to sharing the
      rarely isolated hypoganglionosis and sigmoid volvulus in a 45-year-old male patient with
      mental retardation, the investigators present a systematic comprehensive review of
      hypoganglionosis. Pubmed and Scopus databases were scanned. No restrictions were used in the
      written language. Only isolated cases of hypoganglionosis were added to the study. In the
      cases; author, year of publication, country of publication, age, gender, surgical or
      non-surgical treatments, treatment results, and mortalities were examined.

      When sigmoid volvulus is seen in children and adolescents, congenital neurological bowel
      diseases should be considered in the differential diagnosis. Hirschprung's disease must be
      ruled out by rectal biopsy. The histopathological investigation should be carried out for the
      diagnosis and determination of surgical margins in isolated hypoganglionosis.
