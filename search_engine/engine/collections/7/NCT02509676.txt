      sports and to prevent or decrease the risk of sports injury. Muscle stretching is also used
      for therapeutic purposes in many clinical conditions.

      It is generally performed in either static or dynamic manner. The effects of stretching
      depend on the type, duration and timing of stretching. However, the acute and chronic effects
      of a stretching can be different in the same muscle.

      Recent studies suggest that static stretching has adverse effects on performance, reduces
      maximal muscle force and is not successful in preventing non-contact injuries, as believed
      so. Dynamic type is reported to improve flexibility and range of motion better. But there is
      still debate over which prescription provides the best results in terms of flexibility,
      power, performance or injury protection. And the answer to the question what happens to the
      viscoelastic properties of a muscle when it is stretched dynamically for some period of time
      has not been clearly established.

      This study is planned to investigate the effect of a 5-week dynamic stretching exercise
      training on muscle tendon unit of gastrocnemius muscle. The effects of the training program
      will be assessed by ultrasound.
