      in up to 95% of cases where brackets are bonded with composite resins. Although early lesions
      appear clinically as opaque white or brown areas, if mineral loss continues cavitation will
      occur. Following appliance removal, the lesions may regress or disappear but may still
      present an aesthetic problem more than 5 years after appliance removal. Fluoride is known to
      inhibit lesion development and to enhance remineralization following treatment.
      Resin-modified glass ionomer cements, which release and absorb fluoride, may be used for
      bracket bonding thereby offering the possibility of less demineralization around bonded
      attachments. In addition, these cements appear to behave as reliably as composite in terms of
      bracket failure rate recorded but these data are from case series rather than optimally
      designed randomised clinical trials. A bonding agent that can behave as reliably as composite
      and minimize unwanted enamel demineralization would be optimal; saving on restorative costs
      that may be required should cavitation occur. From the patients perspective, subjective
      assessment of treatment outcome is likely to be enhanced as ugly demineralised enamel white
      lesions will be eliminated.
