      severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss over several decades. The surgical procedure
      for cochlear implantation surgery aims to atraumatically insert the electrode array of the
      cochlear implant into the cochlea. However, due to the location of the cochlea inside the
      skull, the surgeon is required to initially create an access from the surface of the temporal
      bone to the cochlea (inner ear). In conventional methods, this access is acquired by removal
      of large portions of the mastoid bone through a wide mastoidectomy and posterior tympanotomy.
      The outcome and success of the conventional procedure varies due to mainly two factors:
      surgeon skill and subject anatomical variation.

      To overcome these variables toward a more consistent and less invasive cochlear implantation
      surgery, the development of robotic and image guided cochlear implantation has taken place.

      This study primarily aims to explore the efficacy of the HEARO robotic cochlear implantation
      surgery.

      Primary Objective

      The primary objective of this study is to:

      â€¢ explore the efficacy of a minimally invasive direct cochlear access via the HEARO
      procedure.

      Secondary Objectives

      The secondary objectives of this study are to:

        -  explore the safety of a minimally invasive direct cochlear access via the HEARO
           procedure.

        -  exploratively evaluate the electrode array insertion outcomes through the direct tunnel
           access.
