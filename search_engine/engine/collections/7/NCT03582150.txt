      breathalyzer device with facial recognition to confirm the patient's identity and sends the
      information to the study staff using cellular technology. A second device is used which is a
      wireless blood pressure cuff that connects to the patient's smartphone and sends blood
      pressure and heart rate measurements directly to the study physician for enhanced monitoring
      during alcohol withdrawal management. The duration of the study is 8 days, starting with an
      initial appointment to set up the equipment. Throughout the study, surveys are completed by
      subjects in regards to their experience with the device. Subjects undergo a brief 30-60
      minute appointment on the first day of the study, appointments as needed throughout the
      study, and an appointment on the last day of the study to check in with the physician for
      ongoing ambulatory management of alcohol withdrawal, including medication adjustments if
      indicated.
