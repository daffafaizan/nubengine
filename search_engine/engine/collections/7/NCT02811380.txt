    
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the safety for the medical device of 'BIP
      central venous catheter". Safety is assessed by evaluation of adverse events (according to
      ISO 14155:2011). Examples of CVC related common events are phlebitis, infection at the
      infection site, catheter related bacteremia/fungemia, septicemia, sepsis, thrombosis, lung
      emboli and pneumothorax.

      The secondary objective is to assess the overall performance by evaluating if there were any
      CVC handling problems experienced by the physician/health care personnel.

      Furthermore, an exploratory objective of this study is to assess coating and microbial
      colonization.

      Included in the study were men and women aged 18 years or older undergoing elective
      standardized large surgery with a planned CVC catheterization in right or left jugular vein
      or subclavian vein planned for at least 3 days.

      This study is a single-centre, randomized, single-blind, controlled study of tolerability and
      safety of BIP CVC with noble metal alloy coating.

      All statistical analyses is performed using the SASÂ® System, version 9.3 or higher (SAS
      Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Data is to be summarized using descriptive statistics.
