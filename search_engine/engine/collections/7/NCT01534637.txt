    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Discern the gastrointestinal toxicities associated with 5-FU (fluorouracil)/Gemcitabine
      (gemcitabine hydrochloride) chemotherapy when combined with upper abdominal radiation
      therapy.

      II. Determine if the addition of prophylactic Aprepitant/5HT-3/Dexamethasone therapy to
      standard chemoradiation for patients with pancreatic cancer results in less nausea and
      vomiting when compared to historical controls.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the impact of prophylactic Aprepitant/5HT-3/Dexamethasone therapy on the
      impact of emesis on daily living, as measured using the MASCC Antiemesis (MAT) tool.

      OUTLINE:

      CHEMORADIOTHERAPY: Patients undergo radiation therapy once daily on days 1-5 for 5.5 weeks.
      Patients also receive gemcitabine hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes once
      weekly and either fluorouracil IV continuously or capecitabine orally (PO) twice daily on
      days 1-5.

      PROPHYLACTIC THERAPY: Beginning 1 hour before chemoradiotherapy, patients receive aprepitant
      PO on days 1-3. Treatment repeats every 7 days for 5.5 weeks in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      CONSOLIDATION CHEMOTHERAPY: Two to four weeks after completion of chemoradiotherapy and
      prophylactic therapy, patients without disease progression or a declining performance status
      receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every
      21 days for 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.
