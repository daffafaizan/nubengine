    
      At the start of the study, baseline investigations are performed including assessment of
      vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, pulse oxygen saturation), weight, Everest congestion
      score (consisting of grading of dyspnea, orthopnea, jugular venous distention, rales, edema
      and fatigue), echocardiography, 24h urine collection, bio-impedance measurements and blood
      sample analysis with plasma renin and aldosterone Subsequently, a run-in phase of 2 weeks,
      without intervention, will start. After this run-in period, participants will be reassessed
      with the same baseline investigations. In addition, a skin biopsy will be performed as well
      as a blood volume measurement.

      In the next phase of the study, salt intake will be increased with 3 grams daily. The salt
      will be packed in capsules containing 1 g of sodium chloride (NaCl). Patients will be asked
      to take one capsule with their breakfast, lunch and dinner. Every 2 weeks a follow-up visit
      is planned.

      After 4 weeks of increased salt intake, a new skin biopsy will be taken and a blood volume
      measurement will be performed.
