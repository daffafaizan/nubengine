      pathogenesis. In contrast to patients with C. difficile colitis, in whom a single FMT is
      highly effective, in patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) an intensified therapy
      with daily or repeated FMT may be more beneficial. Whereas repeated endoscopic application
      are not feasible and repeated enema applications are not favored by patients a combination of
      endoscopic FMT and consecutive maintenance therapy with oral FMT using the FMT capsule G3
      produced by OpenBiome to help establish the donor microbiome in the host seems to be the most
      promising approach. The objective of this trial is to evaluate the safety of FMT in patients
      with ADP and to estimate the effect size to be achieved from FMT therapy in patients with ADP
      for subsequent evaluation in a large definitive trial. A secondary objective is to study the
      microbial engraftment of donor FMT in the recipients.

      This proof of concept randomized placebo controlled trial with an open label extension period
      will evaluate the safety and efficacy of an initial endoscopic FMT followed by 14 days of
      oral FMT. The study has two distinct outcomes, a clinical and translational aim, to
      investigate the effect of FMT in patients with ADP.

      Aim1: Evaluation of safety, tolerability and clinical effectiveness (measured as clinical
      response or remission and discontinuation of antibiotic therapy) of FMT in patients with ADP.

      Aim 2: Evaluation of the impact of FMT on the fecal bacterial microbiome in patients with
      ADP, which will provide functional data about possible mechanisms of this therapy.
