      intervention to influence workplace sitting on objectively measured sitting time, standing
      time and breaks from sitting, as well as self-reported context-specific sitting. The
      computer-tailored advice was compared to a generic advice and a 'no-advice' control at
      1-month and 3-months follow-up. The 'tailored' group received a web-based computer-tailored
      intervention including personalized feedback and tips on how to reduce and/or interrupt
      workplace sitting. The 'generic' group received a web-based intervention containing generic
      information and tips to reduce and/or interrupt workplace sitting. The control group was a
      waitlist control condition and received the generic intervention after completing all
      measurements. Participants were recruited from a convenience sample of two companies
      (university and environmental agency) in Flanders (i.e. northern Dutch-speaking part of
      Belgium), mainly employing desk-based workers, having more than 100 staff members and each
      having at least three different worksite locations.
