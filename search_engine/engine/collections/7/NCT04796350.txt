    
      This is an event driven, randomized, controlled, prospective, single blinded, multi-national
      study.

      This study is designed to demonstrate that the AGN1 LOEP treatment can reduce the incidence
      of secondary hip fractures in subjects presenting with an index hip fracture and undergoing
      hip fracture repair surgery. Subjects presenting with an index fragility hip fracture who
      will undergo hip fracture repair will be enrolled. Subjects will be randomized 1:1 into the
      following two study groups:

        1. Treated Group - receives standard of care to repair the index hip fracture and AGN1 LOEP
           treatment on the target unfractured contralateral hip

        2. Control Group - receives standard of care to repair the index hip fracture and no AGN1
           LOEP treatment on the target unfractured contralateral hip

      AGN1 LOEP is an elective procedure that will be performed immediately following hip fracture
      repair.

      Subjects will be followed through scheduled visits conducted at 6 weeks, 6 months, and every
      6 months thereafter for a minimum of 5 years.
