      studies. Vitamin E tocotrienols are composed of α-, β-, δ-, and γ-tocotrienols. The
      investigators preclinical studies indicate that δ-tocotrienol possesses the most potent
      antitumor activity against pancreatic cancer. It is believed that this micronutrient may have
      a role in the prevention of pancreatic cancer in healthy participants who are at increased
      risk of developing the disease.
