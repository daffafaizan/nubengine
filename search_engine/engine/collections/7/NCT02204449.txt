      randomized to either receive the intervention (cardiac rehabilitation peer mentorship) or be
      in the control group (receive usual care). After consent is obtained cardiac patients in the
      intervention group will be visited, at the hospital bedside, by trained volunteer cardiac
      rehabilitation peer mentors (i.e., individuals who have completed cardiac rehabilitation) who
      will provide the patients with information on cardiac rehabilitation as well as encourage the
      patients to obtain a referral from their healthcare provider. During this visit the cardiac
      rehabilitation peer mentor will also obtain agreement from the patient to call the patient at
      home two weeks after their discharge. Those in the control group will not be visited by
      cardiac rehabilitation peer mentors.

      One week after discharge the cardiac rehabilitation peer mentors will mail the patients in
      the intervention a get-well soon card reminding the patient of the visit, giving them more
      information about the cardiac rehabilitation program, and reminding them of their future
      scheduled phone call. Two weeks after patients' discharge cardiac rehabilitation peer mentors
      will call the patients in the intervention group. At this point they will assess how the
      patient is doing, if they were referred to cardiac rehabilitation and if they enrolled. Any
      possible barriers the patients have to attending cardiac rehabilitation will also be
      discussed.

      Eight weeks post-discharge, patient referral and enrolment will be ascertained by a research
      assistant blinded to random assignment. Statistical analyses will be conducted to determine
      any differences between the two groups as well as to determine any differences between men
      and women.
