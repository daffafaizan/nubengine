    
      This is a single-arm, open-label study to be conducted in 32 patients at a small number of UK
      hospitals. The study is in 2 parts: Part 1 will confirm, in a small number of patients, that
      the treatment regimen is safe and doesn't result in unacceptable delay to liver resection.
      Part 2 will expand the number of patients studied, and provide the opportunity to assess
      survival over about 2 years after liver resection. The decision to proceed to Part 2 will be
      taken with advice from an independent, expert committee.

      Patients with early-stage HCC will first undergo screening procedures during a 28-day time
      window between giving consent and starting drug treatment. Screening procedures will include:

        -  Medical interview and physical exam

        -  ECG

        -  Tumour biopsy

        -  Tumour imaging by MRI

        -  Tumour imaging by CT

        -  Blood and urine samples

        -  Stool sample (optional)

      Patients meeting the protocol-specified criteria will be enrolled and on Day 1 will have the
      following:

        -  Medical interview, and physical exam (if required)

        -  Blood and urine samples

        -  Intravenous dose of ipilimumab ('YERVOY') 1 milligram per kilogram body weight

        -  Intravenous dose of nivolumab ('OPDIVO') 3 milligrams per kilogram body weight

      On Day 22 the participants will have the following:

        -  Medical interview, and physical exam (if required)

        -  Blood and urine samples

        -  Intravenous dose of nivolumab ('OPDIVO') 3 milligrams per kilogram body weight

      On Day 43 the participants will have the following:

        -  Medical interview, and physical exam (if required)

        -  ECG

        -  Tumour imaging by MRI

        -  Blood and urine samples

        -  Stool sample (optional)

      Patients who remain eligible for liver resection will likely undergo surgery within a few
      days of the Day 43 visit.

      On Day 127 the participants will have the following:

        -  Medical interview, and physical exam (if required)

        -  Tumour imaging by MRI

        -  Blood and urine samples

      Every 4 months thereafter until 2 years later, or until starting another anti-cancer
      treatment, participants will have tumour imaging by MRI.
