      novel H1N1 vaccination among HIV positive and negative persons receiving the novel H1N1
      vaccination as part of routine clinical care, with secondary objectives examining the impact
      of prior seasonal vaccinations on subsequent seroresponse to the novel H1N1 vaccination,
      determining potential reactions (local or systemic) to this new vaccine among patients, and
      assessing for potential immunologic/virologic changes (in CD4/HIV RNA levels) after H1N1
      vaccination among HIV patients. Finally, the investigators will collect data on
      influenza-like illnesses (ILI) and H1N1 events during the study follow-up period and
      influenza isolates causing ILI events will be genetically characterized.
