      long-term benefits in these patients with or without obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). However,
      there are limited data concerning the impact of long-term effects of PAP therapy on survival
      and functional status in individuals with obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) and OSA.
      Therefore we aimed to assess the role of different levels of compliance and long-term effects
      of PAP on gas exchange, sleepiness, quality of life, depression and death rate in patients
      with OHS, two year after PAP initiation.
