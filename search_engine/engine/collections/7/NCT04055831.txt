    
      This clinical observational study is designed to identify specific biomarkers for bone
      involvement in patients with GD1 with decreased bone density and/or bone structural
      abnormalities

      Aims:

        1. Identify novel immune cell surface and biochemical markers in peripheral blood
           correlating with bone involvement in GD.

        2. Assess the correlation between cytokine levels in peripheral blood and the severity of
           bone involvement in GD.

        3. Assess the relationship between glycosphingolipids accumulation and macrophage
           activation with specific bone markers and GD severity.
