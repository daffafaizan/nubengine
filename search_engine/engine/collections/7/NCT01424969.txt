      musculature have been correlated with poorer healing rates after rotator cuff repair.
      Platelets are an endogenous source of growth factors present during rotator cuff healing.

      The investigators hypothesis is that augmentation of rotator cuff repairs with platelet-rich
      fibrin matrix (PRFM) may improve the biology of rotator cuff healing and thus improve
      functional outcome scores and retear rates after repair.

      Rotator cuff tears at risk for retear were prospectively identified using an algorithm;
      points were assigned for age (50-59 years = 1; 60-69 years = 2; .70 years = 3),
      anterior-to-posterior tear size (2-2.9 cm = 0; 3-3.9 cm = 1; .4 cm = 2), and fatty atrophy
      (Goutallier score 0-2 = 0; Goutallier score 3-4 = 1). Three points were required for
      enrollment. Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair was performed with the addition of PRFM.
      Preoperative and 1-year postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional outcome
      scores were obtained. Imaging and functional outcomes were compared with historical controls
      meeting the same enrollment criteria.

      Enrollment for the study began in September 2008 and continued until March 2010.
