      pts). Side effects will be formally evaluated by the UKU side effect rating scal which will
      be done 7 days before conversion (day -7), the day of conversion (day 0)and then at the start
      of days +2, +7 and +14. This investigator conducting the evaluation will be blinded to the
      conversion status of the patient. Secondary measures to be obtained will be a Quality of Life
      measure (QOLIE-89) on Day 0 and +14. Plasma samples will be obtained on Day 0 and +14 before
      dosing for total and free valproic blood level.
