      neonatal mortality by up to 47%. Such mortality impact is however not sustained due to rapid
      skills deterioration.

      The investigators propose to improve sustainability of HBB's impact by increasing skills
      retention with an innovative mobile application called HBB Prompt. HBB Prompt will be an
      interactive tool that guides frontline providers through the steps needed to save newborn
      babies at birth. HBB Prompt will facilitate individual and group training in health
      facilities using the Low Dose High Frequency model (LDHF) for resuscitation skills retention.

      The investigators will robustly develop HBB Prompt by integrating human factors and
      user-centered design approaches. The investigators will engage end-users and HBB Master
      Trainers to iteratively collect feedback to develop HBB Prompt for both individual and small
      group resuscitation practice. The iterative approach will mitigate the common scenario of
      mobile health (mHealth) solutions unable to achieve sustained success at scale due to lack of
      comprehensive input from frontline users.

      The investigators will pilot the app at a single centre and compare it to a control site for
      HBB skills retention at different time points after initial HBB training.
