      signatures for AD, identified using SpliceArray tm technology, in the intended use population
      of patients suffering from dementia, including AD and the most common non-AD dementia (Lewy
      Bodies dementia, vascular dementia, fronto-temporal dementia, dementia due to Parkinson's
      Disease, and mixed dementia). A group of non-demented subjects will serve as a control
      reference.
