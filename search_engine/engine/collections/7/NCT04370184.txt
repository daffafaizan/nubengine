      multiple short video loops (6 seconds) in avi format from 100 adult patients who had
      undergone ultrasound guided costoclavicular brachial plexus block for surgical anesthesia for
      their upper limb surgery over a 5 year period, from April 2013 to April 2018 by three
      experienced anesthesiologists. Demographics data such as age, gender, body mass index, ASA
      Physical Classification System, local anesthetic drug used and mode of anesthesia can be
      retrieved from patients' record or Clinical Management System. No direct contact nor
      intervention will be done to the patients in this study, so waiver of patient informed
      consent has been sought. There will be no patients' data in any of the ultrasound images as
      the ultrasound video loops for the costoclavicular brachial plexus block are routinely saved
      anonymously for all patients. All information related to the patients will be kept
      confidential and they will not be identified in any form in future publications.
