      effective means of controlling some forms of cancer auxotrophic for nonessential amino acids.
      Recently it has been shown that human melanomas are auxotrophic for arginine. As arginine is
      a nonessential amino acid for humans, elimination of it may prove to be an effective method
      for controlling cancer. Laboratory studies have provided promising results with the
      arginine-degrading enzyme arginine deiminase (ADI) coupled to polyethylene glycol (PEG) to
      enhance its circulating half-life.

      In this study, patients each receive 3 intramuscular treatments of ADI-SS PEG over a 4-week
      period. There are 4 cohorts of patients each receiving a different dose level.
      Pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety and toxicity, and immunogenicity studies will be
      performed.
