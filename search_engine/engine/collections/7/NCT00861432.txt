      chemotherapy and radiation. Preliminary results have revealed positive effects of add-on
      homeopathy on quality of life as well as subjective well-being. Patients are receiving
      classical homeopathy with administration of either globules and/or dilutions. With each
      appointment, patients complete two questionnaires.
