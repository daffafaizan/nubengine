      LSS, and will consist in the prospective, longitudinal collection of peripheral blood, urine
      samples, tissue biopsies and clinical data. The results of the project could provide a future
      benefit for patients with the same condition by: i) identifying accessible and sensitive
      biomarkers for the identification of patients at risk for having an underlying ATTRwt; ii)
      optimizing the therapeutic strategies in an era of innovative but cost-intensive treatments;
      iii) provide the proof of principle for a regular follow-up of patients who eventually will
      become symptomatic for overt organ ATTRwt involvement; and iv) providing the rationale for
      future studies based on early access disease-modifying approaches.
