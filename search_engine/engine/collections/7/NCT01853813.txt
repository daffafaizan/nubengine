      for an innovative class of antineoplastic agents. Among these antiangiogenetic-targeted
      treatment modalities the anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody bevacizumab has become a new standard
      of care for first-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. The biological link between
      hypoxia, LDH levels and the tumour-driven angiogenesis pathway through the abnormal
      activation of the hypoxia Inducible factor 1 α (HIF1-α) is well established. HIF1-α is a key
      transcription factor that up-regulates a series of genes involved in glycolytic metabolism,
      angiogenesis, cell survival and erythropoiesis Accordingly to this biological assumption
      Azuma et al (Azuma et al 2007) demonstrated that high LDH serum levels were associated with
      tumour over-expression of VEGFA and VEGFR-1. As a clinical consequence it has been speculated
      that LDH levels may represent an indirect indicator of activated tumour angiogenesis and
      ultimately of worse prognosis We previously analysed the role of LDH pre-treatment serum
      levels in colorectal cancer patients receiving first-line bevacizumab in metastatic
      colorectal cancer treated with first-line bevacizumab were eligible. A control group
      including all consecutive patients treated with chemotherapy alone was also considered.
      Pre-treatment LDH serum levels were collected for all cases
