      (version 4.0) questionnaire. A planning CT-scan is acquired and for the first 10 patients
      also a MR-scan for intra fractional motion is acquired. The MR sequence is repeated every
      week during radiotherapy. The first week of treatment a standard non-adaptive IMRT-plan is
      used and CBCT-scans are acquired before and after treatment. The CBCT-scans are used for
      delineation of the bladder on the CBCT-scans from the first 4 fractions. The adaptive plans
      are generated from the union of the first 4 CBCT-bladders and the planning CT bladder (medium
      size) and the volume contained in at least 2 out of the 5 bladder volumes (small size).
      Details can be found in the reference list. From the 6'Th fraction the treatment is performed
      using the most appropriate size of treatment plan. CTCAE is repeated every other week during
      radiotherapy and 2 weeks, 3, 6, 12 and 24 month after radiotherapy.
