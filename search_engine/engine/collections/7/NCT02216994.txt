           3 years old are recruited in this study.

        2. The recruited patients is undergoing preoperative work-up including barium enema (BE),
           anorectal manometry (ARM) and histochemical acetylcholinesterase (AChE) staining of
           rectal mucosa. Known risk factors for intestinal dysganglionosis (IDs) are recorded. The
           predicting score is calculated by summing the scores of the risk factors and 3
           preoperative tests.

        3. The patients with a predicting score of more than 5 are diagnosed with HD, and are
           performed surgery to remove the aganglionic bowel.

        4. The patients with a score less than 5 are mostly indicative of HAD, and receive
           conservative therapies that included colonic irrigation, enema, high dose lactulose, and
           oral paraffin oil for at least 6 months. When there is no clinical improvement, patients
           are consented for surgical procedures to remove the dysganglionic bowel segments.
