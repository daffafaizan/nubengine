    
      Subjects will undergo a Screening Period (up to 28 days in duration) to determine study
      eligibility and baseline levels of signs and symptoms of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN)
      will be established. Subjects will then enter a Treatment Period (6 months in duration).
      During the Treatment Period, subjects will be evaluated on an ongoing basis (at 8 scheduled
      study visits). Subjects will receive intramuscular (IM) injections of investigational product
      (IP) on Study Days 1, 29, and 57 as fifteen 0.30 mL injections (below the knee and above the
      ankle) in one lower extremity in a blinded manner. After completing the Treatment Period,
      subjects will enter the Follow-up Period where they will continue to be evaluated at
      scheduled study visits over the subsequent months.

      An analysis of all study data will occur after the last subject has completed Visit 9 (Month
      6) and after the last scheduled study visit.
