      doses of methylphenidate and placebo; all children will receive active medication during the
      study. Prior to treatment, each child will receive a thorough psychiatric evaluation and each
      guardian will complete a 10-week workshop (2 hours/week). Throughout the study, parents and
      teachers will complete forms that report on the child's behavior and possible side effects.
      Participants will be monitored by regular visits with a study physician. Most participants
      will be involved in the study for up to 16 months to ensure optimal evaluation, dosing, and
      monitoring
