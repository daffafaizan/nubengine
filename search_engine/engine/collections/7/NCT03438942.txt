      to the need of use iron and folate supplements in women of childbearing age. Increased intake
      of micronutrients in the diet or the use of supplementation does not always bring the
      expected results, what depends on factors that affect the bioavailability of minerals and
      vitamins. On the one hand these factors are related to the properties of food intake, e.g. to
      the presence of other nutrients that can increase or decrease the absorption of folates and
      iron (eg vitamin C, phytates), and on the other hand the functioning of the body itself,
      which to a certain extent is determined by genetic factors (e.g., genetically determined
      reduced activity of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase [MTHFR], which reduces the
      bioavailability of folic acid).

      The study aims:

        -  assessment of the effect of simultaneous supplementation with iron and folate on:

             -  parameters of the iron metabolism

             -  parameters of the folate metabolism

        -  the estimation of gene polymorphisms encoding proteins transporting iron and folate

        -  obtaining information whether the polymorphism of genes encoding proteins transporting
           iron and folate is related to the effectiveness of the iron and folic acid
           supplementation used in non-pregnant women of childbearing age.

      In 200 non-pregnant women of childbearing age a blood level of iron and folic acid will be
      determined. Subjects with low level of blood iron and folic acid will be supplemented with
      oral iron and folic acid for 3 months. Subjects with proper level of blood iron and folic
      acid will be a control group. At baseline and at completion of the study (after 3 months)
      fasting blood will be collected and abovementioned parameters will be estimated.
