      is comparing the clinical and cost-effectiveness of the decision to prescribe lithium versus
      quetiapine add-on treatment to antidepressant medication. There will be two parallel groups:
      1) Quetiapine add-on to existing antidepressant medication; 2) Lithium add-on to existing
      antidepressant medication. 276 patients will be randomised 1:1 at baseline to the decision to
      prescribe either lithium or quetiapine, and treatment will then be undertaken by clinicians
      on a real world basis. All patients, regardless of their treatment status, will be followed
      up in the trial for one year. This is a superiority design whereby we hypothesise that
      quetiapine will be superior to lithium in terms of time to treatment discontinuation and
      average symptom burden (QIDS-SR) over 12 months.
