    
      The XLH-DMP is a global, prospective, multicenter, longitudinal, long-term outcomes program
      for subjects on or off any treatment designed to characterize XLH disease presentation and
      progression, assess long-term safety and effectiveness of burosumab, as well as prospectively
      investigate longitudinal change over time across biomarker(s), clinical assessments, and
      patient/caregiver-reported outcome measures in a representative population. The XLH-DMP will
      collect demographic, biochemical, physiologic, disease severity, and progression data in
      patients taking burosumab and those not taking burosumab. In this DMP, patients will only
      have access to burosumab through authorized prescribed use. The Sponsor will not provide any
      treatments as part of the DMP.
