      a simple, economical anesthetic technique commonly used in our hospital. Still some patients
      could not get effective postoperative pain control. Pregabalin, an anticonvulsant, has been
      shown to reduce acute pain after molar extraction, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, and reduce
      postoperative morphine requirement after total hip arthroplasty, and celecoxib, a selective
      cyclo-oxygenase (COX) - 2 inhibitor, with perioperative prescription is successfully reduces
      pain score and opioid consumption after TKA under spinal anesthesia alone. However, no
      clinical study has yet investigated whether preoperative single-dose of pregabalin, celecoxib
      or in combination compared to placebo can improve analgesic efficacy of intrathecal morphine
      after TKA. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate whether these medications
      could reduce pain scores at rest / when movement and morphine requirement after TKA under
      spinal anesthesia with intrathecal morphine. Secondary outcome assessed include adverse
      effects, anxiety score and patients' satisfaction score.
