      topical mesalamine adherence exist in patients with UC. These factors can be identified using
      qualitative testing in order to develop and design appropriate behavioral interventions to
      reduce non-adherence.

      The investigators will undertake an observational study of medication persistence in 100
      patients in the BIDMC clinic, "Persistence Cohort". Persistence will be measured using
      12-month pharmacy refill data. The investigators will also employ a qualitative research
      design with discrete choice modeling in two phases: Phase I - Initial Interviews with 10
      patients and Phase II - Focus Groups (2) with 5 patients each.
