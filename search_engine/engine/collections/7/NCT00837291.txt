      patients with knee OA will be randomized to either CF101 1 mg or matching placebo tablets
      every 12 hours and followed for 12 weeks on treatment. For patients with bilateral knee
      involvement, only 1 knee will be selected for evaluation, namely, the most severely involved
      knee that meets study criteria (the "index knee"). Screening examinations will occur within 1
      month prior to dosing. Washout of non-specific non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
      (nsNSAIDs) and cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors will occur prior to dosing, and must be
      followed by requalification before dosing. Disease activity will be assessed using changes
      from baseline in Patient's Global Assessment (PGA) and Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA)
      scores, and the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis (WOMAC) index and
      subscales for pain, physical function, stiffness, according to the Outcome Measures in
      Rheumatology Clinical Trials-Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OMERACT-OARSI)
      criteria. Assessments will take place at Screening, Baseline (Week 0), and at Weeks 2, 4, 8,
      12, and 14.
