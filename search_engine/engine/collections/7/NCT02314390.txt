      negative impact on patients' physical and mental health. In recent years, Mindfulness-Based
      Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) has gained interest and popularity as a treatment not only for
      preventing recurrence of depression, but also to treat current symptoms. Usually, the
      training is delivered in group format, thus little is known about the feasibility and
      effectiveness of MBCT as an individual training.

      This pilot study aims to compare the effectiveness and feasibility of group and individual
      MBCT in reducing depressive symptoms in patients with a chronic somatic disease.
