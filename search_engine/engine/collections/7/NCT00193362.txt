      arms:

        -  Paclitaxel + Carboplatin + Gemcitabine

        -  Gemcitabine + Vinorelbine

      For ever 2 patients treated, 1 will receive treatment A (Paclitaxel + Carboplatin +
      Gemcitabine) and 1 will receive treatment B (Gemcitabine + Vinorelbine). The study is not
      blinded so both the patient and the doctor will know which treatment has been assigned.
