      Primary

        -  Compare the overall survival of patients with stage I-III non-small cell lung cancer
           treated with vinorelbine, cisplatin, and continuous hyperfractionated accelerated
           radiotherapy (CHART) vs CHART alone.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the response, progression-free survival, and quality of life of patients treated
           with these regimens.

        -  Compare the toxic effect of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Compare the cost effectiveness of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Compare the local and distant control in patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment
      arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo continuous hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy (CHART) 3
           times a day for 12 consecutive days.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive vinorelbine IV over 5-10 minutes on days 1 and 8 and cisplatin
           IV over 2 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 3 courses in the absence
           of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning 4-6 weeks later, patients
           undergo CHART as in arm I.

      Quality of life is assessed periodically.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are evaluated periodically for at least 5
      years.
