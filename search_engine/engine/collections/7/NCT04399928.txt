    
      This is a multicenter prospective observational post-market clinical follow-up study that
      will include 500 patients who will have total hip replacement with the R3 Acetabular System
      and either cemented or cementless hip stem.

      Effectiveness will be assessed by comparison of changes in parameters contained in the HOOS
      questionnaire and based upon incidence of revision and change in Harris Hip Score and UCLA
      Rating. Safety will be measured by assessing all adverse events experienced by patients from
      study enrolment through to study completion.
