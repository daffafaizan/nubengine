      device that is inserted blindly. It may be used to facilitate intubation and secure the
      airway in routine practice, in difficult airway scenarios or in emergency situations.
      Endotracheal tube insertion may be blind or fiberoptic scope guided, the latter raises the
      success rate. The i-gel™ is a newly developed supraglottic airway device and is also
      introduced blindly. Insertion of an endotracheal tube may be blind or fiberoptically guided.

      So far, prospective randomized controlled trials comparing their performance are not yet
      published. There are case reports about intubating over the i-gel.

      In this prospective, randomized, controlled trial, we are going to evaluate the performance
      of intubation through both devices. In 250 patients undergoing elective surgery, we will
      place either the ILMA or the i-gel according to randomization and then intubate with the help
      of a fiberoptic scope, using the specific ILMA tracheal tube or a normal tracheal tube for
      the i-gel. In order to remove the supraglottic airway devices, we will use the ILMA
      stabilizer rod.
