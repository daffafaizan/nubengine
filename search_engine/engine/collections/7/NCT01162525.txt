      anorectal manometry. Incontinence scores (Wexner, Vaizey, Hanley) and quality of life scores
      (FIQL, VAS) will be recorded.

      Treatment consists of 4 phases with decreasing frequency of percutaneous tibial nerve
      stimulations (pTNS).

      During phase 1 weekly stimulations of 30 mins are applied for 12 weeks. After 6 and 12 weeks
      incontinence scores are recorded. Additionally after the end of phase 1 quality of life is
      measured and an anorectal manometry is preformed.

      Phase 2 lasts for 8 weeks, with 2-3 stimulations/month Phase 3 lasts for 8 weeks, with
      stimulations every 3 weeks Phase 4 consists of one stimulation in one month.

      After phase 4 incontinence scores und quality of life are measured.
