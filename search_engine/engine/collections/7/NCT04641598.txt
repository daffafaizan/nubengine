      multiple fertility treatment options, including in vitro fertilization (IVF) and intrauterine
      insemination (IUI). Additionally, methods such as endometrial scratch (a modified endometrial
      biopsy) have been postulated to increase success rate. This prospective, randomized control
      trial will assess whether performing an endometrial scratch improves cycle outcomes and
      decreases time to pregnancy following IUI. Each patient will be randomly assigned to receive
      either an endometrial scratch or undergo a "sham" procedure (speculum insertion but no
      scratch) during the menstrual phase of the IUI cycle.
