      inhalation anesthetics or intravenous anesthetics can influence the QTc. In addition,
      tracheal intubation during induction can stimulates sympathetic activity, which, as a
      results, prolong the QTc interval. Therefore, the aim of study is to find out the effect site
      concentration of remifentanil for preventing QTc interval prolongation during intubation
      under propofol-remifentanil anesthesia in elderly patients.
