      with the AQrate System on bench and cadavers, the study is build around the following
      hypothesis:

        1. The design and principle of operation of the AQrate System permits a correct integration
           in the surgical procedure flow thus enabling the surgeon to benefit from its advantages
           while not generating any additional operational difficulties

        2. The stability and ease of use of the device will permit the surgeon to achieve any
           planned spinal fusion without requiring additional assistance from the medical staff
           compared to a conventional spinal fusion surgery.

        3. A spinal fusion surgery procedure that is performed with the use of the AQrate System is
           similar to conventional spinal fusion surgery. If correctly used, no additional adverse
           event should be observed.

        4. The exposure to x-ray should decrease as the need of intraoperative recheck of pedicle
           screws placed should be reduced

        5. The precision of placement of pedicle screw should not be adversely affected by the use
           of the system compared to conventional spinal surgery.
