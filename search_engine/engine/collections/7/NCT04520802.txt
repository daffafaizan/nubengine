      neuroinflammation, which plays an important role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative
      disease. Major cardiovascular surgery induces a severe systemic inflammatory response.There
      is growing support that neuroinflammation is a pivotal factor in the development of
      postoperative cognitive decline (POCD) due to surgery-related systemic inflammation.

      Although the neuroinflammatory hypothesis is scientifically accepted, in vivo human data
      supporting the role of neuroinflammation in severe systemic inflammation such as major
      surgery are still lacking. In the last decades, several nuclear imaging tracers have been
      developed that can quantitatively measure microglial and astrocytic activation in vivo, by
      targeting the mitochondrial 18kDa translocator protein (TSPO).

      The investigators hypothesize that cardiac surgery induces a neuroinflammatory response and
      that its presence is related to acute and long term brain dysfunction postoperatively. This
      will be studied by pre- and postoperative PET brain imaging using a 18F-DPA-714 tracer
      targeting TSPO, combined with longitudinal neuropsychological examinations. Structural
      changes in the brain will be recorded on MRI prior to and after cardiac surgery to enable us
      to correct for the potentially confounding effects of neurovascular events on cognitive
      outcomes after CABG surgery.
