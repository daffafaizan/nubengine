    
      This is a 26-week randomized, double-blind, parallel group prospective study of the
      effectiveness of treating insulin resistance (IR) to improve mood in patients with IR and
      treatment-resistant bipolar depression (TRBD). The investigators will compare the effects of
      treating IR (with metformin) versus placebo on outcome in each patient. The primary outcome
      will be change in Montgomery-Çºsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) scores. Patients' current
      optimized mood stabilizing treatment as usual (TAU, according to the Canadian Network for
      Mood and Anxiety Treatments [CANMAT] or American Psychiatric Association [APA] guidelines)
      must remain unchanged for a period of at least 4 weeks prior to and throughout the study.
      Patients will undergo a baseline assessment and then be randomized to treatment with
      metformin or placebo with titration to full dose after 2 weeks. Patients will remain on full
      treatment for 24 weeks thereafter (total trial duration of 26 weeks for each patient). In
      those patients with TRBD assigned to treatment with the insulin sensitizer metformin, a
      significant improvement in depression symptoms will be mediated by the conversion of IR to
      insulin sensitivity.

      Subjects: We aim to enrol 110 subjects with IR and TRBD from 2 sites: the primary site in
      Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, and a second site in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.
