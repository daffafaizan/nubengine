        1. Establish the iron content in bone specimen in patients with hip fracture.

        2. Explore the correlation of BMD and differentially expressed proteins.

      OUTLINE:

        1. Collect human bone specimens from patients with osteoporotic and nonosteoporotic
           Fracture.

        2. Provide a repository for storage of tissue and make these specimens available for
           approved projects by laboratory-based investigators.

        3. Collect clinical data on these patients including bone mineral density.

        4. To examine the bone iron content using ICP/MS.

        5. Investigate the differentially expressed proteins through quantitative analysing the
           global proteome of osteoporotic and nonosteoporotic fracture bone specimens.
