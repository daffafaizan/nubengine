      adults. Performing this service in a consistent and documented fashion allows investigators
      to obtain informed consent from recipients. Data is tabulated locally for quality-control
      comparisons with nationally-reported standards. As a condition of maintaining transplant
      center status and to have acess to NMDP-registered donors, UCSF submits clinical and outcome
      data to the NMDP. As a result, UCSF is contributing to the resolution of remaining
      uncertainties regarding particular transplantation practices.
