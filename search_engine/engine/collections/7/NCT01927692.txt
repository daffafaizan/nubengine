    
      This is a prospective, multi-center, pilot biomarker study in subjects receiving TPE for the
      treatment of MG. No study medications will be given.

      Ten (10) AChR antibody positive MG subjects will be enrolled in the study at 2 sites. Of
      these 10 MG subjects, up to 5 may be receiving chronic TPE.

      The study period will be approximately 3 months and will consist of:

        -  Screening/baseline visit,

        -  TPE visit where subjects will undergo clinical evaluations and blood draws for
           immunological assays,

        -  End of TPE visit where information on the TPE procedure will be recorded, clinical
           measurements will be performed, and a blood sample will be drawn.

        -  Post-TPE period where subjects will undergo clinical evaluations and blood draws for
           immunological assays at week 1, week 2, week 3, week 6, and week 12 after TPE.

      Study procedures performed outside of usual care will include optional single-fiber
      electromyography (SFEMG) studies, blood draws and optional skin biopsies.
