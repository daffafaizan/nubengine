      Warfarin; (b) life distresses caused by Warfarin treatment; and (c) quality of life as
      primary and secondary endpoint. All participants participated in a face-to-face interview
      during the pretest and at the 6-month follow-up in the outpatient department (OPD). Each
      subject in the experimental group was taught face-to-face individually according to
      investigator's brochure in the OPD by researchers trained in a standardized protocol. The
      control group received a brochure only.
