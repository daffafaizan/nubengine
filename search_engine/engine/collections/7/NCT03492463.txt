      affecting successful switching from combustible cigarettes to e-cigarettes, as well as
      concomitant reductions in ad libitum cigarette smoking and exposure to harmful and
      potentially harmful constituents of combustion. The strategy will be to assess adoption of
      e-cigarette use and concomitant reduction in ad libitum smoking of subjects' usual brands of
      cigarettes over an 8-week period, during which they will receive nicotine or non-nicotine
      e-cigarettes, and nicotine skin patches. The nicotine patches will not be used as a
      therapeutic treatment in this study, but rather as a way to manipulate the nicotine dose,
      while varying the rate and route of nicotine delivery. Behavioral or "habit" aspects of
      e-cigarette use will be controlled for by the groups receiving non-nicotine e-cigarettes.
      Initially the study design included placebo patch control conditions, but due to limitations
      in budget and period of support, enrollment in these these arms was discontinued. All
      participants currently receive active nicotine patches.
