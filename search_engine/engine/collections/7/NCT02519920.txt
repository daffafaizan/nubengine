      device for in vivo real-time histological observation of the gastrointestinal mucosa. The
      conventional intravenous dosage of fluorescein sodium is in the range of 5ml to 10ml of 10%
      fluorescein. Image quality can be guaranteed with this range of fluorescein sodium, but
      yellow discoloration of the skin seriously influences daily life. This study was to test
      whether a lower dose of fluorescein sodium, which has minimal discoloration of skin, can
      provide satisfied image quality by a randomized blinded controlled trial.
