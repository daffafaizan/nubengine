    
      Extrahepatic cholestasis has various etiologies including benign causes (benign stricture,
      chronic pancreatitis, choledochal cyst, mirizzi syndrome, etc...), choledocholithiasis,
      malignant causes (cancer pancreas, gallbladder cancer, cholangiocarcinoma, etc....),
      parasitic infestations (fasciola hepatica, ascaris lumbricoides, etc......) and other causes.
      it is essential to detect the exact cause of extrahepatic cholestasis in order to determine
      treatment options. diagnosing such conditions depends on clinical examination, laboratory
      investigations, imaging studies, endoscopic procedures, biopsy and even surgical
      intervention. some of these investigations are expensive, not available, or carry risk to the
      patients. moreover non of them is accurate 100%. Complete blood count is already available,
      easy to obtain, not invasive investigation. In these study we are trying to evaluate the role
      of complete blood count parameters namely RDW, MPV, PDW, PCT, NLR, PLR in the differential
      diagnosis of extrahepatic cholestasis.
