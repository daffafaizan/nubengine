    
      This is a randomized phase II/II study. Patients are randomized for the sequence
      capecitabine-hormonal therapy versus hormonal therapy- capecitabine. At progression the
      patient should receive the other protocol treatment (e.g. if the patient was randomized to
      capecitabine, at progression the treatment should be switched to hormonal treatment).
