    
      A historic cohort study was designed with prospective follow-up of ART children conceived in
      the Clinical Centre of Reproductive Medicine (CCRM) and born in Maternal-Fetal Medicine Unit
      (MFMU) of First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University (FAHNMU) from 1 January
      2002 to 31 December 2012.

      The present design is a prospective single-center study in FAHNMU. ART group will be
      recruited by a non-random, consecutive sample on the basis of the unique personal
      identification number assigned to ART children conceived in CCRM and born in MFMU.

      The controls will be recruited by a non-random, consecutive sample on the basis of the
      spontaneous conception population attending the MFMU of FAHNMU during the same period as ART
      group for prenatal screening and subsequent delivery considering their age.
