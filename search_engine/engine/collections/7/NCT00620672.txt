    
      This is a randomized, blinded prospective study with 2 groups: placebo and group supplemented
      with DHA. Women are randomized at 16 weeks gestation without knowledge of their dietary fatty
      acid intake. Only healthy women expecting to deliver a single infant with no known or
      anticipated maternal or fetal complications are enrolled. Maternal venous blood is collected
      at 16 and 36 weeks of gestation and used to assess the maternal DHA status and effect of DHA
      supplementation. Dietary information is collected at 16 and 36 weeks of gestation to
      determine usual fatty acid intakes. Following delivery, fetal cord blood is collected to
      assess transfer of DHA from mother to fetus. Breast milk samples are collected from all
      breast feeding mothers at 1 and 2 months postpartum. The mother -infant pairs are followed
      for 18 months. Measures include visual acuity, language, motor and mental development, and
      growth and dietary intakes.
