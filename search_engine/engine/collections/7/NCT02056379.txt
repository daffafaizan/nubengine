      non inferiority study enrolling 70 children with postextubation stridor. The population will
      be divided in two groups: group 1 will receive inhaled budesonide and IV NS (intravenous
      normal saline) and group 2 will receive IV (intravenous) dexamethasone and inhaled normal
      saline. The study aims to analyze and compare (I would just say compare) the clinical effects
      of using inhaled budesonide or IV dexamethasone in the treatment of postextubation stridor on
      children admitted to the pediatric intensive care units at Hospital Municipal do MÂ´Boi Mirim
      and Hospital Albert Einstein.
