      to a wait-list control condition. The investigators hypothesize that helping individuals
      identify the links between their stress, emotions, and physical symptoms will likely increase
      their awareness and endorsement of the link between stress and physical symptoms, including a
      willingness to engage in stress management techniques. It is also expected that helping raise
      an individual's awareness about their symptoms, followed by an experience and expression of
      unexpressed emotion is likely to influence their physical and psychological well-being.
