      challenging, and knowing the comorbidities and physiological changes in this population, use
      of opioid-sparing agents during anesthesia has attracted substantial research.the use of
      opioids in the perioperative period in obese patients is associated with an increased risk of
      complications . They are especially more sensitive to the respiratory depressant effect of
      opioids , thus any analgesic alternative without further compromising airway tone would be a
      desirable choice.

      Dexmedetomidine is a selective alpha-two adrenergic receptor agonist that has
      antinociceptive, analgesic and sedative properties, without compromising airway tone and
      reflexes .

      Lidocaine, a local anesthetic that has been shown to be an effective multimodal strategy to
      minimize postoperative pain was evaluated in one study involving obese patients undergoing
      bariatric surgery. Its usage was associated with an improved quality of recovery compared to
      placebo .
