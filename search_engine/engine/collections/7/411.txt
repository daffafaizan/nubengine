3270. tolerance of dogs to deep hypothermia.  controlled and maintained with apump oxygenatorthe advantages of hypothermia of below 10 c for 2 hr,induced and maintained byextracorporeal circulation of 200 min.,were compared to partial bypass of thesame duration during normothermia.in the normothermic group 9 dogs out of 12lived.  in the hypothermic group 6 dogsout of 15 (40%) survived when perfused atthe high flow of 55 cc/kg/min.  elevendogs out of 15 (70%) survived when the flowrate was reduced to 25 cc/kg/min whenthe temperature was below 10 c.  the deathin the high flow group were due mainlyto postperfusion lung changes even when lowpulmonary venous pressure was assuredby venting in the left atrial chamber.  me-tabolic acidosis occurred in all groups;though greater in the high flow, with thelow flow intermediate between the formerand the normothermic group.  this changeto a great degree, can be explained by the lung changes.
