      participants. The 40 participants will be evenly split, with 20 in each of the two dosage
      groups for cAd3-EBO S. The dose escalation plan includes daily review of any new safety data
      by a study clinician, regular review of safety data by the protocol team and a staged
      enrollment plan with required interim safety reviews. The study will begin with enrollment of
      3 participants into Group 1 at a rate of 1 participant per day. After at least 7 days of
      follow-up for the first 3 vaccinated participants, an interim safety review will occur before
      enrollment of additional participants into the group. If no safety issues are identified, an
      additional 17 participants will be enrolled to complete Group 1. When there is a minimum of
      seven days of follow-up safety data from the last enrolled participant in Group 1, an interim
      safety review will occur. Once no safety issues are identified, enrollment of participants
      into the next dose level (Group 2) will begin with the enrollment of 3 participants at a rate
      of 1 participant per day. After at least 7 days of followup for the first 3 vaccinated
      participants in Group 2, an interim safety review will occur before the enrollment of
      additional participants into Group 2. If no safety issues are identified, an additional 17
      participants will be enrolled to complete Group 2.
