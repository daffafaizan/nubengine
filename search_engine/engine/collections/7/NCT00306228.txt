      eluting stent compared to conventional bare stent in terms of restenosis, and second to
      determine the effect of tirofiban administered prior to percutaneous coronary intervention
      (PCI) but 120 minutes after thrombolytic on the epicardial and myocardial flow after
      mechanical revascularization in patients with STEMI.

      Methods: This is a phased 4, 2x2 randomised, open, multicenter, clinical study. Patients will
      be randomised 1:1:1:1 to four groups: a) paclitaxel eluting stent with tirofiban, b)
      paclitaxel eluting stent without tirofiban, c) bare stent with tirofiban and d) bare stent
      without tirofiban. A total of approximately 436 patients, with <12 hours STEMI will be
      enrolled. All patients will be initially treated with tenecteplase (TNK) and enoxaparin.
      Tirofiban will start 120 minutes after tenecteplase administration in those patients
      randomised to tirofiban. Cardiac catheterization will be performed within the first 3-12
      hours after the study inclusion and stenting on the culprit artery, with the randomised
      paclitaxel or bare stent, will be performed.

      The efficacy of these strategies will be measured in terms of: 1) binary restenosis, defined
      as >50% diameter stenosis and segment analysis including the stented segment as well as their
      margins, 5 mm proximal and distal to the stent at 9-12 months follow-up and, 2) the
      assessment of the epicardial and myocardial perfusion (%TIMI 3, CTFC, CFR-CTFC, TMP y DSA-TMP
      and the analysis of the normalization of the ST segment at 90 minutes, 3, 6, 12 and 24 hours
      after thrombolysis).
