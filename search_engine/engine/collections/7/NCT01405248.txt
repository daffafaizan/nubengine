      atherosclerosis,current treatments include internal medicine medications, interventional
      treatment and so on,among them, the interventional therapy can make narrow blood vessels
      blood recovery fastly,and for its small trauma,Gradually accepted by psychiatrist, But stents
      are easy to narrow has been plagued by everybody ,At present, prevent restenosis stent is
      mainly of antiplatelet therapy,But,prevention effect is not obvious often easy to appear
      harmful response,how to effectively reduce postoperative restenosis, become the majority
      concern of patients and doctors .Clinical trials showed that, butylbenzene can promote the
      function of ischemic stroke recovery patients. Animal pharmacodynamics study suggests that
      this product can block the ischemic stroke of brain damage caused by DuoGe pathological link,
      with strong against ischemic and brain protection, especially can obviously increase in small
      brains ischemia ATP and phosphoric acid creatine level, decrease local cerebral ischemia in
      rats, reduce infarct size, cerebral edema improved energy metabolism and brain ischemia of
      microcirculation and blood flow in the brain, restrain the nerve cell apoptosis, and has the
      cerebral thrombosis and anti-platelet aggregation function. Research shows that, butylbenzene
      phthalocyanine influence through arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism, selective inhibition and
      their metabolites from DuoZhong mediated pathophysiological events, can remove microvascular
      spasms. Inhibit platelet aggregation, restrain TXA2 synthesis, scavenging free radicals,
      thereby through many ways, many link blocking caused by cerebral ischemia the pathophysiology
      of development process. These mechanisms may make butylbenzene in preventing phthalocyanine
      intracranial carotid stenting noted restenosis and related ischemia of events play an
      important role.
