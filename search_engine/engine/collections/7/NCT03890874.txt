      Our current medical curriculum devotes a large percentage of its time to knowledge
      acquisition by means of didactic lectures. Psychomotor skill acquisition takes a back seat.
      Certain lifesaving skills like basic life support skill training have not even made an
      appearance in the current curriculum. Equal time distribution to cognitive and psychomotor
      skills should be allotted for a subject as practical as MBBS .Simulation can prove to be a
      valuable tool in imparting skill training. The present study aims to evaluate the efficacy of
      different teaching modalities in imparting lifesaving skills in first year MBBS students.

      Methods

      This Cross sectional study is conducted among 33 first year students who consented to
      participate. Institutional ethics clearance was also obtained. The students were divided into
      three groups, each undergoing didactic lecture, animation based videos and simulation
      studies. Pretest, posttest and skills test was administered to them. One way anova, Paired t
      test were some of the statistical test employed using SPSS version 21.
