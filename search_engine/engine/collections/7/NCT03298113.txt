      Protectant in comparison to different local IAD care regimes in hospitals (IAD:
      incontinence-associated dermatitis). IAD is a skin damage caused by exposure to moisture and
      irritants such as urine and/or stool. The clinical appearance ranges from painful erythema to
      severe erosion and denudation/skin loss with or without secondary infection. The durable,
      long lasting skin protectant (3M study device) is formulated to attach to moist or wet skin
      surfaces (i.e., superficial, partial thickness skin loss) to provide better protection
      against moisture and irritants under challenging conditions.
