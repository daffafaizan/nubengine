      reports suggest that physical activity after cancer diagnosis is associated with better
      cancer- specific and overall survival in individuals diagnosed with PCa. There is a growing
      body of evidence for lifestyle interventions that aim to promote physical activity as having
      the potential to counter some of the adverse effects of cancer treatments, disease
      progression and other health outcomes. Exercise performed 2-3 times a week has been shown to
      improve physical fitness, functional performance, and quality of life in men with PCa;
      however, few men with PCa exercise regularly and do not meet national physical activity
      guidelines. A potential explanation on the lack of exercise in men with PCa is the absence of
      a structured, home-based, exercise program. While studies have shown positive effects of
      exercise in men with PCa, little is known about how physical activity effects tumor
      physiology in men with PCa. The primary objective of this pilot study is to gather
      preliminary data regarding the impact of a novel, home-based exercise program on PCa
      biomarkers associated with recurrence and metastasis of PCa in men under active surveillance.
