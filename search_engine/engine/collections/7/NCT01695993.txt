      could be enhanced by boosting patients' expectations of the bands' efficacy. The present
      study seeks to confirm and extend these findings in a multi-site, 3-arm, randomized,
      controlled study of 216 breast cancer patients beginning chemotherapy who expect to have
      nausea. All patients will receive a standardized antiemetic regimen. Arm 1: control; Arm 2:
      Expectancy-neutral handout + Expectancy-neutral MP3+ acupressure bands; Arm 3:
      Expectancy-enhancing handout + Expectancy-enhancing MP3 + acupressure bands. The
      investigators hypothesize that acupressure bands provided with the relaxation MP3 will be
      effective in controlling chemotherapy-induced nausea. The two versions of the handout and MP3
      are being examined to determine what is the most effective way to deliver the intervention.
