      the brain. Such patients fail to be aware of objects or people to their left. This study is
      being done to learn if vibration treatment can improve visual/spatial neglect and activities
      of daily living in stroke patients better than current standard intervention.This treatment
      will be performed by occupational therapist practitioners prior to regular occupational
      therapy session using a vibration tool.
