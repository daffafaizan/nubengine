      factors that contribute to the success of a cycle: correcting these factors means increasing
      the possibility of the cycle culminating in pregnancy.

      In patients with embryonic implantation failures, a prevalence of non-receptive endometrium
      has been described after performing the ERA test of around 20%. On the other hand, a study
      that shows embryonic generation values below a certain threshold (25th percentile), presents
      a rate of evolutionary clinical gestation and lower embryo implantation.

      It is logical to think that progesterone levels are lower than the state of endometrial
      receptivity, since the hormone is responsible for the endothelial changes that prepare the
      uterus for implantation. It is ERA. The result of this study is the result of the evaluation
      of the lifetime of the endometrial biopsy is related to the result of the same.

      If desired, the determination of the probability of the day of the transfer is predictive of
      the pregnancy rate through the impact that the hormone has on the endometrial receptivity.
      This would allow to decide in the same cycle, if the patient should be in a transfer to
      another dimension, or should it defer to another cycle where obtain the optimal values of
      progesterone.

      Nowadays, there are no publications in the literature that have related the concentration of
      progesterone with endometrial receptivity through ERA. This is the first prospective study
      that analyzes this relationship.

      The ERA test has been chosen for the evaluation of endometrial receptivity, which is a tool
      that has been widely used and used in the usual clinical practice of our clinic.
