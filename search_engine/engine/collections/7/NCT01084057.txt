    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of the combination of vorinostat with
      ixabepilone.

      II. To determine the best schedule for delivery of this drug combination. III. To recommend a
      phase II dose of vorinostat in combination with ixabepilone.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the objective response rate and/or clinical benefit rate. II. To assess the
      toxicity profile.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Collecting circulating tumor cells pre and post-treatment to study its deoxyribonucleic
      acid (DNA) somatic mutation and methylation assay after the introduction of histone
      deacetylases (HDAC) inhibitors and ixabepilone.

      II. To determine whether administration of vorinostat with ixabepilone will alter the
      pharmacokinetics of vorinostat.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of vorinostat. Patients are randomized to 1
      of 2 treatment arms.

      Arm I (Cohort A): Patients receive oral vorinostat once daily on days 1-14 and ixabepilone
      intravenously (IV) over 3 hours on day 2. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Arm II (Cohort B): Patients receive oral vorinostat once daily on days 1-7 and 15-21.
      Patients also receive ixabepilone IV over 3 hours on days 2, 9, and 16. Courses repeat every
      28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.
