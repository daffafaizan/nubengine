      already translated and validated in Portuguese for patients with periorbicular hyperchromia
      (cases) with patients without this complaint (controls) and to compare dermatological quality
      of life through the Quality of Life in Dermatology Index (DLQI) already translated and
      validated for Portuguese patients with periorbicular hyperchromia (cases) with patients
      without this complaint (controls). Patients and / or family members who consult in the
      Dermatology of the Hospital de Cl√≠nicas of Porto Alegre (preferably), but also other patients
      and / or relatives with outpatient care in this institution will be invited to participate in
      the control group.

      The WinPepi program, version 11.32, was used to calculate the sample size. This objective
      predicts a Pareto Control Case study by age, with a ratio of 1: 1. The sample size was 252
      subjects, 126 cases and 126 controls. Adding 10% to possible losses and refusals the sample
      size should be 280 subjects, with 140 cases and 140 controls. This value was stipulated
      taking into account the mean of 5.9 in the PSQI-BR of the cases already collected (n = 148
      subjects) and corresponds to a difference of almost 3 points in the index ranging from zero
      to 21, corresponding to approximately 15% difference between groups. For this calculation was
      considered 80% power and significance level of 5%.
