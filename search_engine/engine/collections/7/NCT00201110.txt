      African Americans with type 2 diabetes carry a high burden of CVD risk and adverse vascular
      events such as stroke and peripheral vascular disease. CVD risk factors of suboptimal blood
      pressure, lipids, and glycemic control are controllable through medical management and
      lifestyle behavior modification. The traditional primary care medical management model for
      these chronic CVD risks is inadequate, and models are shifting toward increased
      disease-related decision-making and self-management on the part of the patient. Yet, precise
      methods for: 1) identifying patients with ineffective disease-related problem-solving skills,
      and 2) providing patients with disease-related education that incorporates problem-solving
      and decision-making skills, have yet to be determined

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      The study will test a measurement tool and a novel training intervention for problem solving
      as applied to self-management of high CVD risk in African Americans with type 2 diabetes. The
      specific aims are to: 1) assess the validity and reliability of an empirically derived
      assessment tool of effective versus ineffective CVD risk-related problem-solving ability (the
      Health Problem Solving Scale, HPSS), 2) develop a novel intervention to teach CVD
      risk-related problem-solving skills to ineffective problem solvers, and 3) conduct a pilot
      study with a sample of African Americans with type 2 diabetes who have a high CVD risk
      profile (suboptimal blood pressure, lipids, and/or HbA1c) AND ineffective CVD risk-related
      problem-solving skills, as measured by the HPSS. The principal investigator is the recipient
      of a Research Scientist Development Award. Her career goal is to become an independent
      researcher in self-management of CVD risk in high-risk African American populations, and to
      be a leader in the development and translation into practice of novel, theory-driven and
      empirically based interventions to improve patient self-management of CVD risks.
