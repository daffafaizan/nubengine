      safety of lung protective ventilator settings before extending the study to patients with
      more severe brain and/or lung injury in the future.

      The primary objective is to investigate if lung protective ventilator settings (higher
      Positive end-expiratory pressure and lower tidal volume) as compared with conventional
      settings.

        1. increase intracranial pressure

        2. diminish cerebral vasoreactive autoregulation as assessed by pressure reactivity index,
           ie pressure reactivity index will turn positive, which means that it will change the
           state from intact to impaired autoregulation.

      The secondary objective is an exploratory analysis of the relationship between ventilator
      settings and other well defined respiratory, cerebral, and cardiovascular variables,
      including transpulmonary pressure.
