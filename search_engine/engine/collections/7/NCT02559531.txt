      Switzerland, France and Belgium. No validated triage scale is actually used by EMS providers.
      The objective of this project is to evaluate the reliability and performance of triage by EMS
      providers with the SETS.

      In order to perform this evaluation a cohort of 22 EMS providers will evaluate 28
      standardized clinical scenarios using a computer simulator.
