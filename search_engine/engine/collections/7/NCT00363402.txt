      PET-CT.PET/CT scans (GE ST Discovery PET/CT scanner) will be performed 60 to 90 minutes after
      injection of 5 MBq/kg of FDG. PET/CT will be repeated at the end of the treatment and
      compared with the results of the initial scan. PET and CT will be interpreted by a certified
      nuclear medicine physician and by a certified radiologist, respectively, blinded to clinical
      data, using the PET severity score (PSS), based on the number and the intensity of FDG uptake
      of lung foci. Intensity of uptake will be determined by calculating the mean value for the
      maximum standardized uptake values (MSUV) of all foci.

      (SUV = Activity concentration in ROI (region of interest) divided by injected dose / patient
      body weight). SUV will be measured in normal lungs to receive the normal baseline control for
      the calculations. The correlation with clinical data (FEV1% predicted) and sputum
      bacteriology will then be performed. Inflammation status will also be followed by cytokine
      analysis.
