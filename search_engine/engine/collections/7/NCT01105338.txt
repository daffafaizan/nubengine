      Primary

        -  To assess serum lycopene and epigallocatechin-3-gallate (green tea) levels at 6 months
           following randomization in patients with prostate cancer previously enrolled on ProtecT

      Secondary

        -  To evaluate trial recruitment and randomization rates of patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  To evaluate intervention tolerability in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  To evaluate compliance of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  To evaluate trial retention of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  To assess PSA values in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  To evaluate dietary compliance with recommendations of patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  To assess weight and body mass index of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  To evaluate attitudes and views of men and their spouses about dietary modification and
           participation in long-term study.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to PSA test levels obtained from ProtecT study
      recruitment clinic (< 3.0 ng/mL vs 3.0-19.99 ng/mL). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2
      treatment arms.
