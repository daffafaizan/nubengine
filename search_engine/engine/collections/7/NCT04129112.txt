      and its elimination time with a computerized system, provides the anaesthesiologist useful
      information to guide anaesthesia.

      Although the correlation between propofol at the effector site at loss of consciousness (Ce
      LOC) and age is still debated with contrasting results, the correlation between propofol at
      the effector site at return of consciousness (Ce ROC) and age is well established, and some
      authors suggested that, due also for age-related changes in both pharmacokinetics and
      pharmacodynamics of propofol, its dosage should be reduced in elderly patients.

      Lowering propofol dosage however, can lead to an higher incidence of awareness during general
      anaesthesia, even if anaesthesia management is guided by consciousness monitors.

      Awareness during anaesthesia has recently been defined not as a binary phenomenon, but as a
      graded spectra of states and, during general anaesthesia without using neuromuscular blocking
      drugs (NBDs), body movement on the operating table can be taken as an indication of
      increasing probability of consciousness or 'light' anaesthesia.

      Hence, this study aims to evaluate the impact of age on the concentration at the effector
      site of propofol-remifentanil anaesthesia administered with TCI pump and without NBDs.
      Concnetration at the effector site of Propofol at the return of consciousness (CeP ROC) and
      at any clinical sign of superficialization such as body movements (CeP BM) will be
      considered.
