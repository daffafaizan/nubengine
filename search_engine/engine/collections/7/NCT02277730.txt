      fetal adverse effects. We developed a double-vasopressor automated system incorporating
      continuous non-invasive haemodynamic monitoring using Nexfin cardiac output monitor with a
      two-step algorithm. The system delivered phenylephrine 25 mcg or ephedrine 2 mg (if heart
      rate<60 beats.min-1) every 30 seconds when systolic blood pressure was between 90-100% of
      baseline. The system delivered phenylephrine 50 mcg or ephedrine 4 mg (if heart rate<60
      beats.min-1) every 30 seconds when systolic blood pressure was <90% of baseline.

      A randomised controlled trial will be done to compare with manual bolus technique. With the
      manual bolus technique, phenylephrine 50mcg or ephedrine 4mg (if heart rate<60 beats.min-1)
      every 60 seconds when systolic blood pressure was between 90-100% of baseline. The system
      delivered phenylephrine 100mcg or ephedrine 8mg (if heart rate<60 beats.min-1) every 60
      seconds when systolic blood pressure was <90% of baseline.
