      This is an experimental (exercise) study with follow-ups three and twelve months after
      exercise completion.

      Participants:

      Participants will be recruited from two instances:

        -  "Praksisnett", which is a collaboration between GPs and researchers in Bergen, Norway,
           where GPs recruit potential participants to research projects.

        -  The Ear, Nose, Throat department at Haukeland University Hospital (Bergen), who provide
           service to older adults with hearing impairment. The aim is to include 60 patients into
           three intervention arms: i) virtual reality exercises, ii) vestibular rehabilitation
           exercises and usual care

      Intervention arms:

        -  Virtual reality exercises: Participants will exercise in virtual environments twice
           weekly. The choice of environments/tasks will be individualized, and progress from
           sitting/standing exercises, to doing exercises while walking on a treadmill. The aim is
           to perform cognitive and motor tasks simultanously.

        -  Vestibular rehabilitation exercises: This is an exercise approach that has been used in
           clinical groups, such as patients with vestibular disorders and traumatic brain injury.
           The aim is to perform movements/exercises where the participant is exposed gradually to
           movements that may be provocative for the vestibular system.

      The exercises will be done in a movement lab at Western Norway University of Applied
      Sciences. Participants will be randomised to either of the three intervention arms using a
      computerized procedure. Neither participants, testers or deliverers of the intervention will
      be blinded. Testers and intervention deliverers will be physiotherapists, students enrolled
      in a master program in clinical physiotherapy and bachelor students in physiotherapy.
