      functional connectivity and neurotransmission. Furthermore, in transgender people, CSHT is
      know to induce anatomical and functional changes in the brain. However, only a few studies
      have already been conducted to investigate the effects of sex hormones on the brain
      accounting for the interference of endogenous gonadal hormones. Also, there is a lack of
      knowledge about the importance of CSHT after Gender Affirming Surgery (GAS) regarding induced
      hypogonadism that follows this surgical procedure. Therefore, neuroimaging studies designed
      to isolate the effect of endogenous gonadal hormones in people with GD urge to be developed.

      To fulfil this purpose, transgender women that have already performed GAS and/or were under
      Gonadotrophin Release Hormone analogues treatment (in order to induce hypogonadism similar to
      GAS) were invited to interrupt CSHT for at least 30 days to promote sex hormones washout. At
      the end of the washout, participants performed magnetic resonance imaging, laboratorial
      analyses for sex hormones and neuro-cognitive assessment. After this first time-point,
      participants received a new prescription for CSHT containing estradiol (without progesterone)
      to be used continuously for 60 days, when the same assessments from the end of washout were
      repeated 60 days after CSHT to compare brain and cognitive longitudinal changes.

      At all the time-points, variations in depression scores and anxiety levels were assessed with
      specific scales.
