      the clinical unit on day -1 (if required by the clinical unit to facilitate the severe acute
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2] real-time reverse transcription polymerase
      chain reaction [PCR] procedure) or on day 1.

      After the first dose on day 1, all participants will remain in the clinical unit for
      observation for approximately 24 hours postdose. After the 24 hours, participants will be
      discharged from the clinical unit provided no reactions have occurred that require additional
      observation.

      For all subsequent doses, participants will remain under direct observation for a minimum of
      1 hour postdose. Participants will be discharged from the clinical unit provided no reactions
      have occurred that require additional observation.
