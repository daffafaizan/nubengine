    
      Phase III, open-label, randomized, controlled multi-center study. In the study, 214 patients
      will be enrolled and parallel assigned (via randomization system) in a 1:1 fashion to one of
      two different arms:

      ARM 1:

      Patients in Arm 1 will receive multiple intratumoral administrations into all injectable
      cutaneous, subcutaneous, and nodal tumors of a mixture of L19IL2 and L19TNF once weekly for
      up to 4 weeks (or until all injectable tumors have disappeared, or intolerance to study
      treatment or in the opinion of the investigator immediate surgical resection or any other
      treatment for melanoma is warranted, whichever occurs first). The whole volume of
      L19IL2/L19TNF will be equally distributed among all injectable lesions.

      Newly occurring injectable melanoma lesions within the 4 weeks treatment period will also be
      treated as described. For the new lesions the treatment period will not be extended beyond
      the pre-defined 4 week- treatment period with a clock start at the time of the first
      intralesional L19IL2/L19TNF injection. Surgical resection of all existing metastases will
      follow within 4 weeks after end of treatment. Surgery will be performed after the safety
      evaluation carried out at week 5 and, if indicated, may be carried out on the same day of the
      safety evaluation.

      ARM 2:

      Patients in Arm 2 will receive directly surgical resection of melanoma tumor lesions within 4
      weeks after randomization.
