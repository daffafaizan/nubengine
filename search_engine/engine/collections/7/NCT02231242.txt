      nucleated cells (TNC) into the brain may produce some benefits by different mechanisms like
      cytokine production, in several neurological areas such as motor, social, adaptative and
      cognitive.

      It has been found that after introducing TNC in the subarachnoid space of the spinal cord,
      these cells may be transported through the cerebrospinal fluid and can be delivered more
      efficiently to the injured area, compared with intravenous route in patients with neurologic
      injury.

      Patients will be stimulated for 3 consecutive days with subcutaneous granulocyte colony
      stimulating factor (G-CSF) and then their bone marrow will be harvested according to their
      weight. Bone marrow will be processed in order to obtain the buffy coat and minimize the
      amount of red blood cells. An inoculum of 10mL of this TNC will be infused intrathecally.
      Patients will be evaluated with the "Gross Motor Functional Classification System" before the
      procedure and one, three and six months after that.
