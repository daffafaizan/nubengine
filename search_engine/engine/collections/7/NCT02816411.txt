      inflammatory response as well as recovery of muscle performance following an intense
      eccentric exercise protocol. In a double-blind, counterbalanced design, 14 men received
      either Placebo (PLA) or milk protein isolate (PRO) for 8 consecutive days following a single
      bout of exercise (300 eccentric contractions at 30 deg/sec). In both conditions, performance
      was assessed at baseline, immediately post-exercise, 2h post-exercise and daily for 8
      consecutive days. Blood samples were collected at baseline, 2h post-exercise and daily for
      the remaining 8 days. Muscle biopsies from vastus lateralis were collected at baseline as
      well as at day 2 and day 8 of the post-exercise period.
