    
      Purpose:

      To compare refractive and biometric outcomes in patients with type 1 retinopathy of
      prematurity (ROP) treated with intravitreal injection of Ranibizumab (IVR), versus
      bevacizumab (IVB), at a corrected age of 3 years.

      Methods:

      A retrospective case series compared cycloplegic refractive statuses and biometric statuses
      in patients who received either IVR or IVB for Type 1 ROP, from April 2011 to April 2014.

      Comparison of refractive errors and biometric findings between the two groups was performmed
      and multivariate analysis of possible factors contributive to visual acuity was also
      performmed
