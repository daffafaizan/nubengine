      cells/mm3 among severe asthma patients attending their routine clinical visit at sites
      specialized in the management of severe asthma in several countries in the AstraZeneca
      International Region. The prevalence of an atopic phenotype and the status of asthma control,
      will also be studied. It is expected that this study will contribute to the understanding of
      severe asthma, ultimately helping to inform therapeutic decisions and addressing patients'
      needs.
