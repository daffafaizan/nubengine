      infarction, acute ischemic stroke, and acute massive pulmonary embolism in adults. Previous
      studies have shown the ability of rt-PA to lyse venous thrombus in patients with deep vein
      thrombosis (DVT), and suggest that successful rt-PA mediated thrombolysis can prevent
      post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS).

      rt-PA is delivered directly into venous thrombus using a catheter/device which is embedded
      within the thrombus by a physician under imaging guidance. This method of rt-PA delivery,
      catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT), is thought to be safer, more effective, and more
      efficient than previous methods. The question of whether CDT using rt-PA improves long-term
      DVT patient outcomes with acceptable risk and cost is currently being studied in the ATTRACT
      Trial for adults, but has not yet been addressed in the pediatric population.

      The rationale for performing the PHLO Trial is based upon:

        -  the major burden of PTS on pediatric DVT patients and the U.S. healthcare system

        -  the reported association between rapid clot lysis and prevention of PTS

        -  the proven ability of rt-PA to dissolve venous thrombus in proximal DVT

        -  the recent advances in CDT methods which may lower bleeding risk, but which could,
           inadvertently, cause more endothelial injury in the smaller caliber vessels of pediatric
           patients

        -  the lack of outcome evidence for either anticoagulation or catheter-directed
           thrombolysis in children

        -  the major clinical controversy on whether CDT should routinely be used for first-line
           DVT therapy
