      investigate the efficacy and safety of AMG0001. Specifically, the objectives are:

        1. Assess efficacy of a dosing regimen of 4.0mg/3 mL AMG0001, administered on Days 0, 14,
           and 28 as measured by reduction in total wound area at Month 3.

        2. Assess potential effects of angiogenesis associated with a dosing regimen of 4.0mg/3 mL
           AMG0001, administered on Days 0, 14, and 28 as measured by reduction in total wound area
           at Months 6 and 12, along with reduction in major amputations and improved pain at rest
           as measured on the VAS and hemodynamic measures (ABI/TBI) at Month 3 and Month 6.

        3. Assess overall safety of AMG0001 in the Critical Limb Ischemia subject population as
           determined by physical examination, blood and urine analyses, electrocardiogram, vital
           signs, and by evaluation of adverse experiences during and after the course of
           treatment.
