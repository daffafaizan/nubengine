    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To assess the progression-free survival rate at 2 years after autologous stem cell
           transplantation (ASCT) in patients with relapsed or primary refractory follicular
           lymphoma treated with sargramostim (GM-CSF) and rituximab after ASCT.

      Secondary

        -  To assess the safety of administering GM-CSF and rituximab after ASCT.

        -  To assess the effects of GM-CSF on the relative expression of activating and inhibitory
           FcγR on circulating monocytes.

        -  To assess the effects of GM-CSF on the relative expression of activating and inhibitory
           FcγR on circulating dendritic cells.

        -  To assess the effects of GM-CSF on the level of circulating FcγR.

        -  To assess the reconstitution of NK cells, NK-T cells, dendritic cell subsets, and
           regulatory T-cells after ASCT.

      OUTLINE:

        -  High-dose chemotherapy: Patients receive carmustine IV over 2 hours on day -7, etoposide
           IV over 1 hour and cytarabine IV every 12 hours on days -6 to -3, and melphalan IV on
           day -2.

        -  Autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT): Patients undergo ASCT on day 0. Patients
           receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) once a day beginning on day 5 and
           continuing until blood counts recover.

        -  Sargramostim (GM-CSF) and rituximab: Beginning approximately 7-10 weeks (49-70 days)
           after ASCT, patients receive GM-CSF SC 3 times a week for 8 weeks and rituximab IV once
           weekly for 4 weeks (beginning within 3 days after the first dose of GM-CSF). Patients
           receive a second course of GM-CSF and rituximab (as above) beginning approximately 22-26
           weeks (154-182 days) after ASCT.

      After the completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 2 years.
