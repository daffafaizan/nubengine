      strength, neurological recovery, balance ability, vertigo symptom, gait pattern and
      activities of daily living. This will calculate the prevalence of post-stroke visual
      dependence, and investigate the negative impact of visual dependence on balance and walking
      functions. This also determines whether the value of visual dependence could differentiate
      stroke patients with a history of falls from without a history of falls.
