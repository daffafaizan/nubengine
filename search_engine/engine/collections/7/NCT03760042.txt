      comparison study, C3291042 will assess the local tolerability of crisaborole 5 mg/cm² in
      healthy participants, who have had baseline assessments of surrogate markers of skin
      sensitivity-i.e. current perception threshold (CPT) measurements and standardized lactic acid
      stinging test (LAST) assessments. To further the clinical understanding of application site
      pain, responses to crisaborole ointment compared to crisaborole vehicle ointment will be
      assessed in comparisons based upon CPT (low versus high; symmetry versus asymmetry) and
      response to LAST ("stingers" versus "non-stingers"). This exploration of skin sensitivity
      characterizations in healthy participants exposed to crisaborole 5 mg/cm² will assess
      application site burning, stinging, and pain as well as other application site
      characteristics selected from a MedDRA-based list of terms by the participants. More advanced
      understanding of baseline application site sensation in healthy participants prior to higher
      local application rate of topical crisaborole may provide strategies for topical dermatologic
      product development programs striving to prevent or minimize application site sensory adverse
      events.
