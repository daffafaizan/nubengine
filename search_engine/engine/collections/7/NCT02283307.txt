      is equivalent to SECT urography performed with a full iodine dose for:

        -  Enhancement of the aorta, renal arteries, and renal veins

        -  Enhancement of the renal cortex

        -  Enhancement of the renal pelvis, ureters, and bladder

        -  Subjective evaluation of image quality

        -  Objective evaluation of image quality

      In addition, the investigators hypothesize that DECT virtual non-contrast images using
      material suppression from the same low iodine CT exam results in equivalent diagnostic
      information compared to SECT true non-contrast images obtained in the same patient during the
      same exam. If the true non-contrast images could be replaced by the virtual non-contrast
      images without loss of information, there is potential for DECT to both significantly lower
      radiation dose as well as significantly decreasing iodine dose.

      The investigators designed this research protocol to prospectively test these hypotheses in a
      population scanned with a 50% reduced iodine DECT urography protocol compared to a control
      population scanned with a standard iodine dose clinical SECT urography protocol.
