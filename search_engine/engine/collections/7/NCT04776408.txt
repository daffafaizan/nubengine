      response to preserve ventilation/perfusion (V¬/Q¬) matching. However, in ARDS, this normal
      vasoconstrictive response is impaired. Because the body is unable to shunt blood away from
      the diseased alveoli, these nonaerated alveoli receive excessive blood flow, which
      contributes to severe V¬/Q¬ mismatching and an intrapulmonary right-to-left shunting of blood
      flow, which causes hypoxemia.

      In the recent years, the treatment of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome has been proved
      that lung recruitment re-opens the non-ventilated alveolar to improve ventilation, and
      inhaled Nitric Oxide dilates non-perfused pulmonary vascular to improve perfusion. Both of
      these could improve ventilation-perfusion mismatch to enhance oxygenation. However,
      Ventilation-Perfusion mismatch is devided into ventilated nonperfused lung units(dead space)
      or perfused nonventilated units(shunt). No published study has evaluated the availability of
      lung recruitment combined with inhaled Nitric oxide in patients with ARDS.

      The aims of our study are to measure dead space or shunt fraction before and after inhaled
      Nitric Oxide in moderate to severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome patients indicated
      Nitric oxide in FEMH MICU on 2021/01-2022/12, injected a bolus of 10mL of 3% NaCl solution
      via the central venous catheter with two-step recruitment maneuver by Electrical Impedance
      Tomography, which monitors ventilation-perfusion mismatch to evaluate whether the patient has
      potential to improve V/Q mismatch by Nitric oxide.
