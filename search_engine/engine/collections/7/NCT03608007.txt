    
      This is a phase II, multicenter, single-arm study in which the efficacy and safety of X-396
      capsule (Ensartinib) will be assessed in adult Chinese patients with ROS1-positive
      (rearrangement or inversion) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Approximately 69 patients
      (59 for never-treated, and 10 for previously treated with crizotinib) with locally advanced
      or metastatic NSCLC carrying ROS1-rearrangement will be enrolled in the study.
