      in combination with other neutralizing antibodies led to protection from HIV-1 or SHIV
      infection and also to sustained suppression of HIV-1 plasma viremia. The aims of this
      protocol are to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics profile of 3BNC117 in
      both HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected subjects,and its antiretroviral activity in HIV-infected
      subjects.
