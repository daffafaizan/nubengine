      of hypoxia is vital, the current clinical practice of excessive oxygenation settings is
      common, and unnecessary, and may even be harmful.

      An expert panel convened to define optimal oxygenation targets in critically ill trauma
      patients. The strong consensus was to target normoxia at an oxygen saturation (SpO2) range of
      90-96% and arterial oxygen (PaO2) range of 60-100 mmHg. Accordingly, a pilot trial
      implementation of this consensus will occur for the care of trauma patients.

      Specific Aim:

      This is an observational pre/post study to evaluate the impact of targeted normoxia
      implementation in optimizing oxygen delivery and oxygenation in critically ill trauma
      patients.

      Hypotheses:

      That the clinical efforts to improve adherence to oxygen guidelines will:

        1. improve the proportion of time spent with target normoxia thresholds (oxygen saturation
           SpO2 90-96%) by

        2. reducing utilization of unnecessary supplementation oxygen

        3. without a substantive increase in hypoxic episodes or an adverse impact on clinical
           outcomes.
