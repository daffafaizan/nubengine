      high dose chemotherapy (HDCT) with hematopoietic progenitor stem cell rescues has been chosen
      as potentially curative therapy. Many institutions have used carboplatin, thiotepa, etoposide
      (CTE) for conditioning regimen of 1st HDCT and cyclophosphamide, melphalan (CM) for
      conditioning regimen of 2nd HDCT. Our institution applied this regimen to the 38 pediatric
      patients with high risk brain tumor since 1996. Although the 3 year overall survival rate and
      event free survival rate were improved to 69% and 47.9%, respectively, the results showed
      relatively high treatment related mortality (TRM) rate of 21%. Toxicity of this tandem
      regimen was also reported as being high up to 32% in other researches as well so that this
      regimen is considered not feasible due to toxicity. In this study, the investigators plan to
      improve event free survival rate and reduce treatment related toxicities of pediatric
      patients with high risk/recurrent CNS tumors by administrating tandem high dose chemotherapy
      and autologous stem cell rescue with topotecan, thiotepa, carboplatin (TTC) for 1st HDCT and
      melphalan, etoposide, carboplatin (MEC) for 2nd HDCT.
