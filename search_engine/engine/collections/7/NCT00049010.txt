        -  Correlate degree of melastatin gene expression with risk of developing local regional
           metastases in patients with primary stage I or II melanoma.

        -  Correlate melastatin expression prospectively with event-free survival of these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Melastatin mRNA expression is determined by in situ hybridization using tissue from primary
      tumor and lymph nodes. Tissue is also examined by immunohistochemical staining using
      antibodies to S-100 and MART-1. Patients do not receive the results of these tests nor do the
      results influence individual therapy.

      Patients are followed every 4 months for 3.5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 300 patients will be accrued for this study within 3.5 years.
