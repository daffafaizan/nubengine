      medical and basic science research discoveries about the short-term and long-term effects of
      drug use on the developing brain. One outcome of this results was the production of a
      science-based drug education program entitled "The Brain: Understanding Neurobiology Through
      the Study of Addiction." This is a 5-lesson module for high school science classes that
      teaches about brain structure and function, how drugs affect and change the biology and
      chemistry of the brain, how addiction occurs in the brain, and that addiction is a chronic,
      recurring disease. However, the effect of receipt of this program on students' substance use
      knowledge, attitudes, perceived risk of harm, and behavior has not been systematically
      evaluated to date.

      The specific aims of this project are:

        1. To evaluate the effects of receipt of the curriculum on specific cognitive contributors
           to substance use including a)students' knowledge about the short- and long-term effects
           of substance use on the brain; b)perceived risk of harm from substance use; and
           c)intention to use substances in the next 3 months.

        2. To evaluate the effects of the intervention on actual substance use behavior. We
           hypothesize that the effectiveness of this approach may be modified by the students'
           level of prior and current substance use, with the effect being stronger among those who
           have not already initiated use, or among those who have very low use. Therefore, we will
           specifically examine whether the intervention a)prevents substance use initiation among
           students who had no previous use, b)stops use among students with low lifetime use, and
           c) reduces use among those with higher levels of use.
