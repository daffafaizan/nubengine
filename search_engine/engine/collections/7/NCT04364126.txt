      or home blood pressure measurement (HBPM). The SOC group will target office blood pressure
      <130/80 mmHg. The HBPM group will measure BP at home, twice morning and evening for (3-)7
      days before routine clinical visits (ideally 28 measurements); the mean value from day 2-7 is
      used; target home mean BP is < 125/80 mmHg.
