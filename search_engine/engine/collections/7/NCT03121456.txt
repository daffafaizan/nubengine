      in the absence of treatment. The therapeutic strategy and prognosis of patients depend on the
      initial staging and evaluation of early therapeutic response. Positron emission tomography
      injected with labeled fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG PET-CT) is recommended in the initial
      disease balance; It also has a prognostic value demonstrated in the evaluation of the
      intermediate and final response of treatment of malignant non-Hodgkin's lymphoma B (LMNH B)
      to large cells through a qualitative visual analysis using the 5-point scale of Deauville,
      but also thanks to a quantitative analysis with the measurement of the Delta SUV max. If the
      18F-FDG PET-CT is referred to, it is not without constraint, it is notably an examination
      leading to exposure to ionizing radiation for the patient.

      Diffusion MRI (DWI) is a non-irradiating technique based on the evaluation of the diffusion
      of water molecules allowing indirect qualitative and quantitative analysis of the tumor
      microstructure, cellularity and integrity of the cell membrane . The tumor is thus detected
      thanks to its hypercellularity and the mapping of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC).

      Several recent studies have demonstrated the feasibility and interest of MRI scattering and
      measurement of CDA in tumor staging and early therapeutic evaluation of high grade lymphomas
      and more particularly diffuse large B-cell Lyphoma, The latter being characterized by a high
      nucleo-cytoplasmic cellularity and ratio which makes it possible to obtain a strong signal
      and low ADC values in diffusion MRI (5) (7) (8) (9) (10) (12) (13) (14). However, there are
      few studies comparing these two imaging techniques in the therapeutic evaluation of large
      cell LMNH B (6) (11) (15). The main limitations of the existing studies are their small size
      and, above all, the accuracy of the methodology for quantifying the measurement of
      therapeutic response and in particular in terms of quantitative analysis of CDA.
