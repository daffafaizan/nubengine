    
      1. The investigators have developed an AI-based miniprogram, and embedded in the Wechat
           social application.

        2. The investigators invited patients receiving warfarin therapy to participant this
           randomized controlled trial .

        3. Participants were randomized to the experimental group and control group in a ratio of
           1:1.

        4. Participants' warfarin therapy were managed by an AI-based social miniprogram and a
           Human-based social miniprogram respectively.

        5. International normalized ratio(INR) was monitored once a month at least, and the time in
           therapeutic range was calculated to evaluate the warfarin anticoagulation quality.

        6. Participants were followed-up for 24 months, and clinical events, including major
           bleedings and thrombotic events were recorded during follow-up.
