      will be screened for participation. Discharge antithrombotic medication will be at the
      discretion of the treating physician.

      Follow-up visits will be performed at 1, 6 and 12 months post-percutaneous coronary
      intervention by telephone contact or personal interview. All outcome and adverse events will
      be adjudicated by an independent endpoint committee. All data will be recorded in electronic
      forms and multiple quality controls will be performed both electronically and on-site to
      ensure data integrity.

      Platelet reactivity substudy:Patients receiving either clopidogrel or ticagrelor as part of
      their (dual or triple) combination therapy, will be eligible for sub-study of platelet
      function assessment with the VerifyNow assay at 1 month post-percutaneous coronary
      intervention in centers with test availability.

      Sub-study's endpoints will be platelet reactivity between groups and high platelet reactivity
      rate between groups.
