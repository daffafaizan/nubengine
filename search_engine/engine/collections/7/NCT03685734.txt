      renamed Descemet stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK). In recent years, DSAEK
      techniques have evolved, favoring increasingly thinner and finer grafts, known as ultrathin
      DSAEK (UT DSAEK), with the aim of obtaining better visual results.

      Endothelial keratoplasty is now the most common surgical procedure used to treat endothelial
      dysfunction. The current study focused on assessing both objective and subjective visual
      quality outcomes following DSAEK.
