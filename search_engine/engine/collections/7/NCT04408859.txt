      included in the 2018 version of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guideline as
      an optional treatment (category 2B) for prospective resectable advanced gastric cancer cases
      (â‰¥cT2, any N).At home and abroad, the research on neoadjuvant chemotherapy for advanced
      gastric cancer mainly focuses on the safety and long-term survival, and there are few studies
      on the quality of life. This study, according to EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-STO22 assessment
      scale, explores the long term effect of neoadjuvant chemotherapy on the quality of life in
      patients with advanced gastric cancer.
