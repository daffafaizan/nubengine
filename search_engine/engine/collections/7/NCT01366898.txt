    
      Prephase (days -5 to -1) Dexamethasone 10 mg/m2 bolus day IV for 5 days (-5 to -1).
      Supplementary treatment: hydration minimum 2000 ml/day, allopurinol 300 mg / day, gastric
      protection (as center), daily monitoring of blood glucose, daily monitoring of renal
      function. Intrathecal treatment (diagnosis and prophylactic) day -5: 12 mg were administered
      intrathecal methotrexate. The morphological study of the CSF will be defining initial CNS
      involvement by LAL. Although it is recommended immunophenotypic study of CSF, the definition
      of CNS involvement by LAL (and its therapeutic consequences) based on morphological
      observation of blasts in CSF cytocentrifuge.

      Remission induction:

      Tolerance prephase period can be used to establish the final indication of treatment
      (standard protocol or frail patients). Day 0 is free of treatment and is considered as +1 the
      first day of induction. The total duration of the induction is 30 days, consists of two
      phases (Phase I, days +1 to +14 and phase II, days +15 to +30). Mandatory testing is
      considered counting the percentage of blasts in peripheral blood +8 day of induction, a
      myelogram to day +14 to assess early response and a day +35 to assess the complete remission

      (days +1 to +14)
