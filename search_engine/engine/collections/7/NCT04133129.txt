      training modes have on the lipid profile of subjects with pre-symptoms of metabolic syndrome.
      One training mode will involve High-Intensity Interval Training and the other will involve
      medium intensity continuous training. The desired outcomes of this project are to know the
      effects of both modes of training have on the long-term on the lipid profile in order to help
      develop a nonpharmacologic alternative to prevent or treat metabolic syndrome and to know how
      affective and enjoyment responses are affected by the different modes of training. The
      Project lasts for 16 weeks. Training will take place during weeks 3 and 14 of the project.
      The project will be described fully to the participants during the 1st week. In addition to
      this, their rights as participants will be explained in addition to any possible ethical
      issues that might require clarifying. Once the subjects have agreed to take part in the
      research they will undergo a series of tests in order to asses their cardiorespiratory
      fitness and their lipids profile. Before starting the training intervention participants will
      be randomly assigned to one of the 3 different groups; Control, Medium Intensity Continuous
      Training and Low Volume High-Intensity Interval Training. Between weeks 3 and 14 subjects
      will take part in 3 training sessions per week. At week 15 and 16 subjects will undergo the
      same tests as during week 1 and 2.
