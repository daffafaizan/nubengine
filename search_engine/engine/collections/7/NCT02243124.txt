    
      The study is a nonrandomized open-label treatment with varying doses of cenersen by
      intravenous administration to:

      Primary

      *To assess the safety profile and dose limiting toxicities (DLT) of cenersen for each of
      three increasing dose levels as stipulated by the protocol in patients with lower risk MDS
      defined as low or intermediate-1 risk by IPSS.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the lowest pharmacologically active exposure from among three increasing
           dose levels as stipulated by the protocol that exhibits the desired activity on
           erythropoiesis after evaluation of all dose levels, and

        -  To determine if intermittent treatment with cenersen will reduce transfusion
           requirements for patients with lower risk MDS.
