      of side effects. The yellow light is preferentially absorbed by hemoglobin allowing more
      selective destruction of the ectatic capillaries in the dermis.

      The flashlamp-pumped pulsed dye laser has become the treatment of choice for port wine stain
      birthmarks; however, therapeutic challenges remain. The epidermis is not totally spared due
      to partial absorption of energy therein by melanin which presents an optical barrier through
      which the light must pass to reach the underlying blood vessels. Absorption of laser energy
      by melanin causes localized heating in the epidermis, which may, if not controlled, produce
      permanent complications such as hypertrophic scarring or dyspigmentation.

      Clinical studies have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of cryogen spray cooling during
      pulsed laser treatment of port wine stain birthmarks. This technology allows the use of
      higher incident laser light dosages and has been demonstrated to improve treatment results.
      cryogen spray cooling also decreases treatment pain and the duration of post-laser treatment
      purpura.
