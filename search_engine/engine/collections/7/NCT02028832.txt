      in reducing overall symptoms of pain, nausea/vomiting, and/or anxiety (PNVA), length of stay,
      and costs, in hospitalized children when compared to conventional care. In this context,
      "integrative" refers to a combined approach of complementary and conventional medical
      therapies in an evidence-based fashion.

      Design: cluster trial; 2-arm controlled evaluation study in pediatric oncology, general
      pediatrics and pediatric cardiology. Intervention will be offered during a 6-month PIM period
      following a 6 month control period.

      Population: Inclusion criteria: (i) In-patients in participating division and (ii) informed
      consent/assent. Exclusion criteria: (i) lack of parent participation, fluency in English, or
      informed consent

      Intervention: Recommendations for specific CAM therapies will be determined by a staff PIM
      pediatrician. Any combination of the following CAM therapies (dose, duration, amount to be
      based on patient need as assessed by CAM provider, patient, and parent):
      acupuncture/acupressure, massage, Reiki; all are to be offered in addition to usual care.

      Control: Usual care.

      Outcomes: Primary outcome: feasibility (i.e enrollment); Secondary outcomes: (i) PNVA symptom
      management, (ii) need for conventional pharmacotherapy, (iii) adverse events; (iv) parent and
      health care provider satisfaction with care provided, v) length of stay; and vi)
      cost-effectiveness (analysis of this outcome to be limited to patients admitted for at least
      2 days and for not more than 30 days).

      Significance: To our knowledge, this study will be the first comparative effectiveness trial
      to assess the impact of PIM for hospitalized children with cancer.
