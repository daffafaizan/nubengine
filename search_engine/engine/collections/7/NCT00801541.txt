      occurring in the chorioretinal interface during progression of AMD from risk "dry" AMD to
      sight-threatening chorioretinal neovascularization (CNV) (wet AMD).

      Different imaging methods will be used simultaneously and at regular intervals in order to
      characterize markers or predictors of conversion to sight-threatening CNV will be: CNV
      (classic or occult) or position of CNV within 2500 Âµm (~1.7 disc diameters) of the foveal
      center, as evidenced by fluorescein angiography.

      This is an institutional, prospective, observation study to be performed in fellow eyes of
      patients with evidence of "wet" AMD in other eye. Therefore, patients will have evidence of
      exudative ("wet") AMD in one eye ( the non-study eye) and non-exudative ("dry") AMD in the
      fellow eye (the study eye) that is at risk for progressive to exudation "wet" CNV.

      Patients will exit the study at the time of developing sight-threatening CNV in the study eye
      and will be treated at the discretion of the physician.
