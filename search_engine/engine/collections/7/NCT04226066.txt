      the anti-tumor effect, but also reduce the toxicity of T601. Considering the risks and
      benefits of participants of the clinical trial, the protocol design is divided into 4 parts:

      Part 1: dose-escalation study of single-dose of T601 to evaluate the safety and tolerability
      of T601 and to determine the MTD;

      Part 2: dose-escalation study of single-dose of T601 combined with predrug 5-FC, to evaluate
      the safety and tolerability of the treatment of single dose of T601 combined with predrug
      5-FC and to determine the MTD of single dose of T601 when combing with 5-FC;

      Part 3: dose-escalation study of multiple-dose of T601 combined with predrug 5-FC, to explore
      the safety and tolerability of the treatment of multiple dose of T601 combined with predrug
      5-FC and to determine the MTD of multiple dose of T601 when combing with 5-FC, also to
      determine the RP2D (recommended dose for Phase II Trial);

      Part 4: extending study of multiple-dose of T601 combined with predrug 5-FC, to evaluate the
      efficacy of the treatment of multiple-dose of T601 combined with predrug 5-FC in patients
      with various specific tumors and to evaluate the ORR, DCR and PFS according to the RECIST
      v1.1.
