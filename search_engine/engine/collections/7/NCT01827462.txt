      annually with the seasonal influenza vaccine, Fluzone, on Day 0. Follow-up visits will be
      conducted on Day 6-8 and Day 28. Unsolicited adverse events are collected from immunization
      until the Day 28 visit, serious adverse events are collected for the entire time of study
      participation. A blood sample is collected pre-immunization and at each follow-up visit.
      Volunteers will be followed for up to 11 years, those too frail to come in for visits
      received annual phone calls to monitor health. Last annual influenza vaccines were given in
      Fall 2015.

      The main basic research effort will be to collect safety data and follow medical history
      events in elderly and younger control subjects. Investigators will also look at immune
      responses to influenza vaccination. In 2008, 2012 and 2014, the cohort added additional
      participants to replace those who had withdrawn.

      Beginning in 2014, those participants 65 years and older were immunized with High Dose
      trivalent Fluzone and younger participants received the quadrivalent formulation of Fluzone.
