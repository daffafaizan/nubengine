      week daily attentional retraining (AR) delivered via a portable electronic device (PED) in
      comparison with a control condition over the course of a 2-3 week training period.
      Participants in this study will be cocaine and opioid-dependent individuals stabilized on
      methadone. Both cocaine and opioids will be targeted in the AR procedure the investigators
      will test in this study. The retraining or control condition, along with a series of
      assessments, will be delivered on the PED as part of a daily (Monday through Friday)
      appointment at which time participants will also obtain their daily methadone dose.
      Assessments will cover substance use, craving and other issues. In addition to completing the
      retraining or control procedure, participants will also be engaged in standard versions of
      attentional bias tasks (i.e., without retraining) periodically in order to gauge an effect of
      study condition on attentional bias over time. Thus, the investigators will be able to track
      changes in attentional bias over time in a more detailed fashion than has been previously
      possible. Following the 3 week training period, there will be another 3 weeks of treatment in
      which patients will continue to receive methadone and complete limited assessments without
      any AR or control procedures with the PED.
