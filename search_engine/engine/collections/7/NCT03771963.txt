      (TDV). The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the immune response and safety of a
      naturally aged (>12 months stored at 2°C to 8°C) lot of TDV in a healthy adult population in
      country(ies) non-endemic for dengue. The assessment of a naturally aged lot of TDV in this
      clinical trial will provide an important contribution to data on TDV stability throughout the
      shelf life of the product.

      The study will enroll approximately 200 patients. Participants will be enrolled to the one
      treatment group:

      TDV 0.5 mL

      All participants will receive subcutaneous (SC) injection on Day 1 (Month 0) and Day 90
      (Month 3).

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to
      participate in this study is 9 months. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic
      including a final visit at Day 270 (Month 9).
