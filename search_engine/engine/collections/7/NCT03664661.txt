      mature B cells and plasma cells. Myeloma cells express BCMA universally. BCMA signal pathway
      can induce plasma cell proliferation and survival, down-regulation of BCMA could control the
      progression of myeloma. The BCMA CAR used in this study consists of BCMA nanobody, CD8 hinge,
      transmembrane region and 4-1bb co-stimulation domain.
