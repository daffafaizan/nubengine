      remediation, compared to a placebo, improves attention and related cognitive functions in
      patients with compulsive hoarding. Previous research has demonstrated that hoarders have
      diminished neuropsychological abilities, particularly in the areas of attention, memory, and
      executive function; and that cognitive remediation improves those functions in populations
      that are similarly impaired, such as in individuals with schizophrenia. The investigators
      will thus randomize 20 patients with compulsive hoarding to receive either cognitive
      remediation or a placebo condition. Before and after treatment, the investigators aim to
      assess the effects of cognitive remediation on neuropsychological functioning and hoarding
      severity. The primary specific aim is to examine whether cognitive remediation improves
      cognitive function in compulsive hoarders. The investigators hypothesize that compulsive
      hoarding patients who are treated with cognitive remediation will demonstrate improved
      cognitive skills at post-treatment compared to patients receiving placebo. This will be
      especially true of attention; memory and executive function skills may also be improved. A
      secondary, exploratory aim is to examine whether cognitive remediation improves hoarding
      severity, compared to placebo. The ultimate goal of this research is to determine the
      feasibility and appropriateness of pursuing larger-scale studies of the promising new
      approach of combining cognitive remediation with other treatments for compulsive
      hoarding-particularly cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT).
