      I. To assess the safety and feasibility of combining PS-341 with topotecan in patients with
      advanced solid tumor malignancies.

      II. To define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of topotecan when administered in combination
      with a fixed dose of PS-341 and to described the toxicities at each dose studied.

      III. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of topotecan when given in combination with PS-341 at
      MTD.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To perform laboratory correlative studies on patients tissue investigating potential
      predictors of response.

      OUTLINE:

      PART I (completed as of 09/06/06; all patients enrolled in study after 09/06/06 are enrolled
      in part II): Patients receive escalating doses of topotecan hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes
      on days 1 and 8 followed 6 hours later by bortezomib IV on days 1, 4, 8, and 11. Treatment
      repeats every 21 days for at least 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      PART II: Patients receive bortezomib IV on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 followed 6 hours later by
      escalating doses of topotecan hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment
      repeats every 21 days for at least 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      In both parts of the study, patients who achieve a response may receive additional courses of
      treatment.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.
