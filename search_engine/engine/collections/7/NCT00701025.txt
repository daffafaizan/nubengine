      asthmatic) and exercise habits. The participants will have baseline spirometry performed, and
      skin prick testing for allergies. Skin testing is important as it can influence the level of
      exhaled nitric oxide and hence we would like to adjust our results for the presence of
      allergies. Subsequently, volunteers will undergo sputum induction and then have peripheral
      blood drawn for microRNA analysis. MicroRNA's are single-stranded RNA molecules of about
      21-23 nucleotides in length regulating gene expression. Patterns of MicroRNA expression have
      been linked to heart disease and cancer. Similar patterns have not been identified in
      exercise-induced asthma. In total, including time for questions and recovery, the time for
      Visit 1 will be approximately 3 hours.

      At Visit 2, which will occur 24 hours to 7 days after Visit 1 in order to minimize risk of
      asthma exacerbation, the participants will again have baseline spirometry. Baseline exhaled
      nitric oxide will be performed. Eucapnic Voluntary hyperventilation testing will then be
      performed. They then will have a second exhaled nitric oxide quantification, will undergo
      sputum induction and then have peripheral blood drawn for microRNA analysis, all occurring
      after EVH testing. In total, including time for questions and recovery, the time for Visit 2
      will be approximately 2 hours.
