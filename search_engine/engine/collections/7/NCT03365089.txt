      mature (FTM). The most common cause is stenosis of the artery or vein. Another potential
      cause is the presence of collateral or side branch veins that steal blood flow from the main
      fistula channel. The utility of ligating these veins to improve maturation of those failing
      AVFs is controversial. To evaluate this, 35 patients presenting for fistulograms for
      evaluation of AVFs with FTM, found to have side branch veins will be prospectively enrolled.
      After management of stenoses (if present), they will be randomly assigned to ligation of the
      venous side branches or not. Maturation rates for each group will be prospectively assessed.
      For patients assigned to the control group who have persistent failure to mature, a
      cross-over intervention will be performed and side branch ligation will be offered.
