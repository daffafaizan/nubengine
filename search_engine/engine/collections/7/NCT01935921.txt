      I. To identify the starting dose of ipilimumab, in combination with standard cetuximab-IMRT
      in patients with high- or intermediate-risk, locally advanced head and neck squamous cell
      carcinoma (HNSCC), for use in a future clinical efficacy trial.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the clinical response of patients with high- or intermediate-risk, locally
      advanced HNSCC treated with above regimen using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
      (RECIST) 1.1 criteria.

      II. To estimate the 2-year progression-free survival of patients with high- or
      intermediate-risk, locally advanced HNSCC treated with the above regimen.

      III. To investigate serum, lymphocyte and tissue biomarkers as predictors of progression-free
      survival, toxicity and other outcome parameters in patients with high- or intermediate-risk,
      locally advanced HNSCC treated with above regimen.

      IV. To estimate the association by dose-response modeling between dose of ipilimumab,
      clinical response and biomarkers.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of ipilimumab.

      Patients receive cetuximab intravenously (IV) over 60-120 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22.
      Treatment with cetuximab repeats every 4 weeks for 2 courses. Beginning in week 2 of course
      1, patients undergo concurrent IMRT 5 days per week for 7 weeks. Beginning in week 4 (day 1
      of course 2) patients also receive ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes once every 21 days for 3
      courses. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients achieving disease progression may undergo surgery after completion of therapy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 12 weeks for 1 year,
      every 6 months for 1 year, and then every 12 months for 3 years.
