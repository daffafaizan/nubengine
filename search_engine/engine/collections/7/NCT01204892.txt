      Plane (TAP) block with Ropivacaine 0.5% is better than analgesia with local infiltration of
      trochar sites with Ropivacaine 0.5% in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

      Our hypothesis is that in laparoscopic cholecystectomy, bilateral TAP blocks will reduce
      postoperative pain scores when compared to conventional postoperative pain control with local
      infiltration of trochar insertion sites.
