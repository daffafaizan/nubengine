      Management methods of epistaxis include nasal packing, chemical or electric cauterization,
      and arterial ligation or embolization.

      There are numerous nasal packing products available in the market, and are used to stop or
      prevent nasal bleeding. The ideal nasal pack should be efficient in controlling bleeding,
      have antimicrobial properties and be well tolerated. Currently, there is no perfect nasal
      pack, but some are closer to ideal than others. Nasal packs can be classified into
      non-absorbable and absorbable nasal packs.

      Recently, a new hemostatic product has been introduced in the market, and used as a military
      wound bandages, the ChitoFlex®. ChitoFlex® is made of chitosan, a naturally occurring,
      bio-compatible polysaccharide. Because chitosan has a positive charge, it attracts red blood
      cells, which have a negative charge. The red blood cells create a seal over the wound as they
      are drawn into the bandage, forming a very tight, coherent seal. The ChitoFlex® -dressing has
      been demonstrated by AATCC Test Method 100-2004, Evaluation of Antibacterial Finishes
      (Technical Manual of the America Association of Textile Chemists and Colorists) as an
      antibacterial barrier in laboratory testing with a variety of gram-positive and gram-negative
      bacterial organisms.
