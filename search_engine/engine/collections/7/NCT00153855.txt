      Despite improved survival rates among this population in recent years, these forms of brain
      injury remain frequent and have considerable consequences. Periventricular leukomalacia
      (PVL), a disease characterized by necrosis of the cerebral white matter in a characteristic
      distribution, is one of the most common types of brain injury seen in premature infants. MRI
      technology now allows for better anatomical resolution resulting in improvements in
      diagnostic accuracy. The current standard practice is not to perform routine MRI examinations
      on premature infants, nor is it routine to perform surveillance brain imaging in children
      after leaving the NICU. In their 2002 Practice Parameter for neuroimaging in the neonate, the
      American Academy of Neurology and the Practice Committee of the Child Neurology Society
      acknowledge the superiority of MRI in detection of brain lesions in premature infants, but
      fall short of recommending routine MRI scanning on the basis of a lack of information
      correlating MRI findings to neurodevelopmental outcomes. We now have a unique opportunity to
      help provide such information.
