      Chinese adults. To investigate the clinical predictive value of p16 hydroxymethylation
      diagnostic reagents in the early diagnosis of oral cancer, the investigators carried out the
      prospective multi-center double-blind cohort study.

      Methods:265 patients with histologically confirmed mild or moderate OED were included in the
      present study. After the bisulfite modification and tet assistant bisulfite modification,
      MethyLight and Methylation-specific PCR (MSP) assays were used to analyze p16 methylation and
      status in these patients. Building three follow-up queue by p16-methylated,
      p16-hydroxymethylation and p16-unmethylated. The Statistical analysis used SPSS16.0. All
      P-values were two-sided. P<0.05 was considered to test for statistical significance
      difference.
