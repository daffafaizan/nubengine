the serological differentiation of mycoplasma strains (pleuro-pneumonia-like organisms) from various sourcesa complement fixation test with rabbit antisera was used to differentiate 82cultures of mycoplasma from man, mammalian cell cultures, laboratory rats andmice, cattle, goats, poultry, embryonated eggs and sewage.seventeen serotypes were distinguished, 5 from man, 1 from mammalian cellcultures, 4 from rats and mice, 4 from cattle and goats, 2 from poultry and onesaprophytic.  most of these corresponded to recognized species of mycoplasma,but 1 of human origin (represented by 1 strain, navel), and 1 from tissuecultures (5 strains), may represent new species.  r38, one of the serotypesfrom rats, could be distinguished from the species m. arthritidis, but isprobably an antigenic variant rather than a distinct species.  two specieshitherto recognized as distinct m. arthritidis and m. hominis type 2, could notbe distinguished and appear to constitute a single species.  these findingsillustrate the necessity, from the viewpoint of taxonomy, of comparingmycoplasma strains by serological methods.the serotypes of human and animal origin were largely host-specific.exceptions were the inclusion of m. arthritidis from rats and m. hominis type 2from man in a single serotype, the finding of a bovine organism among thestrains isolated from goats and of a saprophytic strain in a rat.in relation to the aetiology of disease in man and animals, the isolation ofan endogenous mycoplasma from embryonated eggs used to passage infectivematerial illustrates the importance of identifying these organismsserologically.  the demonstration of mixed mycoplasma infections in lesionsin two rats shows the necessity of adequately purifying all cultures ofmycoplasma before examination.
