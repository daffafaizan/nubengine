      Spectrum Disorder (ASD) to optimize the effects of an evidence-based behavioral intervention,
      Pivotal Response Treatment (PRT) by attempting to enhance it with oxytocin (OXT). We will
      integrate fMRI, eye tracking, and behavioral outcomes to measure how OXT may create a neural
      background for individuals with ASD to bolster their motivation to interact socially and
      facilitate their biological preparedness for learning social communication skills during
      behavioral treatments.
