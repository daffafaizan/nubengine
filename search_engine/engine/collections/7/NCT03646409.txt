      thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. For cancer patients receiving chemotherapy the incidence
      of VTE is even higher.

      Several predictive models were previously developed to identify and justify
      thromboprophylaxis for cancer patietns who are at highest risk of VTE, like the Khorana and
      PROTECHT score. The Khorana score is a risk-stratification tool to select patients at high
      risk of VTE for thromboprophylaxis. The PROTECHT score takes cisplatin-based chemotherapy
      into account in addition of the Khorana score.

      Thereby, the incidence of bleeding and VTE in patients with esophageal cancer is not clear.

      This study aims to assess the 6- and 12-month venous thromboembolism (VTE) and bleeding
      incidence from the start of cancer diagnosis in a retrospective cohort of patients with
      esophageal cancer. Additionally, the predictive value of the Khorana score and several other
      VTE and bleeding prediction scores and risk factors will be evaluated.
