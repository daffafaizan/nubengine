    
      This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of the human monoclonal antibody
      (mAb) AR-105 for the adjunctive therapeutic treatment of P. aeruginosa pneumonia in
      mechanically ventilated subjects. Subjects who are randomized will be treated with either
      standard of care (SOC) antibiotics plus placebo or SOC antibiotics plus AR-105. The study is
      being conducted at approximately 100 clinical sites across 17 countries. Subjects who meet
      all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria are screened by the
      microbiological culture test and/or rapid diagnostic test of an endotracheal aspirate to
      confirm the presence of an active P. aeruginosa infection. Following eligibility
      confirmation, the subject will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of two treatment groups.
