      between an intervention of participant preferred music, when initiated within the first 24
      hours following a left middle cerebral artery stroke, and a reduction in the following
      disabilities: Expressive aphasia, right hand functional deficit and post stroke depression.
      This aim will serve to address the first research hypothesis and address the relationship
      between These disabilities are well known sequalae among patients diagnosed with the most
      common form of stroke, a LMCA stroke. Participant preferred music within the first 24 hours
      following a LMCA stroke and a reduction in: Expressive aphasia, right hand functional deficit
      and post stroke depression, as these disabilities are well known sequalae among LMCA stroke
      patients.

      Aim II. The second aim of MASTER is to identify if a relationship exists between an
      intervention of audible books, when initiated within the first 24 hours following a LMCA
      stroke, and a reduction in the following disabilities: Expressive aphasia, right hand
      functional deficit and post stroke depression.

      Sufficient evidence exists to suggest that although listening to books stimulates cognitive
      function, the effect of melody and participant engagement in music is far superior to
      listening to words alone as the inherent rhythmicity of patient-favored music has been shown
      to strengthen synchronous neuronal connectivity, by modulating dopamine and inducing fine
      grained neuroanatomical changes in a recovering brain.
