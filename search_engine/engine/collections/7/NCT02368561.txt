      that may be as high as 40 to 50 percent in competitive athletes. About 20% of the achilles
      tendinopathy injuries occur in the insertion point of the achilles tendon into the calcaneus
      bone1. The leading theories for the mechanism of the disorder are inflammatory response or
      mechanical tendon overuse. Still, the exact pathogenesis of Insertional Achilles tendinitis
      (IAT) is unclear, and as so the conservative management of IAT is less successful than the
      management of the Non-insertional tendinopathy. Previous histological description, in an
      unpublished data of the insertion point showed that the main pathologic features were found
      to be in the bone and cartilage tissues. The achilles tendon, in those studies, was almost
      intact. The histological features of the cartilage tissue were advanced degenerative changes,
      which resemble the pathologic changes of Osteoarthritis. This observation encourages to try
      treating IAT with management strategies that showed to be beneficial in OA( OsteoArthritis).
      One of the more acceptable non-surgical methods in treating osteoarthritis is intra-articular
      viscosupplementation injection. The investigators hypothesis, based on the histopathological
      finding, is that viscosupplementation may be a therapeutic option also for individuals with
      IAT. The purpose of this study is to show the impact of Hyalin G-F 20 injection in patients
      with Insertional Achilles tendinitis.
