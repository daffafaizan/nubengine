      study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK of repeat IV doses of RYI-018 in subjects
      with NAFLD. Subjects in each cohort shall be randomized to either RYI-018 or placebo as
      weekly injection for four weeks. The active doses of RYI-018 will be as follows: Cohort 1:
      0.6 mg/kg, Cohort 2: 1.2 mg/kg, and Cohort 3: 2.5 mg/kg. Primary endpoints include safety and
      tolerability. Secondary endpoints include pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity.
