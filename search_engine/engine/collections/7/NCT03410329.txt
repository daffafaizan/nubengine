      training and a restricted caloric diet on body composition, cardiometabolic risk factors and
      handgrip strength in overweight and obese women. 45 women were randomly assigned to one of
      two groups: a group with a high-weekly frequency of three times a week (HIGH) and a group
      that performed only one weekly session (LOW).HbA1c, percentage of fat mass and handgrip
      strength were taken before and after the intervention period.
