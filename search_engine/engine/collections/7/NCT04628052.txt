      Colorectal cancer is the third most common diagnosed cancer in the United States and is
      second only to lung cancer in number of deaths. Widespread adoption of colorectal cancer
      screening has resulted in earlier detection as well as reduction in mortality. Colonoscopy,
      compared to other methods of screening has additional benefit in its ability to prevent the
      development of colon cancer through removal of precancerous polyps.Besides it being
      considered the gold standard for colorectal cancer screening, colonoscopy is an essential
      tool for diagnostic evaluation for a wide range of gastrointestinal complaints.Despite the
      proven success of colorectal cancer screening programs and public understanding of its
      importance, there remains a gap in adherence. In a recent study, about 64% of eligible
      patients received CRC screening within the past 10 years, which is far behind the "80% by
      2018"target. Besides colonoscopy, alternative tools have been developed in an effort to
      improve adherence to screening including fecal immunochemical testing and fecal DNA testing.
      However, these tests still have low sensitivity for advanced adenomas of 24% and 42%,
      respectively, and lack the added benefit of colonoscopy for prevention of development of
      colon cancer.Patients often experience feelings of anxiety and anticipated discomfort both
      prior to and during the procedure; one study reported greater than 50% of patients have
      moderate to severe anxiety about undergoing the procedure. These concerns regarding an
      anticipated unpleasant experience deter some patients for whom the procedure is indicated
      from undergoing this valuable test.Sedation is administered during the procedure to alleviate
      patient discomfort, but this is associated with potential adverse effects, especially if
      increasing doses are required in response to increased discomfort or anxiety.Sources of
      patient anxiety about colonoscopy include the necessary bowel preparation,fear of
      embarrassment, pain, potential complications, sedation, and the potential of a diagnosis of
      cancer.This anxiety can increase pain perception in patients: a key predictor of pain during
      colonoscopy is a patient's pre-procedural anxiety level.This anxiety and pain can manifest in
      the need for increased sedation, increased length of procedure, and reduced patient
      satisfaction.One way to improve the patient experience that has been investigated is reduced
      volume bowel preparations. But, prior studies have also suggested that music during a
      colonoscopy can significantly improve patient satisfaction, reduce anxiety and pain, and
      reduce the total sedation medication requirement

      The performance of gastroenterologists is measured by quality factors such as adenoma
      detection rate and adenomas per colonoscopy. A number of techniques have been studied to
      improve these parameters, including use of colonoscope caps and second looks on the right
      side of the colon and right-sided retroflexion. Additionally, prior studies have suggested
      improvement from music being played in the endoscopy suite. An intervention that is
      inexpensive and without adverse effects that can potentially improve the patient experience
      and as a consequence hypothetically adherence to screening programs, and improve endoscopist
      performance, would be expected to be widely adopted. Yet, use of music during colonoscopy is
      inconsistent and there are no society guidelines or recommendations regarding its use.
      Potential reasons for this include a sense of a lack of adequate body of evidence and
      inconsistency in the method of administration.The investigators aim to provide more
      convincing data to support or refute the benefit of music during colonoscopy to aid the
      decision on whether routinely offering music during the procedure should be considered a
      standard of care.

      Objectives/Aims:

      The investigators' aim is to assess whether playing music during a colonoscopy procedure
      improves the patient experience and willingness to undergo the procedure again(measured on a
      Likert scale), improves endoscopist performance (as measured by adenoma detection rate and
      time to reach cecum), and reduces the mean dose of sedatives required during the procedure
      (both midazolam and fentanyl).Secondary endpoints include reduction in pain,total procedure
      time, and withdrawal time.The delay between the time the procedure was scheduled for and the
      time the procedure actually commenced will also be measured, as long delays are a not
      uncommon occurrence that can separately negatively impact the patient experience and
      therefore this variable maybe used for post-hoc analysis. The investigators anticipate the
      study to take place over the course of 1 year.
