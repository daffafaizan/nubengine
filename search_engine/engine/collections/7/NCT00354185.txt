      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of PXD101 and 17-AAG administered to patients with
      refractory solid tumor malignancies.

      II. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase II dose of PXD101 and
      17-AAG in patients with refractory solid tumor malignancies.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of PXD101 and 17-AAG in patients receiving this
      combination.

      II. To evaluate the antitumor activity of this combination, per tumor measurements using the
      RECIST criteria.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the effect of treatment with PXD101 and 17-AAG on the transcriptional
      upregulation of targeted genes in tumor and surrogate tissue (PBMCs) by means of RTPCR and
      incorporation of the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay.

      II. To evaluate the effect of this combination treatment on the post translational
      modification of histones from tumor and surrogate tissue (PBMCs).

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive 17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) IV over 2 hours on days 1,
      4, 8, and 11 and PXD101 IV over 30 minutes on days 1-5. Courses repeat every 21 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of 17-AAG and PDX101 until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2
      of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Up to 12 patients are treated at
      the MTD.

      Patients undergo blood collection on days 1 and 4 of course 1 for pharmacokinetic studies.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 36 patients will be accrued for this study.
