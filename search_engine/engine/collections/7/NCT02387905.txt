      I. To assess whether prophylactic cement augmentation reduces new or progressive vertebral
      body fracture at 3 months in high risk patients undergoing single fraction spine stereotactic
      radiosurgery.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the impact of prophylactic cement augmentation on time to first new or
      progressive vertebral body fracture.

      II. To assess the impact of prophylactic cement augmentation on pain control measured every
      three months post treatment.

      III. To assess the impact of prophylactic cement augmentation on quality of life measured
      every three months post treatment.

      IV. To estimate local control in each arm. V. To estimate overall survival in each arm. VI.
      To document and assess post-treatment adverse side effects between the two arms.

      VI. To document and assess the relationship between radiographic vertebral body fracture,
      pain control and quality of life.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients undergo stereotactic spinal radiosurgery per standard of care.

      ARM II: Patients undergo vertebral body cement augmentation within 4 weeks before or after
      standard stereotactic spinal radiosurgery.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years.
