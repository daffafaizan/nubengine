      minimally invasive techniques have been demonstrated to be associated with superior outcomes
      compared with lobectomy by thoracotomy. the us of segmentectomy is under investigation for
      selected patients with small tumors, and the use of minimally invasive strategies is
      applicable as well.

      This nationwide, multicenter, prospective, randomized open phase III study of cVATS (complete
      Video-assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery) segmentectomy versus Lobectomy for stage IA non-small
      cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with Lung adenocarcinoma in situ or with microinvasion, is
      aiming to evaluate the relapse free survival and 5 year overall survival (OS) rate of two
      types of surgery. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo cVATS lobectomy.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo cVATS segmentectomy.

      Patients will be followed up every 3 months within the first year, and annually for 5 years
      postoperatively.
