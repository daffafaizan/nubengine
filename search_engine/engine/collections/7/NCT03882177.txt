      adjunctive therapy when combined with the standard TB treatment regimen in adults with
      drug-sensitive TB. The pharmacokinetic data for pravastatin will be used to choose a dose to
      be studied as adjunctive TB treatment in subsequent trials.

      This study is a dose-escalation trial, and participants will be sequentially enrolled into
      four study arms. Participants will receive standard anti-TB therapy (Rifafour) and
      pravastatin daily for 14 days. Pravastatin will be given alone on Day 1, and pravastatin +
      Rifafour will be given on Days 2-15.

      Total study duration for participants will be 30 days, during which time participants will
      attend several study visits. Study visits may include sputum specimen collection, blood and
      urine collection, lung function testing, and pharmacokinetic assessments. All study
      participants will be referred appropriately to continue standard TB treatment at study
      completion.
