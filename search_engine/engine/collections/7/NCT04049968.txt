      death over the past 33 years, and the incidence of an increase in oral cancer year by year.
      The average age of death was 55-57. With this average age compared to other cancer patients
      under 10 years of early life, it's necessary to care about the burden of disease from oral
      cancer. The main treatment of oral cancer is surgery and a combination of radiotherapy and
      chemotherapy. Patients often got severe treatment complications with varying degrees of
      physical functions and uncertainty due to poor cognition or less clarification in a complex
      course of treatment that affects medical decisions in the illness process. Both domestic and
      foreign research show that the majority of oral cancer patients expressed the need for and
      attention to health information. "Treatment information" was the most needed and important.
      When information needs are met, it can effectively reduce the anxiety and unease of unknown
      events. Relevant domestic and foreign research do not provide accessibility and convenience
      of health education for post-operative patients with oral cancer.
