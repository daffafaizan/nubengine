    
      A randomized study is planned for 5 years to evaluate the effectiveness of the Therapeutic
      Workplace in promoting methadone treatment and abstinence in unemployed injection drug users.
      Participants will be recruited through street outreach, at agencies that serve the target
      populations, and informal word-of-mouth referrals. Participants will be invited to attend the
      workplace and to enroll in the methadone treatment. To engage participants in the workplace,
      they will be allowed to work independent of whether they enroll in methadone treatment and
      independent of their drug use. The workplace participants (N=162) will be randomly assigned
      to three groups. The "Usual Care Control" participants will be allowed to work independent of
      their methadone use or urinalysis results. The "Methadone Contingency" participants will be
      required to take methadone to attend work, and will receive a brief pay decrease for failing
      to take their medication. The "Methadone & Abstinence Contingency" participants will be
      required to take their medication in order to attend work, as well as receive a brief pay
      decrease for any positive urine samples for both cocaine and methadone.
