      populations.

      A Danish project called 'Exercise on Prescription' (EoP) is implemented in primary
      healthcare. Patients eligible for EoP are non-institutionalised adults with medically
      controlled lifestyle diseases or risk factors of lifestyle diseases, who are motivated to
      change lifestyle, able to improve health status through a physical active lifestyle, and
      willing to pay a fee of â‚¬100 for the intervention.

      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect on: 1) Self-efficacy, 2) Readiness to
      change, 3) Decisional balance, 4) physical activity level, and 5) health related quality of
      life.

      The EoP-group is compared to an intervention group receiving only motivational counselling.
