      and drainage of cutaneous abscesses (1-4). Despite this, there are no randomized controlled
      trials that demonstrate the benefit of irrigation in treatment of these abscesses. Potential
      disadvantages of irrigation include increased procedural time, pain, increased cost with
      sterile irrigation solutions and materials to capture the irrigation effluent, and increased
      risk of microbiologic contamination of the surrounding area. The goal of this study is to
      examine patients undergoing incision and drainage of cutaneous abscesses to determine if
      irrigation of the abscess cavity affects the need for further interventions.
