    
      Amyloidosis is a disorder of protein folding in which normally soluble proteins are deposited
      as abnormal, insoluble fibrils that progressively disrupt tissue structure and impair
      function. The treatment of systemic AL amyloidosis has evolved to a risk adapted approach
      based on the end organ damage, particularly cardiac involvement, and the functional status of
      the patient. Intensive therapies like high dose melphalan followed by an autologous stem cell
      transplant are considered for patients with limited organ involvement, younger age and
      excellent functional status.

      The majority of patients with AL amyloidosis, however, will not be candidates for ASCT and
      are generally treated with combination chemotherapy. This therapy may include bortezomib, a
      proteasome inhibitor which is particularly effective in AL amyloidosis but which may have a
      severe side-effect profile.

      Carfilzomib is specific for the chymotrypsin-like active site of the 20S proteasome, is
      structurally and mechanistically distinct from bortezomib, and has demonstrated less
      reactivity against non-proteasomal proteases when compared to bortezomib. It also appears to
      be better tolerated. However, information regarding the use of carfilzomib in the treatment
      of AL amyloidosis is limited.

      In the dose escalation phase of this study, a minimum of 6 (3 at dose level 0 and 3 at dose
      level -1)and a maximum of 18 (6 at dose level 0, 1, and 2) patients will recruited in a 3+3
      design with cohorts of between 3 and 6 patients, in order to determine maximum tolerated dose
      and recommended dose.

      At the recommended dose level identified, a further 20 (minimum) patients will be recruited
      to further assess safety and toxicities at the RD.
