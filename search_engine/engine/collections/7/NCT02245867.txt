      reducing production of the amyloid-forming light-chain protein by giving conventional or
      high-dose (with stem cell transplant) anti-plasma cell chemotherapy, as used for patients
      with multiple myeloma. Although this approach has extended survival, the prognosis remains
      poor due to the persistence or progression of the amyloid deposits in vital organs, such as
      the heart or kidney. A different treatment strategy would be to attempt to reduce and/or
      eliminate these deposits. This study evaluates this by administering an anti-amyloid
      monoclonal antibody, 11-1F4. This compound has been shown to reduce/destroy this material in
      an experimental animal model of amyloidosis.
