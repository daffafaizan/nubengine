    
      Sixteen (16) subjects per dose group who have received a minimum of 3 and no more than 7
      doses of an anti-VEGF agent (i.e., Lucentis or Avastin), and whose PED has not decreased by
      greater than 25% in height despite therapy, will be enrolled for a total of 32 subjects. The
      presence of PED diagnosed by the Investigator will be confirmed by SDOCT, ICG and FA by a
      digital imaging reading center prior to subject enrollment. The ability of iSONEP to induce
      regression of persistent PED in subjects with exudative AMD or PCV despite previous treatment
      with an anti-VEGF agent will be evaluated.
