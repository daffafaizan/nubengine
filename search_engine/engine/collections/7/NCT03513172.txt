    
      A total of 55 consecutive patients undergoing anti-VEGF intravitreal injections (received ≥1
      treatments) for age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic macular edema (DME) or
      macula edema secondary to branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) will be prospectively
      recruited between December 2016 and July 2017. Patients will be randomly assigned based on a
      pre-determined allocation sequence to receive topical brimonidine tartrate 0.15% (Alphagan®
      P; Allergan, Inc) during either the first or second of two consecutive visits. A standard
      protocol for sterile preparation with topical 5% povidone-iodine solution will be followed.
      Pre-injection IOP measurements will be recorded prior to the instillation of dilating agents
      and brimonidine tartrate. A total of three IOP measurements will be taken by certified
      ophthalmic technicians at immediately after the injection (T0), 10 minutes after (T10) and 20
      minutes after (T20) injection.
