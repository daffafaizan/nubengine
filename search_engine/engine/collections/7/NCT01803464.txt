      past 10 years. The investigators have found that bone structure is markedly underdeveloped
      and bone strength is severely compromised in children with CP. Also, an increased fracture
      rate has been observed in the lower extremity bones of children with CP. There is evidence
      that Botox, which is used to treat spasticity in CP, can improve motor function; however the
      effect of Botox on human bone is unknown. There is also evidence that low magnitude vibration
      treatment can improve bone mass and bone structure. The overall goal of this current research
      study is to investigate the effect and mechanism of action of Botox and vibration on bone in
      children with CP. The investigators will also examine the effect of Botox on muscle volume.

      A total of 36 participants will participate in this study. The investigators will assess bone
      structure and muscle volume using MRI. The investigators will assess bone mass using
      dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA).
