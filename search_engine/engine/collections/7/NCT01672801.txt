      subjects will receive Clomid 100 mg for 5 days for the purpose of ovarian follicle
      recruitment. Intervention will be initiated once ovarian follicle maturation has been
      documented (≥1 ovarian follicle size of ≥ 17mm) and the absence of a premature LH surge has
      been confirmed - this will be classified as intervention day 0. Subjects will receive their
      assigned comparator (Placebo or Active) according the schedule below:

        -  Intervention Day 0 - noon / afternoon / bedtime (3 doses)

        -  Intervention Day 1 - morning / noon / afternoon / bedtime (4 doses)

        -  Intervention Day 2 - morning (1 dose) Serum hormone levels and ultrasound examination
           will occur on days 0,1 and 2 for all subjects.
