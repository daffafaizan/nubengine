      combination with docetaxel for previously treated, advanced KRAS mutant non-small cell lung
      cancer (NSCLC). It is a single-arm, non-blinded study, which will compare safety and outcomes
      with historical controls (docetaxel monotherapy). The multi-center study will be conducted
      within the Academic Thoracic Oncology Medical Investigator Consortium (ATOMIC).
