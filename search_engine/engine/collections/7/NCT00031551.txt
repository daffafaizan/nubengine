      pilot study is to demonstrate the effectiveness of planned laboratory techniques to assess
      for TNF-alpha gene expression from unstimulated saliva, plasma, and mucosal epithelial cells
      in patients who have chemotherapy-related stomatitis.

      Main Study Description: Stomatitis is defined as inflammation of the mucous membranes of the
      oral cavity and oropharynx characterized by tissue erythema, edema, and atrophy, often
      progressing to ulceration. Stomatitis is a biologically complex, multifactorial, cancer
      treatment-related oral condition experienced by many oncology patients, which often leads to
      a cascade of negative sequelae including oropharyngeal pain, critical treatment alterations
      or cessation, and decreased quality of life. The optimal treatment strategies for stomatitis
      have not been established. There is a critical need to examine the pathogenesis of and to
      evaluate interventions for stomatitis and related acute oropharyngeal pain in the randomized
      controlled clinical trial setting using valid and reliable stomatitis assessment tools to
      both advance the science of cancer treatment-related oral toxicities and improve patient
      care. Therefore, the purpose of this randomized controlled clinical trial is to elucidate the
      role of inflammation in stomatitis by testing the effects of a novel tumor necrosis factor
      (TNF) fusion protein etanercept, (Enbrel) (Registered Trademark), Immunex Corporation,
      Seattle, WA) on the incidence and severity of stomatitis. The actions of this fusion protein,
      which binds specifically to TNF preventing its interaction with cellular receptors and
      altering the inflammatory cascade, may provide insight into the role of inflammation in
      stomatitis. An etanercept effect is defined as a prevention or amelioration of stomatitis and
      acute oropharyngeal pain and/or changes in levels of tissue mediators. If stomatitis is
      primarily a consequence of a mucosal inflammatory response, then we hypothesize that this
      oral condition will be responsive to binding of TNFa. Elaboration of the role of inflammatory
      cell signaling associated with stomatitis and the effect of TNFa may elucidate the mechanisms
      related to the pathogenesis of stomatitis and to other mucosal conditions.

      Patients who are scheduled to receive autologous or allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell or
      bone marrow transplant will be invited to participate in this study during a regularly
      scheduled pre-treatment visit. Written informed consent will be obtained from all
      participants. Patients will be randomized to receive either etanercept 2.5mg in 20cc
      mouthwash or placebo 20cc mouthwash, which will both be administered by protocol schedule.
      Stomatitis and oropharyngeal pain will be measured at baseline and at specified
      post-chemotherapy time points corresponding with the predicted stomatitis onset, peak, and
      healing time course. TNFa levels in buccal mucosa, analyzed by real time polymerase chain
      reaction techniques, and blood levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, growth factors, and
      inflammatory mediators will also be measured at baseline and at specified post-chemotherapy
      time points corresponding with the predicted stomatitis onset, peak, and healing time course.
