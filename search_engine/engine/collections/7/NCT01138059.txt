    
      1. Study design: A prospective multicenter trial

        2. Study centers: 6 participating medical centers in South Korea

        3. Participants: Consecutive patients with acute ischemic stroke visiting the emergency
           room within 6 hours of the detection of stroke symptoms

        4. Methods

             -  3 thrombolysis protocols applicable to UnCLOS patients

                  1. IV tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) : Conventional intravenous tPA (0.9
                     mg/kg, 10% of the dose as a bolus and the remainder over 60 minutes) will be
                     administered to patients within 3 hours of first found abnormal time who had
                     no arterial occlusion or catheter-inaccessible occlusion.

                  2. IV tPA + IA urokinase protocol : Combined intravenous tPA (0.6 mg/kg, 10% of
                     the dose as a bolus and the remainder over 30 minutes) with intra-arterial
                     urokinase will be administered to those within 3 hours from first found
                     abnormal time who had catheter-accessible arterial occlusion.

                  3. IA UK protocol : Intra-arterial urokinase will be given to those between 3 and
                     6 hours after first found abnormal time who had catheter-accessible arterial
                     occlusion.

        5. Outcome variables

             -  Safety outcomes Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) within 48 hours from
                thrombolytic therapy.

             -  Efficacy outcomes

                  1. Long-term clinical outcomes (modified Rankin Scale) at 3 months

                  2. Secondary efficacy outcomes : Good vs. Poor outcomes according to mRS
                     responder analysis, Early neurological improvement, Immediate and 5-day
                     recanalization on MRA or CTA
