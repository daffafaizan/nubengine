      Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved this daily medication (comprised of one pill) to
      reduce the risk of sexually acquired HIV in adults at high risk. Other medical practices to
      avoid transmission within this population include assisted reproductive technologies such as
      sperm washing (or donated sperm) coupled with in vitro fertilization, intracytoplasmic sperm
      injection (an in vitro procedure where a single sperm is injected directly into an egg), and
      intrauterine insemination (placing the sperm directly into the uterus). However, these
      methods are costly and often regionally scarce. PrEP is more accessible and a less expensive
      option for couples. When used consistently and as prescribed, PrEP has shown to significantly
      reduce the risk of HIV infection among adult men and women. However, risk reduction
      counseling and clinical monitoring are necessary for its effective implementation. Therefore,
      beyond efficacy trials, it is important to conduct additional studies of pre-exposure
      prophylaxis to observe what factors make PrEP feasible and acceptable to couples, as well as
      identify other factors that impact level of adherence. The study will take place in four U.S.
      cities: Boston, Baltimore, Philadelphia, and San Francisco and will involve couples who have
      chosen to begin PrEP for conception as part of their clinical care after receiving
      preconception counseling and reviewing their options with their health care provider.
