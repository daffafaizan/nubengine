    
      Patients will be included if they are in stable remission with a prednisone at the lower
      stable dose to maintain remission with or without azathioprine , Budesonide with or without
      azathioprine or azathioprine alone for at least 24 months.

      Patient will be switch from standard of care to treatment with Cannabidiol for 12 months.
      They will receive increasing doses of Cannabidiol over a period of one month. Dosage will
      start at 25 mg Cannabidiol twice a day and will be increased every seven days, if no side
      effects are observed, to 50 mg, 100 mg and finally to 150 mg Cannabidiol twice a day
      respectively, as detailed below.

      At the end of this month, if the 150 mg twice a day dose level is deemed safe for one week,
      the standard of care will be stopped at once and patients will continue receiving only
      Cannabidiol 150 mg twice a day for an additional period of 11 months.

      The patient will be offered to undergo liver biopsy in the screening period to prove
      histological remission along with the biochemical remission (not mandatory for inclusion).

      After 12 months of treatment with Cannabidiol all patient will undergo liver biopsy for
      confirmation of histological remission and then the treatment will be stopped as for
      physician decision and guidelines of treatment of autoimmune hepatitis disease.

      In any case of flare defined as elevation in liver enzymes and immunoglobulins in consecutive
      blood test the patient will reintroduced for standard of care treatment at a dosage as of
      investigator decision and the Cannabidiol will be discontinued.

      The patient will be withdrawn from the study but will continue follow up until returning to
      stable inactive disease as define as normalization of liver enzymes and immunoglobulin level
      in consecutive blood tests.
