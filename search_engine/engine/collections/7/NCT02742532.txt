    
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether intra-nasally administered oxytocin will
      decrease craving to use alcohol and stress reactivity following exposure to
      laboratory-induced stress among Active Duty Service Members (AD SMs) with a dual diagnosis of
      alcohol/substance use disorder (ASUD) and post-traumatic anxiety (i.e., PTSD or anxiety
      disorder NOS).

      This is a 2-arm placebo controlled study. Subjects will complete a battery of self-report
      questionnaires and behavioral interviews. Baseline assessments of subjective (craving,
      stress), physiologic (HR, BP), and neuroendocrine measures (salivary cortisol) will be
      collected. These same assessments will be repeatedly collected throughout the testing portion
      of the study. Subjects will receive acute administration of intra-nasal oxytocin or placebo
      and will then be exposed to a laboratory-induced social stressor. They will be asked to give
      a short speech and perform arithmetic in front of a panel of judges. Following the task,
      additional post-task assessments of the subjective, physiological, and neuroendocrine
      measures will be completed over the next hour.
