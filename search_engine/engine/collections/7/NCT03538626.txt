    
      Study Design:

      This is the first study in healthy adults of the N6LS monoclonal antibody (MAb). It is a
      dose-escalation study to examine safety, tolerability, dose, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of
      N6LS administered intravenously (IV) and subcutaneously (SC) to healthy adults. For SC
      administration, N6LS will be administered alone or coadministered with the permeation
      enhancer rHuPH20 enzyme. Primary hypotheses are that N6LS administration to healthy adults
      will be safe by the IV and SC routes, alone and with rHuPH20 coadministration. A secondary
      hypothesis is that all N6LS administrations will be detectable in human sera with a definable
      half-life

      Product Description:

      N6LS (VRC-HIVMAB091-00-AB ) is a human MAb targeted to the HIV-1 CD4 binding site. It was
      developed by the VRC/NIAID/NIH and manufactured under current Good Manufacturing Practice
      (cGMP) regulations at the VRC Vaccine Pilot Plant operated under contract by the Vaccine
      Clinical Materials Program (VCMP), Leidos Biomedical Research, Inc., Frederick, MD. The
      product is provided as a sterile aqueous buffered solution in 10 mL glass vials at a
      concentration of 100 mg/mL and volume of 6.25 mL.

      Each vial of ENHANZETM Drug Product (EDP) contains 0.5 mL of rHuPH20 formulated at a
      concentration of 1 mg/mL (approximately 110,000 U/mL rHuPH20). rHuPH20 is a tissue
      permeability modifier that depolymerizes hyaluronan (HA), increasing the dispersion of a
      substance into the subcutaneous space, which enables SC delivery of co administered antibody
      (-ies) at higher dose volumes (e.g., >10 mL) that cannot be administered quickly without
      rHuPH20. EDP is manufactured by Ajinomoto Althea, Inc, (San Diego, CA) for Halozyme
      Therapeutics, Inc. (San Diego, CA) and is supplied in 2 mL glass vials as a sterile,
      single-dose, injectable liquid.

      Subjects:

      Healthy adults, 18-50 years of age.

      Study Plan:

      This open-label study includes 8 dose groups to assess N6LS alone given as a single IV
      infusion at the 5, 20, or 40 mg/kg dose level (Groups 1, 3,4); a single SC injection at the 5
      mg/kg dose level (Group 2); or in 3 administrations, spaced 12 weeks apart by SC injection at
      the 5 mg/kg dose level (Group 5), or by IV infusion at the 20 mg/kg dose level (Group 6). Two
      additional groups will assess N6LS given as a single SC injection mixed with rHuPH20 (2000
      U/mL) at 5 mg/kg (Group 7) or 20 mg/kg (Group 8) doses. Enrollment opened with Groups 1, 2
      and 5; and was followed by the sequential activation of Groups 3, 4, and 6. With
      implementation of the two SC N6LS+ rHuPH20 arms as a protocol amendment, Group 7 will open
      first to accrual, followed by Group 8.

      Study Duration:

      Study participation will be approximately 24 weeks for subjects in Groups 1 to 4, 7 and 8;
      and 48 weeks for subjects in Groups 5 and 6.
