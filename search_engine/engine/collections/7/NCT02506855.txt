      transversus abdominis plane block under direct view. In this pilot study involving
      gynecologic patients undergoing open (abdominal wall incision either vertically or
      horizontally) hysterectomy or other related gynecologic surgery, the investigators will use
      ropivacaine versus saline for the placebo control group, which in both groups involves
      injection of agent directly into the appropriate fascial layers prior to abdominal wall
      closure. Efficacy is to be assessed via measurement of pain scores, nausea and vomiting, and
      opioid consumption in both participant groups. The number of dermatomes which are blocked in
      both participant groups during the first 24 hours following surgery will be recorded.
