      and 78000 deaths / year are linked to a pathology attributable to this addiction. In
      addition, active consumption of cigarettes is a destabilizing factor for chronic respiratory
      diseases. During hospitalization for acute respiratory illness, evaluation of smoking
      cessation remains declarative. Although stopping advice and possibly nicotine replacement
      therapy are prescribed, no objective measure of smoking is performed to assess the adequacy
      of this attitude.

      This project aims to objectively evaluate smoking during hospitalization by measuring twice
      daily exhaled CO. The impact of this intervention on the duration of hospitalization and
      smoking 3m after initial admission will also be evaluated. Tobacco consumption patterns based
      on reason for hospital admission and background pathology will be highlighted.

      Secondary objectives include:

        -  To measure the impact of expired CO measurement during hospitalization on the smoking
           status 1 month and 3 months after initial admission.

        -  To determine smoking patterns during hospitalization according to reason for admission
           and background pathology.

        -  To measure the effect of iterative CO measurement on the duration of stays.

        -  To measure and compare the quality of life of patients.

        -  To study the variability of expired CO measurements.
