    
      Famitinib Malate is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor mainly targeting vascular endothelial growth
      factor receptor 2(VEGFR2), and its anti-angiogenesis effect has been viewed in preclinical
      tests. The investigators' phase I study has shown that the drug's toxicity is manageable and
      the recommended phase II dose is 25 mg. The hypothesis of this clinical research study is to
      discover if the study drug Famitinib Malate can shrink or slow the growth of pretreated
      HER2-negative breast cancer. The safety of Famitinib Malate will also be studied. Patients
      physical state, symptoms, changes in the size of the tumor, and laboratory findings obtained
      while on-study will help the research team decide if Famitinib Malate is safe and effective
      in pretreated HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer patients.
