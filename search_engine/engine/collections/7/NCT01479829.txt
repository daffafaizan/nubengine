      well-known antidepressant, escitalopram (ESC), in combination with the anti-inflammatory
      agent, celecoxib (CBX). The investigators hypothesize that combination treatment will lead to
      a qualitatively and quantitatively augmented response and will result in greater numbers of
      remitters compared to ESC monotherapy.
