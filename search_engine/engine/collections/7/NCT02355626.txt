      will be assessed at admission.

      Within the first 12 hours, and at day 4 and day 7, anxiety will be assessed by the STAI
      scale, Geriatric Anxiety Inventory (GAI) scale, and a specific questionnaire assessing
      anxiety in the intensive care (REAX). Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) scoring for anxiety,
      starvation, thirst, pain and dyspnoea will be collected daily. Anxiety and depression will be
      evaluated by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) on day 7. Patients will be
      assessed by psychologists or trained doctors, the team in charge of the patient will not be
      aware of the result of this evaluation.

      Clinical and biological data regarding the hemodynamic, neurological, respiratory and renal
      status will be collected from admission to day 7, as well as parameters required for
      computing the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score.
