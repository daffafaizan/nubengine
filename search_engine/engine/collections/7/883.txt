plasma growth hormone concentration in the rat determined byradioimmunoassay: influence of sex, pregnancy, lactation, anesthesia,hypophysectomy and extrasellar pituitary transplants.the assay used is described in detail.  several experimentalconditions were studied, both to validate themethod and to determine factors which regulate gh secretionin this species.  in fasting sprague-dawley ratsweighing 150-200 g, mean plasma gh concentration infemales was 94.2 17.3, and in males, 54.9 12.0 m g/ml.gh levels in lactating rats were determined to be inthe normal range for females, thereby providing evidencethat this assay does not detect prolactin.  gh levels werenot elevated in pregnant rats.  hypophysectomy led to afall below detectable levels of gh.  intraocular pituitarytransplants failed to raise gh levels in hypophysectomizedhosts.  gh levels in male, but not in female, ratsare depressed by brief periods of ether anesthesia.  thesefindings and the results of pituitary transplantation experimentsare further evidence that the nervous systemis involved in the regulation of gh secretion.
