      since they appear to be safe and usually add little additional cost.

      Using a computer model, a new dual-stage septal pacing has been developed.The proposed septal
      pacing algorithm could suppress AF reentries in a more robust way than classical single site
      rapid pacing. The feasibility of pacing both atria simultaneously from a single lead placed
      in the interatrial septum has been previously demonstrated clinically. The septal pacing
      concept has also been successfully tested in a computer model of AF and in a pig model .
      Experimental studies are now needed to determine whether similar termination mechanisms and
      efficacies can be observed in humans.

      The purpose of this non-randomized, non-controlled, acute, single-arm research study is to
      evaluate the feasibility to obtain a stable position of a ring of stimulation electrodes on
      the interatrial septum
