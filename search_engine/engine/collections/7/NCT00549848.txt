    
      Details of the Treatment Plan:

      Treatment will consist of three main phases: Remission Induction, Consolidation, and
      Continuation.

        1. Remission Induction

             -  Intrathecal Treatment during Induction

           Frequency and total number of triple intrathecal treatments for Remission Induction is
           based on the patient's risk of CNS relapse.All patients will receive triple intrathecal
           treatment on days 1 and 15. Patients with high risk features may receive additional
           triple intrathecal treatment on days 4, 8, 11, and 22.[t(1;19)/E2A-PBX1.

           Induction treatment will begin with prednisone, vincristine, daunorubicin,
           PEG-asparaginase and triple intrathecal treatment, followed by cyclophosphamide plus
           cytarabine plus thioguanine.

           Remission Induction Chemotherapy (6-7 weeks) Prednisone 40 mg/m2/day PO (divided t.i.d.)
           Days 1 - 28 Dexamethasone will be substituted for prednisone in patients with early
           T-cell precursor (ETP) immunophenotype.

           Mercaptopurine will be substituted for thiopurine in TPMT HET/deficient patients

           - Reintensification

           Patients with high-risk leukemia may receive reintensification therapy and then will be
           offered the option of transplant. This treatment will attempt to maximize leukemic cell

      Drug Dosages, Schedules and Routes for Continuation Therapy from Week 21 to End of Therapy:

      Mercaptopurine 75 mg/m2 PO daily for 7 days, Days 1-7. Methotrexate 40 mg/m2 IV or
      intramuscularly (IM) Day 1. Cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m2 IV, Day 1. Cytarabine 300 mg/m2 IV,
      Day 1. Dexamethasone 12 mg/m2 (std/high risk) or 8 mg/m2 (low risk) PO daily (divided t.i.d.)
      for 5 days, Day 1-5 (between week 21 and week 68).Decrease dexamethasone to 6 mg/m2 PO daily
      (divided t.i.d.) x 5 days,Day 1-5 between week 69 and week 101 for all risk groups.

      Vincristine2 mg/m2 IV push (max 2 mg), Day 1 (0.05mg/kg for patients < 1 year or < 10 kg).

      PEG-ASP 2,500 vs 3,500 units/m2 IV randomization (until week 30)

      Dexamethasone, vincristine, and asparaginase will be given regardless of blood counts,
      provided that the patient is clinically well. Cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, mercaptopurine
      and methotrexate will be held if WBC <1000/mm3 or ANC <300/mm3. Mercaptopurine and
      methotrexate will be reduced for WBC < 1500/mm3, or if WBC and ANC do not increase by at
      least 2 folds a week after the start date of dexamethasone pulse. Doses of cyclophosphamide
      and cytarabine may need to be reduced if patient misses 25% of chemotherapy and if the low
      counts deem to be related to this combination.

      The same treatment (weeks 30-37) will be repeated for a total of 5 times, until week 69 (see
      Section 5.5.3 for intrathecal therapy). After week 69, all patients will receive daily
      mercaptopurine and weekly methotrexate interrupted with pulses of dexamethasone, vincristine,
      and mercaptopurine every 4 weeks. The dose of dexamethasone will be decreased to 6 mg/m2
      between week 69 and week 101, after which only mercaptopurine and methotrexate will be given.
      Intrathecal treatment will be given every 8 weeks only to patients at risk of CNS relapse
      after week 49 and will be discontinued after week 97. Continuation therapy will be
      discontinued after 120 weeks.

      Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (for patients who meet the criteria of high-risk ALL
      are candidates for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation). However, if the
      option is declined by the patients or guardians, or the procedure is deemed unsuitable by the
      attending physician and the principal investigator, the patient will remain on study and
      continue to receive chemotherapy.
