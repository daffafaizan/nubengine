      response to therapy. MEP and SSEP contributes significantly to the predictive value of mmEP.
      The variability of MEP and SSEP has limited its use in multicenter clinical trials. Recent
      technological advances and standardization of procedures has decreased the variability. The
      objective of this study is to evaluate the reliability of MEP and SSEP and feasibility of
      performing MEP and SSEP in an international, multicenter setting. Establishment of the
      reliability and feasibility of MEP and SSEP will allow for further development of this
      predictive biomarker in future clinical trials.
