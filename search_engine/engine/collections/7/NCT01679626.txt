    
      Cricoid pressure (CP) and the backward-upward-rightward pressure (BURP) manoeuver, are
      extralaryngeal manoeuvers which are widely applied during endotracheal intubation,
      respectively offering potential protection against passive gastric regurgitation and improved
      laryngeal view in emergency airway management.

      Their validity in achieving an improvement of the laryngeal view has been questioned.

      The objective of this study is to measure the change in mean anterior-posterior rima
      glottidis (APRIMA) distance and mean area under the vocal cords after backward upward
      rightward pressure (BURP) and cricoid pressure (CP).

      The investigators will measure the APRIMA distances and areas under the vocal cords, using a
      specially created module in the program DeVIDE. The measurements assessed during BURP and CP
      will be expressed relative to the measurements when no external pressure is applied.
