      patients with high grade dysplasia(HGD) and/or esophageal cancer(EC) who meet the study
      criteria will be enrolled, undergo a baseline diagnostic EMR and then be randomized in a 1:1
      ratio to undergo treatment by either S-EMR or radiofrequency ablation(RFA). The initial
      staging EMR will not extend more than 50% of the esophageal circumference or more than 2 cm
      in longitudinal extent. Patients in the S-EMR group will undergo step-wise eradication of the
      BE segment using the Duette multi-band mucosectomy kit (Cook Medical, FDA approved) whereas
      those in the RFA group will undergo BE ablation using the endoscopically-guided HALO
      radiofrequency ablation system (Barrx Medical, FDA approved).

      Both treatment groups will undergo their respective treatment sessions every 2 months until
      either no Barrett's esophagus is seen or until a maximum of 4 treatment sessions. Once there
      is no visible Barrett's esophagus, patients will undergo surveillance biopsies (random 4
      quadrant biopsies every 1 cm of the neo-squamous mucosa and random biopsies of the cardia) to
      evaluate for complete eradication of Barrett's esophagus. Regardless of whether there is
      visible Barrett's esophagus, all patients will undergo repeat endoscopy every 2 months for 1
      year after enrollment. If no visible Barrett's esophagus is seen during the endoscopy, then
      surveillance biopsies to evaluate for dysplasia will be taken. Regardless of whether this is
      any visible Barrett's esophagus, all patients will undergo surveillance biopsies at 12 months
      after enrollment.

      The objective of this study is to compare the proportion of patients with complete
      eradication of Barrett's esophagus using S-EMR versus RFA at 12 months.
