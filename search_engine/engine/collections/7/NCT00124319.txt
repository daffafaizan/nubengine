      beneath the thighbone (femur). A hard twist or excessive pressure on the ACL can tear or
      rupture the ligament, resulting in high levels of short-term disability and extensive
      rehabilitation. Previous data indicate that women who participate in sports or who are
      otherwise physically active have higher rates of ACL injury than men; the reason for this is
      unknown. There are four groups of potential risk factors for ACL injury: environmental,
      anatomical, hormonal, and biomechanical or neuromuscular. In particular, poor technique when
      landing from a jump (also known as jump-landing) is proposed as a specific neuromuscular risk
      factor of interest in this study. This study will determine gender-specific anatomical,
      hormonal, and demographic risk factors for ACL injury, as well as quantify gender-specific
      differences in jump-landing technique and other neuromuscular risk factors.

      This observational cohort study will enroll 4,800 cadets at the three large U.S. military
      academies; approximately 50% of those enrolled will be women. Only incoming cadets at the
      U.S. Naval, Air Force, or Military Academies will be able to participate. Each study
      participant will undergo a baseline assessment that will include measurement of neuromuscular
      risk factors using motion analysis, strength testing, and standardized assessment of poor
      jump-landing technique using the Landing Error Score System (LESS). All participants will be
      followed for up to 4 years. ACL injuries will be prospectively identified; an injury
      questionnaire is administered to participants who sustain an ACL injury while they are
      cadets. Otherwise, there is no further contact.
