      with benign or malignant hepatobiliary disease. Liver failure after partial hepatic
      resection, so-called post-resectional liver failure (PLF), is a dreaded complication with
      high mortality rates. Patients suffering from PLF experience significantly more clinically
      significant infections (CSI) when compared with patients without PLF. The liver plays an
      important role in the body's innate immune defense. Recently, polymorphisms in genes encoding
      key molecules in the innate immune response (e.g. nuclear factor kappa-B) have shown to be
      associated with a greater risk of CSI. The presence of these polymorphisms combined with
      partial hepatic resection might render patients susceptible to the development of CSI, PLF
      and early mortality after liver resection.
