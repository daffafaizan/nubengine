           will at this visit fill out a knowledge questionnaire prior to receiving counseling.

        -  Patients will be randomized into standard counseling or standard counseling plus
           educational video using sealed envelopes that have been randomized by a computer
           generator and labeled for example #1 - #100 based on order enrolled in study. The
           envelope will have a piece of paper with video or no video

        -  At the next High risk clinic visit one week later patients randomized to the educational
           video will watch the video on a clinic designated computer after being checked in by
           nursing. They will then fill out the same questionnaire. Patients that are randomized to
           no video will only refill out the questionnaire

        -  English-speaking patients will view the English version of the video, and
           Spanish-speaking patients will view the Spanish version of the video in either English
           or the dubbed Spanish version.

        -  A Spanish version of the patient hand-out will be provided in an amendment, prior to
           their use with Spanish- speaking patients.
