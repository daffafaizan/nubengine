      cluster attack induction following LF (20 Hz and 0.2-2.1 amplitude) and sham (amplitude = 0)
      stimulation in 20 CH patients with implanted SPG neurostimulator. In addition, we measured
      plasma concentrations of pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide-38 (PACAP38) and
      vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), as markers for parasympathetic activation before, during
      and after SPG stimulation. We also investigated if LF SPG stimulation induces changes in
      cardiac autonomic regulation and whether any attacks induced by SPG stimulation are
      associated with such changes.
