      cells. High grade glioma (HGG) refers to grade III and IV gliomas in the central nervous
      system tumor classification of the World Health Organization (WHO), accounting for
      approximately 67% of newly diagnosed cases. The maximum safety resection of the tumor
      followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy is the HGG standard initial treatment strategy.
      However, glioma cells grow aggressively, and most patients will relapse after initial
      treatment. Recurrent high-grade glioma (r-HGG) is difficult to treat, lacking treatment
      standards and having a poor prognosis.

      There is no standard treatment plan for patients with recurrent high-grade cancer. Studies
      have shown that gliomas highly express a variety of pro-angiogenic factors and have a large
      number of abnormally proliferated blood vessels, VEGF especially playing an important role in
      the formation of GBM neovascularization. VEGF is almost not expressed in normal tissues, but
      it is highly expressed (about 96%) in malignant gliomas and surrounding tissues, especially
      VEGF-A is highly expressed in glioblastomas. Therefore, VEGF It can be used as an effective
      target for anti-angiogenesis treatment of malignant glioma.

      Anlotinib hydrochloride is a multi-target receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor that has
      significant inhibitory activity against angiogenesis related kinases such as VEGFR1/2/3,
      FGFR1/2/3, and other tumor related kinases such as PDGFR /, C-Kit, Ret, etc. (e.g., Met,
      FGFR1/2/3).

      Based on the above theory , the purpose of this study was to explore the efficacy and safety
      of anlotinib in treatment of recurrent high-grade glioma.
