    
      -  It is a prospective multicenter clinical study, not controlled, with evaluation of
           clinical variables before and after the intervention (insertion of one or more silicone
           stents in the trachea or bronchi and main or intermediate bronchus by rigid bronchoscopy
           under general anesthesia).

        -  110 patients, both genders, will be followed for one year, total of 8 visits, in order
           to evaluate the safety of the procedure of stent insertion.

      It is allowed to include patients for whom it is indicated the combination of treatments (eg,
      electrocoagulation followed by stent placement) - full anticoagulation or severe disturbance
      of coagulation. (Includes: use of any anticoagulant, by oral, intravenous or subcutaneous
      administration with full intention of coagulation / therapy; coagulopathy with INR> 2.0 or
      aPTT [KTTP]> 1.5 times control or platelet count <50000). Note: The use of antiplatelet drugs
      (aspirin, clopidogrel, ticlopidine) is allowed.

      - The HCPA-1 silicone stent is made of biocompatible silicone, medical grade, via injection
      process in the matrix using different densities of the same material for a set of prostheses
      with rigid and flexible variables; available in the following dimensions (diameter x length
      in mm): 9x30, 9x50, 11x30, 11x50, 13x30, 13x50, 14x30, 14x50, 16x50, 16x70, 18x50 and 18x70.
      Requires specific surgical (applicator) for insertion.
