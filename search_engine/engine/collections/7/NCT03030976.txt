      patients with systemic lupus erythematosus（SLE）.The investigators constructed a 2nd CAR,
      using CD19 as target, using 4-1BB as co-stimulator, and optimized the spatial conformation by
      a suitable hinge and transmembrane domain sequences. The infusion dose is (1-10)E6 CAR
      positive T cells/kg, and the specific cells numbers depends on the situation of individual
      CAR-T cells preparation.
