      diagnosis on the reduction in incidence of new HIV infections in the general population. It
      will be conducted in two phases:

        -  First phase: aiming to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of extensive HIV
           testing and early ARV treatment initiation on a subset of the target population (Hlabisa
           sub-district in KwaZulu Natal, South Africa); completion on February 2014.

        -  Second phase: full implementation of the trial in the target population from May 2014.

      The proposed intervention has two components :

        -  Component 1 "Test": HIV counselling and testing, and comprehensive prevention programme
           among the entire target population

        -  Component 2 "Treat": ART treatment initiation for HIV infected individuals following two
           strategies

             -  control group: ART initiation when eligible for treatment as per WHO guidelines

             -  intervention group: immediate ART initiation regardless of immunological and
                clinical staging
