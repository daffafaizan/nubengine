      longitudinal strain and 3D) and serum biomarkers can detect CV injury early after receipt of
      Chemotherapy, these methods require lengthy and difficult examinations that are not routinely
      executed in community hospitals where the majority of patients with BrC & lymphoma are
      treated. Yet, 1-month deteriorations in traditional 45-min MRI measures are known to forecast
      6-month subclinical deteriorations in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) that are
      associated with CV events. At the same time, new observational data indicate therapy with
      HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors/statins administered early during receipt of Chemotherapy may
      prevent subsequent cardiac dysfunction and CV events. Our MRI fast scanning techniques remedy
      these community hospital implementation obstacles.

      In this proposal, the investigators propose to test the utility of these fast scans within an
      existing funded randomized clinical trial R01HL118740 of generic atorvastatin that is
      researching methods to prevent cardiotoxicity in patients treated with Chemotherapy for BrC
      and lymphoma (taking advantage of significant existing clinical trial resources). This study
      allows us to address our over-arching goal: to determine the optimal implementation (alone or
      in combination with other tests) of our proprietary MRI processes for forecasting CV injury
      in patients treated with Chemotherapy in community hospitals through performance of a Phase
      II comparative effectiveness study within an ongoing clinical trial.
