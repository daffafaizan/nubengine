      disorder. Duvoglustat is designed to act as a pharmacological chaperone of alpha-glucosidase,
      in order to restore enzyme activity. This study consisted of a 28-day screening period, an
      11-week treatment period, and a 1-week follow-up period. Three dosing regimens of oral
      duvoglustat were to be evaluated (Cohort 1: 2.5 g daily for 3 days, followed by no study drug
      for 4 days; Cohort 2: 5 g daily for 3 days, followed by no study drug for 4 days; Cohort 3: 5
      g daily for 7 days, followed by no study drug for 7 days).

      Participants meeting all eligibility criteria underwent physical examination,
      electrocardiogram, spirometry, muscular strength test, functional muscle test, 6-minute walk
      test (when appropriate), laboratory tests, magnetic resonance imaging, and muscle (needle)
      biopsy. Quality of life was assessed via the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey questionnaire.
      Functional ability and level of handicap was assessed by Rotterdam handicap scale.
