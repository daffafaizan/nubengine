    
      This clinical trial "DARALUP" is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of daratumumab,
      a monoclonal antibody directed against CD38, in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus
      (SLE). This is a monocenter, open-label Phase II trial recruting SLE patients with clinical
      and serologic activity despite state-of-the-art immunosuppressive therapy. Treatment in this
      study will be Weekly daratumumab injections over a period of 8 weeks. This study will enroll
      10 patients.

      SLE is a sometimes severe, generalized autoimmune disease with few approved therapies to
      date. Therefore, the planned study offers an opportunity to identify a new, targeted
      therapeutic approach. Daratumumab has been studied in multiple Phase III clinical trials in
      patients with relapsing multiple myeloma, a plasma cell malignancy, where it demonstrated
      efficacy with an acceptable safety profile and has been approved since 2016 under the trade
      name DarzalexÂ®. The aim is to investigate whether daratumumab provides clinically significant
      efficacy in SLE, another disease in which plasma cells have been shown to play a pathogenic
      role. Previous experience by the sponsor of this trial with the use of daratumumab in two
      patients with SLE suggests that one cycle of 4 weekly infusions with 16 mg/kg daratumumab was
      associated with a significant serologic and clinical response. In this study, a dosing
      regimen of 2 cycles of Darzalex is planned, with one cycle containing 4 Weekly injections.
      Based on the previously reported efficacy under anti-CD38 therapy, this human monoclonal
      antibody appears suitable for the therapy of SLE and will be investigated in this study.
