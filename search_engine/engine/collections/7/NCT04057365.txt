      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a
      specific disease. "Investigational" means that the drug is being studied.

      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved DKN-01 as a treatment for any
      disease.

      The FDA has not approved nivolumab for this specific disease but it has been approved for
      other cancers.

      DKN-01 and nivolumab are both antibodies. An antibody is a protein that attaches to other
      cells to fight off infection. DKN-01 is believed to work by attaching to and inhibiting
      (stopping) a specific pathway in the cells that is responsible for processes such as cell
      growth. Nivolumab is believed to work by attaching to and inhibiting a specific protein in
      the cancer that controls parts of the immune system (the system in the body that fights off
      infections and diseases) by shutting down certain immune responses. The investigators believe
      that nivolumab will inhibit the protein, thus allowing the immune cells to recognize and
      destroy cancer cells.
