      non-fatal disease, so safety is a high priority in the choice of treatment. Probiotics is a
      dietary supplement and have no adverse effects. In some studies it has shown beneficial
      effect on some of the IBS patients symptoms, but some of the results are questionable. The
      studies have to be of longer duration, with more patients and the probiotics have to be
      capsules instead of milk based drinks.
