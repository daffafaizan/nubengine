    
      RLY5016-205 was an open-label, randomized, dose ranging study to determine the optimal
      starting dose, efficacy and safety of patiromer in treating hyperkalemia in hypertensive
      patients with nephropathy due to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who were already receiving
      Angiotensin-converting Enzyme Inhibitor (ACEI) and/or Angiotensin II Receptor Blocker (ARB)
      drugs, with or without spironolactone.

      The study consisted of the following periods:

        -  Screening: Up to 10 days (1 visit)

        -  Run-in for those who were not hyperkalemic at screening (Cohorts 1 and 2): up to 4 weeks
           (1 to 4 visits)

        -  Patiromer Treatment Initiation: first 8 weeks of patiromer treatment (a minimum of 10
           visits)

        -  Patiromer Long-Term Maintenance: additional 44 weeks of patiromer treatment up to a
           total of one year (minimum of 11 additional visits)

        -  Follow-up (after patiromer discontinuation): 1 week (2 visits) OR 4 weeks (5 visits)
           depending on the final serum potassium level
