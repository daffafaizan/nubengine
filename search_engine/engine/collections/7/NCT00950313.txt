      self-assessment risk score and a practice data risk score that can be used in a variety of
      setting to detect undiagnosed diabetes and impaired glucose regulation. This is done to
      establish a simple and effective 1st stage screen to identify those people at risk of
      diabetes and engage the public to increase the number of high risk individuals attending
      screening invitations but reducing the overall number of oral glucose tolerance tests. This
      study aims to test in a pragmatic way the use of such tools in a primary care setting
      administered by primary care staff as part of the NHS Health Check programme.
