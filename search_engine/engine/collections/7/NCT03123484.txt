      gefitinib，erlotinib and icotinib demonstrate excellent effect on the treatment of non-small
      cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with EGFR mutations. However, patients who are initially
      sensitive to the drugs eventually become resistance. Beta-elemene, a natural plant drug
      extracted from Curcuma wenyujin, has been used as an antitumor drug for different tumors,
      including NSCLC via mechanism that inhibits Ras/Mapk signaling and cell cycle progression.In
      this study, the investigators aim to explore the efficacy of beta-elemene, combining with
      EGFR-TKI in advanced non-small cell lung cancer with EGFR-TKI resistance.

      main objectives: progression-free survival (PFS) ratio in 12 week the secondary goal:
      Objective Response Rate （ORR）
