    
      To determine:

      Primary Outcome Measure:

      The Overall complete remission rate and one-year survival rate of combination transfer of
      CD19-targeting CAR T Cells and CD20-targeting CAR T Cells is superior to or at least not
      worse than two kinds of single target treatments in the treatment of CD19+/CD20+ B-cell
      lymphomas.

      The risk of cancer recurrence in a year of combination transfer of CD19-targeting CAR T Cells
      and CD20-targeting CAR T Cells is inferior to two kinds of single target treatments.

      Secondary Outcome Measures:

      Evaluate the initial effect time, time to disease progression, and life quality improvement
      of combination transfer compare to single target treatments.

      Evaluate the safety and tolerability of combination transfer compare to single target
      treatments by observation of high fever duration in patients and testing related cell factor
      level in peripheral blood.
