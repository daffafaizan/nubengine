    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE

      -To prospectively assess the frequency of different genetic mechanisms of secondary
      resistance in patients' tumors during treatment with erlotinib (e.g., T790M mutations, MET
      amplification).

        -  Correlate these genetic changes with patient demographic data and clinical outcomes
           (time to progression, survival, sites of recurrence/progression).

        -  Search for novel mechanisms of acquired resistance to erlotinib.

        -  Identify whether these genetic changes are present at low levels in initial pretreatment
           tumor specimens.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE(S)

        1. To measure the steady-state plasma concentrations of erlotinib during the course of
           patients' treatment.

             -  Determine if the development and/or resolution of skin toxicity is related to
                plasma erlotinib concentrations.

             -  Determine if the development of disease progression while on erlotinib is
                correlated with declines in plasma erlotinib concentrations.

             -  Assess the plasma levels in patients whose smoking status has been biochemically
                verified to determine if smoking is associated with lower erlotinib plasma
                concentration.

        2. To analyze from both free plasma DNA and DNA from circulating tumor cells of
           erlotinib-treated patients for the original sensitizing EGFR mutations and genetic
           changes associated with secondary resistance.

        3. To measure clinical outcomes in patients with known sensitizing mutations in their tumor
           EGFR when treated with first-line erlotinib.

             -  Response rate

             -  Time to progression

             -  Median overall survival
