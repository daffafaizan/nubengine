      disease and diabetes is a factor in several post-PCI risk scores (including the commonly used
      DAPT score). However, until recently, there were almost no studies performed specifically in
      the diabetic population of patients undergoing PCI. At large, results from randomized trials
      assessing the duration of DAPT have produced conflicting results and there is uncertainty
      about the best anti-thrombotic strategy in patients with diabetes. Further assessment of the
      patterns of use and their clinical effects, including those related to prolonged DAPT is
      needed, in diabetic patients, especially in less selected "real world" populations.
