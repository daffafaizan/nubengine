      patients to the risk of allogeneic blood transfusion or other blood products and the risk of
      mediastinal re-exploration.Antifibrinolytic drugs like aprotinin and tranexamic acid are
      proven to reduce bleeding tendency and transfusion requirement in cardiac surgery. The
      efficacy of these drugs is proven, especially for the unspecific proteinase inhibitor
      aprotinin, however, there are concerns about the safety and the high costs of this drug.
      There are only limited head-to-head comparisons of these two drugs.

      In this double-blind, prospective, controlled study the efficacy of aprotinin and tranexamic
      acid is compared. Primary outcome is the 24 hours postoperative drainage blood loss and the
      percentage of patients requiring allogeneic blood transfusion during the hospital stay.
      Subgroups of patients undergoing CABG surgery or aortic valve replacement are predefined for
      combined and separate data analysis.The power of the study is calculated for this
      subgroup-analysis.

      Secondary outcome measurements are molecular marker of activation of hemostasis up to the 5th
      postoperative day.
