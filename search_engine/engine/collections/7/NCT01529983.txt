    
      This is a prospective randomized comparison study comparing the efficacy of micro-focused
      ultrasound versus fractionated carbon dioxide laser for treatment of periorbital wrinkles.
      Subjects who meet inclusion and exclusion criteria will be enrolled in the study. The treated
      sites are both lower eyelids and lateral orbits. Each side will be randomized to receive
      1550nm-fractionated laser treatment on one side and the contralateral side will receive
      micro-focused ultrasound treatment every 6-8 weeks for a total of 2 treatments.
