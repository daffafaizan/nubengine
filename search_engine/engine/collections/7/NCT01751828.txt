      they are currently taking an antidepressant and are not doing well on it, they will be taken
      off it. Participants will then start sertraline, a commercially available antidepressants.
      They will be monitored for response and side effects for 8 weeks and doses adjusted as
      needed. After the study, we will examine how differences in brain blood flow may predict who
      does and does not respond to sertraline.
