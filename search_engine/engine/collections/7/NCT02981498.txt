      suitable for transarterial chemoembolization, and sorafenib is recommended as standard
      care.3-5 However, for patients with major PVTT, the median overall survival of those treated
      with sorafenib monotherapy was only 3.1 to 6.0 months.

      Whether combining sorafenib with hepatic arterial infusion (HAIC) of oxaliplatin,
      5-fluorouracil and leucovorin is safe, well tolerated, and efficacious remains unknown, with
      no prospective clinical data currently available.The investigators therefore conducted a
      prospective single center, single-arm phase II trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      sorafenib combined with HAIC in patients with unresectable advanced HCC.
