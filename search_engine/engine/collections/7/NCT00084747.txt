        -  Determine response rate, as defined by resolution of bone marrow plasmacytosis and
           monoclonal paraproteinemia, in the first year after autologous peripheral blood stem
           cell transplantation in patients with intermediate or advanced multiple myeloma treated
           with adjuvant bortezomib.

        -  Compare progression-free survival of patients treated with adjuvant bortezomib with
           historical controls treated with autologous transplantation alone.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients (phase I).

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive bortezomib IV on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 8
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of bortezomib until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
