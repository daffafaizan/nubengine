      forward growth (1). 60 young children aged 9-11 with backward positioned lower jaw/chin will
      be recruited to have either active or non-active Wilson type upper arch expansion appliance.
      Patients will have special x-ray (Cone Beam computed tomography) before and after treatment
      (after 9 months) of starting the treatment. After participation, routine orthodontic
      treatment will be continued.
