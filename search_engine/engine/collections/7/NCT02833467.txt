      cancer patients were available for mutational analysis. DNA and RNA were extracted from fresh
      tumor tissue or formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue. A series of cancer-related
      genomic alterations including single nucleotide variations (SNVs), short insertions and
      deletions (InDels), copy number variations (CNVs) and gene rearrangements were identified by
      a comprehensive NGS Panal . High frequency mutations were also identified in blood sample by
      droplet digital polymerase chain reaction(ddPCR).
