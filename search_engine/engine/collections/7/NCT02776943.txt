      mesenchymal stem cells (UCMSCs) is a promising strategy given the high proliferative capacity
      of MSCs and their potential to differentiate into cartilage-producing cells - chondrocytes.
      The acquisition of ucMSCs does not require invasive surgical intervention or cartilage
      extraction from other sites as required by other cell-based strategies. The investigators
      inject allogeneic human mesenchymal stem cells to the cartilage lesions in patients via
      intra-articular injection method, and to investigate the efficacy and safetyã€‚
