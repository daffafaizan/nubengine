      male and female patients ≥40 years of age with OA of the knee. Approximately 450 patients
      with OA of the knee were randomized to 1 of 3 treatment groups (1:1:1) and treated with a
      single IA injection of:

        -  32 mg FX006,

        -  normal saline (placebo), or

        -  40 mg TCA IR.

      Randomization was stratified by weekly mean of the average daily (24-hour) pain intensity
      (ADP) scores at baseline, with the following classifications: 5 to <6, 6 to <7, and ≥7.

      Each patient was evaluated for a total of 24 weeks following a single IA injection. Following
      screening, safety and efficacy were evaluated at 7 out-patient visits (Days 1 [baseline],
      Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24). The study was expected to enroll in approximately 6 months.
