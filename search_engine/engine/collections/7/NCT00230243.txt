    
      The current clinical trial is designed to provide historicals controls comparable to the
      P00041 study population, that is, a) patients with invasive fungal infections which are
      refractory or resistant to standard antifungal therapies or b) patients who have developed
      intolerance to standard antifungal therapy. This clinical trial also serves to allow
      collection of historical data regarding the efficacy of available antifungal therapies
      against a variety of invasive fungal infections which although serious and life-threatening
      are sufficiently rare so that they cannot be studied in a controlled, randomized clinical
      trial.

      This trial will be conducted primarily at the investigative sites that enrolled subjects into
      P00041 and/or investigators who are members of the Mycosis Study Group.
