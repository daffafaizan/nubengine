    
      This is an extension of the multi-site sub-study of the National Institute of Mental Health
      (NIMH) protocol, Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D), which
      utilized the infrastructure of the Depression Trials Network to enroll 4,000 subjects
      diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder. These subjects initially received 12 weeks of
      treatment with the anti-depressant citalopram. The thrust of this study was to test treatment
      algorithms for those subjects who did not respond adequately to initial monotherapy treatment
      with citalopram or who were unable to tolerate it. The parent protocol also contained several
      ancillary studies, including a sub-study of subjects with co-morbid alcohol use disorders,
      which enrolled 130 subjects. Treatment response data was collected at multiple intervals
      during the 12 week treatment period on depressed subjects both with and without a co-morbid
      alcohol use disorder.

      Comparison: Treatment outcome measures of subjects diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder
      will be compared to treatment outcome measures of subjects diagnosed with Major Depressive
      Disorder and an Alcohol Use Disorder following the initial 12 week citalopram treatment
      period. This comparison will show whether having a co-morbid alcohol use disorder affects
      recovery from depression. In addition, alcohol use data of depressed subjects who
      demonstrated a positive response to anti-depressant treatment will be compared with alcohol
      use data of depressed subjects who did not have positive treatment outcomes. This comparison
      will show whether recovery from depression is associated with improvement in the co-morbid
      alcohol use disorder.
