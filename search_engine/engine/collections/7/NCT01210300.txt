      descriptive design using purposive sampling of 20 Taiwanese pregnant women who have
      previously had a CS with a live baby will be recruited from Chang Gung Memorial Hospital in
      Taiwan. In-depth interviews will be carried out in three phases: (1) between 34 weeks to 38
      weeks of women's pregnancy; (2) on the third day after childbirth; and (3) at the fourth week
      after birth, the end of confinement. Boyatzis' Data Driven approach will be adopted to
      thematically analyze the data.
