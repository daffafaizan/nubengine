    
      20 kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) with a diagnosis of cAMR in a prospective randomized
      clinical trial will be recruited in two arms

      : ten KTRs treated with plasmapheresis, intravenous immunoglobulins and rituximab
      (PE-IVIG-RTX group) vs 10 patients receiving the same therapy plus Bortezomib. Differences
      between transplanted kidney survival and functional outcomes 6 mo after diagnosis and
      histological features and donor-specific antibody (DSA) characteristics (MFI ) will be
      investigated between two arms.
