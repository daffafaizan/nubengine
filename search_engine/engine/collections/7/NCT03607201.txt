    
      Adult patients (â‰¥ 18 years of age) with acute coronary syndrome which are diagnosed under
      International Classification of Disease (ICD-10) coding of I24.9 were included in this study.
      The inclusion criteria are patients with primary diagnosis of I24.9 and with a complete
      record of prior medical and treatment history, electrocardiographic findings, cardiac marker
      results and outcomes. Participants were grouped into 2 groups - diabetic and non-diabetic
      based on history of diabetes prior to ACS. Diagnosis of ACS was made based on clinical,
      electrocardiographic and cardiac marker findings found in the medical record.

      Data such as age, sex, ethnic, education, prior medical and treatment history,
      electrocardiographic and cardiac enzyme results as well as outcomes were collected from the
      patients' medical records. Outcomes of interest were defined as either concomitant heart
      failure, acute lung edema, malignant arrhythmia, mortality or combinations of them as
      diagnosed in the medical records. Heart failure is defined based on echocardiographic
      findings from the medical records. Acute Lung Edema is defined based on medical records or
      reported clinical findings of lung edema - rhonchi reported in 1/3 of the lungs with oxygen
      saturation <90%. Whereas malignant arrhythmia is defined as the presence of ventricular
      tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF).
