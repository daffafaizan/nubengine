      It was planned to include patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal surgery with a
      predetermined anaesthesia protocol.

      Patients will receive a standardized general anesthetic and thoracal epidural anaesthesia.
      Ventilatory parameters will be adjusted to maintain ETCO2 35 mmHg, Paw 25 cmH2O.Patient age,
      gen-der, BMI, ASA classification, the duration of surgery, anesthesia, Trendelenburg position
      and pneumoperitoneum. Hemodynamic parameters, blood gas analyzes, ventilation parameters and
      EtCO₂ values will be recorded. We determined 6 timelines to compare the difference between
      PaCO₂ and EtCO₂. These timelines were the times where we could collect the most data
      regarding blood gas analyzes. Preoperative period: to, 10th minute after the first
      insuflation and trendelendburg position: t₁,the first hour after the first insuflation and
      trendelendburg position: t₂, 10th minute after desuflation and supine position: t₃, 10th
      minute after the second insuflation and trendelendburg position: t₄, and 10th minute after
      the second desuflation and supine position:t₅. Primary outcome measure is the difference
      between PaCO₂ and EtCO₂ a difference greater than 5 mmHg was assumed to be important.
