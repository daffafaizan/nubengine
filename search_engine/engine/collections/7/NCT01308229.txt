    
      The BIPAX clinical trial is a prospective, non-randomized, multicenter, clinical trial
      evaluating the investigational coronary bifurcation device Nile PAXÂ® in patients with main
      branch reference vessel diameters >= 2.5 mm and <= 3.5 mm, side branch reference vessel
      diameters >= 2.0 and <= 3.0 and lesion length <= 14 mm. The trial allows the treatment of a
      single de novo bifurcation lesion in native coronary arteries following the provisional
      T-stenting technique with mandatory pre-dilatation of the main branch. In case the side
      branch requires a stent the treatment will be completed when possible with a Delta PAXÂ® Drug
      Eluting Side Branch Stent.

      The BIPAX clinical trial will enroll 100 patients. All patients will receive Quantitative
      Coronary Angiography (QCA) after stent implantation and at 9 months follow-up. All patients
      will have a clinical follow-up at 1, 6, 9 and 12 months and subsequently every year up to 5
      years.
