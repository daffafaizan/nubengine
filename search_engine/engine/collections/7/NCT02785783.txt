      but it is well known that colonoscopy is associated with a neoplasia miss rate of up to 25%.

      One such method of reducing the neoplasia miss rate is cap assisted colonoscopy, where a cap
      is placed at the distal end of the colonoscope.The theory behind how the cap aids mucosal
      visualisation is that it depresses and flattens colonic folds, thereby improving
      visualisation on the proximal sides of folds.

      Investigators aim to evaluate the impact of one such cap assisted device: EndoRings™ on polyp
      detection rates. EndoRings™ has been shown to improve polyp detection rate by 51% compared to
      29% for standard colonoscopy in a recent tandem endoscopy study. EndoRings™ has received FDA
      approval.
