      depression. Consistent with these effects, aerobic exercise in general, and running in
      particular, has been repeatedly shown to have both immediate mood elevating and longer-term
      antidepressant effects. To the investigators' knowledge, all studies of running as a
      therapeutic intervention for mood have had subjects run in standard running shoes, despite
      increasing evidence that running barefoot or in shoes with minimal effect on foot strike
      (i.e. "minimally shod") leads to marked changes in how people run in ways that might have
      physiological effects of relevance to health. Thus, nothing is currently known about
      differences in effects on depression-relevant physiological or emotional functioning between
      running either barefoot or minimally-shod vs. running in standard running shoes (hereafter
      called "shoed). The current pilot study is designed to begin addressing these issues by
      examining effects of minimally shod vs. shoed running on non-invasive measures of autonomic
      nervous system (ANS) functioning and mood state. The investigators have selected the ANS as
      the physiological focus of the current study for several reasons including: 1) running
      acutely alters ANS activity; 2) running (and aerobic fitness in general) is associated with
      increased parasympathetic and reduced sympathetic activity at rest; 3) increased
      parasympathetic tone in the body has been repeatedly associated with emotional well-being and
      stress resilience, whereas reduced parasympathetic tone has been reliably associated with
      major depression; 4) given increasing evidence that ancestral humans may have run
      exceptionally long distances to hunt prey to exhaustion, it is likely that such running was
      conducted under fairly significant parasympathetic tone to reduce energy expenditure; 5)
      ancestral humans ran barefoot or minimally shod suggesting that the type of foot strike
      pattern encouraged by these styles of running may have enhanced parasympathetic tone compared
      to running with heel strike such as occurs when running shoed; and 6) therefore minimally
      shod running might differentially impact parasympathetic tone in ways that would make it more
      effective as a treatment for depression than running shoed.
